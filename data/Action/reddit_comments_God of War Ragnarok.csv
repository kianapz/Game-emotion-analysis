z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-27,It‚Äôs a game that wants to be a movie. It sucks.
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-12-02,"I wouldn't say awful, but pretty bad for a god of war game. Just a disconnected poorly paced mess of a game. Same puzzles copy pasted over and over again with annoying NPCs telling you what to do literally 10 seconds into them. Terrible camera during combat, lock on issues. Sound was mixed poorly compared to 2018. Graphics for me were nothing special, but that's to be expected for a ps4 game. None of the new characters besides Thor and Odin did anything for me and god the Atreus sections where you pick berries and roots for an hour were painful.. the pacing of the whole game was terrible. It had its moments but i couldn't wait for it to end."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,People are allowed wrong opinions i suppose.

z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,It's not the old God of war
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-12-07,"I couldn't agree more. I'm just trying to skip past the battles and get to the end. I'm at the point now where I just turned off the game, and I'm not sure if I'll go back and finish it. Every corner, every corridor, another fight. Coming from Horizon and Elden ring, where you explored, climbed mountains, uncovered secrets, leveled abilities etc. GOW just seems so... dull. Another hallway, another fight. It's a shame cause the story is really great and they nailed somethings. The worlds are beautiful, a shame we can't see more of them. The weapons are super cool, shame there aren't more ways to upgrade or new combos or... anything to make the combat less repetitive. I don't know how everyone really likes this game that much, im so bored and can't wait to finish it. I spent 100 CAD on it, so i'll beat it... but yea, not even close to game of the year. Horizon forbidden west takes that crown IMO or Elden ring."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,All in all a bad bait
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-12-07,"I think it‚Äôs wild that people are sooo obsessed with this game. It‚Äôs fine, it‚Äôs not great. I don‚Äôt find any of the characters interesting besides Thor and Odin. And ‚Äúexploring‚Äù is not fun. Fuck that canoe‚Ä¶."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-12-26,"This game is garbage. Coming from souls games at least you had control of your character. You can barely dodge. Your shield no matter which one you have deploys slowly and the only enemies you NEED to parry are mini bosses who are smaller than you and they only throw red hits. So parry ain‚Äôt there when you need it. The camera is garbage and seriously whoever thought programming the enemy camera unlock to unlock automatically because the enemies are able to go faster than the camera was a fking moron. So you got them locked and they can fly behind you and you can‚Äôt turn fast enough or relock so they can just backstab your over n over as they stagger you by looking at you and you can barely stagger them. You have to hit them 200 times to die, they only have to hit you twice. I could go on forever. Storyline too, garbage. I wish I would have read reviews about this POS before I wasted money on it."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"I can‚Äôt say I agree, as true as some of your points may be the game when looked at through ALL aspects is good. The additions to the realms look great, the story really brings Kratos journey full circle from the original GoW, and the fact that they didn‚Äôt drag this out over another game is great. So best game I ever played, probably not, but GoTY definitely."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-12-11,"It seems like a button bash fighting game to me with unskippable boring cut scenes.

Honestly, it's not close to games like RDR2, Witcher 3, Spiderman or Uncharted. 

I don't get the hype at all."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Bruh... your opinion would be fine and subjectivity is ok but if you would make an effort to look objectively at the game and see all the effort and care put in the game you would probably realize that calling it ""total trash"" is absurd... like I don't fell enjoyed RDR 2 but I cant call the game absolute trash because thats objectivelly wrong"
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-12-26,ya it was incredibly boring
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-12-27,"I hated it!!! It was such a slog and the characters were awful!! And all that stupid puzzle crap that slowed the game right down. And when is Kratos going to admit his dead giant wife was a lying bi@$h and that his son is a whiney little $hit and just call it quits! If the little turd wants to go off and find his destiny, I say let him!!! Let the little rat haired rodent go off and get smushed, so Kratos can go find a new land where he can settle down in peace. The combat was so dull and repetitive, it was just a glorified coming of age tale for his idiot son. It was a giant waste of money, a boring, linear pile of overrated crap."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-01-07,"Gameplay - 4/10
Visuals - 10/10"
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Turning off replies everyone it‚Äôs been fun. Enjoying losing your shit defending a mid game!
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Well your entitled to your opinion even when its wrong.
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,git gud
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-12-19,"When you've played a game for 35 hours that seems like 100hours it's not a good sign, this game is disappointing on so many aspect, the story is good but the side quest, the open world and the RPG aspect who were not the best points of the previous game are way worse in this sequel. It really cost me to finish it and the fun was almost nowhere in this game"
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-01-12,"I finished Elden Ring, it was amazing, and i said to myself let's go see if Ragnarok truly deserved to be in the GOTY debate. Maan il played 2 hours and it was the 2 most boring hours of my life. World empty, the fights are pointless,what the hell happened to the design of Odin ? Thor was interesting but thats it, . 

&#x200B;

Can someone explain to me how can someone call this a ""Goty contender "" ?"
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Bait your hook better, man."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"I thought it was really good.  
Did not agree with all decisions, character developments, characters or storybeats, but cannot deny that it was all done expertly."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-18,"I'm watching my sister play. I grew up with the original trilogy with bloodthirsty Kratos and compelling story. 
Now Im watching this stupid fucking Atreus trying to skip rocks giggling with some Angrboda or something. Looks like something out of a poorly written tv series."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Lol, thanks for this. I needed a good chuckle this morning."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Omg you‚Äôre so cool for not liking a popular and well made game.
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Careful you don't cut yourself on that edge.
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Havent played so cant judge but from what I gathered from frienda they seem to like shame it didnt meet your expectations combat wise is it really that bad?
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-01-06,Story was ok I really wanted to see it but I couldn't because I got so bored of the game play. Got to motivate myself to play it. Game play is really boring sorry! Yeah this game sucks. I hate the boring time wasting puzzles.
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-01-11,"Bro, I‚Äôve been playing this game for a week most of the time it‚Äôs on pause because the game keeps putting me to sleep."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-06,Way too much talking. I don't care about the story at all.
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Lol.. Back to CoD then I guess.
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,what‚Äôs the last game you genuinely enjoyed?
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"You're bitching about a game made for mass appeal, to the masses. Be prepared for everyone to disagree with you. GL soldier ü´°"
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Git gud
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"I have found that if you up the difficulty to either the hardest or second hardest difficulty, it does make them more fun - it is significantly more difficult but it is also wayyyy more fun."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"It‚Äôs not awful in the slightest but it‚Äôs definitely not as ‚ÄúOMG FANTASTIC AMAZING GOTY!!!!111‚Äù as it‚Äôs being made out to be. It‚Äôs a 7.5-8/10 game at best. I found it to be way too long and downright boring in some parts. Took me two full weeks to finish it because I kept falling asleep. Half the characters are annoying AF and the puzzles are a pain in the ass. The combat mechanics are mostly fun and the main story is okay, but that‚Äôs about it."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"The whole game was Disappointing, or maybe I had very high expectations. Pre order a game after 6 years, stupid plants exploding in your face every second ( no I dont care enough to throw my axe at some plants), stupid puzzles, one or two is enough, but puzzles after puzzles, should have put that time in runes for weapon to make the combat more engaging. The new system of weapon awaking is BS since 90% you don't have the time to awaken them. Spear is on down button if you press it while shielding, kratos does 180. 

Thor story is BS, Atreus doing stupid stuff half of the game. The BIG Ragnarok was a dissapoitment, run in a straight line, and kill people, then Odin jump from one place to another.

Why didn't kratos take the damn deal? The whole game he doesn't want to fight, but keeps putting his nose in odins business. Either go full on or don't at all. 

The Jokes between mimir, kratos and atrues made me finish the game"
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-27,"on the contrary, doesn't seem awful at all.. however, if u are absolutely dogshit at gaming in general (which sounds quite likely judging by ur qualms), I can understand why u could be simply incapable of experiencing anything beyond ur flaccid depth.."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-12-10,Feel more like ‚ÄúGod of Mid‚Äù
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-12-30,I do.
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-01-03,"Played it for an hour last night and all I can say is it‚Äôs ugly if they would‚Äôve had the same layout for the entire pause screen I‚Äôd pretty much be fine with the rest of the changes but the pause screen is the wound and everything mentioned everywhere else is the salt getting shoved into it 

I was really excited and 70$ later I‚Äôm pretty disappointed"
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-01-04,I had a blast with GoWR. Sad to see you didn't enjoyed it the same way i did. But its totally normal for different people to like and dislike different things. Happy gaming my bro!
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-01-20,Lol more people in these comments seem to hate this game rather than love it how on earth it went anywhere near game of the year shows the standard of gaming at the moment ..........
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-03,"The game is a tedious chore. It‚Äôs boring and in some aspects stupid. The stuff where you collect fruit with what‚Äôs her name is a joke. Am I a farmer now? 

The puzzles are another slow the game to a grinding halt annoyance that just feels more like work than a yay I figured it out. Oh and can we walk through another wall crack or crouching cave. I mean these are all over the place now. They replace load screens but dam, is it really replacing a load screen when they are all over the map. 

The combat is not fun. 18 was a blast and I 100% 18. This game is just not fun at all with combat. The story sucks. The long drawn out narrative process while walking or boating drags the game along. I could go on, but I‚Äôm not even going to finish this game because it‚Äôs a grind and I have better ways to waste time. 

Something told me to wait to buy it and I should have waited longer or for a sale. Waste of $70
How in the world did this ever get considered for goty. Such a disappointment 

Oh and Atreus is a whiney bitch"
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-13,They should rename it to GOW Ragnacock
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"I have not played it, but it Sounds like my experience with the first game... So i have no reason to disbelieve you."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,The only thing that is complete trash is your ability to master the game.
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,I understand what you mean. It does get tedious and the combat feels like a step down from its previous iterations. However the overall package comes with such attention to detail. Nothing pulls me in quite the same.
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Have you played a video game before?
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-01-16,allies are useless in damn near every game I've ever played besides demon souls and dark souls lol pointless ass comment. give me a game with quest that was cool to you and I bet I can say those where boring. the world most def dose not feel empty lol. thats BS on a top tier level. the only thing I will give you is that the blocking/parrying is hands down one of the worst I've played. that shit drives me insane. the combat while not absolutely terrible is just bad. specially on harder difficulties. its insane to me that the camera is so damn close to kratos. LOTS of cheap deaths in the game make me rage often. story is great though. still im mature enough to not say its absolute garbage lol you're just mad at the game to say something so stupid. I get it though. it can def make you that mad. im considering dropping the difficulty to offset the bad combat and not have to fight the same battle 15 times before I move on.
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-16,I can't believe I just bought this game for $70
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-01-12,"It‚Äôs extremely polished and well made. Did you play the first game? If you didn‚Äôt like the first you won‚Äôt like the second. It‚Äôs definitely not perfect gameplay wise but I mean cmon you sound like the guys that hated on elden ring. It‚Äôs just not your kind of game, I‚Äôm halfway through currently and it‚Äôs been awesome."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-27,"I didn't like the story for The Last of Us 2 but didn't play either of the new God of War games, but, gameplay wise they look pretty good from what I've seen."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-27,I think he‚Äôs confusing being bad at the game with the game is bad
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-12-29,"Big fan of GOW, played all the main games from 1-4, enjoyed the last game, but this game‚Ä¶ the worlds seems a bit empty, and new character designs seems Amazon prime-esque and looks‚Ä¶ cheap - with cringey dialogue. At this point Santa Monica should probably focus on making a movie instead.

Luckily Kratos, Freya, Atreus carry the game. 8/10 at most."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-01-07,"The game didn‚Äôt even feel like a fucking god of war game. Bad/cringy writing, same combat bugs from the first game, Kratos being a major pussy, even the graphics felt worse"
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-01-07,Veeeeery boring :( agree
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-01-13,Im slogging through it but what a grind. Feels likea  souless version of the last game. Getting around the map is tedious and the fetch quest and generic puzzles are far too frequent.
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-01-15,"I finally bought a PlayStation after some 15 years being solely on Xbox. Got the gow ragnarok ps5 from Sony website bc I always wanted to see what was so great about the gow series. I stopped playing at the level where you‚Äôre rescuing some giant dude from the mines. 

Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm a late joiner, but I simply do not care about the characters and it moves along so slowly I can‚Äôt stay with it. I might pick it up again after I finish some other games - ratchet/clank ape escape and last of us are occupying most of my free time now those are some really fun ones"
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-02,"I found the story just barely fun enough to finish the story but then it got too
Boring"
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-05,Anyone else think Mimir calls them Brother and Little Brother wayy too often in this game?  In the 2018 game he would call them that once in a while so it meant something.  Almost every other sentence in this game he says it.  Just sounds meaningless after a while
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-06,"The strange obsession with this game almost seems fabricated to me. Like conspiracy level fabricated. Not fun and the combat (to me the most important part of this GAME NOT MOVIE) is so blocky and awkward. The sound design is really bad too, like I‚Äôm playing on a big ol‚Äô 5.1 built surround and it‚Äôs tinny and flat still. I miss the old bangin‚Äô snake broads and chopping up baddies."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-07,Yeah tbh it‚Äôs kinda üöÆüóëÔ∏è‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm only trying to finish it cause I brought the bundle & all of the hype behind it..  But there‚Äôs literally nothing special about it.. I also think the game ‚Äúblew its load‚Äù by starting off with the Thor fight.. That had me thinking this game was going to be non stop.. However 28 percent in its not it‚Äôs boring as hell for the most part.. The puzzles are annoying imo & the son is even more annoying..
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-10,"Honestly the game would have been way more enjoyable if it had visible blood spray and feedback when hitting enemies. It was done so much better in 2018 and that was already mediocre in terms of feedback and blood. Ragnarok feels like you're hitting everyone with a wet noodle. 

God of war 3 is a good example on how blood spray and feedback should feel like. DMC 5 and Bloodborne is another good example. 

Also the sound mixing was dog shit. The pacing and puzzles were god awful. Riding that cow for what felt like 5 hours was enough for me to trade the game in after I forced myself to finish it. Sony Santa Monica are overrated as hell and are a shadow of their former selves. 

Sony has completely ruined gaming. It's not even a hot take. Tell me I'm wrong? Literally the only good game they have released in the last 10 years is Bloodborne. Because it focused on being an immersive game."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-10,"Definitely a drag compared to the rest, starting to become a chore to play."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-10,"it so DESPERATELY wants to be souls-like, but the dev slack at every turn and make ganks the solution to everything.  the insta-runic shields the bosses toss on is just the crowning achievement of fucking complete shite design.

and before you start talking getgud, i have no-hit king and gna on gmgow.  but it was a shit-show of working around the ganks.

SMS couldn't hold From's jock.  And yes, they'll make plenty of cash off this cow-of-game, but don't kid yourself that this is actually good combat mechanics."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-16,FUCK THIS POS GAME. TOTAL TRASH AND AFTER YOU BEAT IT IF YOU CAN EVEN GET YOURSELF TOO THERE ARE NO MONSTERS. NONE. YOU MAY AS WELL GO TO MUSPHELEIM AND GET FUCKED IN THE ASS BY THE LAME FUCKIN TRIALS. AGAIN. FUCK THIS POS GAME
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-17,I really wanted to love this game but it wasn't anything besides a failed attempt at bridging an beat em up and RPG.
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-25,Awful awful game
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-03-05,I‚Äôm enjoying it for the most part. It‚Äôs at a 7/10 for me at the moment. Not as good as the first but enjoyable enough to see what happens. I like playing as Atreius too. But I wish the allies wouldn‚Äôt just tell you how to solve puzzles sometimes. It‚Äôs annoying af.
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-03-12,The whole fucking game is just walking aimlessly throwing a fucking axe at shit trying to figure out what to do it fuckin sucks fuck this game I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt pay 70$ for it I woulda been hot I got the bundle pack so this weak ass game came with the ps5 ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è fuckin trash the graphics are good tho they should just make a movie instead of a game of walking around all fuckin day long stupid fucking idiots
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-03-15,Game dragged on with some of its sections
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-03-16,Im a huge god of war fan and i thought this game was complete dog shit. Im tired of critics and gamers blindly sucking a game off and slapping it with a 10. How in the hell was this game a 10?
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-03-17,"i think the whole god of war series sucks, because how badly misrepresented gods are and how indifferent the developers of the game are to the fact that the gods slaughtered in the game by a fictional character are actually worshipped by many in the old world"
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-03-17,"Totally agree. The game tells you eveything that you need to do from start to finish, no immersion whatsoever. Combat is awful, attacks doesnt have any weight on it considering kratos is a big man. Quest design is trash as well, go to this blabla and fight blablabla to obtain blablabla. Man do i hate this game, 2018gow might not be trash but mediocre as hell too."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-03-20,I didn't like it I thought it was horrible! And And so was the last one.
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-05-01,"Shitty opinion you have there, this one was disapointing but GOW 4 was one of the best, your just sad theres no more quick time event sex scenes for you to jerk off to"
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-05-06,"This is just apart of our culture too just hate lol the enemy variety is way more then 2018 u litteraly fight the same 2 types of enemies mainly so u really didn‚Äôt even play the game fr and second the story is amazing and has way more giants moments set pieces and over all just better quality and yes the combat may suck but too me it only sucks bc it‚Äôs the same moves I recently beat both 2018 and ragnorok back too back and honestly they feel completely different combat wise not the same Rhythm but honestly can‚Äôt change everyone‚Äôs opinion everyone today loves too hate not without reason crazy bc everyone says the same thing that the pacing sucks but I mean where is your proof how can you say the pacing sucks but what is good pacing? It‚Äôs all different events in the game happen sporadically bc it‚Äôs RAGNOROK the WORLD IN THE GAME IS LITTERALLY ENDING. Crazy shit is supposed too happen and at random and I feel the pacing is good the start of the journey where everyone isn‚Äôt sure what they wanna do if they wanna give in too prophecy or not and sooner then later they have no choice but too make their own decisions and take action without thinking exactly why the fates come in too explain that they are all playing too their fate just being themselfs, then releasing garm is litterally the cherry too start ragnorok, also like the hog riding part or whatever, yea it sucks but it also is important it all is important too prophecy if he doesn‚Äôt go too iron wood and learn how secretive that all is then that doesn‚Äôt make kratos and Atreus bond start too break makes kratos question his son and drives him too Asgard naturally, then that kicks off the whole search for a weapon and the norms which really starts too boil ragnorok"
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-05-06,"Totally agree, in my opinion this game is just a gimmick, a mandatory sequel aimed at mainstream audiences, all on it smells cheap design. It is clearly designed to be played in easy dificulty. The amount of bad thought systems you have to fight in order to not die is ridiculous. You can't get enjoyment out of it playing in higher dificulties, because it wasn't meant to be played this way. But they still give you the choice so you would think it is actually meant as an action game when its not. So the frustration is even higher. I literally got scammed with this game. Just make a movie or an interactive graphic adventure or something if that is what you wan to do. Why making an action game where any of the systems works well for an action game. Its ridiculous. And then the plot and characters, in gow2018, ther was novelty so they were kinda ok. In Ragnarok eveeything gets old pretty fast.
Its just a bad sequel, a bad action game, and a mediocre movie. Shame, graphics look good tho..."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-05-10,"This was the absolute worst gow game I‚Äôve ever played. The game mechanics were shit , the story was mediocre at best, the berserker fights had you so fucked up with different dumbass builds that you have to have a goddamn aneurysm before you can beat the king for a combat game with this shitty of combat mechanics I definitely won‚Äôt be buying nor playing any future gow games this game absolutely fucked off any chance of that"

z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-05-01,LoL just becsuse its cinematic? GOW 4 was cinematic and it was awesome
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-01-10,"I could barely stand riding on that giant cow, holy shit that was annoying. Ride slowly on it through the water get to a ledge to jump up to, break 2 pots, meet it on the other side then jump on it to ride slowly to the next one. YAWN."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-01-16,I have no idea what you mean copy and paste puzzles. I disagree with the pacing. no problem there. I play on PS5 so graphics cool for me. why mention graphics on last gen? I know there not as bad as you're pretending lol. stop it. FACTS about the NPC's telling you what to do in 10 seconds lol. Atreus picking berries was painful. the characters are cool. story is good. the combat is the single bad thing in this game. and its pretty bad. like rage quit cheap deaths over and over bad
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-12-17,bro game was shit. deal with it.
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-12-25,People are allowed to have standards
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-01-06,"The gameplay of ragnarock was really sub par, i know other mediocre games with way better and more enjoyable combat and variety. But it's fine I guess if you don't care about combat or fights that much, you can pretend it's a movie where you have to click to open a door or pull a lever in a cutscene. Well even if we treat it as a interactive movie, I for one, thought the story was painfully mediocre and only enjoyed a couple of scenes while the story was mediocre as hell. If you enjoy it like thousand of others praising this movie to be the best game ever, then good for you."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-03-11,Both 2018 and this are half-assed at best.. they definitely don't hold a candle to the old games. They just aren't that good of games.. the story is interesting but the gameplay is bad.
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-05-06,Opinions are neither wrong or right you dummy
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-01-31,"If it‚Äôs bad, how‚Äôd gow 2018 win goty above Spider-Man and rdr2? Gowr improves graphically and combat more than 2018"
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-12-10,Your right it must be better
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-03-27,Beacause it's better then the old God of war.
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-10,"I‚Äôm always just almost at the point of putting it on easy so I can just get through the story. And I played through DS3, Bloodborne, Sekiro, Elden Ring and replayed GoW 2018 basically in a row before starting Ragnarak. All have far more satisfying combat. 

It‚Äôs just so frustrating in this game. They nerfed Kratos, took away the key moves from last game, camera lock system sucks, and most enemies are obnoxious."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-01-06,"not a bait, the game is mediocre, if we can call it a game"
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-04-23,"Kind of similar to how people are so obsessed with Gears of War and Halo. I hated those games. I mean, I've beaten both and found them to be very ordinary, yet there is a cult following of people willing to die (exaggeration) and defend their honor for said games. I just don't get it. I guess people like what they like."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-13,"Yeah it‚Äôs really dumb sometimes with the combat system, you fight an enemy 1 or 2 levels above you and they take years to kill. And some of the mini bosses on gmgow difficulty feel so cheap because of how many hits the enemies take and how little damage you do, plus I‚Äôve been hit at times from yellow attacks while using the stone wall shield that insta killed me when the shield wasn‚Äôt even at full power."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Story, characters are great. Gameplay not so much."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-12-15,"RDR2 is about as wide as an ocean but as deep as a puddle. It has its own share of boring cutscenes too. The open world, graphics, and story/characters are the only good things about the game. Everything else is a slog to play through. Gameplay is still the same clunky shit that's been present since GTAIV. Menu UI is awful. Braindead AI and mind-numbingly boring combat too."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-12-11,"It felt like a PS2 game to me. Not much care given into surrounding objects when you run towards them. It just feels blocky, and underdeveloped. Way too much time on cut scenes."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-03-17,"I'm not sure how you can say that. I agree with the OP. To ME, the game is total trash. 
I think the disconnect between the ones that like it and the ones that hate it is the ones that hate it played the original 3 games. 
I didn't like the story AT ALL, the combat was OK but worse than the last game somehow, and the characters were just plain awful. Odin was sold as a monster in 2018, but turns out to be a used car salesman. The biggest sin is Angrboda. This is norse mythology. Like Sweden, Finland, etc, which are the whitest countries on earth. There is absolutely no reason Angrboda should be black just for the sake of appeasing some exec at Santa Monica. 
At the end of the day, it's just NOT God of War. We tolerated 2018 because it was so different, and Kratos had only changed so much. Now he's a cuck."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Look up the word subjective.
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-01-06,"ah yes, what a great defense for a game with mediocre combat and mechanics. Git gud."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-10,"Just waiting for it to end at this point.. literally thought I‚Äôd put around 30 hours into it, checked my playtime and I‚Äôve only clocked 7 üò≠"
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Not fishing, genuinely think it‚Äôs terrible. That being said I love the story, it‚Äôs a shame it‚Äôs hidden behind terrible gameplay"
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Ok spartan.
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Who‚Äôs trying to be cool? Grow up üòÇ
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-01-06,cuz the truth does hurt
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Yeah I really hated it man, every single fight there is creatures shooting you from distance with poison, or little ones that seemingly spawn endlessly. The lock on function is terrible and comes off constantly, parrying enemies doesn‚Äôt make a difference as they just attack again immediately. Picking up health just gets you hit and rage mode is pointless."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"I enjoy most games I play. Recently: The Evil Within, The Medium, Phantom Pain, Guardians of the Galaxy. I also enjoyed 2018 GOW as well as every other in the series."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"I know, people acting like I‚Äôve personally offended them over my dislike of a computer game üòÇ"
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-12-28,thats the problem. game has no skill based mechanics to get good at so it ended up a boring mess
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"That's funny, I thought the opposite. On the higher difficulties the enemies are such ridiculous damage sponges that it made the combat really tedious. Every fight was this drawn out chipping away at a health bar. 

Once I dropped the difficulty down to the second lowest I moved through enemies quicker and it felt like I was actually swinging weapons instead of wet noodles."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-12-07,"This, its a gorgeous world and story, but as a game its a 6 - 8 at best."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Kratos does not make deals with gods
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Agree completely man. Total disappointment
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,">Spear is on down button if you press it while shielding, kratos does 180.

Or you could go into the options menu and easily change the quick turn button. I set it to pressing down L3 because I don't have to take my thumb off the movement stick to do the quick turn."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-12-07,That's why I kept spinning vs Gna lol. Tilted isn't the word .
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-04-09,la gran profundidad de la trama del campeon jotnar?...
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-01-23,"Yea. Im just playing it through now, im like 13 hours in. Man is it boring to play and i really doesnt care about the story at this point"
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Came here to say this. OP describes my feelings with the first game of 2018.
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Oooooh good one. I have finished the game for what it‚Äôs worth. Why are you so upset someone doesn‚Äôt like a game?
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"The very post you‚Äôre replying to suggests so‚Ä¶ what do you think, stupid?"
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-03-28,I loved 2018 God of War. Ragnarok is worse. Game is slowed down by annoying and frequent puzzles. The game is a chore to get through
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-01-21,The game is piss easy theres nothing to be bad at.
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-01-03,Totally agree with you and some points of OP. I am huge gow fan but after 12 hours I have to force myself to play it. Sometimes Im so bored with this game. Do you have recommendation for some game that you enjoyed recently?
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-03-28,"Ragnarok sucks but Sony ruined gaming? Relax champ. 

Any uncharted, last of us, spider man, ghost of Tsushima, god of war (2018) are masterpieces"
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-25,Facts trash game
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-05-21,The search for Tyr chapter was quite lame imo. You just move water wheels and kill the same freaking poison frog things. I hope it gets better‚Ä¶
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-01-26,And that girls annoying af shout to call that thing
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-04-04,I‚Äôm getting gray hairs playing this mission cuz it‚Äôs aggravating me so much.
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-08,You seem like a bot account looking at your profile. Everything he said is valid. Why the fuck did you buy a game to enjoy it as a movie???
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-03-20,Wow struck a nerve with the fanboy I'd say! Much of a God of war fanboy are we?
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-03-27,Deal with the fact that the game is great.
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-05-10,"Damn, small world lol. I recognize you from the Warriors sub. But yea this game has been serious step back from a narrative aspects so far. Feels like some B tier Marvel movie."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-01-26,Yea but the story was complete trash too.
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-01-16,"I really miss the combat in GoW2018 that had more slow motion, heavier basic attacks, larger and better animations, more particles, better runics, etc. Only thing that was improved in this game was Kratos's speed and mobility but it did not have to come at the cost of heaviness."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-17,Sifu found a better balance than this GOW bloated mess.
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-23,To each their own but after playing it for hours and finding myself relentlessly bored to tears I have to assume the reviewers were probably just too distracted by its (admittedly impressive) polish to realize they weren't actually having any fun.
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-12-10,"I just finished it last night and booted up the original on PS2 for comparison. Both are fantastic but they are very different games. Ragnarok is beautiful and emotional and I cried a lot. But it wasn't fun, it was more a chore to play and it was very paint by numbers. The original is button mash fun."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-03-28,"Wow that is such a hot take, nobody has ever felt that way. Crazy that somebody would like a game that won a bunch of awards. 

Luckily I have your opinion which is far more important than mine. Tell me how I feel about other things."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-25,God the enemy variety sucks and turning it on east doesn‚Äôt make them less tanky. I seriously hope they reevaluate combats being so frequent in the next game.
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-11,"Oh man, yea just put it on easy. The story is worth finishing the game, but the combat is so tedious. But I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be grabbing the next entry unless it‚Äôs on a deep deep deep sale."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-03-03,story was shit as well tbh
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-09,Watch gbg
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-15,"You‚Äôre not wrong. RDR2 is one of my favorite games but the gunplay is horridly boring and although the lighting/effects are great, the textures are pretty bad. 

Rockstar games have always had bad controls. RDR2 does not change this lol. The inputs are so laggy or just outright unresponsive. 

Anyone who disagrees didn‚Äôt platinum the game lmao."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-01-24,I can tell you hurt ü§£ü§£
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-13,Yeah the UI is so slow and trash
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-12-11,"Fair criticism my friend, it's not everyone cup of tea and certainly not "" Total Trash """
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-04-25,"Can‚Äôt wait to see a white person cast in African mythology. Oh wait, it only works one way because diversity. It‚Äôs so out of place. They even gave her dreadlocks lol. Not to mention the entire mission was like 2 hours long. It makes the game a 6/10 for me simply because of this section. I don‚Äôt care about Atreus or angrboda."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-27,"It's not ""subjective"" when 90% of your points are just you being dogshit at the game. You're experiencing the game like a moron, of course you hate it."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-09,Skill issue tbh
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Mad cuz bad???
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"In all seriousness, I do disagree with your post, as do the majority of gamers and critics, but not everyone will enjoy every game and that‚Äôs a fact. So it‚Äôs okay if you dislike the game. I for one don‚Äôt enjoy Fortnite despite its mass player base and I can‚Äôt just get into the RTS genre at all. So to each their own."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Right, based off this post and these comments, I‚Äôm definitely the one who needs to grow up and stop looking for attention from strangers online."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Yeah you just parry again. Picking up health staggers enemies. Please explain how rage is pointless
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,I find it funny that one reason you don't like Ragnarok is because the enemies are copy and pasted when that is what happened in GOW 4
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Lol imagine how hard the Valkyries are at the highest difficulty.
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-01-08,6.4 but if I'm being generous then 7.1
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Word
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"I get that, then why put your finger in odins nose, my point is,it could have been handled better. Take the deal, Odin breaks the deal, we have a reason to kill him.

If you look at it from outside perspective, Odin did nothing wrong, he was an Ahole sure, but he didn't do anything until Heimdall was dead, speaking of which it was all because Mr Atrues decided to visit Odin, had he taken him by force I understand but nope, I am going to Asgard

Then gets brok killed, after he gets brok killed he decides to walk away( like bro?), Then we have to kill Odin because he killed brok, which was our fault since we were searching for tyr and he clearly told us, he is keeping an eye on us, they know we searching for tyr, even after Odin was tyr most of the game he said let's not fight

We could have found a better reason to fight Odin, just not like that. Odin didn't even feel like a villan, just an old manipulative man, the end fight wasn't STATISFY ING, why exactly did we do Ragnarok? Who knows

He killed Thor, we should feel bad? Thor was a bigger Ahole, sif talking Thor into killing Atreus, then suddenly she is the good guy, jormongandar SENT back in time, a clash so Strong, happens in the back round, give me a break"

z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-08,I‚Äôm not a bot account you clown. So nothing I said was valid? Lol so everything he said was without a doubt undebatable across the board? Dumb ass. I played and beat the game. I disagree with him on most of his complaints. I even said the shit that I agree with him on. You‚Äôre just a complete fucking idiot that can‚Äôt read.
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-04-21,"Its trash. The game holds your hands from start to finish its insulting. The game could tell you to ""go to this street address and suck the devs dicc"" and you people would do it. You guys better be happy that fromsoft doesnt pump games yearly because if they do theyd be swimming in a pool full of GOTY trophies."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-05-10,"Oh what‚Äôs up man! I agree with your take, don‚Äôt care for the writing or the plot. Didn‚Äôt even finish it got bored lol"
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-13,"Lmao Odin throws a temper tantrum and kills brok because he gets tired of listening to him üòÇ. The guy is supposed to be a master manipulator but the gets upset like a little bitch over something like that, and then on top of that he doesn‚Äôt even get the goddamn mask."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-10,"Yes! Sorry, I know this is late, but I‚Äôm I‚Äôd guess around halfway through. The combat is super frustrating and disappointing, especially compared  to 2018. I replayed 2018 right before starting Ragnorak so it‚Äôs fresh for me. 

They super nerfed Kratos. I know games need to have challenge, but he has a glass jaw here. They took away the core moves from the first game, your damage is super nerfed.  Runic attacks are nerfed. Kratos feels weak and fragile.  

Camera lock is incredibly frustrating. Enemies are *obnoxious.* So many creepy little crawly things you can‚Äôt hit, ranged enemies offscreen spamming poison. You can‚Äôt have satisfying solo combat with heavy enemies because they all have nuisance guys with them griefing you. 

I just really don‚Äôt know what they were thinking. I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm doing this after playing through most of the from software games and god of war 2018 pretty much consecutively, but I am half considering turning the difficulty down to easiest just to blow through the story and be done."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-03-09,Even the health jar animation is lazy.  The last game had the green glow surround Kratos looked awesome.  Now its just a little flash.  Very disappointed in this game relative to it's predecessor(s).  Just feels flat.
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-13,"The runics in 2018 were op and made the game cheap and easy, why would you want that back?"
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-12-31,[deleted]
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-12-10,Very well I respect your opinion other then some person in this post
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-17,"""Paint by the number"" perfect analogy!"
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-25,"Well, I just finished the main story the other night. I‚Äôll say finally in the middle of the third act, things felt reasonably balanced. Damage taken and received felt more how they should be. It‚Äôs a shame it happened so late. 

There‚Äôs also an optional late game area that‚Äôs huge and a lot of fun. Again, too little too late, but I enjoyed it. 

Even so, I‚Äôm probably not going to do the post-story stuff due to how tedious the gameplay has been. I‚Äôm just glad to be done. 

I‚Äôm glad people are enjoying it, but I just don‚Äôt understand the praise."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-04-25,Dude I‚Äôm doing the angrboda mission now and I simply don‚Äôt care anymore. Stop forcing me to play as this angsty teenage weed of a kid. Give me kratos and stop weaving woke moral relativism junk into a god of war game.
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-09,What‚Äôs that
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-04-25,Yeah RDR2 gameplay is horribly outdated. Everything else about the game is elite though
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-01-06,"ah, the braindead her of sheep defending this mediocre game, I love it"
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-10,"Lol garbage take. And I played the god of war 2018 right before starting this one. It was better in almost every single way other than graphics.

The combat in Ragnarok is incredibly frustrating and disappointing, compared to 2018. I‚Äôm also spoiled having played through Sekiro and Elden Ring recently too. 

If you liking the game, great, but I find it heavily subpar compared to even the previous entry"
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-10,"Funny since my problem with the gameplay is that it's way too stale, boring and uninteresting and it has nothing to do with skill issue since I barely died on the highest difficulty. The combat is inferior to the old god of war games"
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Yep based on these comments, you are. I‚Äôm allowed my opinion, you‚Äôre allowed yours. I‚Äôm not the one saying yours is wrong or you‚Äôre trying ‚Äúto be cool‚Äù what age are you üòÇ"

z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-03-04,"I agree. Ps5 graphics are great. For me, I hated being Atreus and absolutely hated playing with the girl and her dumb attitude. I want to beat the game but keep stopping because I'm stuck at the God of Teenagers section. They got pretty cringe with the story and whatever message they are attempting. The game is good but feels almost like they're forcing ideas that don't belong in a game about fighting and killing Gods. Very heavy-handed, forced emotional parts"

z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-04-25,i don‚Äôt know anything about moral relativism i was just bored as fuck for most of the game and thought there was no drive. shit just occasionally happened and we(kratos) were just there for the ride. not fun imo

z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-02-15,"I felt the same way about the combat my fist time around. It‚Äôs just.. harder in Ragnarok. My second playthrough I‚Äôm finding out how to read enemies and counter their attacks. I can understand how people don‚Äôt like that, though."

Call me fragile but i hate people who glorifies games like GOW, its essentialy forbidden west with a different protagonist and different title. I was really excited for gow2018 since they wanted to make another theLastOfUs. But no, its your typical western ubisoft game.tlou has too much cutscenes and drama but atleast  they teach only you the most basic things and throws you on a hopeless world, its fucking beautiful. In Gow2018 and ltrashnarok , I cant stand those cutscenes that are way too important to skip, a slow ass combat where your attacks doesnt feel like they have any weight on it, UI that tells me everything that i need to do and fuck that canoe."

z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-05-06,"God of war 2018 sucks too but it was much more polished, so kinda gulable. Ragnarok is complete mess. Is made for people who doesnt regularly play, and with easy dificulty in mind. Its adesign problem and it sucks big balls."

They keep pumping trash because of you people who enjoy it. Fuck, i wish miyazaki could create masterpieces every year so every western games and those who uses their formula could burn to the ground. Maybe only then they could learn. Also no fucking wonder fromsoft won 2 goty with their 2 recent games since they are the only one who doesnt use that trash gow or any western game design."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-04-21,"Btw, i don't know if you've noticed but i completely agree with you on fromsoft and Miyazaki. Most games coming from the west are trash. However gow is still at the very least good, not necessarily great in my opinion."
z5cmgf,2022-11-26,2023-04-21,"But it fucking is a great game, just like you don't get why some think it's a great game. I seriously don't understand how you think it's so horrible.

Yeah I get you cant use playstation in certain countries which does make it worse, but having to sign up for an account play either a playstation or an xbox game on a different platform ( or EA, Ubsisoft or any other companies stupid launcher after opening via steam for example) is just really annoying and should be pushed back against in general. 

Not trying to downplay the playstation issue here. I just think we have gotten far too used to having to do this kinda thing in general and maybe we should start pushing back against everyone doing this."

Edit: Y'all can downvote all you want. I'm one of the affected and I will voice this as much as I can because their decision fucks me over. Before the whole helldivers mess I had no issue buying and all of a sudden my country is blocked. This shouldn't be something we just stay quiet about because it doesn't affect some of you.

1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"I think the big problem here is that even on a PC environment, countries where people would like to play it can't because PSN isn't allowed there.

1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"Just remember, they walked back this requirement for Helldivers 2, but still upheld its region restrictions from anywhere that you can't get a PSN account. 

Don't reward dishonesty."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"For people that say you can just pick another region to make your psn account. Yes, you can and I just made one before this comment to check but that's not the problem. The problem is the game won't be even available for you on steam to buy and link that account you made. This is the case for Ghost of Tsushima and I imagine it will be the same for this as well. You can't use a VPN either because that's against Steam TOS and you probably will get banned.

A quick search showed me that both using game keys and gifting the game to someone in a blocked region don't work. There may be another way I don't know of but for me at least, it looks like there no way to get GoT on Steam. It is also not available on Epic Games for the blocked regions.

So, there is no reliable way to get GoT on PC if you happen to live in one the blocked regions and God of War: Ragnarok will probably follow suit. Well, unless you sail the high seas."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,Cause of all that multiplayer you play in God of War

1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"Because some people are having a really difficult time comprehending why folks are annoyed, I'll try to break it down. You should know up front, however, that there are multiple concerns, and it isn't any single thing.

Firstly, and this is the same with any and all other platforms, it's completely unnecessary and annoying to have to make an account to play a single-player offline title. People have complained about this when EA does it, when Ubisoft does it, when Microsoft does it, and yes, even Steam back in the day. Sony is no different.

Where the Sony specific issues come in is twofold;

Firstly, PSN is not supported in something like 180 countries, meaning you cannot make an account without circumventing the system by using a VPN. This is not acceptable because it means you are at risk of losing all your titles purchased on that account should Sony ever find out.

Secondly, Sony has a history of suffering from large scale data theft. There are countless examples. The combination of that and them forcing you to make an account for something that has no arguable reason for it is a ridiculous combination.

I'm not here to argue with anyone, I am pointing out why people are understandably pissed off. You yourself might not have an issue, but don't suggest that other people are stupid for having concerns and grievances."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,It is peak decision to require PSN account on PC games.
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,I already have a psn account.. That I cant access because my 2fa phone was stolen.. and they refuse to resolve the issue after 2 years..

Sony are the ones restricting the sales, they're the ones making vpns and setting your region falsely a ban offense. They're the one deciding to force PSN accounts into single player games.

The Spider-Man games add a couple of in-game things if you link an account but it was very much optional. I despise the push to make it mandatory, and I can't help worry that Sony being as tone deaf as they are would down the line try to make people subscribe to PS+ to use multiplayer on their PC ports.

Even worse when it's a single player game. 

Still hate EA's behaviour as well, forcing their own launcher on everything. The post I saw recently of a game that doesn't require the launcher gives me a glimmer of hope but I'm not expecting anything."

1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,Piracy is a must nowadays

Now GOW is a different story because I enjoyed going through them.   Also get Steam achievements by re playing! AC Valhalla  too damn long. I'm not even done with the main story and I'm 150hrs in!  Bought it release day on PS4 then upgraded cause I wanted to play on PS5 and it was optimized. Didn't want to try to finish on PS4 even though trophies/most pop.   It's just a shame and also my fault cause I really don't need to buy multiple copies of the same game on different devices."

Anyways, you have to have an EA account. That fucking thing (Ea log in) pops up every time I start my computer. I know I can turn it off in the start up options, but still. It's rather annoying.

Ninja Edit: I think it's Ubisoft, I ignore the details of the pop up now. But I also have an EA log in pop up too. I don't remember what game that was for. I mostly play indie or non AAA games."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,How is this is any different from any Ubisoft game or any game that requires a launcher or secondary log in. Like this is nothing new at all
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,Didn't people say this about Ghost of Tsushima as well? I don't need a PSN to play it.

1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,Is that needed even if you buy the game from GOG? I thought GOG games were DRM free?

1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"Personally this doesn't effect me since I'm in a supported country, however I do question why a singleplayer game needs a PSN account? I mean, I get metrics and shit like that, but should be optional for singleplayer only games.

I can accept multiplayer games needing an account if it is related to some online service that is required to play or use crossplay features, but HD2 proved we didn't need PSN accounts to play online nor play with PSN folks, so it shouldn't be required.

Overall Sony needs to get out of the dark ages and support these countries."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,In my country it's free and it doesn't require any accounts...
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"Ofcourse they would require PSN account on their games. They are trying to make customers comfortable with playing their games with PSN integration. So later they can introduce subscription to pc gaming with their account. I am sure they are working on getting PSN available in countries that currently don't. The thing with Helldivers was one time step back just to avoid escalation of negative image of PSN account, just because lot of people had already bought it in countries that don't have PSN service"
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,Why? They argued with ghost of tsushimas online mode. Ragnarok doesn't have one?

I cant really imagine how am I not a financial burden for all these mandatory (nonsteam) accounts, since not once have I bought anything on any of the 3D party official stores, but they do have to pay the upkeep for me to use it.

1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,This is most likely their long term plan. They see pc gaming getting more popular and they want to sell to them but they also want their 30% cut so this is to ease people in. First it‚Äôs psn account then it‚Äôll be a launcher then they‚Äôll stop selling on steam and only through Sony launcher

Anything published by sony is a probable. 
Anything built by one of their studios will 100% require a PSN account. 

Otherwise they have no way of connecting with the people playing their games. It's the right move from their side..

Out of interest, why are people so against it? It's a username/password combo right?"

It's become the norm for companies to force u to make an account with them if u wanna play the game. I think it's pathetic of these companies to do this to single player games but nobody should be surprised or hold this against sony. It's industry standard now"

I'm just glad Sony releases these games on PC and without Denuvo too. And I think it's more than fair for them to ask for an account, similar to most other big studios do."

Seriously. Why is this an issue. 

I was on-board with the helldivers controversy. I even joined the boycott and made my negative reviews. 

Why? Because they forced it to be mandatory AFTER the release. And let people in regions buy it who could not make accounts. 


As long as ragnarok and tsushima let people know beforehand. 

So what? Is it just a Sony hate boner?"

1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,Do we really have to teach you this lesson again Sony?
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,Never seen so many people bitch about something like this. Do you want me to start making accounts for people? Just make the freaking account and be done with it¬†
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"I‚Äôm a ps guy, but also, why do people care /hate making an account so badly? I feel like I must be missing something lol. I have to make a steam, original, Ubisoft, and epic games accounts to play games they have. I just don‚Äôt know why pc players draw the line at a psn account but not the other 4 they possibly have lol"
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"literally who gives a fuck. it also requires a steam account. stop trying to drum up outrage over absolutely nothing.

god this sub is pathetic"
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,Lol. Not buying it then
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,Isn't this normal? Why is there an article and why do people care?

Lastly, fuck valve for allowing Sony to sell games with locks like that on their platform."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,Oh no what ever will we do
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,It's a game that belongs to them. EA has their own launcher and you still can't play their games on steam without an account.
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"Okay but what bout the games that require a Ubisoft account, EA account, Rockstar account, Microsoft account, the list goes on. 

It‚Äôs almost like they‚Äôre new to the PC industry and just following what almost every other major game company does. 

Sony does need to expand their list of available countries though, that‚Äôs my biggest thing with them"
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,Your reminder that reddit has long been used by companies to try and change public perception by manipulating the sentiment around a clear negative thing in order to try and make it look less bad or even positive...kinda like the dozens of upvoted bot comments in here üòÄ
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"You create a PSN account and that's it. You never have to interact with it again. Boot up game and play. No launcher. Nothing stoping you from playing the game offline. 

Sony just wants a statistic box checked. Cool. Fine. 

""But I can't even buy it cause Sony won't sell the game in my country"" 

Google why that is. Is Sony completely blameless? No. But I cannot blame a company for not wanting to bend to the will of the greedy ass governments."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,The number of people in this thread who are ready to take the corpocock so readily while disregarding all legitimate concerns Is so bizarre that it sounds like astroturfing. It‚Äôs reaching nearly Nintendo fan levels of self-disrespect.
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"sorry, but why do people care? it takes seconds to make an account. genuinely don‚Äôt understand"
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"If Sony games were actually worth the hassle, I wouldn't mind. I played a few of them and it was a forgettable experience."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,What‚Äôs the big deal? This and ghost of Tsushima were formerly PlayStation exclusives. This isn‚Äôt a helldivers situation.
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"Why are people still so mad about making accounts? I have so many damn accounts that I made and then never had to look at or deal with ever again. I use the same login and password for most because they're not tied to anything. I get it. Maybe some people get annoyed. 

But do you guys not have that 1 email address that you use for all of these gaming related accounts so that you never have to look at it again? I mean I use PSN, Xbox Live, and Switch online. I occasionally use Steam but really all I play on PC are retro titles like Starcraft and Jagged Alliance.  But Origin, Epic, Ubisoft, EA, and whatever other random accounts out there take 5 seconds to make. It's no hassle at all."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,We'll just have to see about that.
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"Ghost of Tsushima already launched and found success despite this requirement.

I think this one is a lost battle."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,Ok this is ridiculous. I can get the Helldivers complaint cuz they let you play w/out the account on launch then locked you out if you skipped the account. All these other games who are asking for a PSN account to play the game are fine lol
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,Just do the same we helldivers did
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,AHHHH SONY WHAT THE FUCCKKKK IM GOING TO DO IT
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"I did play both the GoW games on a PS4, so I don't intend to buy it.

That being said, I never justified buying a PS5, and I've been waiting since release to play Ghost of Tsushima on an eventual PC port. Now that it is finally here, I can't play it because the store page is literally inaccessible in my country. I haven't pirated a game in nearly two decades, but this is definitely pushing me in that direction again."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,I can wait.

1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"I don't understand, what is the problem here? It's not like this hasn't happened before."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"It‚Äôs just so weird. Many won‚Äôt do this out of principle and they are locking 177 regions of people, millions of potential customers out of buying the game."

1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"Idc if they tell us beforehand. 

Sure, I feel bad for the 180 countries who can't get it because PSN isn't present, but it doesn't impact me nor people who already have the game."

1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,I still have my PSN account from 2010 or something when I brought a PS3. So I dont really care honestly. So far at least Sony doesnt force another launcher on me so in that regard Im kinda glad its only a login in the game.
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,Jesus fucking Christ its a first party game.
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"I guess the PC port of Ghost of Tsushima proves that even without those 177 countries, they can still sell record breaking numbers. I guess the market in those banned countries are either very small or is just a hot bed for piracy so not much of a loss for Sony"

Obviously that wasn't the case, since they were forced to disable that and crossplay worked just fine, which was annoying to see but since it worked out, everyone let it go.

It was when they came back months later to reinstate it, while basically blacklisting quite a few countries who can't make PSN accounts and who WERE playing the game just fine until that point, that everyone lost their minds lol.   

PS: Absolutely agreed that the intent was to start with Helldivers 2 to boost their PSN numbers with their Steam games, but it looks like they just waited for things to blow over before starting again."

1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"Hi, it's me, most consumers. I don't have a PSN account because I haven't owned a PlayStation since PS2. I'm perfectly fine signing up for a PSN account to play on PC. I'm just going to use my burner email so they just get my bogus data."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"Gotta be honest, looking forward to this game and the PSN account doesnt bother me personally. I considered getting a PS5 for some of the Sony single player exclusives but am pretty happy they're being ported over and I dont need a console. Making a PSN account seems less annoying than dealing with EA or UPlay (low bar I know).


Everyone playing helldivers on PS5 seems to be doing fine with a PSN account."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"Yea I don‚Äôt really understand‚Ä¶ how is this any different than any other game that requires a launcher login after you‚Äôve launched from Steam‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs Sony, but is that really any worse than rockstar or uplay?"
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"After finding out how many countries restrict people from having a PSN account, I‚Äôd say they could be selling even more."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"If logging into my PlayStation account is all it requires to play PlayStation games without having to buy a PS5, I'll gladly do it"
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"> most consumers don't care.

I know who will care: The people in the 180 or so countries where PSN accounts aren't available and have been waiting for a PC release to be able to play it."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"Most redditors don't care, they've been doing 3rd party launcher sign ups all the time. The helldivers 2 thing was crazier because some countries had no PSN. And Sony took their money and said you can't play."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,Im upset because my friend won't be able to buy the game and thus I won't be able to borrow their copy of the game
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,">Reddit will continue to be upset about it ( justifiably or not) and it will still sell incredibly well because most consumers don't care.

I don't think you even understand why people are upset. I would have bought it, but it won't be available in my region on Steam, so I **won't be able to** buy it. Not because I don't want to, or because I care about accounts -- but because I literally **can't**.

>it will still sell incredibly well

It will still sell incredibly well, even in those regions where you literally can't buy it? How is this the top comment."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,Yeah. I‚Äôm just glad it seems to have been announced. I wasn‚Äôt paying attention. First game was great. Looking forward to playing this.
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,Problem is that requirement for psn cuts about 100 countries as they dont have psn there.
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"Except, of course, the regions it will be blocked in"
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"I don‚Äôt think most people care that they‚Äôre being up front with this one. Helldivers was a big deal because the expectation wasn‚Äôt set, and Sony/Arrowhead literally had to scrub things from their websites in the spirit of avoiding potential legal action when they tried to make having a PSN account mandatory."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,Whoa. Cynicism? That's crazy
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"Reddit: uplay, blizzard launcher, origin/ea, r* all that is fine

Also Reddit: PSN?! WHAT THE FUCKIN SHIT IN FUCK WHO THE FUCK WHY EVERYONE REVIEW BOMB IT"
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,Ghost of Tsushima also required a PSN account. I ended up just making one.
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"You're REALLY far behind on how the internet works now that it's controlled by a small group of megacorps. All these accounts exist so companies can sell your personal data, track your every move and interest and sell that to advertisers to make more off of you passively.

They're also about creating closed garden economies as well to keep you looking at only products and services they have a hand in. In every case though ultimately you are the product. 

It's only going to keep getting worse until the economy entirely collapses under the weight of the late stage capitalism we're currently being crushed under. Every year must be more profitable than the one before, forever."

The next question is, how does it make them money.

Get enough of an install base on PC, and then launch an app. They will be able to directly advertise to you that the next big hit is available on their PC app via the overlay, and how amazingly targeted that will be - you are literally showing it to specifically gamers who already purchased PS titles. Now they dont have to give steam a cut, so more money.

Now you have gotten them to buy from your app, time to introduce PS+ to PC. More money."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,">Yeah I get you cant use playstation in certain countries which does make it worse

Putting it like that is disingenuous. By estimates [it works in 70 countries and doesn't in 120](https://www.sportskeeda.com/gaming-tech/all-countries-playstation-network-available-and-countries-it-s-not)."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"That is the issue, Sony isn't opening up to new regions.

Microsoft accounts work in regions Xbox isn't in, Playstation accounts do not.That is the major issue, when you block almost over 100 countries from buying your game on PC, you pss people off. Why is this tied to a console marketplace, when these games don't have a console marketplace.  


If Sony had opened up account creation to every legal country they could and had a note saying ""account will not work on Playstation consoles due to unsupported regions"", people would have been fine with it."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"(I'm not mad at you, I'm just irritated in general about all this, because it's fucking everywhere.)

It's just another fucking dumbass login for something that shouldn't have one. Everything has a gods damned account and password, and I'm just sick of it.

Why the fuck do I need to be interacting with these companies outside of just booting up and playing their games? Why do I need all these accounts? Why do I need to be online, all the time? Dude... ***Enough*** with this shit.

Is it data collection? Just big brother'ing us? Like what the fuck is it? Because I have the strangest feeling that corporations aren't trustworthy... And I don't want to support this shit any longer. It is stupid as fuck in principle and function. I'm tired of having to be connected to fucking everything all the time ffs. 

I don't give a ***fuck*** about these corporations besides the fucking games they happen to slap their damn name on. I don't want another fuckin' account for some company that I do not give a shit about interacting with; I'm not going to use anything on their account platform aside from just buying a fucking game, and that's only if I have to. And if this shit is somehow exploiting me to earn them more money on top of the price I paid for the game then ***fuck*** them and ***fuck*** this."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"Hmm okay so just a quick run down of what happened so far from the beginning...

--Psn games were region locked, since like last 20 years, but you could just work around that by saying you're from a different country, Sony were fine with this and didn't really give a shit if people did this.


--Helldivers2 happened. It blew up, hard. Servers couldn't be maintained. 


--AFAIK, Sony did and were always planning to use a PSN account to sign in. Just like ubisoft, Ea, xbox.. literally most companies out there..it's a very common practise.


--At the beginning of the HD2 arc, Sony indeed *did* have a sign saying you need a psn account to play, HOWEVER, Arrowhead, the developers, messed up.


--As the playercount increased,  Sony gave the devs the go ahead to temporarily bypass the Psn future, but they have to re-add it in the future. 


--Everything was fine and dandy as the servers increased and the player count settled after some months. Until Sony asked the devs to keep re-enable the psn future, as it should've originally. 


--Arrowhead dev admitted that they kinda forgot that the psn sign in notification wasn't re enabled every time one booted up helldivers2, which is what they originally intended to do. Instead it was just one small notification, with a 'skip' option back when things were hectic and everyone forgot about it.


--Helldivers2 community went mad, admittedly. They were complaining about two main things:
1. Why did they need a psn account to sign up after all this time
2. Certain regions couldn't make an account, but could buy the game. 'Wasn't this illegal?'.


--The review bombing came, like never before. Hell was unleashed. People mass demanding refunds. Steam allowed the refunds even past the 10hour playtime mark.


--Sony responded and said that helldivers2 will be an exception, as it was a mistake.


--Which brings us to the current timeline. The backlash Sony received was 100% significant. It was on articles, youtube videos, Mass negative reviews of not only helldivers2, but other psn games on steam.


- This brings us full circle. Sony, who couldn't care less if regions that didn't have PSN, were now fully aware of the consequences by not paying attention to it. 


- So what do they do? They stop selling the games in those regions. Full stop. It's the easiest and quickest solution for Sony to avoid such a debacle from occurring ever again.


These are the facts, AFAIK. Feel free to let me know if I'm missing something. 


I just want to state that, it would've taken less than 5 minutes for an helldivers2 player to create a psn account. And possibly a maximum of 10 minutes if they were in a region locked area to make it.


No, I am not Pro corporate or whatever people want to call it.  Sony ARE a business. That's how they operate. I can definitely understand why Sony did what they did. They're not some indie developer that's for the people."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"What is the benefit to the customer in *requiring* registration? If nothing, then it is at BEST a waste of my fucking time when I've legally paid the company for their game. If they want me to pirate their shit, they just need to show a lack of respect for my time."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,I actually like getting trophies in Ghost of Tsushima and I can see my playstation friends and messages. They just need to open it to every country.
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"Issue was when they tried to force people to make new acc for helldivers after, idk 3 month in order to continue to play game they bought. Making people open extra acc on fresh game buy is dick move, but still tolerable if you buy it for first time"
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"Also most PC games for the longest time if you bought a physical copy would require you to install and create an account on steam. Even if you own the physical disc you still are required to use steam it seems like.

I should be able to play the game without having to use the internet at all if I wanted to. So kinda annoying in that respect to."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,PC gamers need something to complain about.

1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,I mean just think about it for a second. I‚Äôll give you an example. I just got an email today that there was suspicious activity on my Activision account. I forgot I even had one but probably had to make one for Call of Duty in the past. So I can possibly have some information stolen from me due to people breaking into my account or Activision having their data stolen directly. For what purpose? So Activision can sell some personal information to target ads at me? It‚Äôs actually bullshit and it‚Äôs bullshit people have gotten so complacent about giving out all of their information so they can actually use a product that they bought and SUPPOSEDLY own.

In fairness, it's not a ""this is theoretically dangerous"" with Sony as they have repeatedly shown they shouldn't be trusted with your info.

I much prefer GoG's model because you can just download the damn game and run it as a standalone app if you want to.

Their launcher is a _convenience_, and not a prison with all the software you purchased locked inside of it.

That said, I still end up getting almost everything on Steam... because that's where I can find it for the lowest price most often. I guess my principles are only as deep as my wallet."

It likely is available on PC in Japan and you are doing something incorrect.

And Sony likely isn't interested in selling games in those regions because the market is too small for it to be worth it for them to operate inthem so by all means just pirate the game then"
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"It was against their terms because it had to be in the legal speak.  They rarely enforced it and it allowed people in countries without PSN to get around it easily.  The Helldivers thing is now pushing Sony to just region lock and now there is no way around it but the people who complained about it, from the countries that it truly has no effect on, will STILL have to have a PSN account to play the games because they aren't going to stop doing that.

Ghost of Tsushima required it for the Playstation overlay and legends multiplayer.  I can ignore that and play the single player content, what I bought the game for anyway. God of War, and all of the other single player content Playstation games don't require it to play, Ragnarok shouldn't either."

1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,Many country don't have access to psn network they just can't create account and If you try to VPN you risk to loose access to all your game .

1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,Did you miss the whole incident with Helldivers 2 where Sony allowed the game to sold in countries where PSN was not available and then tried to force users to get a PSN account that they couldn‚Äôt create without risking bans from Sony for violating Terms of Use?

1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,Because Sony is working on their own PlayStation Store for PC and they want people to be able to move there and bring their games.

1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,Yea I‚Äôm not sure why Sony is the only one catching shit here when I had to make a Microsoft account to play sea of thieves.
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,At least they aren‚Äôt having data breaches every other week
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-06-02,"And this attitude from people is why they get away with it. It's just more restrictions on how we can play the games we buy. How long till Sony starts trying to enforce PS+ on PC players to play online? The Playstation people have to do it, so what's the big deal, right? Give them an inch they'll take a mile. 

Look at the Helldivers 2 fiasco. People got pissed about the PSN requirement and it launched a PR nightmare. Sony backpedalled with some bullshit statement about how they're figuring out what's best for PC players. Then the release Ghost of Tsushima. Single player is untouched, but multiplayer requires PSN account. Not much outrage here. Single player is playable regardless, and the requirement for the PSN account is only multiplayer. Sure it's sucks for the people being barred from the game, but whatever. Now they're requiring PSN for single player only games that doesn't have a multiplayer to justify the barrier of entry for non supported PSN regions. When does it stop?"
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"Yeah except now they know that the proper response to PSN having issues and the game being unplayable on launch is, ""Sorry, the game will be unavailable until we resolve the issues,"" instead of, ""Sorry, we'll temporarily waive the PSN requirement so everyone can play while we resolve it."""
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,EA games requireing an EA account is also bad. There should be no accounts at all.
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,I get it for MULTIPLAYER games but requiring online accounts for offline single player games esp GOW which has no online game mode ever is really odd.
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"That makes sense considering they offer services worldwide, unlike PSN. So you can‚Äôt really compare em as apples to apples."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"Microsoft have had 280 breaches since 2002, they absolutely eclipse Sony in how often they get breaches its not even close, they've already had multiple this year. I bet you didn't blink twice to link your Microsoft account to Steam."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,PSN hasn't been compromised in 12 years. Microsoft and Steam get compromised way more often and way more recently and these people use Steam on Microsoft Windows every day so you can stop pretending you are worried about whatever data you'd put in to sign up for PSN
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,Actually it does stop me from playing when I couldn't even buy the game in the first play as Sony pull it off from unsupported region.

 Seems like more then an inconvenience if you live in one of those countries"
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,I believe that 99% of the people mad about this cannot buy it due to being in the region ostracized by this decision. Why not sell to the regions that cannot own a PS console or have a PSN account?
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"It's not about the mandatory PSN account. It's about 180 regions that can't buy the game at all. Even if you want to buy it, you can't."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,You should see the piracy subreddits talking about how this is the reason why they've decided to pirate the game. Sure..
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,The games are starting to give Playstation Trophies at least. I'm alright with that compromise.
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,I wouldn't care if the process for making a PSN account didn't involve uploading a photo ID of some sort... to a company notorious for data breaches.
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"Social Media easily leads people into this false sense that ""this is what everyone thinks"" because you don't realize that a post with 1,000 users commenting is 0.000003% of the US population. In addition, most comments are by crazy people who think they are right about everything."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"Reddit is also inherently flawed by design enabling it to be an echo chamber. Users will upvote what they want to hear and downvote hard to swallow truths.

1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"On the other hand, if nobody complains, it never gets fixed. It's like arguing that the people protesting X government action should just STFU because nobody but them cares. In truth, nobody but them cares *yet*."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"If you haven't been using reddit for that long and already had your own gaming opinions it's really obvious.

Here's a fun example:  
Around the 2010s I mostly followed French media on video games, and Call of Duty quickly gained a reputation of being a scam, with its overpriced map packs, very short campaign, releases that were just the previous game with 3 hours of new campaign... It peaked at some point where if you typed ""Call of"" on Steam the first suggestion would be ""Call of Pigeon"" (pigeon in French is also used to call someone gullible/stupid).

Yet if you mention Call of Duty on Reddit, how likely are you to have everyone go on a rant about you and your shit games?

The point is that even if there was a really big gaming community opposed to the game, there were millions of people just buying it. And the opposition was such a minority that it's all but forgotten a decade later. Boycotts are irrelevant, most people live outside of gaming communities or will just buy anyway. And whatever was outrageous at the time, millions have grown with it thinking it was normal. And in fact, it also applies to whoever thinks they're superior or above that."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"No. People just like the drama, they like to act all righteous on the internet for upvotes. Is a fake endorphin release.

1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,The gaming market in those countries is incredibly small which is why they are not supported. The money it would take to operate in them has not been worth it.
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,I probably am I try to avoid anything that requires constant accounts mainly for this very reason. A better way I should ask it is why is everyone (hyperbole I mean majority) just okay with it? Ignoring regular consumers not quite understanding the implications behind all the accounts it's still just consistently annoying to deal with I'd think ever for a regular consumer
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"This is why I adblock. If this system is unavoidable, then the least I can do is tear a hole in their coin purse on the way through. At the device level, and the DNS level."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"This is the thing that really pisses me off. If they want my data they should pay me for it. Instead, they are trying to have it both ways - the service is offered ""free of charge"", but at the same time they claim you're exchanging data for access. Really, it's the first one - the service is free of charge, and in the fine print they hide a second transaction where you give up your data free of charge. This is done to deceive and prevent users from making a fair value assessment. It should be a crime.

The data brokerage industry is a $400bn industry. There are 8bn people in the world. If we assume everyone is online and everyone has data of equal value (both are not true), that means a person's data is worth *at a minimum* $50 per year on the market."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"Sony can fix this in as little as two steps, so they're just being lazy fucks over it. Selling in these regions isn't even their jurisdiction on PC, that's entirely on Steam."

PS Studios could do that but they could only do that if they undercut steam prices and then, steam users are waiting machines, we waited 4 years for GoT and a few years because KingdomHaerts was exclusive to epic IIRC.

Besides, if that doesnt work, we sail the seas"
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"And they were actually cool with that up until the helldivers thing. Arrowhead delayed the psn requirement to help launch and Sony was fine with it, and stuff like ghost of Tsushima was going to release single player but multi wasn‚Äôt going to work without one and it said so on the steam pre-order page. 

Then helldivers happened, Sony is reacting by making these games unavailable in those countries completely, and making PSN mandatory. 

But people did ask for transparency, and they‚Äôre getting it."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"They are more than likely working to resolve that but the reason the other regions aren't supported is because the gaming market in those regions is so small and a fraction of the people that actually buy video games

Sony used to just tell people to sign up in another region if yours isn't listed. After the backlash it was forced to be removed and not sold in those regions.

Millions of people have been signing up for PSN in unsupported regions since PSN came into existence 18 years ago"

People were upset about registering, full stop. It was never about what countries were officially supported. That's why the protests stopped on Helldivers even though the game sales are restricted.¬†¬†


¬†PSN works unofficially in unsupported countries. You don't even need a VPN. You just have to choose a supported country to be your ""home."" Technically this is against the rules, but Sony isn't interested in enforcing it - they just don't want to be subjected to any given country's legal jurisdiction. If people ""sneak"" onto PSN, that's fine by them. The Helldivers protests forced them to end PC sales in those countries because they couldn't exactly claim at that point that they had no idea people buying the PC game in those countries were using PSN while selling the game to them directly."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"What really pisses me off as someone who moved to one of those unsupported countries, is I already have the fucking PSN account but they still won't sell to me."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,The issue only started occurring like a month ago. This isn't something they can just do in a short amount of time. They are a large corporation and policy change like this can take months
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,Totally agree. It‚Äôs a fucking single player game. Does it cloud save to your PS5? If not gtfo
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"The problem is that whule creating an account outside your region hasn't been an issue, it IS against Sony's own TOS.

It never stopped being something we hate, it just became something we begrudgingly dealt with. Sony is catching shit now because if I remember right previous Sony PC releases like Spider-Man didn't necessarily require this, so they were hoping it would generally stay that way, but ever since the Helldivers 2 fiasco this is.... well.

Y'know. More in the limelight."

Sony had set a precedent of not requiring that stuff, now presumably future games won‚Äôt be playable offline nor on the Steam Deck (their overlay doesn‚Äôt work on Deck).

As someone who plays primarily on the Deck away from internet these days, it‚Äôs not just some minor inconvenience to me. It‚Äôs a literal roadblock to playing their games and it genuinely feels bad to see them do this."

I know......countries that are unable to purchase the game are stuck in a shitty situation, but that's Sony's problem. If they want to leave money on the table that's their decision."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,I think the reason Sony gets a heavier backlash now because after the drama in HellDivers 2 people realised how small the list of regions that have access to PSN is compared to other companies
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,Why are people missing the fact that people in 180 countries can't buy the game?
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"The PSN account problem was/is a major problem because they were selling Helldivers 2 for 3 months without the requirement (they stated they did require it, but there wasn't anything stopping you for 3 months).

So 3 months later - WHOOPS, actually there's over 100 countries that cannot play this game that we were actively selling this game to. WELP we'll just revolk access to it or we'll tell customers how to violate our ToS so they can keep playing the game they bought. 

So now with their latest games requiring this, there's no consumer benefit so people are obviously mad about that. But also Sony has had several data breaches over the years and they've made headlines about how much of a problem it is and how they've been warned and done nothing about it.

  
So sign up for a PSN account, we might leak all your personal data but at least you can play God of War, Ghost of Tshushima and such! 

  
There have been plenty of outrage posts on EA/Ubisoft, you not seeing it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Go to the steam deck sub and see people trying to play the games they legitimately bought but they can't play because they're on an airplane or the internet crapped out while they're not home. 

There's plenty of people pissed off and if you don't believe it? EA has just started removing EA play requirements for their games because of the problems it's caused with the deck and just how shit EA play has become.

Ubisoft, is ubisoft so they'll die on their shitty DRM hill before they change anything- like they've been doing for the last 10+ years"

1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"> Why isn't there an outrage posts every time EA or Ubisoft release a new game that requires an account?

Answer: EA's library hasn't interested me since _Mass Effect 3._  Simple as that.

I have some mild outrage over not being able to earn achievements on Steam in _Far Cry Primal,_ the only Ubisoft game that has interested me in the last 15 years.  It has outright stopped me from buying the game.

My response to exclusivity is to play some damn other game.  Goodness knows I will never, ever run out."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"EA and Ubisoft have required bullshit launchers for years, if you want to see the backlash you have to look at older releases as people are now expecting it and only slightly grumble.


Sony demanding accounts is new and therefore gets backlash as that's the time to be vocal if you want change. It won't change and people will have to accept or go without just like they do with EA and Ubisoft but this is a new standard so it gets more attention."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"It's been a longstanding thing that people in countries without official PSN/Sony support would simply register their account as the nearest country with support. Some countries have literally been doing that for like 15+ years with no issues.

The wrinkle now is selling the game on Steam, Valve isn't going to accept the liability of Sony selling games to people that are technically breaking ToS. Sony can look the other way selling physical games or on PSN, bc the ToS is simply legalese for liability reasons

So realistically, Sony wasn't going to ban people on Steam for linking PSNs registered for another country, but you can understand why Valve isn't going to play those games when they're on the hook for refunds and customer service if there are any problems."

We're in a really bad spot regarding ethics.

While being forced to link/create accounts with no functionality gain only feels greedy and slimy."

1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"> And they were actually cool with that up until the helldivers thing.

Having to have a PSN account and a Playstation to play a Playstation exclusive is one thing, arbitrarily requiring a PSN Account for games on PC is a separate thing entirely, especially if your service is only accessible from about 1/3 of the countries in the world. Helldivers was an especially terrible example because they released WITHOUT the requirement."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"Steam delisted them from the regions, not Sony, this was confirmed by Arrowhead CEO

And Helldivers was advertised from the start as requiring PSN same as how these are getting advertised with requiring PSN."

People didn't just ask for it, in a whole lot of jurisdictions such transparency is a legal requirement, like in the EU.

So it's not like Sony suddenly saw the light and listened to the people, it's more like Sony covering their asses against potential regulatory action/litigation because it pissed off a whole lot of people.

Since then it's been bumbling around pissing off even more people by trying to artificially inflate its PSN account numbers in such hamfisted ways.

A surprising amount of incompetence and bad PR moves, over something they already had figured out over a decade ago, with Portal 2."

I bought helldivers because I had a PSN account. When you get to the screen saying you need to log in your credentials it just says PSN is not supported in your region. And you cant log in anything.

At least this time it‚Äôs clear and obvious ahead of time
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,And that was pretty stupid too. But at least that was only required for the co-op mode.

What purpose would the number of free user accounts serve a company who produces so many tangible products?  It's not like it's Twitter or Facebook where the number of active users is directly tied to potential revenue.  Sony makes high end electronics in most categories, publishes video games, runs a very successful movie & TV production studio, and runs the 2nd largest music production company on the planet.  The amount of PSN really doesn't seem like something that would affect how Sony is perceived. 

The only thing that makes any sense to me is if they're going to make a play to start selling their PC games directly from the PSN store in the near future, and if people who have been buying their PC games already have an account it won't be much if a barrier anymore.

Even more puzzling is that (1) PS games are not region locked (and haven't been since PS3) and (2) Nintendo, Microsoft, and Valve all allow their users to update their country of residence.

You can but you are immediately in violation of EULA/TOS and you can be banned at basically anytime for just wanting to play a video game."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"Yes, those players in unsupported regions have been playing on psn for over a decade just fine by using this workaround, only recently are they actually having problems and this is because people threw a shit fit over having to add one more account to their list of 10+ accounts they already had. And so those players in unsupported regions are now suffering for this weird ass crusade."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"I thiiiiink the whole deal was that you can do that, but it breaks the PlayStation terms of service. And when people from those countries asked PlayStation reps what to do, they said to just basically do what you said. And people were like that literally breaks your own TOS. And the reps were like nah it‚Äôs fine. 
  
  
So people were doubly pissed that the company was telling them to violate their own terms of service as the fix instead of just‚Ä¶not making them make an account."

1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"I think steam removed it because they got tired from the constant complains (and maybe a possibility of a lawsuit) for selling games that they can't play as they can't make the required account to play the game.

Even if the company goes under or they get fired, so long as they can put ""I raised growth/share value/market cap/[insert preferred number here] at company X"" on their resume, investors at other companies are going to hire them in a heartbeat anyway, so they have nothing to lose.

1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,There's only 196 countries in the world... so that number is wrong
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-06-01,"> What purpose would the number of free user accounts serve a company who produces so many tangible products?

I... think I already explained this in the comment above. It's all about optics. Sony's gaming division has been constantly moaning about how each one of their best-seller, blockbuster tentpole game releases (e.g. Horizon Zero Dawn 2, GoW:R, Spiderman 2, FFVII:R, etc.) ""under-performed"", because they just poured so much money into development and advertising. They need something to please the shareholders, and what the shareholders care about isn't profit, but growth; not the value of the company right now, but it's value in three, five, ten years from now.

PSN numbers are used to show that people are invested in their ecosystem. If the number goes up, it means more people are into Playstation games, which means they are going to buy games in the future and make more money in the future. Bigger number means more growth meaning a better investment. At least in theory, in a perfect world, if all the stars align, but that's kind of the deal; modern corporate investments are all speculative, gambling on the company's exponential growth, and so the corporations are scrambling for metrics to convince said firms and share brokers that they are going to grow in the future and thus make a good investment opportunity. Whether or not those metrics, like PSN numbers, are indicative, useful, or even just substantial is beside the point.

As for them wanting to sell their games separately with their own launcher, I think it's a blatant misunderstanding of why those launchers exist. The big publishers pushed those out originally over a decade ago when they tried to compete with Steam, and they lost. Now they exist as just an extra layer of DRM, which is once again nothing more than something they can point at during investor meetings and say ""Look, we have all of these measures in place to combat piracy, meaning we're going to make more money in the future, so give us money now"".

The truth is that while Steam's 30% cut looks huge, it's doing a tremendous service to these companies and publishers in return. Valve takes care of the back-end, the servers, the maintenance, the forums, the advertisements, and the customer support, including all the related apps and other services. If Sony tried to do that themselves for PC, they would need to build out all that infrastructure and service-base, which is not only going to be a big initial investment, but they'll also need to maintain it, pay the people in charge of maintaining it, and so on, so I sincerely doubt they would make any more money off each purchased game than they do when working with Steam.

But then again, Sony is a big, publicly traded company with multiple layers of bureaucracy and multiple boards that answer to other boards like a freaking layer cake, so their decisions aren't necessarily rational. If someone decides ""If we make a launcher, we can spin it as our official entry into the PC gaming market and use it to bolster investor confidence"", it will get pushed through, because at the end of the day, it's all about money, and the promise of growth makes more and easier money than actually developing a product."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"Right now, today, its Steam taking 30% from Sony. I did not mean or infer anything else."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"So which company do you buy games from with no account? You need a Steam account to buy from there and Steam is inherently DRM. GOG will give you an .exe so it's DRM-free, sure, but you still need a GOG account to shop there."

That's some Olympic-level mental gymnastics."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"Yeah, they had no issue *on PlayStation*. The reason why it became a problem is because this was the first time a PSN account was required for PC, and many of the people who never had a PS were naturally concerned about the regional restriction, not knowing there was a workaround, so they started asking for refunds.

I've seen people on this thread believing the issue was just a simple ""Oh, I have to take a minute to create an account"" and raising a petty fuss about this, but that's not what it was about at all. It was people genuinely concerned they would be locked out of playing the game after they bought it."

Why tf does a SINGLE PLAYER Game require an EXTRA sign in? And another reason it pissed people off is because that unnecessary sign in, blocks the game from hundreds of countries.
It doesn't matter if steam is available. Because if psn isn't available then the game isn't sold in that country.

The sign in adds absolutely zero to the player experience and it shouldn't be required."

1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,This game is not on Steam as far as I can tell. It's an Ubi game released exclusively on the Ubi app. Nothing to be mad about here I suppose. (If you can bare to use the app at all)
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"I think you are taking issue with the level of response the PSN account linking had, which was massive because the game launched without this requirement and then they tried to make it one after. Which was NOT the way to go about this. 

If it had been required from day 1 the reaction would have been different. The hate Ubisoft and EA get is definitely there, but no where as big as the Helldivers situation."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"I'm providing my personal case-in-point.

Though I _will_ add that I came pretty close to being pissed off at EA for buying out _The Outer Worlds._  I wanted to play that game and didn't appreciate the prospect of having to infect my PC with EA's software.  In the end, though, I laughed and laughed at EA because they weren't able to keep the game off Gamepass, so I ended up playing it for a buck.

I'll be laughing at Sony in a year or two, as games that would normally have been long-timed exclusives on underpowered $450 consoles, like new Final Fantasy entries, are simply going to be available day one on PC.  Bless Square Enix for getting that ball rolling.  Others will follow suit, because when you make a game for PS5, you're 90% of the way to having a PC port already.  That will challenge all other incentives to stay exclusive, including nationalistic ones."

They temporarily disabled it because of the server issues. People then claimed it was never mandatory, never labelled as such, was a big switcheroo. These idiots basically lied through their teeth about it acting like it was some sudden shock and kicked up such a fuss.

1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"This sounds really condescending... and doesn't even make sense. 

So you're saying wanting to use a $20-30 product (that you can afford) is entitled because some of the people in your country don't buy it, or pirate it? Note I'm not saying ""cannot afford it"", they mostly can afford it in principle, but it's a steep price so they prefer not to.

But no, wait, that isn't your logic: you're saying people in developing countries *do not want to play games* because they have more pressing concerns... of what? Scrounging around in the dirt to make their daily dirt and broken glass soup in their house of plastic bags? WTF? 

How is having less money that US citizens connected to not having the capacity to play video games? Are video games in 2024 some kind of extravagant luxury hobby, like safari or helicopter piloting? A thing that only the richest, spoiled people outside of the US can enjoy?

Sorry for going off, it's just such a weird statement on all counts. ""You shouldn't complain, most of your compatriots don't even know what video games are... so you shouldn't play them too out of solidarity"". They do know, they play games."

Maybe it's not the worst thing in the world, but I would still prefer to be treated with dignity in a hobby that I enjoy. Imagine if you were into knitting and your favorite type of yarn literally can't be sold in your country because of arbitrary company politics even if you are willing and able to purchase it. It's alienating for no good reason."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"Same here. I buy games on GoG before Steam/Epic Store. I have BG 3 on GoG. I have couple PS4/5 games on GoG, too. 

I encourage people to use GoG, it's platform is optional, and you can download games directly from the browser onto your head drive, and it's there forever. The platform works a lot like steam. Achievements work similar to steam, they aren't that important anyway, but they're there. It helps keep your games updated and easier to repair files. It's Steam just with more ways to keep your games yours."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"Upon further investigation you do appear to be right about BG3 giving you the direct .exe file and being able to launch it without even having Steam running. However, this is an extremely rare exception. I've never heard of any other game like this. It certainly isn't the norm."
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,This was before it became delisted. The reason it got delisted was because a lot of people in those countries already bought the game and Steam was granting their refund requests. There was likely a lot of them for Sony to take notice and decide to delist it.
1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"It's true that they haven't been enforcing their own TOS, but nothing stops them from doing so. I'm going to be laughing my ass off and copy-pasting ""I told you so"" if/when Sony politics changes (new CEO, etc), and they suddenly ban all TOS-breaking accounts, and millions of people come complaining and blaming Sony for losing all their games."

1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"That's true. Maybe I'm just overthinking it but I think gamers should generally know a little bit about the world on account of interacting with people from anywhere at any time. I played 1 single game with people from Lithuania, Latvia, Serbia, Russia, Brazil, and many more countries. Hell, I played old school runescape with some people from Kuwait."

1d4i7fr,2024-05-31,2024-05-31,"The thing is the reason that PSN isn't available in your country is because Sony have decided, likely based on console sales, that they won't make enough money there for it to be worth providing the service. You're a victim of global capitalism, much in the same way as people in poverty are, except you don't get to play a video game and they don't get to eat."

107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Honestly enjoyed playing as Atreus overall but there were a few times I got tired of it. The switching back and forth happened a bit too often IMO. It felt more like playing as Atreus was a bit of a novelty/watered down version (I know he shouldn‚Äôt be at Kratos‚Äôs level of power but I do wish there were more skill upgrades for him. I had him maxed out in abilities way before the end of the game whereas Kratos still had a lot to develop on). I also wish you could‚Äôve switched back and forth between them as a duo when they‚Äôre together instead of being locked into Kratos.

107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Everything I say below is kinda spoilery about God of War Ragnarok but not really in a plot way but I put it all in spoiler text anyway...

>!The Atreus stuff always felt like a waste of time because the game never really committed to them either?!<

>!Like with Kratos there is a fairly deep level-up system where you have armor and multiple kinds of weapons and you have your support characters that you improve or adjust. You feel invested in every little widget you pick up or side quest you go on.!<

>!With Atreus you have... the same armor you got from doing the Kratos parts and... no new weapons and... you don't level up your side characters. You do level up Atreus still but it's all abilities that only matter on the Atreus sections with some Kratos section correlations.!<

>!Every time you did something with him it felt like a break from the ""real"" game and the game systems did nothing to make you feel otherwise.!<

EDIT: Also also also... >!The Kratos sections are, by and large, repeatable. The game could hide secrets in there and side quests because you could go back and do them later. The Atreus stuff was all for the most part a one shot deal, so there just wasn't the depth there like in the rest of the game. I never worried about figuring out how to master Atreus gameplay because I knew the game would never throw a harder optional boss or mode at me that required me to really master his style.!<

All of this just contributes to a mindset where you feel like these sections ""don't matter"" even if the story stuff is interesting or if you actually do enjoy the characters."

107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Surprised nobody brought up The last of us part two
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Grow up.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Fucking spoilers man! Not everyone even has a PS5 yet much less God of War as well.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Last of Us 2 is the King of this. It's determined to make you hate every character you next play more than the last one.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,This reminds me of a large chunk of the last of us 2
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Last of us 2 in a nutshell

107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Controversial opinion, but this was me all through Red Dead Redemption.

Probably the dumbest, most gullible protagonist in all of video game history. And the game would not let me avoid the obvious traps he kept walking into.

It felt like I was being held hostage. The gameplay was good, but the story kept preventing me from having fun."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,What tlou2 did was genius. I felt real emotions in a game
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Oh hey, it's the exact reason I fell off TLOU2 *super* hard.

I don't give a shit about Abby. I hate Abby. Why do you have me play as this bitch? And the game tries to get you to care about her SUPER hard. They're like ""Oh she does friendly banter with her crew and likes dogs!""

Fucking so? Let Ellie murder her and deal with the PTSD later."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,"TLOU2 joined the chat.

The twist that nobody asked for. 

Honestly though, I liked her story of somewhat redemption over whatever the fuck they thought they were doing with Ellie. Abbie and the kid(s) were the best part of that game, and I‚Äôll die on this hill."

107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,I would just walk Atreus up to enemies and watch him get beaten. It brought me joy.

107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,"Thought it was just me. Between making me play as Atraeus and the damn squirrel, it deflated the whole experience for me.

All I could think about was them killing off Kratos and them continued the ""story"" through Lori. Turned my stomach.

I understand why they want to attach children to the franchise monetarily speaking, but not at Kratos' expense.

107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Bayonetta  3 is almost entirely ruined by huge boring segments of playing as not Bayonetta. The Jean mini game gets old fast, in my opinion, and Viola is like Bayonetta with fewer abilities and nothing to unlock and no  equipment.

Violas animations even seem lower quality like she was added to the game last second. She looks like she's from a game by a much less competent game studio."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,With these games its more like walking as said character down a long corridor.

107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,What did Atreus do?
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,There was a fun Hulk game that came out years and years ago that would force you to play as Bruce Banner and sneak around in between the Hulk rampages
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"i don't have a problem with this per se, my problem/chip/quirk is when games force stealth sequences, JFC that make me whip out the cheats/trainers immediately."

107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Agreed especially when they force you to pick fruit for a fucking hour

107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,I'm just getting through the section as Atreus in ironwood and holy shit has it killed the pacing of the game for me

107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"I have NEVER played a game where they make me play as the non main char and it be an experience I enjoyed. 

At best its quick and easy so I can get back to the person whom I've spent hours meticulously leveling and shaping. 

I can't think of a single game where I was forced to play as some other person and I went ""man that was cool as hell. I want to play some more of this person"""
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Lol, any game that makes me suddenly play as a different character pisses me off."

107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"I think they pretty clearly set up a potential sequel featuring Atreus as the main character. And tbh, the speed of his movement and combat made him super fun to play as in place of kratos' slowness."

Thank god for games like Ragnarok"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,lol.. Atreus is a little shit sometimes.  Great gameplay though..
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Last of Us 2 has the absolute best example of this in gaming history.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Metal Gear Solid 2 was one of the OGs for this  having to switch from Snake to Raiden (who was always complaining led to a lot of hate from fans. In fact he was so hated by fans that Konami included a femboy character in MGS3 (Raidenovich from memory)as fan service.

107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,"That's what games like Warcraft 3 did so well

You played as a human killing the undead

But then you played AS the undead, killing humans and all they needed to do was turn the protagonist into an undead

Or, kill their leader and establish a new one so the players don't have the hate for that character

Like how you need to kill Cenarius in the orc campaign but once you're over you play as the night elves, as Tyrande instead of Cenarius"

107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-03-18,I love how almost 90% of the comments are about TLOU2. Really makes you wonder how unlikeable they really made Abby.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Reminds me of the first force unleashed game where they start you off as darth Vader and you just plow your way through so many Wookiee.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"I'm noticing a trend here.   


OP mentioned God of War, one of other top comments mentioned Shadow of War, you mentioned Symphony of War.   


I'm just avoiding games with the ""of War"" ending from here on out."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Like ff7 when you play as Sephiroth. Early on.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,loved that game but the difficulty dropped off a cliff the last 2 or 3 levels for me sadly. It gave me huge ogre battle vibes with the army/team building.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,I suppose it's mostly a problem in narrative driven games.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Absolutely love Symphony of War!

Kinda wish we coulda fleshed out the character interactions part more and I‚Äôm sad they nerfed my favorite artifact (though it was deserved) but it‚Äôs an absolute blast of a game.

Can‚Äôt wait for the dlc and the 2nd game"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Just lose on purpose as soon as you get control of him and win the game. Checkmate symphony of war.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Came here to post Symphony of War but you beat me to it. I was still mad at the time.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,"How is that game? Been trying out more strategy RPGs now that I'm running out of good fire emblem games, Tactics Ogre Reborn is kinda disappointing me with the lack of uniqueness to the characters. They all feel barely above generated ones."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Wait I was just about to go back and play both of those storylines. Are they not fun then?
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,TearofGrace ripped that DLC a new one in his hate-fueled playthrough.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Shadow of war goes from good to ass in the final chapter when you have to just grind the fuck out of it
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,I loved Desolation tho. Baranor was fun to play as and the Mithril rank reward lets him fight almost endlessly lol
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,B-but she got the shiny shines that kill.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"At least in mgr you can kill sam while as raiden, and playing sam just gives more story background about how sam teamed up with armstrong so the game did it right"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Not even a cyborg, just a mad Brazilian"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"I mean that‚Äôs different though everyone loves Sam.

The fact that he practically a normal guy and beat the shit out of an enhanced cyborg already shows he was super badass."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,He‚Äôs a Brazilian so that means he has the ability to naturally double jump.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,That ONE?
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,This
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Ugh, that dude was suuuch a good douchebag. I couldn‚Äôt wait to fight him"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,"And I'm the opposite, I loved Heimdall. He was honest, straight forward and called Atreus out on all his bullshit. I can't hate him even if he was an ass"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Like, i bought that game to whoosh and fling and splat on walls, what is it with this boring two legged walking ? Get some powers you freak"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Wow, I had forgotten that part even existed.  It was so unnecessary."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,The Miles part sucked too... Really hope that SM 2 gets rid of the stealth sections.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,If they were gonna force her in they should‚Äôve kept it like that part where you told spiderman who to take out.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"I just finished that game and miles morales over winter and good god I wanted to break the game whenever I‚Äôd have to play as MJ. 

It was even *just* the gameplay but what is she doing walking around super dangerous armed guards or villains like she‚Äôs invincible

One section was too much with the tents. I almost quit right there

Luckily it wasn‚Äôt in miles morales"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"I didn't really mind it, just the story around it, girl you don't have powers you are risking your life"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,I would have been ok with it if it was *only* that one section in station square or whatever where you direct peter around. It would have been a cool 'ha look I'm playing as MJ' moment instead of 'ugh another one of these'.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,When he first encounters a chest and tries to punch it open like Kratos but his hand crumples at the wrist
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Loved his quickness over Kratos. He just felt so much faster. Don‚Äôt get me wrong - prefer the big guy but it was a noticeable difference in game play.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"I had the same reaction, then realized Atreus kind of slaps. Just racking up headshots to R3 kill enemies before they even get close to me. I actually started to prefer him to Kratos because he was so damn overpowered"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"This except instead of an ""UGH..."" I let out an audible gasp instead.

I had no idea that playing as Atreus was even going to be a possibility (I'm not sure if they announced it beforehand or not), so I was totally caught off guard by it. Looking back though, I'm not sure how where else they could have placed that first transition in the story to have the same effect. He sneaks out because Kratos was being over-protective and still treating him as a child who can't do anything for himself. I think because we initially see it from Kratos' point of view, it made Atreus sneaking out seem as some sort of terrible betrayal. But then the transition happens and you see that (because you're now controlling him) Atreus can really hold his own in combat without having to rely on his father. His combat mechanics were fast and agile and smooth like butter, despite being ""inexperienced"" and not having the same physical strength as Kratos. It makes you realize that Atreus' frustrations with Kratos were somewhat justified, and made it easier to sympathize with him as a character.

Or maybe I'm just over-analyzing it. Incredible game though."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Becoming an almost hit kill wolf every 2 minutes was fun too. 

After the ending >!I was hoping for some open world changeable character, but they did us dirty and robbed us of our boy!<"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"His combat is fine but his sections had the best storytelling IMO. Everyone shits on Ironwood but I loved that section, Angraboda is a dope charecter 

His time interacting with Thrud and Thor is great too. First arriving in Asgard is absolutely draw dropping. And I loved the bar fight"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"I thought at the beginning Atreus combat was kinda fun and mostly on par with Kratos. By the end of the game, Kratos has multiples weapons and skills to unlock/master while Atreus is much more limited. That and having to remember the Atreus controls/combos after hours of Kratos made it a drag."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"My biggest beef with Atreus is the lack of finishers, literally the same 2 finishers for each enemy"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,I think Im one of the few people who was actually exited to play as Atreus from the moment I saw the camera behind his shoulder
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"he controls well, but for a story-centric game... it was really unappealing playing as him. especially with how LONG you have to play as him. I don't want to be passing the torch on to anyone or anything like that - i want to play as the god of fucking war, dammit."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Honestly his moveset feels as good as Kratos' if not better imo
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,not unlike playing as miles
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"I'm the opposite on the reaction, i was excited.     


Though as it gets later in the game and kratos can kill way, way faster, it's annoying playing as Atreus since his power doesn't scale nearly as much. >!My first annoyance was Musphelheim with Thor.!<"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"whoa that is interesting, I thought Atraeus gameplay was pretty cool. it gave me a break of being kratos because I low-key felt a little bored of him.. so switching to Atraeus is a cool experience. it gives me more curious to Atraeus freedom of expressions what he had to say when Kratos is not around and his own adventures. I'm glad Santa Monica went with this route."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,He actually controls better than Kratos.  It's kind of annoying because his character is too vanilla.  Wish he was more realistic and a bigger shit to his dad throughout.  He's so kind and obedient.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,Exactly what I thought too.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,Yeah I really hated the parts where I had to play Ellie
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,i was actually enjoying the last of us 2 until i had to play as abby. it kind of ruined the game for me because i didn't connect with her at all. that and the overall story structure just sucked imo
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"All the characters pissed me off so...yeah, I guess."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"This was me at first, I almost turned the game off when I had to play as Abby again after what happened. But I came around and liked her and Lev. I couldn't give less of a shit about that guy in her story though. Owen I think? He was the most boring character in the whole series."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,You better believe I made Abby die 10+ times in the most gruesome way possible right after they made me play as her.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,I like the point they made with it. After awhile. She had a lot of ‚Äúaccidents‚Äù in the early goings.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Yep. I still need to do another playthrough to see how I feel about it second time around, but the LENGTH of the big halfway change really irked the shit out of me. There‚Äôs no reason Ellie couldn‚Äôt have been written into most of what happened. 

I like how she was retconned as the Surgeon‚Äôs daughter, and I appreciated the back and forth, but once I realized I was stuck with Abby for the foreseeable future I really lost interest in the game.  The whole time I fought Rat King I was hoping he‚Äôd tear her apart. 

That last hour playing as Ellie again was such a ‚Äúoh thank god‚Äù breath of air moment for me."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Oh absolutely.  Totally hated Abby at first of course, then you learned her story and how she's still haunted by Joel killing her dad, and I began to emphasize with her.  It helped drive home the idea that the world is basically never black and white, just a fuck ton of grey

Which was the whole point of having to play as Abby of course.  Fantastic game imo"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Yeah, didn't care for Ellie, she went too far."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Last of Us 2, everyone?"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Fanboys on their way to give you every insult that exists
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Main reason I didn't play the game and never will. Imagine having a character focused master piece on your hand and with your sequel you make another character focused game but this time have 0 likeable characters.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,nah
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,i thought Abby was more fun to play as than Ellie. Abby really fucks shit up.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"I rarely finish games, and it might be the most i've disliked a character in a game i've finished, like ever. I just wanted to see the end of Ellie's story so It kept me going. Every single time the character would switch I would say out loud..  >!""I dunno.. Kill any Joel's lately?"" And I really wish the game just let me fucking off her.!<"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"God that game was awful.

TLOU 1= God tier narrative, characters, tense game play

TLOU2= C tier narrative, F Tier characters, game play was the same but some how worse. 

Abbey wasn't even the problem. Abbey was an absolute badass UNIT. but her characterization was all over the damn place and it seems like no one noticed anything about her past her muscles.

EVERYONE'S choices in that game made no fucking sense. Abbey being able to even track Joel at all with NOTHING BUT A DESCRIPTION. 

Like the only two compelling characters were Lev and his sister(?)"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Abby was a great character and most if not all hate about her seems to be ""strong woman bad"" lmao

Edit: Yes let the women hate flow through you, joel got killed by a strong woman lmaoooo"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,YUUUUUP
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Lot of hating on Abby in this thread but her sections were some of the best parts of the game. Being captured by the Seraphites, traversing the sky-bridge, the hospital. Was amazing."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Same here. I am not even THAT against the concept but the execution was just poorly done. Which is a shame because everything is done so well except the pacing/plot.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Abby was the best part of that game
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,Joel killed millions with his decision. I was sad but ultimately unshaken by his death
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,"For real, when you have to play Ellie again I was like ""No, I don't want to play this bitch anymore.  She's fucking awful and she needs to die.""  Abby is bae though."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"I had to take a break for a day or two after the switch I was so mad, but then I grew to appreciate the different view and new characters making the final fight much more emotionally charged"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Also I thought Atreus was kind of a gameplay palette cleanser. Kratos is hack and slash, but when you switch to Atreus, it was almost like third person shooter."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Same!! Loved the story sections as well!
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"And we'll have her say something about getting herself out of this mess as she walks around, pointing out the people she needs her Ex to get rid of."

Huh."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Saying you ‚Äúplay as him for a bit‚Äù is kind of over selling it.

He‚Äôs in your party, as an uncontrollable guest, for one fight in a flashback, and he generally ends the fight in a single attack.

It is a cool way to establish though just how strong he is in relationship to the characters you‚Äôve met so far.

Everybody else is hitting for 100‚Äôs of damage at best, and Sephiroth is out here smacking dragons for a couple thousand."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,It's almost as if reddit was made of many people with different opinions.

I can‚Äôt see how anyone could, for example, stomach something like game of thrones and turn around and say TLOU2 is trash lol. 

The characters are well written, motives easily understandable.

Lots of complexity in their feelings and actions.

107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Yeah, it has the easiest ""hard"" difficulty I've ever encountered. 

On the one hand it's gratifying to be able to sink everything they throw at you...on the other hand it would be nice if the enemy AI employed all the abilities available to them.  (For instance, I rarely saw them making good use of Charge and Ambush.)"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Loved the ogre battle group structures but yeah.... I felt like I hit max level several levels before the end and just rolled over the rest of the game without really progressing anymore

107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,"It was my favorite game of 2022.  I rarely finish games and *never* 100% them, but I did everything there is to do in SoW.

However:  

Quality:  I'm pretty sure it was made in GameMaker, and it's pretty rough around the edges.  It takes some getting used to, particularly navigating the menus.  My experience was bug-free.

Content:  the story and most of the writing are pretty forgettable bordering on bad.  There are some moments of good writing in the character support conversations.  If the story isn't your thing, you can skip every single cutscene and dialogue.

Gameplay:  this was the entire experience for me.  I think it's very well designed, and most importantly, fun.  You have a lot of freedom to build units and armies as you see fit. 

Advice:  if you pick up the game, bear the following in mind:

* use any arena tokens you find as you get them.  The arena is where you earn most of your money, as well as incredibly useful items.  Also handy for leveling up your lagging troops.

* don't sweat it if a unit occasionally dies (assuming you're playing with permadeath), but it quickly becomes expensive to replace a lot of troops, particularly when they're promoted. 

* if you see any interesting artifacts or named characters in the market you want, buy them.  The market is where about 80% of your army and game-breaking items will come from. 

* don't hoard your items.  They're useful out the gate, and you'll get plenty more.  Using them early and often really helps in the early game. 

* always keep $3k in the bank until a certain point.  There's a map where you can hire a mercenary for $3k if you have it.  It's very worth it.  I think it's map 7, 8, or 9.  After that point, feel free to blow your whole wad.

Hope you enjoy it if you pick it up!"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Ehhhhhhhhh

Honestly, the Desolation of Mordor DLC is better imo for gameplay surprisingly. Feels like AC in how much more grounded it has to be

107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"He's also very charismatic and likeable despite, y'know being kinda crazy and murder-ey although you find out through the DLC he was originally a good guy trying to take down Armstrong but after his defeat he kinda forgets the reason why he even fights and who he is as a person and just started killing for the sake of killing which is reflected in his theme."

107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,I loved that they gave the first punch you land on him such a deep thud. Satisfying as hell.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,"IIRC, Heimdall is the only Norse god that was ruthlessly, sadistically, and brutally *Kratos'd*. Every other god got off relatively easy.

And that makes me happy"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,"Same but the fight against him was kinda ""meh"" for me but Kratos did end up giving that little bastard what he deserved."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,Homie if you loved Heimdall I worry for you. He‚Äôs a great character yes but nothing about his personality is redeemable.

107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,The comedic bits in this game we're top notch! Guffawed many times throughout the game and this being one of them!
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Recently started this game and reached to this point yesterday. It made me laugh when he tried to punch open the chest. But all in all it is not enjoyable experience playing with Boi. His dad is badass.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Atreus felt stronger to me because of that until I got the dropnir spear.



I love nimble dodge and jab styles and atreus was really good for sliding around the field."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,But with kratos you get the added benefit of watching his rippling muscly shoulders as he runs
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,"For real, playing Atreus was fluid as Hel."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Also, you can do sonic arrows to trigger status effect then melee for a quick kill on almost everything especially after you buff the status effect with upgrades and skills. All of his sections felt easy"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"I used Atreus as melee, lol.  Bow trip + downed enemy attack built up stun so fast which led into finishers."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,"Yeah I‚Äôm honestly surprised to read people immediately hated when they switched to Atreus. I had a similar reaction to you and had a good time, especially because they don‚Äôt really ever make you stay as Atreus for too long (outside of the part where they pick fruit with the ox thing lmao)."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-15,"Late reply, but no, they did not announce that Atreus would be a playable character. I was equally shocked and pleased by the revelation!"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"My one gripe with the game is that after you beat it, >!you essentially lose all progress and experience with Atreus. Freya is a good assist, but I prefer Atreus' summons over her sword attacks !<"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,The section isn't bad at all it just drags on way too long.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Ironwood was the worst part for me because it took me two nights to play through it. Felt like a lot more exposition at once than there should have been. I liked most of the atreus sections, but the length and the ""let's do one more thing"" fakeouts made it drag.

Considering how kratos also serves as the voice/self insert of the player, it was fuckin perfect how kratos says ""you've been gone for TWO DAYS"" especially as I was waiting to play as Kratos again for that long."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Iron wood needed to be cut in half. Way too long.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"The thing that I didn‚Äôt like about Angraboda and Thrud is that it felt like they whipped them up specifically for a yet to be made Atreus game.  They barely had any character development besides ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a giant with a big mean grandma‚Äù and ‚ÄúI wanna be a Valkyrie and my dad needs an intervention‚Äù.  

I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll end up being cool eventually, but you could essentially take them out of the game and it would barely matter other than the deus ex machina part."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,I was so excited when Atreus >!the sword!< only for it to be another companion character lmao
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,It didn't help that they had you play as Abby in the middle of a cliffhanger. Also right after she just blew a hole through best bro's head.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"I think if they had swapped it up where you spent more time with Abby before the Joel stuff, get to really know everyone with her, give us some more time to like her. Really hammer in the fact that Joel didn‚Äôt need to murder everyone in that building, because let‚Äôs be honest, most of us in her situation or the families of any of the other people he murdered would feel the same way. Show more of the repercussions of Joel‚Äôs massacre, then bring us to Joel halfway or something. Then we fuck up Joel and see what it does to Ellie, then we continue on her side more, and give us more choices when it comes to Abby‚Äôs crew, or just let the rage take over and kill."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,I jumped off the first cliff a few times before I actually continued the game with her lol
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"how I felt as well. I was initially just trying to rush through thinking it was a short sequence, it wasn't until I saw the gun upgrade stuff that I realized it was going to be a long haul. I almost put the game down but decided to finish it anyway. Right away I felt they were being transparently manipulative with the dogs and stuff. It just didn't work for me. Though certain sections of abby's part are cool from a gameplay standpoint, as far as story goes it just never worked for me and it reached a point with a certain boss fight where it became ridiculous"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"It was such a bad feeling to control Abby. Right away my brain went ""Gotta find the fastest way to kill her to avenge..."". The game really tried to force us into being empathic towards her."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Same. I understand what the devs were doing with their story telling but I'm not going to sympathize with a character that slowly and brutally murdered someone. You can't ""make me understand"" where another character is coming from when their goal was to kidnap and torture someone. 

There is a big difference between what Joel did and what Abby did. Joel did it with the best of intentions, albeit selfish, but Abby.....straight up fucking murder and vengeance. ""But wait, you get to play as her and understand her journey"" bullshit. I didn't even bother finishing the game, just read the synopsis if the story online and am SO glad I didn't finish that story."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,I actually never finished the game because of this.  Right at the switch off I was like fuck this and have not gone back to it in over a year.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"For the first time ever, I stopped playing a game, and watched YouTube to see how it ends. I just couldn't play as Abby.  Fuck her. How the hell am I supposed to want to keep her alive when all I want is to rip her head off??  


Speaks volumes for how well they did in the first one creating that connection that I just flat out stopped after I had to play as Joel's killer."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,"It's great to see this near the top. I always felt the second game wasn't nearly as good as the first, and one of the biggest reasons for that was the over all story structure and their decision to make me play as Abby half way through the game"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Don't say that around the fanboys lol
It's so divisive That there are 2 TLOU subreddits. One is for the fans of it and the other is for gamers who aren't fans of it but love the franchise and wish it was treated better."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"yup, totally ruined the game for me as well."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Same here. The entire time I was waiting for Abby‚Äôs gameplay to be over, then it turned out it was a significant chunk of TLOU2."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Yeah I was originally pissed off that Joel died, but now I'm glad he left such an awfully written game before his character was ruined"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Don't forget Mel. I think she was even more boring and annoying.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,The love triangle with Abby Owen and the other girl was so dumb and unnecessary. Great gameplay in TLOU2 tho. Just a meh story compared to the first.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Hated the whole game. From start to finish it felt like i was bashing my head against the stupid wall. Everything the characters did (all of them) was dumb.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,I got it out early. I grew to really like Abby. But you can bet her jacked ass that I launched her off that rooftop she was so scared of a good dozen times
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Her dad was killed while trying to forcibly vivisect a small child. The situations aren‚Äôt even vaguely similar, that‚Äôs why it was so strange that the game insisted that we see Ellie and Abby as equals."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,I actually enjoyed TLOU2 more than TLOU1
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,They are the same character. They turned Ellie into abby and tried to turn abby into ellie.

107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Well yea they designed Ellie to be weak and abby to be super strong.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,The gameplay was far superior in the sequel... Did you even play it? That's an absurd statement
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Saying the gameplay is worse shows how wrong you are honestly lol
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Yeah as much as I enjoyed it for what it was...the last 6 hours of that game give or take are rough. The hunting for Abbey...the decision to let her go after finding her...just all of it. 

It felt needlessly muddy at the end."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Yikes, the good old, you must be a misogynist if you didn't like it. As if there aren't tons of strong women in gaming that for some reason aren't that controversial..."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"My personal problem with Abby is that her defining characteristic is ""I'm angry"" and her decision making for better or worse isn't because of being ""blinded by anger"" but rather poor decision making and illogical choices. I will say her sections with the kid sidekick is really great though. Everything that doesn't have to do with her relationship to Ellie in my opinion is way better than most parts of the game as a whole."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,No. Everything she did was devoid of any and all logic. Her characters purpose and reasoning behind all of it was terrible and lacked wisdom or motivation for the audience at all.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Its not abby Its the story direction and plot behind her.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,Annoyed they made it so cheap. I'm ok with him dying for good story. That death was not good story.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"I think there was only one instance where I truly disliked this: FF8, when you have to split up into two separate parties, around when you got out of the desert prison (?). Yeah no, I did not ever train with those 3 from the second party and playing with seriously underleveled, underequipped characters wasn't really all that much fun.."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,No they just loved Cloud
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Dunno why you're being downvoted. You're right, he's wrong. I guess some people never played the original."

107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Oh totally I came around to him too. But when the game came out the amount of people that were bamboozled by the switch was insane.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Wasn't a fan of him complaining all the time, but then again I was put in the same situation I would be complaining about being tasked with disposing of bombs without having any experience"

107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"A lot of people think if the story of a video game doesn't match what they would have done or written, it is automatically bad. Let yourself be challenged by the narrative"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Some day you will learn that just because something is more ""mature"" doesn't automatically make it good."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Ok, that‚Äôs my bad because I don‚Äôt like to play new games on old hardware that doesn‚Äôt run it very well  but that‚Äôs very much a personal preference that not everyone shares. 

But the fact that you change characters from Kratos for the first time in EIGHT games is definitely a fucking spoiler."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Who wouldn't?  Joel said himself he used to be a hunter. Those people killed innocent people. Joel, we loved Joel, but consequences have actions, and even if you're justified to kill, others will be justified to lay that blade upon you as well."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"As a daughter she was in the right. Someone hurts you family, you cant sit there and say it is what it is."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"To save fucking humanity, and Ellie was cool with that, there‚Äôs no comparison here"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Joel killing Abby's dad and Abby killing Joel are morally identical, on the individual level, from the POV of Abby/Ellie. They both inspire the daugher to get revenge. The only difference is that both characters seem to realise the futility of if all when they fight at the end which, luckily for Abby, results in Ellie letting her live."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Why would it matter to them what you think? You didn't buy the game.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"I rage quit when I had to play as Abby. After I got over myself, I was able to play it and enjoy it"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Which is totally fine
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Most people did.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"I was completely the opposite. Witcher 3 and the Spiderman game was the example I had in mind when I made the post. 

I'd love a Witcher game where I play as Ciri and it looks like she may be the next logical step for the franchise which I'm excited for. 

But I did not care for that section of the game at all."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,I was literally gonna say thank goodness you can just dash through her parts.  But yes great game.  Started a new play through with the updated visuals last week.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,That‚Äôs awesome. I‚Äôve heard a lot of good things about that game but I‚Äôve never tried it.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"This game is frustrating, because it's tough as nails."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,"Holy shit that game is good, I know no one asked but I have now beaten all stages, no hit, on the hardest difficulty, but I still suck at normal fighting games"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"If you played it on the Wii with motion controls then I'd definitely suggest trying it with a controller on another platform, the swings just never registered for me and ended up getting me killed 9/10 times"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,I got stuck towards the end when you have to bring down a star destroyer with your force powers. I just can't pull it down for some reason.

Definitely felt like Batman on this game mode, but the RNG has a terrible tendency to break runs."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,I came to say something very like this.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,I liked playing Abby.  Her fighting was so brutal.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"It helps that he manages to be distinct from Raiden in gameplay while still being amazing to control.  I'd kill for a mod that gives you Sam's style for the main game, not gonna lie."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,"Also, he's hot"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Apparently Santa Monica purposefully designed him with ‚Äúthe most punchable face‚Äù. So it was actually intended.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,I was really hoping he'd get the Poseidon treatment. He's the one character (outside of Odin obviously) that deserved it.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,"He loved the fact that Heimdall was truthfully just doing his job and doing it well. Atreus realy was there to destroy everything and Heimdall saw through his lies. Sure he was abrasive but he was right. 

I‚Äôd say there‚Äôs something wrong with people who love Atreus because he‚Äôs a lying manipulative little asshole. Atreus character‚Äôs real name in the Norse mythology is not normally treated as a good guy."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,parts of missions where you have to follow an NPC who is faster than your walking speed but slower than your running speed or they stop in place waiting for you to follow them if you go ahead of them they should be illegal as well
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,I kinda shitted my pants but it was nice yes :p
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Sometimes. Unless the mission specifically says not to or they'll kill the hostage.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"This is absolutely true, and is pretty consistent with comic logic in general. But‚Ä¶ did you just quote yourself?"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,"This game is proper funny with its writing, I loved it! The moment I heard the octopus is called ""Dinner"", I immediately thought ""So where's Lunch"" only for Atreus to call one of them ""Lunch"" when you first spot them made me feel like a kid again with such a thought

Seriously, the funny dialogues in this game just feels so natural, like actual human adults would joke around, not terrible one liners that feels forced"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,‚ÄúI like this riddle‚Äù
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,"It's kinda funny how much I hated the spear at first. Then I got the hang of using it to stick & move quickly and suddenly I realized that I hadn't touched the axe in ages (never forsook my beloved blades, though.)"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Other enemies can stand and take getting the shit kicked out of them by Kratos, but slap 'em upside the head with a bow and they fall down like so many dominos."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"That sonic chain ability was so brutal in scenarios where you are getting attacked with a group of enemies.



They get locked in stuns until they die."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"I really like Freya more with her Valkyrie form in combat situations. Really helps in a lot of situations, that being said the summons were also very nice though so not having the possibility anymore sucked indeed"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"This especially sucks >!if you didn't do all the side quests as there is some missable dialogue, like the big sky jellyfish in the Alfheim desert.!<"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"I agree, but I feel like it fit the narrative. >!Kratos made a lot of progress with Atreus and had to accept letting go. He didn't want to, but he had to, and had to learn to live with what came after !<

Both of these games did a great job of connecting the mechanics to the narrative."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,God Atreus would be a godsend for that bonus Valk. I miss my Rat summon.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Yeah the things you learn to develop the story are interesting, but they occur in like two minutes of dialogue inside a section that takes *hours*. The boss fight in there is fun though."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"I think the only problem was that ironwood happened so suddenly. Like, I thought it would be a 10 min dream sequence. If I knew it was officially Ironwood time, I probably wouldn't have minded as much"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Ironwood was sooo effing long. I forget just how long it was sometimes. I did the same thing. Those sections, in like every game that has the character switch off thing, always feel like they're going to be quick. I had work in the morning. Ironwood was kinda boring. I figured I'd finish that section so I didn't have to pick up on it the next day.

I ended up just having to quit midway. I kept waiting for it to end and it just didn't. It's a super slow introduction to playable Atreus and his side of the story. It gets a lot more interesting in Asgard, but I felt a lot of his playable sections were too long. He spends a good amount of time away. They should've chopped it up a bit more throughout the story.

It gave me TLOU 2 flashbacks. I like that game, but I just remember taking over playing as this character I didn't know or like. Thinking it was going to be an interesting little bridge in the story. And you end up playing as her for like 7 freaking hours."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,The only part I would cut is when you go underground
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"It's ok to have static secondary characters, expecially when you have such dynamic lead charecters. Like GOW R has so many charecters that go through major arcs like Freya, boi, Kratos, Thor and Sindri. You need some static charecters like Odin, Brock, Freyr, Thrud and Angraboda to ground the story and allow you to better observe the changes that happen in the dynamic charecters. 

If everyone is dynamic the story is gonna lose its cohesion"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,"The biggest issue with TLOU2 was the way the two chapters were structured. If they had a short intro with Ellie and Joel and then switched to Abby and her friends either on their way to Jackson (you don't know what the reason is until she kills joel) or on their way back from Jackson. 

&#x200B;

The biggest mistake was making you hate Abby and then go through the process of killing all her friends and then switching to her POV to try and make you like them when you \*dont\* and they're already dead anyway."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,"You dont see her shooting Tommy until you get in the theatre as Abby.

Edit: Oh I just got who best bro was, my bad ..."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"I'm still baffled by peoples inability to empathize with Abby. Like the game basically forces you to feel what she felt when her dad was killed by Joel, and yet everyone acts like she's just a monster."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"They did it that way to give you the blood thirsty revenge Ellie has for Joel. Completely dehumanized Abby with the opening sequence, so you and Ellie are of the same mindset to find and kill Abby and her friends."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"If I had a relative who tried to kill a man who was saving his daughter, I wouldn't have much sympathy for my relative.

This is why I don't have any sympathy for Abbys father. He not only rushed rushed Ellie into surgery but begged Marlene to agree to it.

People say ""but it's what Ellie wants"", well ok but why rush her into surgery? there was no need. They could have woken her up, treated her like a queen, let her say goodbye.

But no, they rushed her into surgery and tried to frog march Joel out of the building with instructions to kill him if he tried anything. This is why the whole revenge plot doesn't work for me and therefore makes Abby an unlikeable character."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,">Really hammer in the fact that Joel didn‚Äôt need to murder everyone in that building

Issue is that in 1 Joel spent the entire time running tf away from the Fireflies while holding Ellie.

And last time I checked, he only killed Marlene and the surgeon and then took off.

Feels like in 2 they made Joel even worse than needed."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Dude holy crap I did the SAME THING. I thought it was  like a small cutscene of hey look at her perspective and how she was doing. Then I realized half the game was her and I still tried to finish her part as fast as possible lol.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Are you old enough to have played Metal Gear Solid 2 when it first came out? At least in TLoUII you get to play as Ellie again later in the game, in MGS2 you spent the rest of the game as a totally different character."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Same. It didn't help that we had to essentially start from zero again weapons-wise and skill-wise.

Also, I didn't really give a damn about the dogs. They were trying to kill me first as Ellie, I wasn't just gonna let then bite off my neck"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"feel exactly the same way! happy others do to and im not insane for not either loving it or hating it 100%.

107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"I ran her into zombies about 30 times, then uninstalled the game."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,I always said that TLoU2 gives you the biggest revenge boner in history only to slap it with a 2-by-4. Still love it though.

107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,I thought it was far and away superior to TLOU1 in every way (which is honestly a pretty mid game outside of the twist at the end). Really interesting how people can have such strongly different takeaways.

107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,I grew to like her too. Well maybe not LIKE her‚Ä¶some things you can‚Äôt come back from. But I at least understood her POV and the game does a good job at making you feel like everyone is a POS.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Lol you are 100% correct.

It's amazing seeing these people just ignoring the fact that Abbys dad only got killed cos he RUSHED Ellie into surgery. Had they woke her up she likely would have agreed to it but at least it was her consent and it let her say goodbye.

He totally got what he deserved,"

I would never say otherwise. 

There are plenty of reasons why the story can be considered good that have nothing to do with that. 

For example I think if you took literally the same story and put it into book form people would love it with some embellishments. 

I honestly feel people just got very attached to papa joel even though he was clearly very morally flawed.

107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"It's actually bugged out depending on what version you play.

The PC version doesn't vibrate when the controller *should* vibrate to tell you to pull it down. On the other flagship versions, the controls shown on-screen aren't correct to *when* you should be doing what. 

Follow what Kota tells you to do instead of the on-screen prompts and you can do it in one cycle of the TIE Fighters.

edit: It occurs to me that it might still not be obvious - You need to straighten the Star Destroyer so it's facing Starkiller, and so the nose is tipped up. When the controls turn green and start vibrating HEAVY (on PS3/360), just gently use the controller to keep the SD in exactly that spot and in a moment Kota will say ""BRING IT DOWN, BOY!"" Pull R2 and then pull both sticks straight down. 

You can take a round or two of the TIE, so if you're really fast you can do the whole thing in one pass."

Plus so many gags in gameplay. One in the dwarf area where you are getting 2018 flashbacks when you get grabbed by a troll, just for Kratos to instantly fuck him up in 2 seconds. And other one in the crater where a dragon swoops in and killsteals your oger"

107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,"""Forced"" is this game's MO.

It has themes about the destructive cycle of violence and revenge and how those things are bad. It explores those themes mechanically by having you collect pills to get better at headshots and forcibly killing everyone in order to progress. Then the game tries to force you to feel bad for participating in the violence that you had absolutely no hand in creating.

The switch to Abby would've worked if LOU2 wasn't a sequel and we knew nothing about Joel, but our connection to him from the first game means that even though he arguably deserved what he got, we still don't want him to die. So when Abby kills him, we obviously don't want to empathize with her. If someone close to you has been murdered, does knowing the murderer as a person and why they did it really make you feel better about it?"

This is what a lot of complaints boil down to"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"My problem with the sequence was the timing, as the commenter said above it halts all momentum for the story at its climax.   


I wanted to know what happened to the characters I was playing/journeying with and the game forces your to spend hours to get back to that moment to find out what happened. I think I was going ""okay, yeah I get it Abby and Ellie are very similar people in nearly identical situations and this is basically the pain arc in naruto"" its like they took 8 hours to tell something that should have taken 30 mins   


My biggest issue with the game forcing you to kill a dog then making you feel like a shitty person for doing the thing the game forced you to do, that just feels dirty"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Well done for stating the exact problem.

No-one should be forced to feel."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Because her dad deserved to die for rushing Ellie into surgery without waking her up or getting her consent.

""But Ellie wanted it""

Fireflies don't know that, Joel is unsure of it, Ellie just told him she will go wherever he wants to go after they visit the fireflies. 

It doesn't justify them not waking her up. They could have woken her up, treated her like a queen and let her say goodbye. But no. This forced Joel to do what he did.

Unlike Abby if I found out my relative tried to kill a child but get busted, I wouldn't want revenge.

Also Abby turns her back on the WLF within 24 hours or something, people she has loved and fought with for years. She is not a good character."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,"I like Abby way more than Ellie. Joel fucked up and the consequences finally caught up. Was it necessary? Not really, but understandable. 

Was it necessary for Ellie to go after Abby after knowing what happened, getting revenge on everyone but Abby. Killing 100s of people just to get to her, abandoning her GF and child. Then because it's still not enough, you beat up and almost kill the girl who had already suffered way more than she herself ever did. And thats the Person I should emphasize with? Naa I won't. I hated Ellie in TLOU2"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,"I think it was mostly just paced wrong. Like Arby's Seattle story is completely detached from Ellie's, and I think that is the reason it's hard for some people to empathize with her. 

Like maybe instead of the plot of her becoming Lev's surrogate mother, Abby's storyline consists of her basically being caught in the wake of Ellie's vengeance. Instead of flashbacks to when she and Owen were dating, we get flashbacks of her and one of her friends showing why they're such good buddies, then have the gameplay section being her finding the bloody remains of that friend.

I think something along those lines would have solved a ton of issues for some people."

107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Eh, if you‚Äôre a family member of Guard #3, and he was killed while protecting what they *thought* would‚Äôve been the end of the Cordyceps, you‚Äôd be pretty pissed. The rest of the world isn‚Äôt Joel, they don‚Äôt care like he cares for Ellie, they care about their families. 

Revenge isn‚Äôt always reasonable or well thought out, take away a person‚Äôs loved ones and they might get a little unhinged. For instance, exactly what Joel does, he kills a lot of people who think they‚Äôre doing the right thing for a person he loves. I think they should‚Äôve humanized Abby first, then go into the unhinged, maybe make her dad some random fuck guard, and I think it would‚Äôve worked better."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"You say that about your relative, but they and those around them probably truly thought they could stop the Cordyceps. Especially if your dad was just a guard doing his job, if you heard some guy blew his brains out, you might be upset. If your dad is a doctor doing what think could fix shit, and a guy blows his brains out instead of knocking him out, you might be upset.
If your reaction is the same as Abby‚Äôs, you could say what they do to Joel is unreasonably cruel(it was), but she likely thought the same for what Joel did. Like I said, they could‚Äôve done it a lot better, like if her killing Joel was this spur of the moment thing, and you have Ellie go through that same revenge."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"I feel like that's a weird way to brush off Abby wanting revenge.

She didn't just have a relative die. She had her only parent, her father die because he was trying to save humanity. Sure what he was doing was wrong but so was Joel. It's all shitty. 

Abby wasn't even in the room to see what happened. From her perspective, Joel killed her dad, took off with Ellie, and doomed humanity. How does that make Abby unlikable for wanting revenge on Joel? It doesn't make her a good person but what would you want to do if you were her? 

And guess what, Ellie even tried to do the same thing when Abby kills her only parental figure. The only difference is she becomes the better person realizing that continuing the cycle of violence will just make her lose more of herself. That's what both Joel and Abby couldn't do without having something to love (Ellie and lev).

Like I get if you needed more to relate to Abby, but this is already like a 20+ hour game. It would've been too cramped imo."

4. the fireflies are domestic terrorists who regularly killed cops, random people, blew up checkpoints etc.

In the last mission Joel definitely domes a guard in the cutscene, proceeds to murder many others during the gameplay segment, kills the doctors, then finishes with Marlene. Joel was definitely as bad as portrayed in 2."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Yeah, I remember playing MGS2 and being surprised by the change in protagonist, and had trouble accepting it for a while, but it didn't bother me all that much because I didn't hate raiden lol. I guess I can say I respect naughty dog for taking big risks with their choices but at least for me it didn't pay off to make me play as the very person I wanted to destroy. I'm not really sure what the message of the game is either other than some generic ""cycle of violence is bad"" which I didn't need a game to tell me. Also the game is a contradiction because as a game it makes it fun to violently murder humans throughout its playtime."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,"Comparison barely works, as Raiden and snake are working towards the same goal, it‚Äôd be more like if after the Arsenal gear lore dump, the choking sequence and the whole ‚ÄúI made you into the broken person you are Raiden‚Äù thing the game then flashed back for another 6 hours of gameplay and made you play as Solidus and tried to make you empathize with him.

When your first proper introduction to a character is to make them horribly at odds with and generally responsible for the worst parts of the life of the character you‚Äôve been with for a whole game‚Äôs worth of play beforehand, liking the new character is an obscenely hard sell. Nearly the worst possible first impression you could give"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,">It didn't help that we had to essentially start from zero again weapons-wise and skill-wise.

That's the only part that really bothered me. Story-wise I thought the Abby section was fine and from a narrative perspective the ""go back to day 1 and see it from the other side"" thing can be a great technique, but in a game it felt like a punishment being robbed of all my character progression like that."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"It would have worked much better if you could finish Ellie's campaign, and then unlocked Abby's. 

The swap KILLED the pacing. That's my only complaint, the game was just too damn long."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Yeah, you kill people crying to their friends/mom/pregnant whatever but people draw the line at a beast trying to kill you lmao"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,yeeeahh forcing empathy often has the opposite effect.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"No it wasn't. It's amazing to me that people still think this. 

The game was trying to show you that both Abby and Ellie are every bit as bad as each other. They both mow through thralls of people to get to this one person they hate. 

In their mind, that is justified, because they have both been wronged. But in actual fact, they are both awful. Abby's friend Mel even spells it out to her when saying where she and her ex are going. 

She literally tells her what a piece of shit she is. Even her friends think that. You're not supposed to like her at all. It's trying to show you what revenge does to people and how it poisons everyone around you. 

Their awful actions are also reflected in the actions of the WLF and the Seraphites. Nobody in that game is the good guy. That's the point."

107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,And by rushing it they were just as likely to kill ellie and ruin any chance to figure out why she was immune.  Surgeon's actions were super immoral and irresponsible
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Not really glossing over it. That's literally just a thing they're claiming could happen without a single speck of evidence or reasoning behind it.

Maybe that's partially the game itself lacking good writing, but jumping straight to ""well guess it's time to kidnap her and open her up"" makes them both idiots and evil."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Thats because her friends killed Joel to and also supported abby during his toture. I'll give ellie that but still didn't like who she became either.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Ellie had to because the trauma of that scene made her see them jumping on Joel and deal with abby best for last for nothing.. honestly the story was mid..

Totally get you on the gags in this game though! I really liked how they toned Kratos down, he never cracks a joke but his stoic response kills me. When Ratatoskr was crawling around Kratos and he says ""What is happening"" killed me. Or when Brok saw Atreus for the first time and said ""What is this thing"" and Kratos replied ""That is my son"" was some of the funniest moment in all of God of War.

107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"I liked it. Games often rush that kind of development. It wouldn't have felt earned for Sindri to experience such loss and then repair his relationships in a few days in the endgame. And sometimes some things simply can't be smoothed over 

Even if Sindri does repair his relations with Kratos and boi, I don't think he should go back to the same charecter he was before. He should be permanently changed. And he honestly had a point about being taken advantage of"

The timing was done that way to make you continue playing to take the story to its conclusion, so you could see what happens to Ellie and Tommy"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"You aren't literally *forced*...You are only ""forced to feel"" in the way that you are with literally any other main character in any other story. Were we ""forced to feel"" a certain way about Joel and Ellie in Part 1? No, but by experiencing their story we eventually do. But Abby is the antagonist, and we don't have a relationship with her at the beginning of the game, so we naturally want to take Ellies side in the conflict. The only thing the story ask of you think about what happened objectively, and when you do, you realize that there is no correct ""side"" in their conflict. That's why I'm baffled. Is it really so hard for some people to put aside their bias towards Ellie and realize that Abby is no worse? Conventional wisdom tells us there are two sides to every story. So why was that so hard for people to accept?"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Incorrect. Ellie knows EXACTLY what they want to do and agrees with it. JOEL is the one that acted without consent. Ellie even says as much.

Also, because the WLF turned to murderous monsters. You see that throughout the entire game. The game goes through great lengths to subtly tell you Ellie is the bad guy, and Abby is the good one. They show you the WLF has turned bad, they show you through Abby‚Äôs actions compared to Ellie‚Äôs. They even show you through old school film tricks. When a movie wants to use shorthand to show you who the bad guy is, or who is not to be trusted, they have them ‚Äúkick the dog‚Äù. Basically, they hurt or kill an animal. Who hurts and kills several dogs, and who plays and hangs out with one?"

107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Let's start from where he picks up Ellie.

From that point, most players only killed the surgeon, picked up Ellie and just left the room. Then you're forced to escape from the other Fireflies since you're too busy holding Ellie, successfully leave the main building only to kill Marlene, before taking off. 

Killing the rest of the doctors and nurses was Druckmann's attempt for players to further sympathise with Abby."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"You say this like Joel is the antagonist when clearly he's not

They took all his equipment gave him no time shoved him around threatened him then were going to throw him our in the shit with without the gear he came with 

So essentially tried to kill Joel and disrespected both him and Ellie for zero reason"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"It was only forced perspective, empathy is always a choice. People still talk about hating her online.

Edit:

We‚Äôre going to go round in circles debating this game for years to come. It‚Äôll become easier if we try to talk about it more subjectively. And I‚Äôm at fault here too.

In my opinion, I was always given a choice in who to empathise with and when. It took me a very long time to feel for Abby. Personally I still enjoyed the game whilst being forced to play as someone I didn‚Äôt like. It was a new experience. I was pleasantly surprised at how much immersive emotion, different from other games, that was being imparted from this form of media.

I think the cost for this was too great for some. TLOU2 was filled with pain, I personally got great value from feeling that."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Well if you‚Äôre not going to naturally find empathy to another perspective, how else can you? Right?

I‚Äôm not defending the perspective of Abby either, I‚Äôm just merely looking at it from a storytelling / design structure. You killed doctors as Joel (canonically), and care deeply for Joel and Ellie, but having you just see Abby in cutscenes or whatever might not be enough for the player to detach from empathizing with Joel and Ellie.

It‚Äôs an interesting and definitely divisive experiment that ND played with. I still had a hard time giving into the fireflies recklessness, but I think it definitely forced the player to try and have a more clear mind when weighing overall motivations."

we're still here talking about it"

It's not ""forcing empathy"". It's changing perspectives. You guys are such dolts about this fucking game lol."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"It‚Äôs funny. I think I mostly agree beyond the fact that I wouldn‚Äôt really describe Ellie or Abby as ‚Äúbad‚Äù so much as ‚Äúcomplex and layered characters with some really dark traits and horrible decision making‚Äù. 

I was PISSED when the switch to Abby happens and thought, ‚ÄúAre we *really* going to do this ‚Äòboth sides‚Äô bullshit.?‚Äù  By the end I thought, ‚ÄúWell shit. They really stuck the landing on that one.‚Äù

I honestly liked that they tackled the moral complexity of the characters decision making and force the player to deal with philosophically interesting questions about what it means to be a ‚Äúgood guy‚Äù or even just a ‚Äúsurvivor‚Äù in a post apocalyptic world. 

I get that some folks simply aren‚Äôt interested in that. At times I was like, ‚ÄúCan I just kill some NPCs and not agonize over all my in-game decisions?‚Äù  But, ultimately, I like media that makes me think and *feel*.  TLOU2 is easily a top 10 title for me."

107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"That may be the point, but I'm not going to sympathize with someone who straight up tortured and murders Joel. I don't give a fuck what kind of person they are, you can't go from ""ambushing and the murder and slow torture of an old man"" to ""oh Abby has her reasons too."" 2 wrongs don't make a right, but Joel did what he had to do to save Ellie. Abby hunted, ambushed, murdered and tortured an old man who saved her. There's no comparison."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"I don‚Äôt disagree, Ellie and Abby are not exactly good people, but not quite evil either. My issue is with how the game presents these characters and the structure they chose to do it in."

I think you should probably stfu and listen to the writers. Feel free to have your own interpretation because art imo is open to that, but they very clearly have stated that the point is to make you hate Abby as much as possible and then try to bring you back. See the podcasts they released about the game."

it doesnt matter that they havent provided YOU with enough ""evidence"", the game itself says theres enough to believe theres a chance, so as far as the game is concerned, its true.  how you reconcile that with Joel/Ellie's actions is another story"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"I mean, she might be weak*er* than Abby but Abby is a monster and is a soldier so of course she's going to be the stronger of the 2. But I wouldnt say Ellie is weak."

Yes tlous2 did something different than most 3A story driven games but having problems with its story doesn't mean that it's because you don't get to play ""as the bad ass grizzled dude"" or whatever excuse you want to come up with.

Joel >!killed her father, who was actively trying to help the world!<, so it seems justifiable to want him to pay for that. Joel's crimes weren't justifiable at all. Ellie chose her fate with the fireflies to help people, it wasn't like she was kidnapped and he was protecting her. Joel acted selfishly and murdered people to that end, he wasn't a hero."

That was in 2014, the first game starts in 2033, so probably much much less than a single billion.

Regardless of all of that ""potential to save humanity"" stuff, Thags not abby's motivation. Nor would anacting her plan have any affect on those past events. It was revenge, I feel like you're missing the point of the second game if you think Abby's revenge was ""right"""

107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Personally I think it should have opened playing as young Abbie as the prologue, introduce her friends and show how similar her life is to Ellie  


As a person with limited time and too many good games to play I gave up on that game and just watched how it ended because I felt like they were beating me over the head with a super simple topic which had me saying ""yeah, I get it"" for hours and I just wanted to know what happened to the characters I was with"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"And that's where it fails because in the first game, Joel and Ellie were pretty much all we knew.

Then Part 2 not only throws in Joel's killer, you also have to PLAY as her. Playing as her AFTER already playing Joel and feeling strong attachments to his character, which millions of fans already developed since 2013. 

If anything your point is the only baffling thing here. You failed to see the very problem you unintentionally pointed out and made a total strawman to boot."

You easily could have played Abby‚Äôs story first and thought Joel and Ellie were the antagonists. That‚Äôs the point and what makes having to play as Abby in the middle of the game so amazing."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Why start at Ellie when the mission starts him in the Firefly building where he fights through dozens of armed guards before he even gets to Ellie in the operating room? Are we going to pretend that these armed guards don't matter and didn't have families?
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"By definition, Joel is a protagonist, cause y'know, hes the main character and you play him. Marlene would be the antagonist at the end since she opposes the protagonist.

Now whether Joel is a villain/bad person is another can of worms entirely and part of why many enjoyed the ending and overall story of TLoU."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,The writing and storyline definitely tried to make you empathize with her. It wasn't unbiased at all.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,"Thank you! I‚Äôve always been intrigued by the idea of a game making play as both the protagonist and antagonist and, while I didn‚Äôt love every story beat in TLOU2, I thought it was well done.

Just because the game is putting you in her shoes, humanizing her, and making her motives more well known *does not mean you have to like her.* In fact, the game works well to me precisely *because* you are uncomfortable undertaking her actions. The game is forcing you in an uncomfortable position making you fight Ellie and I thought that was an awesome artistic choice not really done before in games. It‚Äôs completely fine for the player to feel like you don‚Äôt want to be doing what the game is making you do - *that is the point.*

So yeah, I agree with you. You don‚Äôt have to like Abby and that is completely fine. I would probably agree there‚Äôs maybe too much time spent as her but I think it‚Äôs a good parallel to show the lengths she‚Äôs going through much like Ellie for similar reasons. But you can ultimately still not like her, root for her, or want her to succeed."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"It's typically why you don't change the perspective of your story to be from two sides - especially if one side is more heavily established already and has had more natural character growth.

If they wanted to do this story, they should have done it with the first game, make Joel actually BE Ellie's father. Then as the game goes on and we play as Abby, we learn about the lab, and joel, and her parents, etc. We haven't gotten too attached to these characters yet, so the door to empathy for the 'villain' in this case is still open. But instead, they kill a beloved character, force you to play his killer, and then try to make you empathize with her - even though she is poorly written and really has no likeable/redeeming characteristics to her. She's just a brute.

So Really they just chose the wrong game to do this 'experiment' of story telling in. There was little-to-no chance people were going to like Abby."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"I hated it, thought it was preachy, but then I actually bought it. Became one of the best experiences I've had, gaming or not."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"I'm an extremely empathetic person.

Abby was forced and cruel and showed no redeeming qualities to her character to make me want to give her a chance. 

I honestly don't see what people found about her to empathize with besides losing her parents."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,But Abbys father got what he deserved for trying to kill a child. This makes it hard to have empathy for Abby trying to avenge her fathers deserved death.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"I like this. TLOU took the protagonists you love and put you in the shoes of someone they totally were the antagonist for. It was such a perspective shift. Initially playing as Abby you have this ‚Äúew, this sucks‚Äù reaction and over the course of the narrative eventually you come to the realization that each character has layers that make them more nuanced and less cut and dry as the good or bad guy. 

As an aside, I hate when people critical of TLOU2 say ‚Äúthey should have done X‚Äù. Nah bro, write your own stories if you are such an expert in storytelling. TLOU2 was a masterclass in storytelling. It made me feel things - not all of them good things - and that is art."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Clearly my comment is an opinion. Aren‚Äôt all our comments opinions?
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Which brings us right back around to my original comment - the game insisted that several things were true even when they were observably not the case, and it felt more like forced moralization than gameplay.

Moreover, it's absolutely not the case that the game is ""implying"" there's a chance. Certainly the Fireflies were insisting on that, but the game itself doesn't address it otherwise. Really, the entire ethical crux of the first game was that there *wasn't* really any proof it could succeed, and you just had to end up trusting people."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Shes 130 soakin wet at most? Her strength has always been her character and intelligence. phyiscal Str is very much her dump stat.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"It‚Äôs not about playing as a women or not. You may have misunderstood my comment. 

You say that and yet transistor and Metroid are both extremely simple stories that have very little complexity at all. 

Don‚Äôt even get me started on how something can ‚Äúpretend‚Äù to be complex. It either is or isn‚Äôt. 

And I can certainly say there are very few video game narratives that are even close to as complex as TLOU2."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Is it?
I disagree."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Ellie was a child. She's not a good age to consent to suicide. Protecting ones 'child' is considered one of the most base instict in the animal kingdom. Cycle of vengence does not include the village. A single person will be consumed by it but ur friends will not follow u into the jaws of death.

For the record ellie behavior was also completely devoid of logic and was a simple copy cat of abbys."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Yes, please explain to us more how murdering children for the greater good deserves sympathy."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Ok? So get ur self and everyone u know killed over it? Never mind the 'cure' was standing right next him as u killed him. 

They should of made ellie the focus and joel just got in the way and abby just wanted a personal vengence on the side. If they did it that way abby story would of be so much better. That would of justified it to ur audience instead of the terrible plot they did. 

Last of us had good plot and character interactions

Last of us 2 had terrible plot and good character interactions. The plot kills it."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Excusing murdering children for the greater good. nice.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Here, here! I probably will try it the other way when I play again."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"There‚Äôs the fact that groups of enemies are annoying to fight and bosses are way too easy, beating the final 3 bosses in 3,3 and 1 tries on the hardest difficulty felt underwhelming (but that‚Äôs for the course for the whole ending)"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,Same
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,">Personally I think it should have opened playing as young Abbie as the prologue, introduce her friends and show how similar her life is to Ellie

1) Quick level/cutscene of Abbie and her Dad on the night of zombie's starting (similar to how TLOU 1 started)

2) Quick Abbie mission as a teen/kid/whatever, where the ending is her getting to the hospital.

3) Start the game basically where it was from here.

The problem I had with the narrative was that we had Abbie framed as the ""bad guy"" until the point where we switch characters. Think it  would've been easier to empathize with her if we had her origin before Joel's death. Would leave the morality of the rest of the story a bit more ambiguous."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"I think this is a game much more about the journey and experiencing yourself than the ending. That‚Äôs what makes it so unique to me. I have a friend that read the plot instead of playing it and I fully believe it changes how you‚Äôd feel about it. I would try to pick it up sometime, there‚Äôs no game that‚Äôs done a story like this better (that I know of)"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"And it seems like you're missing my reply for some reason.

We get it that Abby felt justified to avenge her dad's death, it doesn't change the fact that you shouldn't expect everyone to like it. There's a good reason why millions did not like having to play Abby, especially after how the story was presented."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Exactly, thank you! The phenomenon of haters around this game is truly bizarre. It's like they made up their minds before they even played it and simply refuse to see it for what it is. I played part 1 for the first time right before part 2 came out, then immediately played part 2. That was such an amazing experience and it sucks to see people so eager to hate on for the strangest reasons."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Oh you mean the people trying to kill him that stole all of his gear to throw him out so he would die? Yeah clearly Joel is in the right here lmao
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Not saying they didn't matter, just that they were actual threats to Joel, unlike those present in the theatre."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"I mean the antagonist of the situation not the game Joel is clearly not a good man as we can see from his past and his brother splitting from him and joining the fireflys.

Except its very clear cut if you take notice of the state of the fireflys the state of the buildings and 1 of the voice recorders plus the treatment of Joel and Ellie that he is not the bad guy"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Yeah it was very contrived.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"It tries to make you empathize with her which is not the same as sympathizing with her, and critics don't want to admit it but it's very in line with the first game. 

The larger point of the first game was that people's morals are completely perverted by their drive to survive and so all these different communities have gone to further and further lengths to ""protect"" their own people while from joel/ellie's perspective they're just monsters. But Joel is literally the same, and so are the fireflies, and at times in his life so was Tommy. Ellie is a kid because being a kid gives her an innocent perspective of events.

In TLOU2 they flip it, through Abby's perspective she deludes herself that it was justifiable to do what she did because Joel was the monster, and so its again justifiable for Ellie because Abby was the monster.

You as the player just have the ironic perspective of knowing what the cost of all this shit is and who Ellie and Abby are/were. 

I get that some people don't care for the game which is fine but the idea that it is somehow ridiculous or contrived that 2 people see themselves as justified while the other is a monster is hardly reasonable imo.

Fun fact literally the prologue of TLOU immediately draws attention to this with Joel insisting they keep driving and don't help the family with the small child, insisting that it isn't their problem and ""someone else will come"""
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,[deleted]
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Lmao what? Abby is one of the most morally duplicitous characters in the whole game the fuck?
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Joel was already a very father-like figure though no? Dunno if it needs to be that literal. I don‚Äôt think that would make it any better or worse. Joel losing Sarah was such a character defining moment for him in the first place, and caused his internal struggle while dealing with Ellie. Made that character dynamic that much more interesting.

I dunno, game happened. Some liked it. Some didn‚Äôt. I thought it was an interesting experiment to get people talking, even to this day lol."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Nobody let this dude read anything by Cormac McCarthy.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,here's the real question: would you play the last of us 3?
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Disagree. I think it's executed near perfectly. The point is for you to be experience what it's like to be the main character - Ellie, and then for you to be forced to come to terms with the awful things Ellie does. It's extremely challenging to the user, because we don't like to think of ourselves and the main character we love as awful, but they are. This wouldn't work if we'd sympathized with Abby from the start. She needed to be seen as a villain for it to be turned on its head.

I would also note that Ellie does way, way worse shit than anything Abby has ever done. And it's amazing that she largely gets a pass simply because she's the one we see as on our side.

Some people don't like being challenged and I get that. However, personally, I think challenging art is what's ultimately most valuable."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Alternatively, TLU2 could have been Abby‚Äôs story right up to her meeting with Joel. They hand waved her entire history, and that history between Ellie and Joel is what connected us to them. 

Then, release TLU3 as a choice: play as Abby or Ellie and choose to kill or forgive as the player wishes. Yeah that‚Äôs more development time, but fans were willing to wait years for TLU2, and the hype before launch was pretty high."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"I experienced her as yet another Joel. They conveyed that with things like her overall combat style, weapons/tools available to her, and with the obvious comparison of taking in and becoming attached to and protective of a younger character. 

The major difference, IMO, is with Joel you only heard about the horrors he committed later, whereas with Abby you watched her do them to you personally."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,What about when she repeatedly risked her life to save Yara and Lev?
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,I'm not sure you're as empathetic as you think you are...
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Hard disagree. I found her far more enjoyable to play as than Ellie and as a person is much more redeemable.

Personally, that I really enjoy that people had such different takeaways. Good art should challenge would, and that's exactly what the game does."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Loads of people shit themselves over the fact that the game has a diverse cast and characters. I‚Äôd heard so much negative reaction to the game that I was afraid that they‚Äôd bailed on doing a good story in favor of doing diversity, but I personally found it all to be quite natural and not contrived. 

People can like or dislike whatever works for them. I‚Äôm not over here trying to convince anyone to like it. But I did enjoy it exactly as it is."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Hmm maybe I missed something then, you say it's ""observably not the case"" that Ellie's operation would work... which part indicated that?"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,">Protecting ones 'child' is considered one of the most base instict in the animal kingdom.

You know whats also a staple in the animal kingdom? Eating the ""childs"" if there is no food and the group depends on that to live

Like the first game ending is supossed to nuanced and you can argue both sides as being eight from their perspective but it seems most people just saw Joel as a gigachad on a rampage to protect a kid from evil mad scientists lmao"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Because you save every living child and future kids from the misery of the apocalypse, id like to see you guys in that situation, 99% of the people you ever knew dead, all the little cities and communities falling off to madness, hunger or the clickers, im sure all of you would stand up to save a random unknown kid because ""evil"" doctors"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,I find it ironic you think killing hundreds if not thousands to save one life is noble. I'm not even a utilitarian in the classic sense and I know that's fucking stupid.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,"All the mainline story bosses are too easy.  Then they make some of the optional bosses ridiculously hard (ok, usually the ones with multiple enemies)."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,"100% agree this would have been great showing the parallels between them before the game makes the player hate Abbie  


Maybe I'm alone in this but there's the scene when Ellie is forced to kill a dog then when you're playing Abbie the game makes you feel like a monster for killing the dog, but there was literally no way around it  


It feels manipulative to force a player to do a thing then make the player feel like shit for doing the thing you forced them to do, if a game is going to do that it should be for something you have agency to control not something they forced you to do"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"But the story has been told many times.

[The story in a nutshell.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge)"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"I don‚Äôt expect everyone to like it, I think there‚Äôs a nice group of people that couldn‚Äôt get past Joel dying no matter what. One of the braver moves in a game medium that I can think of tbh, and it‚Äôs a shame some people are too emotionally stubborn to expand on those emotions throughout the game."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Been a long time gamer, played TLoU on release day. I've played hundreds of other games. Well written stories and the like.

I played this for a bit until I was forced to play Abby, then lost interest. I'm an adult with my own problems and things to do. When I sit down to play a videogame, I don't want to play a character who is intentionally unappealing.

It's not like this almost exact story hasn't been told before.

rEvEnGe Is A vIcIoUs CyClE. Yup, heard that one before, now let me go shoot the people I don't like because I have to be up in the morning. No? Cool, I'll pass."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,I thought it was brilliant. I went from simply hating her to understanding her more. One of the best and hardest games to play.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"They're talking about *trying* to force empathy, not actually saying they were forced to internally empathise."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Gonna have to disagree with you there. I feel like it was agenda influence. But to each their own. Abby was just a poor character overall for me, and not someone who can really be empathized with if you played the first game."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"You missed my point - I was saying that if this was the first time (I.e. the first game) we were seeing Ellie and Joel, then we wouldn't have as much attachment and therefore be more open to empathizing with Joels killer when we have to play as her - we'd be more confused and trying to figure out why she did what she did to this person we didn't know but clearly meant a lot to the other character we play. 

I agree that Sarah was a major point for Joel and it made him very easy to empathize with. and that is why it's so soul-crushing to see him murdered by Abby, and why it's so jarring and aggravating to have to play as her for people. 

Personally I don't think the game deserves half the awards it got. nor deserves the word-of-mouth it has garnered. But here we are, talking about it. I'm gonna end it here."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,No.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Yeah, that's all great, but I don't want to spend 60$ for an unenjoyable experience. i don't care how artsy or deep it is - if it's designed to be depressing and you expect me to pay for the experience, I'm not going to have nice things to say about it."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,"In TLOU part 1, Joel murders completely innocent doctors who are trying to save the world, which include Abby‚Äôs father, and the player bears immediate witness to this.

Abbey seeks revenge on Joel for not only killing her father but also single handedly dooming the world for his selfish prospects.

It‚Äôs for this reason I never hated Abby, because Joel is OG absolutely shit human. I understand why he did what he did, but you can‚Äôt help but feel bad about it. 

How can we possibly put Joel on a pedestal and demonize Abby? Peoples seething hatred for a character that is only RESPONDING to an evil man‚Äôs prior atrocity is extremely strange to me.

Not calling you out specifically, your comment just evoked this thought from me haha"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Aside from killing Joel, and the cultists that is at war with her group, what horrors does she commit? Especially compared to Ellie?"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"I am Empathetic to a point. When you start smashing in the face of someone I care about with a golf club, I kind of don't care about your feelings anymore."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,And I disagree that TLOU2 was art. To me it was a torture porn and a political message with an established following to profit from. It was propaganda if anything to me. Sure that's gonna go over well with reddit.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"All these people downvoting these very rational responses are probably the same people that think Aloy would look prettier if she smiled more, and that her proportions weren‚Äôt feminine enough."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"The fact Abbys dad rushed Ellie into surgery without her consent means he deserved what he got

""But Ellie wanted it""

That's not a reason to rush her into surgery without getting her consent or letting her say goodbye to a father figure she has bonded with."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,I feel like this guy played a completely different game then we did lol.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"No, first of all there is no proof the cure would even work. There is no proof the cure wouldn't be abused as a weapon to create a dictatorship. Or that the industrial capacity existed to create enough of it.   


There is no proof that Ellie is the only immune one 

Then what, you gonna distribute it among everyone for free? Walk up to warbands and give them the cure? Yea right.   


There is no proof the cure would save anyone.   


All you did was just excuse the murder of an innocent young girl because a terrorist organisation said so.   


You gonna defend what the nazis did next with their bio research?"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,"This game has you as the main character in all four parts of your linked cycle, that‚Äôs the interesting point. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs never been done but I certainly can‚Äôt recall a game that did it as well as this"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Can you blame them? Especially after having strong attachments since 2013 to a character who started out losing a daughter to the cruel world and that it left a Sarah-sized hole in his heart for twenty years, only for that hole to be patched by Ellie? I think something like having Abby's backstory be presented *before* Joel's killing alone would have helped a lot."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,"I don't blame anyone for wanting to feel simple, pleasant escapism while gaming. But that's why multiple genres exist in all mediums. 

You don't *need* to watch Chernobyl, or The Road, or The Pianist, but they're still valid stories which are worth telling. Even if they're so disturbing and unpleasant that many people would rather watch The Sound of Music, or Top Gun: Maverick. I think that diversity in genre-fiction is crucial and video-games will never be entirely respected as a narrative medium if we insist that every game needs to be Uncharted (tonally). 

I also wouldn't say that ""revenge is vicious cycle"" is the primary theme of the game. 

It's more of an exploration of **hate** in all it's form. Part 2 explores hate from every perspective, and on every narrative scope - from its literal/main plotting, to its metaphorical subtext, and minor stories told through found-objects. It talks about revenge, prejudice (religious, gender, racial and sexual orientation), war, political schism, jealousy and personal resentments. The WLF vs Scar conflict is  the biggest macrocosm of that theme."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,I'm glad you enjoyed it however I can easily see how people wouldn't at the same time.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"I would understand why people would hate on this game more if it wasn‚Äôt for the fact that they also closed the story of Joel and Ellie perfectly. You can tell a lot of people never finished the game as soon as they played as Abby, because everyone thinks the story of Joel just ends at Abby meeting him. 

No spoilers, but everything needed to be said between Joel and Ellie *was* said. There was an end, and it worked so well because you know Joel saw it coming. He knows what he did, and it weighed on him. Joel stopped the world for salvation to give Ellie a choice, and Abby was what the world became from his actions; Vengeance, war, and brutality. 

Abby was inevitable, and her perspective was a way to show that she wasn‚Äôt an unknown face of consequence, but one of the many lives changed from one man‚Äôs act to save a little girl. A view of the world and loss of life outside of the perfect Jackson bubble Joel would spend the rest of his life peacefully in. I thought it was well done."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Yep. By far the best game of the last console gen. The story was demanding but felt authentic. I‚Äôm just glad they left the first scenes with her as from Ellie‚Äôs perspective. Having that scene play out from Abby‚Äôs would have been just too much.
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Yeah for me it was the opposite, it went from a very bland generic revenge game to suddenly play as the ""villain"" the first hour playing as her felt awful but In the end I feel like I liked abby story more than Ellie tbh"

No. But the idea that you *cannot* empathize with her is incorrect. *You* can‚Äôt, which is fine. Others can.

Abby certainly grew on me. The writers made many bold decisions, none of which ruined the game for me. As others have claimed happened for them."

107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Oh! Okay yeah for sure if this was the first game, it would have had to be structured / framed differently. I think that's why things were done the way they were though.

I think ND wanted you to be mad and then overcome that over time. I think it worked for some, and less for others. Sometimes it's just too hard to detach, but there's nothing wrong with that."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"That's the one amazing thing about The Last of Us 2. It somehow made us think it's acceptable to kill one person over another despite Joel selfishly killing Abby's father to save Ellie.

At the end of the day, **Joel and Ellie are both awful people, they were always awful people, even in the first game.** *I hated playing as both because the game didn't give me a choice not to be an asshole. I did not want to shoot that doctor at the end, I was hoping for some alternate solution to the problem, but the game forced my hand, and it felt awful.* ***This is also why watching Joel die at the start of the game felt justified.*** **Because it was.**

That same thing can't be said about Abby, and her only falling grace was going to a dark place and seeking revenge after having her father taken from her, but even she realized how far she fell afterward and never felt quite good about her actions. And in some ways redeemed herself by not killing Ellie's pregnant friend, something even Ellie succumbed to.

The Last of Us is an exceptionally compelling narrative experience. Honestly, the real issue with the game is the lack of depth and innovation on the gameplay mechanic side of things. Lacking combat mechanics, piss-poor AI, and basic puzzles that tend to solve themselves.

*I'll probably get downvoted for sharing this opinion, but y'all motherfuckers need to think for yourselves before parroting whatever someone else says.*"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,okay you better not if you do i'll know
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Idk thats what I expect from an apocalypse +18 game, a depressing as fuck world, tlou2 is grimdark if you dont like the genre its okay, you can watch marvel or Disney or play some ubisoft games where morality always wins"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Some people like experiences that challenge them. Some like experiences that are easy. Both are totally fine - you're allowed to like what you like.

It's no worse a game because they are catering to the former group, just like pokemon is no worse because it caters to the latter."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-10,"Nope, I completely agree! I think it's a pure emotional reaction without any real inspection; Joel is certifiably not a good man, the original goes to pretty great lengths to make that obvious to us. 

Abby being used as a vessel to challenge our prejudicial sense of who we care for in this world and the reasons behind it was a pretty cool choice IMO."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"I'm saying that, for the players perspective, killing joel in front of you (ellie) is *more* heinous than all of the stories joel has from his past, but still carries an analogous role for each, i.e. they did things they weren't proud of and have reformed as people.  

To be clear, I'm not saying they have 1:1 equivalent pasts."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,Same with Abby lol. Joel killed her father first. That's the whole point...
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Art has always had political messages. All of the most celebrated pieces of art ever created contain political stances and beliefs. Almost always being pushed for profit. Hell, everything you just said describes Citizen Kane, the most celebrated movie of all time. Just because you disagree or don't like art, doesn't mean it stops being that.

Art is simply creative expression. Video games will always be art - every single one of them. Whether you like it or not."
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Oh this is definitely part of the moral dilemma behind the whole situation and part of the whole ""lot of grey"" comment I made

But this doesn't indicate the Operation wouldn't have worked, which is what I'm looking for"
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,I legit have no idea what he's talking about lol
107eyp4,2023-01-09,2023-01-09,"Your argument is full of straw men. No proof they wouldn‚Äôt find the cure and be able to distribute it easily either. Nothing burger. 

Ellie not being the only immune one is impossible to  test as infection has a 100% mortality rate. Best of luck trying to find volunteers, let alone another one immune. Ellie was already proven to be immune. 

Then you‚Äôre conflating a video game with real life villains. But let‚Äôs think about it for the sake of argument. Did the nazis ever have a guaranteed immune case that they were experimenting on for a 100% mortality illness? No? Then fuck off with your comparison. Trying to imply I‚Äôd agree with fuckin nazis. 

All in all your only argument seems to be ‚Äúmuh daughter, muh feelings‚Äù. And while this admittedly is a strong argument there is only emotion behind it, not logic. Better to just admit that and move on.

Funnily enough I find the most people that hate on 2 but love 1 were the ones who felt Joel did the right thing, and this is why they are so angry at Abby as they feel Joel did not deserve what he got. Sorry pal, he did. He did an extremely evil thing for selfish reasons. No amount of straw men or bad caught arguments I e saying I‚Äôd condone nazis will ever justify it."

And in the unlikely event that that game ships as a glitchy and unfinished mess, we‚Äôll know who is at least partially responsible for pressuring Sony to get the thing out the door before some arbitrary year-end deadline."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,I‚Äôll def pick it up on PC in a year or soüòÅ. Am really into GOW 2018 on PC now.

vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,I thought this was a StarGate SG1 release for a second.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Weird thought but anyone else randomly think this looked like a Stargate at first? Big standing blue-ish circle with glyphs around the outside edge... Kratos gonna be fighting the Goa'uld.

vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Great. The 378 people with a PS5 will play the shit out of it.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,September is only a couple of months away though. So...
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"This would be obvious if Americans followed the rest of the world. Someone please enlighten me, does this mean November or September?"
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"We've had the PS5 release date sure.

What about 2nd release date, for PC ?"

vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,Would be better if it was available on PC
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"AND its on ps4! I thought I was gonna have to seek out a PS5, but it looks like I once again have no reason to do that."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,What system will this be on? Might break down and buy one

vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,Announcing the release date 3 months in advance? Seems late
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,Almost every single big game got a delay these last 2 years. How can everyone in these comments be deceived by this release date so easily
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,This is why YYYY-MM-DD is the only format we should all use.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,For now
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,The eleventh of September. Nice.

vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,Is this an american date or a rest of the world date? I.e september or november?
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,11th of August ain't to long to wait & then i remembered i live in Scotland & this comes out in fucking November!
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,Is this an American date (mm/dd/yyyy) or a rest of world one?

vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,YESSS SEPTEMBER ELEVEN
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,NO PC - so it's not a release and thus don't care.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,September 11th. Nice.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"‚ÄúAlright, I guess let‚Äôs go into the turtle now. Like a couple of nerds in a nerd story.‚Äù"

vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"It‚Äôs fucking made with an engine for the PS4, the  ps5 will have an upgraded version like the upgrade of gta, small differences.  Imagine if they focused the game on next gen only holy shit, that‚Äôs why fuck Sony"
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"Previous one was overrated.   
GOW 3 set the bar too high i guess.   
Graphics and especially the Mortal Kombat Ninjas colors bosses were boring af.   
Combos were brainless, it was just Batman where everything is auto, just tapping 1 button. 

But i guess new generation love 3rd person view with literally same narrative gameplay (Hellblade/ResidentEvil). Can't blame SM for this, it sells...cause it is the 1 game type that newgen can handle."

vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,Guess I won't send my nude photos after all
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"09, 00:00, 2022, 11."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,Yessss
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,I'd be more excited if I could find a PS5
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,Hell yea lessssssgoooo
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"For just a moment, I thought this was Stargate"
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,I‚Äôd love for this to be on Xbox one day
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,I‚Äôm so excited to see this game!!!!
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,Is this an american or european date?
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"I have a wedding to go to on that day 

p a i n"
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,is this American or British time?
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,They should delay it just see how many heads explode
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,Yes boy
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,Nice! Happy Birthday to me then.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"Ooh, I like this logo!"
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"So...nobody gunna talk about the game coming out on a Wednesday, and not the normal Tuesday/Friday? Just me? Okay. Odd release day. I like it though, guarantees something to look forward in the middle of the week."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,Hella. Can‚Äôt wait. I just got PS5 too!
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Does anyone know if this is the last game in the series or are they making the Norse pantheon a trilogy as well?
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,I hope the release date is intentional
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,A lot earlier than I thought
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"I am so pumped for this. This is the only series I've ever preordered, I've been a fan since the original."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"Yesss! I‚Äôm so excited, excuse me while I go and play the last game again."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,I am so excited for it!
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,the logo reminds me of stargate and just makes me disappointed that there isn't a good stargate video game
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,On my birthday no less!
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Fuck midterms
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,I was so convinced it would be releasing on PC since the last one is on steam....back to inhaling copium I guess
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,About damn time!!!
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,I hope they nail the Thor matchup.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"I will be getting the collectors edition, but I am bummed that they wont be including a physical copy of the game : ("
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Can't wait for more god of war 4
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Yeaaaaaa
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Is there a legit trailer yet?
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,I‚Äôve owned the first one for a few years now. I should probably start it soon.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Stargate: Ragnarok
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Fuck yes!! I know I‚Äôm taking those days off
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,AHHHH I CANT WAIT
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,As a Canadian I‚Äôm confused by the date format. Is this November 9 or September 11?
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,11th of September LETS GOOOOO
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,I am now at the maximum stage of erect
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Here's hoping the PC release isn't as long as the first one.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"Is this the international ad or the us ad.

Sept 11th launch or 

Nov 9th?"
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,For everyone outside the US its November.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Is this game PS5 exclusive?
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Stargate?
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,11 Sep. nice
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Can‚Äôt wait hopefully they release for PC too
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"Nice, thats my birthday."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Please please please let me be able to find a PS5 before this drops!!!
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Now I just need a ps5.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,I thought it was scheduled to release in December guess that‚Äôs a good thing that it was pushed earlier
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"Nice, I just started playing the first one on PC"
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Yeeeeeee
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Cannot wait!!! üòÅüòÅ
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Coom
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Finally can't wait
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,That is a lot sooner than I expected:0
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Glad I finally managed to get a ps5 for retail. This is like the only game I'm excited for.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,boy oh boyyyy.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,GET IN THE BOAT BOY!
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Guess I should finally finish the previous game this August then. I stopped playing right after I got a certain weapon.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,That date is gonna raise lots of questions
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Wow that's pretty soon!
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,So now I just have to find a PS5.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"Weird thing to say at this point, probably considering time already spent, I'm comfortable waiting until 2023 for this.

This is a triple A game, and I just don't want horror stories after this comes out of people dying and quitting from over work"
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Doesn‚Äôt matter. I won‚Äôt have a ps5 by then anyway.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Is it fucking September or fucking November?
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Ah shit I forgot I was playing God of war
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Was really hoping it would come out next year so Elden Ring would get game of the year and God of war get it next year
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"lol at first i thought its on my bday septemper 11th but than i realised its american date, in EU its 9/11/2022"
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,11 september? Or 9 november?
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Wait a minute‚Ä¶ THIS YEAR?!
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,I hope the PC release is soon after.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"The only ones gods care about is themselves. So this is my vow, all gods will die!"
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Is that September or November??
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"That's so soon, whaaaaat?????"
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"Fuck yeah! Fuck no, still no ps5!  Fuck no , starfield delay!"
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Perfect date doesn‚Äôt exsist..
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,2026 or 2027 for pc port? üëâüëà
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,That poster looks like the Awaken My Love album cover. I can't unsee it now.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Did they still go with fat kratos?
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Thought it was the MGM lion logo
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,The small teaser looked so cool.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Chevron 8 ‚Ä¶ locked!
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,11/09 umm interesting
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,11th of September lets gooo.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,My 5 Year count till I can play it has started.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"That awkward moment when you mistake the title as ""Thor: Ragnarok""."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"i dont have  PS  
üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠  


wish i can play in my PC  
but they r not releasing in PC"
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Hopefully the PS5 will be available by then.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Is this September or November?
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Is this DD/MM OR MM/DD?
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,whoaaaa its releasing on my bday what a coincidence
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Eh idk why but I'm not even hyped.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,September Or November?
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"So, is it out in September or November?"
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,the game of the year award will be a battle between two giants
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Is this American date or European???
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"The date is OK, nothing about it, like at all"
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,11th of September or the 9th of November??
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Sorry I‚Äôm British‚Ä¶ is that Sep or Nov?
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,It‚Äôll end up on PC in 3 months after release so what‚Äôs the point of releasing it exclusively on playstation to begin with. Getting a bit sick of seeing this happen
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Only another few years before it comes to PC and I can play it. I actually really enjoyed the last GoW game (on pc)
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Cries in European (probably 9th of November yeah?)
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Is it September or November? I hate that the world has different ways of writing the same date in different places...
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Now I just need a PS5
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Will the digital delivery for PS5 be included if I install the PS4 version via disc?
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"Does anyone else have a bad feeling about this? Sequels are hard man

I want it to be good tho, fingers crossed."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Will it be available on PC??
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"Im excited for you PlayStation folk, sadness me that i wont be able to play it"
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,I was thinking 'holy shit in September already??' but quickly realized USA's date format is whack.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,This is September right? please tell it is and not November... can't wait to play this
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Can't wait to play it in September
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Gaaahhh!! I'm gonna say BOI soo many times
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,LET'S GOOOOOO
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,Let‚Äôs devour the gods togethaaaaaa
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"*Random Destiny fan wanders by.* You called for godslayers? Aight, I‚Äôm game."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,If you go to media blackout now; you won‚Äôt hear when it‚Äôs inevitably delayed to Spring 2023.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,so before they dropped a date you were happy to watch potential spoilers? is there some kind of rule that nobody can spoil anything *before* theres a release date?
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Better late than never i guess.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,God damnit I thought September was too good to be true
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Freaking usa ans their special Date format..
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,threw me off so badly at first and then I realised. those 2 extra months just made me depressed
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,November...
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"I don't even remember who won GOTY last year.

It's just so insecure when people act like this. Like, some people really only care about reviews and awards when it already conforms to their own opinions.

Regardless of whoever wins GOTY, people should play both Elden Ring and GOW because they both are great games. (I mean I assume Ragnorok will be good)."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,Literally every gaming media outlet does their own game of the year. Both games will take home a ton.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"As a fan of both, sales will probably dictate who will win GOTY and since GoW is a console exclusive, I think Elden Ring will get it.

Elden Ring sold 12 million copies within 3 weeks."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,Isn't it releasing too late to be considered for this year's GOTY
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"GoW was a reimagining of a franchise that completely changed the feel and gameplay, while having an amazing story.  It was a masterpiece.  I don't think there is a universe where the next GoW could possibly be compared to the first one, no matter how good it is.  It could be the most amazing experience ever, but will still be reiterating on the last games mechanics.    


Elden ring has changed the game, and I think that is what makes for a GOTY.  For the next 5 or 10 years, we will be seeing devs incorporate the lessons of ER, in the same way that devs will be incorporating the lessons of the last GoW game.    


I won't be butt hurt either way, I thought GoW was one of the most amazing games I have played, but this is ER's year, I would put money on it."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,They don't consider games released in the 4th qtr for goty this year I thought? So elden ring shouldnt be up against it
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,People still care about some award at an award show. Don‚Äôt understand why
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,[deleted]
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,If its anything like GoW 2018 itll have too many movie game elements to win goty
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"god of war will win GOTY simply because it released later in the year, i mean i'd say no matter how good ragnarok is elden ring deserves the GOTY but recency bias will probably give god of war a unanimous win"
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"It's ultimately a hype contest if GoWR is better than previous one which I think it definitely will be. If GoWR executes successfully then both of these games are worthy imo.

But if it comes down to the hype contest then I don't see GoWR winning"
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"I literally can't do anything in Elden Ring :( 

I die constantly."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"I'm just glad, crazy Sony fans will stop sending dick pictures to the people at Sony Santa Monica demanding a release date."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,And some of us who enjoys both sit back and laugh.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,Add also them complaining about how there is a black character
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"What drama? Sony has the Game Awards and the puppet who runs it in the bag. Not only GOW will win, Horizon will be a nominee and  they will find a way for the last of us part 1 to win a bunch of awards too, hell it will probably spark a category, ""remaster of the year""."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,Gonna be a helluva toss up between the two. Fuck me.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Elden ring was the first game to surpass Call of Duty in sales in years it deserves to win
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Imagine what a sad life you'd have to lead to get impassioned about that...
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"Man, am I the only one who thinks dying light 2 has a chance."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,I think Elden Ring will take it by a fair margin. It blew up beyond all expectations.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,Indeed
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,unscheduled off world activation!
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,I'm disappointed how far i had to scroll to find this reference.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,I see what you did there
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,Should have stolen that 11.11.22 that Starfield was supposed to have.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"Thank you, wasn't sure if this was freedom time or not."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,Shouldn't it be September 11th based on 11.09.2022?
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Right on!
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,11 september\*
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,[deleted]
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,Not our fault your dates are wrong.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,So true.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,Is it next gen only?
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,November
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,I am American and I was wondering the same because I didn't know who was developing. Damn Americans
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,Basically 9 11
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"I was asking the same, but I realized no studio in their right mind would release a game on September 11th."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"Am American, and hate this date format.  It's why I always use 09NOV22.  No confusion."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,">we‚Äôll know who is at least partially responsible for pressuring Sony to get the thing out the door

This line of thinking needs to die a fiery death. This is not how businesses work."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"If Sony releases a game early due to random tweets, then it's Sony who is responsible for that mistake.

I doubt any major gaming company is bowing to twitter pressure to release games early lol"
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"Nobody is pressuring sony. If its released a buggy glitchy mess then that's on the devs management for lying about how long dev time should be and sony for not giving them enough time. They don't have to tell us anything, sometimes saying nothing is better"
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,It's definitely not coming to PC in a year or so. Maybe 4
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"It will be, I'm thinking 2 years - yes previous exclusives took longer, but then that was before Sony made it blindingly obvious they had a focus on PC now too."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"I was really excited for a second! Nothing against GoW, just not a action game guy."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"My first thought was Awaken, My Love album cover."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,I think that‚Äôs fenrir
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,It's November 9th
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"I was asking the same, but I realized no studio in their right mind would release a game on September 11th."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"It took years before GOW 2018 came to PC, most likely because exclusivity is a big deal to Sony, so I wouldn't anticipate a PC release for quite a while."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"2-4 years later, maybe"
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,Yeah it really is too bad that Playstation has opted to not port their games until years later. Definitely a business level decision in favor of exclusives rather than a technical one too.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"I assume it's American dates, so 9th November 2022, rather than 11th September 2022"

vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,Its November.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,I'd guess 2025
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,It's November 9th
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"It will he, a year later"
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"I mean Sony Santa Monica is an American company, so it just makes sense to use their date format.

Edit : imagine people getting angry over date formats"
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,The why do you lot celebrate the 4th of July and not July 4th?
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,Or you could say 'The 9th of November 2022'
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,Yeah.. Thats not how we all speak it either.

vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,Recommend playing the 2018 one first
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,It will. They won‚Äôt do a day 1 launch on both PS and PC. They‚Äôre still promoting their consoles above just game sales
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,3 months?
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Neither. November 9
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,Sony has delivered as many as they could and for a while outpaced ps4 sales. But no console has ever released in a time when the whole world was forbidden from going outside. Chip manufacturers are still behind and there wont be any relief for at least 2 more years then in the 3rd year all 3 new facilities should be up and running in the US.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"Not from their perspective....they have sold consoles as fast as they can make them, how is that bad for them?"
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"God of War: Not Ragnarok even though this game is about Ragnarok and a character is very closely tied to the mythology, but nevermind, let's not call call this Ragnarok, just to satisfy mrcydonia."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,Sony's games tend to be pretty good in terms of being playable on release.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,You're complaining because it can cater to two Sony systems?
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"Sounds to me like you haven‚Äôt played the game more than an hour, because the combos expand a lot and the combat system becomes fantastic. But sure, go ahead and claim a game you haven‚Äôt played it overrated."

vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,November not September

vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Go off the format of the country the studio is HQ‚Äôd in. Santa Monica Studios is an American studio so MM/DD/YYYY. Non-American will usually follow the DD/MM/YYYY.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"It‚Äôs based on how we say the date. We don‚Äôt say the 9th of November, we say November 9th. Technically we say both but month first is far more common. Does that make sense?"

vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,Copies sold doesn't really matter. I think RDR2 sold more than GOW 2018..and still GOW won the GOTY
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"God of War 2018 has sold about 20m copies. I don't think sales will play as big a part as you think.

If it's as good a game as the first one, it will have a very good shot. Also, nobody cares who wins GOTY. LOL."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"That's what people said about Rdr2 though.. But I think Elden Ring will win, mostly because Gow already won once in 2018."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"I LOVED elden ring but prior to it I considered god of war to br the best game I experienced, amaxing graphics, no loading times, etc.

Personally? Impossible to choose from both‚Ä¶
Sadly I won‚Äôt experience god of war up until it releases on pc :("
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"God of war is just too one sided and ""safe""  to even compete with elden ring for goty, ER is clear winner."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Elden Ring is another Soulsborne game. Its basically like playing the 5th or 6th game in a series. I am not denying that its a great game but nothing about it is really new or unique.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"If I may ask...how exactly did Elden Ring ""change the game""?

It's Dark Souls 4. It's the culmiation of everything From has learned and improved upon from working on the Dark Souls franchise. But it's still basically just another Dark Souls like game.

The only real thing that changed was the open-world. Which is a mixed bag. On the one hand, the world is huge, and each new place to explore is unique and cool. And I mean THE WORLD IS HUUUUUUUUUUGE.

On the other hand, the actual act of exploring in the open-world is pretty meh. A lot of horse-riding. Your biggest obstacle is cliffs. Constantly getting rail-roaded into specific paths, because, again, cliffs. I just wish I had a grappling-hook like in Sekiro, or a parachute like BOTW.

It's not so much a ""big open world"". More like it's a big spider-web.

Still a fantastic game and probably the best game that's come out this year. I just wouldn't ever describe it as ""game changing."""
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,What lessons of er? Its didn‚Äôt do anything knew. Botw is still the best open world game
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,LOL changed the game. Dude it's literally dark souls but the walls of the dungeon have an outside.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,">in the same way that devs will be incorporating the lessons of the last GoW game.

what lesson from gow did the industry learn?"
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"This is stupid take.

Nobody will incorporate jack shit from Elder Ring because there is nothing to incorporate. It's just the same From Software game as always but with bigger map. There is nothing groundbreaking going on.

I'm sure God of War Ragnarok also will not introduced anything revolutionary. First one acomplisments were hiding loading screens and making sure kid you escort is not annoying.

But if those were the only game out there there is 0 reason to give GOTY to Elder Ring for simple reason. Elder Ring have decent boss fights and nice combat system. That's all. It has shit story, forgettable characters, horrible dialogues and overall shit writing.

Say what you want about God of War but first one was well balanced on all fronts and really well made and second will most likely be the same.

Unless Santa Monica drops the ball or something. That can happen. But even if they did - Elder Ring would be the last game in my head that deserve GOTY.

Even SIFU is better candidate for GOTY than Elder Ring."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,Companies who make good games get rewarded
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,This is the dumbest take. Takes it easily over a game that's not even out yet.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"I almost believe the opposite. Since it's coming out so late in the year it'll have less overall sales (not saying that determines GOTY), less time to be appreciated, and much less exposure overall. It'll be a close call for sure, but I truly do believe Elden Ring is gonna take the award."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"> no matter how good ragnarok is elden ring deserves the GOTY

Even if Ragnarok is legitimately a better game? This seems like a weird take."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,I really hope thats not the case

vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"Where you at ?

This game is most accessible soulsborne game ever, summon someone or use spirit ashes or use OP weapons.

One tip i can give for the game to click for you, is play dark souls 3 first."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,Gamescoop Ep ~724 already claimed it so GOW claimed what they could.

There‚Äôs at least a possibility that this has caused the Sony investors and higher-ups to pressure Santa Monica to get the game out the door before the end of the year. 

Granted, I don‚Äôt actually think this scenario is very likely. I doubt Santa Monica and Sony would let a flagship game like this ship till it‚Äôs good and ready. But still, there have been so many delays of huge games this year already, and I imagine Sony would like another killer app for the PS5 in time for Christmas."

Just a few years ago the thought of any PS first party stuff coming to PC ever was ridiculous.

Give it a few more years, and games will be day and date."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"Yeah that would make more sense actually with Fenrir being a child of Loki. Could be teaming up to take on Odin. In mythology Fenrir kills Odin during Ragnarok, Im super curious how Kratos plays into it."

vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"I think the more they release their games to PC, the closer to release dates they'll get.  Jim Ryan sees dollar signs.

It used to be no games were brought to PC.  Then just a few, way later.  Now tons of them.  Give it a few more years, and they'll be day and date.

And PS fans will lose their minds (like they did with Spiderman recently)"
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"The God of War 2018 port was in development for over two years and they're just getting started on PC releases ramping up so I'd expect them to be like 6 months to a year for future titles compared to the several years that God of War and Horizon Zero Dawn took to come to PC. 

In the end they still need to sell PS5s and if there weren't at least timed exclusives many people wouldn't even think of buying one. I wanted to play Demon's Souls remake asap so I got one but since Microsoft announced all their first party titles would come to PC I haven't had any obligation to get a Series S or X."

Don't get me wrong, I was surprised that GOW won....until I played it, and then I fully understood why it won. 

Idk, it's hard to say now. Im excited that it's coming out. I honestly wish they would just come out like January 1st just so I don't have to be salty either way. 

I feel like I'm going to be salty no matter what. I bet GOWR is going to be incredible. Elden Ring has my heart for one of the best games of all time at the moment."

vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,">It's not so much a ""big open world"". More like it's a big spider-web.

I think this is what people liked. Some open world games take that fact too far and let people go ANYWHERE, and unfortunately most of the time there's almost nothing around. Elden Ring designed it's open world so you naturally feel like going the way it wants you to go. That way there's always something there. Sure you can sequence break and do things out of order, but you're never going to spend 30 minutes walking/parachuting/grappling up a mountain with nothing on top. Odds are you'll find some enemies, a dungeon, an NPC, or a special item at the end of whatever path you take. Probably more than one of each!

My point is, that freedom of explore is not as important as that exploration being meaningful. Elden Ring does that meaningful part really well. Not only that, the WOW factor from your exploration is almost unparalleled at times."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"After well over a decade of reiterations of the ""open-world"" where more and more we see hand-holding and cluttered screens full of information, Elden Ring came in and turned the format on it's side a little.  The fact that Horizon devs were freaking out on Twitter about ER says a lot about how the format has been going and how the way From shook things up.  I get that it's more Dark Souls, but that is not what they did that will make ripples.  I think if we are lucky, devs inspired by ER will start making thoughtful games with tighter stories and less exposition, and please god let me see the world instead of a million meters mission markers.  AAA open-world games have become very formulaic and stale, and I think ER's success showed that people were interested in a different take, and I think that is game-changing."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"I think Elden Ring‚Äôs open world is one of the best ever made. No matter where you go there‚Äôs something cool to look at, a goal in the distance, a little hidden treasure or a catacomb. The game world is extremely densely packed with interesting things but it doesn‚Äôt feel crowded, and I never found myself wandering aimlessly trying to find something worth doing while I put off the next major thing, and even when I do that thing it still feels like I‚Äôm discovering something unique because the game doesn‚Äôt actually tell you where to go. The world isn‚Äôt ‚Äúgame changing‚Äù, it‚Äôs nothing new, but it‚Äôs just things that have been done before, done to near-perfection."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,It's game changing for both Souls like games and Open World games imo.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"elder ring is definitely the most overrated game of all time, hands down so its got that going for it, I guess?"
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"This comment screams it's by someone who either hasn't played Elden Ring, or watched a full playthrough of the game and then was disappointed by the game afterwards.

The game definitely did revolutionize open world game design. You can tell it was different because so many open world game devs complained about it when it came out.

Dark Souls revolutionized a genre, that's a fact. There's no way that the success from Elden Ring, with it's incredible sales numbers and popularity, won't change the open world genre in the same way. Even if you don't think it will or it should, the amount of buzz and money it generated is going to attract corporate execs like a moth to light. I guarantee some of these execs are already having meetings able how they're going to ""create the next Elden Ring"".Moreover, AAA open world genre (or subgenre) games already try to copy whatever other open world game is doing well, so expect plenty of Elden Ring influences."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,Ahhh looks like someone is mad they didn‚Äôt make it past the first boss. Elden ring sold over 13 million copies and is one of the highest rated games of all time. You seem like one of those ‚Äústory guys‚Äù who plays the game on the easiest difficulty. There‚Äôs no way you think story and writing is more important than gameplay and world design.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"maybe? i dunno like i know what i can expect from Ragnarok vaguely, and i think its gonna be a great story experience with a solid ass gameplay loop, but i feel Elden Ring really deserves the credit for breaking out into the market the way it did and reaching so many that had never touched a soulslike game before (plus like i said ragnarok winning is almost a given because it'll both be massively high quality plus recent in reviewers minds)"
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"its just kinda the unfortunate way things happen, you cant really avoid recency bias"

Not under any circumstances should we default to the objectively inferior way of doing things. That's just clinically insane. The US should adapt to European standards.

vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"According to [this](https://www.vgchartz.com/article/453293/ps5-vs-xbox-series-xs-sales-comparison-march-2022/) back in April of this year the sales of PS5s was outpacing the Xbox and the gap was growing over the course of 12 months, I am not sure how you reckon that equals PS is losing customers to Xbox over the last two years. Also, the specs of the Xbox have small advantages over the PS5 but to date that has not equaled performance advantages, so I am not sure exactly how objectively Sony is in its worst state in twenty years."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"Graphics sure but gameplay? Did I miss something that got changed from GoW ps4 to GoW ps5?

ITT was absolutely beautiful though. Really enjoyed stomping my buddy in the fun mini games too. I‚Äôm glad it got GOTY, it was near masterpiece imho."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"Elden Ring is absolutely one of the best games I have ever played, but realistically it didn‚Äôt innovate much.

vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,">Many many people who never touched a FromSoftware game picked it up.

vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"I think RDR2 was simply a better game, but GOT was more fun to play"
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"Unfortunately the gun gameplay was incredibly repetitive. Hold L2 so you auto lockon, shoot, let go of L2 and press it again to lock onto the next enemy"
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,20 million copies sold while being on one console versus ER which MIGHT max out around 18-20 million copies sold while being on every platform.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"Not really. People like to talk about stuff, that's all.

In the end, it really doesn't matter. To anyone. And we can't even agree as a group of gamers which GOTY award really matters (many people hate the ""Game Awards""), so the tiny percentage it might matter... it matters far less. 

I mean... Sekiro won ""Game of the Year"" in 2019. Red Dead 2 didn't in 2018. Is Sekiro a better game than Red Dead 2? LOL. No. It's just something to argue about every year, it means less than nothing."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"Which is why it's a mixed bag.

Always somewhere cool to discover. But sometimes discovering it can be annoying.

Like, you know that poison Castle to the north? I almost completely missed it because I didn't see the single path I was suppose to take to it. And the funny thing is, it's not even a hidden path or anything. The world is just too open in some areas it can become confusing as to which direction leads you to where you want to go.

Another example is when I was exploring Calied, I saw the beach area where you fight Rodahn. I wanted to travel there and spent a good hour before I learned the only way to get to that beach is to be teleported via the boss fight (which I wasn't at yet).

That wasn't very fun. 

And honestly, sometimes, the game can go a little overboard with it's secrets. I get that some people really enjoy that kind of stuff, but to me, when side-quests become so obtuse that you NEED a guide, it ruins the fun.

All the times I had to talk to an NPC, exhaust their dialogue, rest at a bonfire, and then talk to them again. Like, WTF? When does the game ever tell you you should do that?"
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Ever heard of botw? The game which influenced elden ring.
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"I mean, BOTW came out 4 years before Elden Ring and had all that stuff you're talking about, with a ""less cluttered map"" and such.

And it was way more fun to actually explore, that incentivized players finding or creating their own paths...

As for the ""less hand-holdy, players discover the lore on their own""...Dark Souls did that too. It's a Fromsoft staple.

So nothing you said was anything new that games haven't already done. I'm sorry but I fail to see how Elden Ring ""changed the game"".

Great game, though. But it could have been called Dark Souls 4 and no one would have really noticed."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"Oh I agree in that regard. It's just insane to me how many interesting and unique areas they crammed into that massive game. And it's places I've never seen in video games before. Not just another ""forest zone"" or ""lava zone"" or ""dessert zone"" (although TBF it did have a kinda generic starting zone, but that's fine). It had, like...hell. A demon world. University sitting in the middle of a shallow lake. An underground area that looked like outer-space. It was so unique.

Like I said, I like that stuff about Elden Ring. But the physical act of explore was tedious because the game isn't as ""open"" as it looks. You can't make your own path anywhere. You have to take the specific paths in the spider-web like map.

Give me BOTW's exploration with Elden Ring's world design. That'd be the perfect game."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"I think you guys use ""game changing"" when you really mean to say ""really good"".

Because I don't really see what Elden Ring did that other games haven't done before it. The gameplay is literally identical to Dark Souls. The only major difference is how big and open the areas are.

But it's not even a true ""open world"". It's still just Dark Souls. Just with really spaced-out and wide-open zones. But you're still forced upon a predetermined path."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,">You can tell it was different because so many open world game devs complained about it when it came out.

Besides the 1 dude from the Horizon dev team, I'm not sure anyone complained."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"You say empty phrases with no real arguments.

If your measure of success is money then Cyberpunk 2077 is a better game than Elder Ring. Hell... Even Fifa is better than Elder Ring. Diablo Immortal is most likely better than Elder Ring. Using money as measure of success is moronic.

There is nothing that Elder Ring is doing that was not been done. It was a blast for From Software fans because this time studio did something different so in 2022 you could finally play open world game but that's it.

And nobody complained about it. Some people liked it because it's a decent game but that's ot. Stop making shit up."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"Baseless assumption from a fanboy. And you are not even original. Every shitty fanboy out there is using same argument. Because it's all you have.

If you talk about sales then Cyberpunk 2077 is a better game than Elder Ring.

Whole story and writing is not more important there is no omitting the fact that story and writing are horrible in elder ring."

A lot of quests work by an NPC telling to you to go to X place, but you‚Äôd probably have no idea where that was if you hadn‚Äôt seen it already.

vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"Money is the only measure of success AAA game companies care about. That's why they keep making sports games and shitty mobile games. Even if you hate a game, the money it makes guarantees lots of similar games. The difference between Elden Ring and the games you mentioned is that Elden Ring made lots of money AND was universally praised. That's the golden ticket for game companies."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"It's EldeN Ring, not EldeR Ring.  Say it out loud and slow."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"First off the story and writing is not terrible. Yes there are no cutscenes and quest markers to guide the player. But you have to be on another level of stupid if you think that people are buying elden ring for its story and writing. It‚Äôs a fucking souls game. The reason the genre has been so successful is the difficulty and how the game gives the player total freedom to play the game how they want. Elden ring has taken that a step further with more freedom and a large expansive open world that does not feel completely empty. It will win goty, like it or not."

Instead of downvoting prove me how I am wrong. There's nothing logical in jumping from month to day to year, while there is in going from day to month to year or viceversa."

vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"Why would what you describe make it any less ""masterpiece""? Are you seriously looking for realism in a game about fictional Gods?"
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"I think BOTW and Elden Ring follow OPPOSITE concepts of exploration.

BOTW is about forging your own path. Climing. Gliding. Riding a horse. Flying through the air on a tree like Tao Pai Pai. Using fire to create up-drafts to launch yourself upwards.

Elden Ring is taking one of the pre-determined paths along the spider-web like map. It's just a lot more open, now. You can think of it basically just like Dark Souls, but with a few wide-open areas and a horse. Gameplay wise it hasn't really changed anything that From hasn't done before hand.

But BOTW? No game has replicated it's exploration since. It's creativity. It's player-ingenuity. BOTW's world feels like a real, living world. Elden Ring's world feels like a video game. Everything is always the same. Every time you bonfire, enemies are always reset in the same place. Nothing is dynamic."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"The game is so massive, even following a Wiki guide, I missed a lot of shit. Regardless of how you play, it is inevitable for a game as big as Elden Ring that players will miss SOMETHING. So I don't think giving players better travel-options would ruin the game.

Also, ""a lot of NPC's tell you to go to a place""? When was this? Most NPC's say something super vague like ""I'm heading north"" or ""I'm sure we'll meet again one day"". Man, the side-quests in Elden Ring are an entire other issue this game has. But I digress.

The map was so big and confusing they actually had to update it so  NPC icons appeared on the map because they were so hard to find and remember where they were.

The game's overly obtuse nature worked better in Dark Souls and Sekiro because those maps were a lot smaller. Since Elden Ring is so big, it's SO EASY to miss important NPCs. I never completed the Jar-man's quest because he just never showed up where he was suppose to."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"The combat is basically just an improved Dark Souls 3. Let‚Äôs not kid ourselves. It plays identical to a DS game. Even with Ashes and Guard added. 

And the open-world isn‚Äôt really ‚Äúopen‚Äù. It‚Äôs a spider-web of paths to take. The only way to get to where you want to go is to take the specific path along that web.

Meanwhile, BOTW you have 360 degrees in which you can travel, with the ability to overcome any obstacle in your way.

Elden Ring you are constantly being blocked off by cliffs and other obstructions and you have no other choice but to turn back and find another route."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"None of that is related, in any way, to the game being open world. Kinda disingenuous to cite that in regards to Elden Rings impact on the open world experience."

So will you quit your bullshit? Please tell us what revolutionary mechanics elder ring have that will change open world games forever. I'm waiting."

vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"But world is completely empty. It's designed the same way as every shitty game in the genre. World is just filled with hostile NPC and nothing else. Minus stations for upgrades.

I never said anything about cutscenes or markers. Good writing or story does not mean you need cinematic cutscenes or markers. I think you do not understand what story is. But that's actually not surprising if you are just playing games from... From Software. 

I never said people buy the game for story and writing. I just pointed out that story and writing are bad. And your only counter to that is that this is a souls games. Like that explains it. To be fair it does explains it. All From Software games have shitty story and writing.

Elder Ring added open world to the formula. Buu huuu. That's what everyone are doing with every genre for past decade. You are excited for game being open world in 2022. That's cute."

vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"Oh yeah, combat is improved Dark Souls 3 combat. But that's what expected because it's the smoothest version of DS combat. And there's also spirit ashes that change the combat radically.

""BOTW you have 360 degree in which you can travel""

You can do this in ER too. It's literally an open world, you can go wherever you want. For example, You can skip Margit, Godrick and Renalla and straight go for Capital just from the start within 1 hour.

I know you are trying to convey some valid point here but I personally felt like it was one of the most freeing open world ngl."

vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"So like, unfortunately, he's right that it's not a majority. It doesn't really matter what a market is (also I'm very confused as to why you focused on that), majority doesn't mean biggest %, plurality does.

vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"Elden Ring has a ton of variety but it isn't exempt from having a couple copy/paste dungeons of it's own. The Black Knife lairs and the Fallen Hero Graves are an example.

And I agree the shrines in BOTW were too copy/paste, but at least they were more creative. At least they incentivized finding your own way to solve them.

Meanwhile, Elden Ring over here going ""you do it this way, or you die"".

Elden Ring is just so...still. So static. You see a pack of wolves hunting some animals? Guess what? They are ALWAYS THERE. They don't dynamically hunt like in BOTW. They're basically just set-dressing used to make the faux appearance of a living world.

Honestly, the open-world in Elden Ring was cool, but it honestly wasn't even necessary. They could have kept the map smaller like in Dark Souls and it would have been mostly the same experience.

It would have cut-out a lot of boring horse-riding sections too. And hey? A smaller map means we wouldn't have to cut the multiplayer from 6-players down to just 4."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,"My 360 degree example was that you can literally walk in any direction in a straight line in BOTW and keep going. Walls? Climb em. Cliffs? Glide down them. Water? Swim over it. Any obstacle can be over-come.

Elden Ring you can go in a straight line for maybe 30 seconds before hitting an impassable cliff or something that forces you to find another route.

My greatest enemy in Elden Ring is cliffs. So many fucking cliffs. Really ruined the fun of exploring when I was constantly getting blocked off by more cliffs.

Sure, there's tons of cool areas to explore. But the actual act of exploring them isn't very fun."
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"Call of Duty is more popular than shitty game I like. And it's more popular than Elder Ring.

vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-06,"This is just another open world game on the market just like every other open world game of the market. It's really not that different than the crap Ubisoft shit out every year or two.

And yes, world is empty because it's not even a world. You just have bunch of hostile NPC placed around the map. It's no different that what Shadow of War or Arkham Knight did. Because even they were too lazy to design believable world.

Boss fights are decent but honestly Monster Hunter series is doing boss fights way better.

Elder Scrolls series, Breath of the Wild, Red Dead Redemption series, Witcher 3, Metal Gear Solid 5, Shadow of the Colossus, Ghost of Tsushima, GTA series etc, etc etc. - they all did it and they all had way better story and writing than this crap.

There is nothing special about ER. It's just another souls like but with open world.

Sorry kiddo buy nobody is excited by open world design in 2022. You are late to the party. If that was your revolution then it was shitty revolution."

vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,">You do it this way or you die

I was never forced to approach an encounter in a certain way. There are bosses which heavily favor some builds but the game never forces a single playstyle on the player.

Agree with similar looking dungeons though, it's not a perfect game. But given the size and scope of the game, it still has more varied design in terms of enemies, dungeons and gear than most open world games.

I don't think open is unnecessary. It has that quality of ""Ah! how do I get to that location"" that fuels my exploration big time.

Also agree with coop/multiplayer. They shouldn't have done it Dark Souls style. It feels dated for an open world"
vsqnwu,2022-07-06,2022-07-07,Oh you meant traversal tools. I definitely agree there. BOTW and HFW both do better and modern job of providing traversal tools. That's something I'd like them to improve in ER 2. New traversal options would be great.

I think if we gave the whole of the world a lot more focus our games would be much more open and awesome for other cultures without having to jump onto Wikipedia. Good on you OP for liking the game regardless of the study time lol!

Note* I put ""living"" cultures into quotation marks because Greek, Roman, Celt, Norse and the like are all folded into an umbrella of ""mythology"" like they never really existed while still being cultures practiced today."

His skin is grey because he was cursed to wear their ashes. There's also some other mess in there about the Chaos Blades being fused to his arms forever. Afterwards he goes on a revenge murder spree taking down a bunch of gods in the Greek Pantheon, starting with Ares, the God of War and taking over his throne, which initiates Kratos' life as a god.!< There's a lot more to it, but that's just the basic back-cover rundown.

*During* PS4 God of War, >!we don't get a lot of context about his current wife, except that she ded. But Kratos is hard on Atreus for two reasons: first, he's trying to teach the kid survival skills cause Kratos is already just a crotchety old hardass and is raising Atreus in the only way he really understands how. Secondly, but more importantly, Kratos is still a god, and subsequently Atreus has god blood too. It paints them both as heavy targets for any divine jerkoff that happens to know where they are, so Kratos wants Atreus to be able to defend himself when that time comes.!<

ysqpgs,2022-11-11,2022-11-12,"The problem is that everything always uses elder Futhark. Elder Futhark was not used to write Norwegian, or old Icelandic, or even old Norse. It was used on incredibly archaic Germanic languages like proto Germanic and Gothic, it predates the words they're trying to use it on by centuries. 

When you see the hundreds of wooden rune stick inscriptions in Bergen, they're in Medieval Futhork. Not elder Futhark. That was the only runic alphabet ever used on relatively 'modern' scandinavian langauges, save for the Dalecarlian runes and √ñlvdalska in Sweden.

On top of that, they just substitute Latin letters like a font, which isn't how runes were used. They didn't use silent letters, except in the case of omitting nasal consonants and some initial consonants like Hs.

Almost no mainstream western media seems to understand that there isn't one runic alphabet. Writing what they do in the alphabet they always choose makes as much sense as writing modern Polish in Old Church Slavonic."

That's why January is called ""January"", Janus is the two-faced god of doorways, of beginnings and endings"

pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-11,"Oh Sony. You are as predictable as you are current year garbage. 

I miss old GoW, where things were unapologetically badass instead of unabashedly fatass."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-11,I didn't know African people had emigrated to ancient Norway.

pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Laura Bailey isn't returning as Freya?

Also Thor looks a bit tubby lol."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,I like what they did with thor it's a nice little  reference  to end game
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Guess I'll pass this time around.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,They copied Thor from End Game
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Belive me guys this game will be something like AC Valhala open world micro transactions and graind
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Older Atreus seems so much like puberty Jaden Smith. 

Watch any scene from After Earth movie and then the trailer for ragnarok if you dont see it"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Damn they got Thor from Endgame.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,The kid actually sounds annoying now. What a weird artistic choice
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Is it just me or Santa monica launching GOW Ragnarok is totally anachronistic?
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Ragnarok has finally come I guess this the extinction of man kind
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Remember when we thought roger clark would be thor?
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"I like that Tyr, Thor and Freya don't really look like gods besides Tyr being huge. Expected Tyr to be built like a tank."

pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Where?where is it?

pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Its here? We can play it?
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Kinda surprised not to see Nolan North, Laura Bailey or Troy Baker in a first party Sony game"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,This is going to be a masterpiece
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"I liked the first (not that it was the first but you know) but there was something missing for me compared to the older games.

I really hope they give us some better battles, more enemy variety and some actual boss fights this time. I know there were the Valkyries to fight, but it was optional and they were basically all the same fight so I couldn't even be bothered to do them all. Not wanting to spoil but the end of the game was quite an anticlimax, even if storywise it was pretty good.

I really missed the big fights with a lot of small enemies and a couple of cyclops, things like that.

GoW 2 and 3 I played over and over and absolutely loved, but just the once for GoW and haven't felt any urge to replay it. I think the whole open world-ness of it came about 5-10 years too late for me, with my desire to play open world games at an all time low."

pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,The yellow part of Artreus's outfit gives me InFAMOUS vibes. Maybe its the colour choice
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,I'm beyond hyped for this game
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,ü•∞
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"So that was totally Tyr on the mural at the end of God of War, right? Same color scheme on his skirt (blue and red), and Tyr looks out for blood and wanting to kick off Ragnarok while Loki is trying to stop it? I think Tyr succeeds and dies, while Loki curses him realizing that Ragnarok was going to happen anyways, but now he (Loki) is at the center of it."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,This will be the sole reason I'll get a PS5.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,It's here!.....With no release date.. lol
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Lmao it‚Äôs Fat Thor I love it
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Am i the only one ingerested in Tyr here? What are those tatoos? They kinda look like egyptian hieroglyphics to me a bit too
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Never got into the god of war series, what does kratos have to do with norse stuff?"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Where the fuck is J√∂rmungandr?
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"I'm seeing lots of clues about a future possible egyptian mithology and i'm out of my mind

It's literally the one thing I wanted since forever, adult Atreus or older Kratos facing blood thirst Horus and Anubis

And also the biggest mithology together with greek and Northern ones


Many years from now, I 'd also like to see South American mithology coming into game


Another mithology i' m waiting since forever is Indian one, thinking about meeting Shiva and Co is pretty sick if you ask me, those Gods have pretty awesome designs"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Guess I‚Äôm actually going to have to buy a ps5
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Any planned release date?
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"The real question is, will i be able to ply it on PC with playstations streaming platform. Most likely no but it‚Äôs hard to find PS5"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Finally I can cosplay as thor and not feel bad about it :')
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Since Durlin is here, are we getting a version of Tyrfing?"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Need to play more God of War games.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Dad Thor is the best
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,I need a ps5. This looks great as usual
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,It‚Äôs awesome that not only is Atreus VA the same model for the game but he‚Äôs growing up like the character so his focus matches perfectly!
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Wonder if Freyr will show up, or be left in the dust while his sister gets the limelight?
And if Ragnarok indeed comes, will Surtr and the flame giants along with the wolf trio show up?"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"I‚Äôve never played a god of war game, would I need to play others before this or could I just pick it up with this game?"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Inner child screaming
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,This dlc or a separate game?
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,And i still can't have a ps5
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,I need a fuckin ps5 so bad now.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Tyr has both his hands...
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Osman Ali !
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Freya kinda bad
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,please come to PC please come to pc
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Fat ginger Thor was not a design I was expecting


The blip hit him hard"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,I‚Äôm just holding onto hope this means the last one is gonna hit pc eventually!!
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Atreus‚Äôs voice actor didn't sound that good is it just me?
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Wait that's still Sunny as Atreus? Shit, I thought it was a new actor he sounds so different. I know it's been a few years but goddamn they really do grow up fast."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Will it be on PS4?
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,I don‚Äôt like sunny suljic
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Wake me when kratos gets to the modern era and deals with all the religions in his hunt for their nonexistent gods
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,I bet ya Thor is going to be a unit of a boss fight.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Damn they got the thor who let himself go
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,They went with fat Thor I guess
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Thor became a discord mod
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,It‚Äôs not actually ‚Äúhere‚Äù yet.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,By looking at thor. I can finally say I have the body of a god
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Weird. I thought his name was Boy.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"This was never asked in the dev interview but I hope the game retains the ""one camera"" shot or whatever it is called from the first game. It really  helped with the storytelling by not having any cuts in the scenes."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"I am glad these actors are getting the credit they deserve here. Phenomenal, incredible work in the first game. I cannot fucking *wait* for this game to come out. I can't think of having ever looked forward to a sequel so much."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Dad bod thor returns
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Not a fan of Thor's design, but to their credit it actually makes sense to portray him that way"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Ah, time for another drinking game when the word ""boi"" pops up.  Maybe....."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,This is so cool! Im so hyped
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Isn‚Äôt that the guy from Fortnite?
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"For those that don‚Äôt know, Ryan Hurst is Opie from Sons of Anarchy if you‚Äôre a fan of the show!"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Excellent
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,I kinda wish it had more action on cover.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,I see Durlin.... Where is Cran?
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Will Odin be in the game at all? He showed up last thing in the previous game.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,So is kratos gonna be ragnarok or is it gonna be atreus?
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Freya looks like she should be starring in a My Chemical Romance music video
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Is Brok a real god or just a local frat bro
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Thor took a couple of bear
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Surprised the 3rd picture didn't cause the post to get nuked. Would've made for a good post on r/SubredditDrama, especially with how spicy controversial is on here."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Well... super excited about this game, but have the feeling that I'll dislike Atreus character here. Hate teenagers with a moody behaviour."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Freya looks like Lisa Bonet
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Why does tyr have both hands??? And what the heck happened to Thor!
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,When do you think Tyr is losing the arm?
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,I hope in the end Tyr sends Kratos back in time to Egypt...
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,‚ÄúHere‚Äù as in it‚Äôs announced or it‚Äôs out?
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,But the ps5 isn‚Äôt!!!
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,thank god they didn‚Äôt call it God of War 2
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Why is Thor fat
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Your son is Chris Finch from The Office UK
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Me can‚Äôt wait.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,is it gonna be on ps4 too
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-11,"Honestly genuine question but 

Is Tyr? Powerful? How powerful is he to have Kratos, literally a killer of all gods, reach out for help from him?"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-11,"Seriously Freya looks really pissed. Judging by her actions in the trailer, she's going to take the part of her late son Baldur and becoming a stalker and assailant of Kratos and Atreus.

I think she eventually will even reclaim her Valkyrie armour and then all hell breaks loose, because imagine having to fend off someone who is even stronger than the Valkyrie Queen from the previous game. 

Man I'm so hyped."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-11,No it is not!!!
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-11,"Tyr will die and kratos will take over the role of god of war only after defeating Odin or deceiving Odin with Atreus  though that could be in the future because there‚Äôs enough to make a 3rd, Atreus may betray kratos, I‚Äôm interested to see the Loli dynamic I was like  holy shit when they said it in game"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-11,"man, freya looks pissed."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-11,So glad I don't have to get a PS5 for this game üòÖ
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-11,Ah Tyr‚Ä¶ AC Valhalla flashbacks
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-11,Remind me of that Fat thor at marvel
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-11,"Freya, Hela, what is it with mad evil female Villains that's so fucking hot."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-11,Kids watching this trailer properly screamed. It's the guy from fortnite they must have.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-11,I'm fuckin excited despite the fact that I'm not gonna be able to play this game in a million years.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,He was my favorite part of the whole game
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,[deleted]
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,The theory was interesting but don‚Äôt you think he‚Äôd be able to read Norse language if he was?
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,And with both hands
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,that would have been a cool twist too - Kratos just being Tyr with Amnesia.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,And the funny thing is people are STILL tying in a time paradox with it.  I really don't think that's going to happen anymore since it already happened in the last GoW series.  It would just be cheap
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"I was really thinking it would be Atreus with his thirst for knowledge and gift of languages. But who knows, it could go so many ways and I love that about this series."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Strange, how would that work with the prophecy that Loki will kill him?"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"> Definitely more surprising to see Tyr than anything since it seemed like they were setting up Kratos as Tyr via the time loop associated with Ragnarok

But is that really Tyr? he has both of his hands"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Loki was the one who got into an eating contest with Logi though.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Finally someone made Thor look awesome! I love the character designs, good job!"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,I got a chuckle at the way Tyr is holding his arm. He should keep his distance from wolves.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Seeing these devs‚Äô interpretation of Fenrir will be interesting. J√∂rmungundr‚Äôs design in the previous game was awesome.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"I commented about the hand, never thought of the option to explain it in game"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Wait what‚Äôs gonna happen? It‚Äôs been a while since I last played so I don‚Äôt remember some stuff
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Username Checks out

pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,He looks like End Game Thor
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,What did you expect from a fat-dobber?
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"I didn‚Äôt even see that was Thor. I was too distracted by the convenient gut window in his armor for sexual appeal. So shameless, women only want one thing and it‚Äôs fucking disgusting."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Don't worry he can dance in fortnite for you forever
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Spoiler from last game, but you remember the hall in Jotunehim that depicted all of the stories on the wall that the giants knew already but still had yet to actually happen? One of the scenes on that wall shows Kratos‚Äô death. 

So, unfortunately, when it comes to the end of Kratos, the writing was ACTUALLY on the wall."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"End of Kratos for the main series game, possibly. They could still pull off a game bridging the 2 together. 

And of course Atreus could try to revive Kratos in the next installment, which could be pretty cool however they try it"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Won‚Äôt be the end. Atreus and angrboda still need to grow up a little bit and have their kids. Fenrir and the world serpent.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Since he's a God doesn't he only become more powerful with age? I really hope he doesn't die.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Possibly. Kratos said that the drawings were ""your story"" in reference to Boy. Kratos probably dies (permanently) at the end this game of or in the beginning of next game. 

Slowly introducing Atreus as the main character.

Gow4: he's just a background character, just a few buttons (little more but yeah)

Gow5: largely playable but Kratos will be your main character 

Gow6: Atreus is who you play as for the entirety of the game.

(Little knowledge of Norse mythology, just speculation)"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Looks as old as in the last game, he kicked all kinds of ass. If he dies in the game, won't be of old age lol."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Leaked script 

Thor: you stupid old man‚Ä¶you don‚Äôt get to rush this.

*Thor swings Mjonir into Kratos‚Äô head*

Atreus: Father! get up! Father, fucking up! Please stop! Please don‚Äôt do this‚Ä¶Father, please get up!"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Strictly speaking, Olympians are usually regarded as immortal. Think about how old Zeus looked in III."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Spoilers; Kratos will die
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"He died 3 times already, he always finds a way to live. If he dies again, valkyries will help him live"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Yes
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"In the poetic Edda, she was Loki's lover. Even bore him 3 children. But they were never married. Wonder why."

pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Game comes out on PS4 as well

pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Why do characters from the same mythology have different symbols then? I don't know what the symbols represent but I'd say it's not mythology.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Here in a few years..
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Thor in the Eddas was known for 1) eating an entire wedding feast because he forgot he was pretending to be Sif (Long story) and 2) drinking so much seawater disguised as beer that in 3 drafts the sea had lowered enough to reveal new islands, before turning around and lifting Jormungandr and almost beating death in a wrestling match (longer story)

This is a Thor who looks like he could do that shit."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Strongman Thor
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,He's still worthy.

pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"The giants once invited Thor and Loki to a ""friendly feast"" where they used illusion magic to make the aesir appear weak. They gave Thor a drinking horn and he chugged as hard as he could but it only went down a tiny bit and all the giants laughed and asked him if he needed a smaller container. The beer in the horn was actually the fucking sea. Which Thor lowered by several feet, even exposing new islands. He drinks so much that you need an actual ocean of beer to make him look bad."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,He‚Äôs a bit depressed.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,well they called him fat in the first God of War... so...
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Jormungandr or The Midgard Serpent. It makes plenty of appearances in the first game, but I don't think we'll get a boss battle."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Atreus is loki right?
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Remember, giants aren't always big. Atreus is half giant, and he's still small. Laufey was full giant and still around kratos' height."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Thats lokis lover and mother of the snake and wolf
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"What if she will tie in the story of Kratos to Africa, Egypt or Mesopotamia... with Tyr and time travel :)"

pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Who?
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,It‚Äôs Bro Thor now
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,They haven‚Äôt missed with the god of war series so I think the hype is at the correct level. So hype
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-11,No she doesn‚Äôt. She looks completely out of character
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Tyr is a pacifist and scholar, it fits with his supposed soft nature. Gentle giant and all that stuff"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Gods do age but the Norse gods eat idun apples which are youth apples only grown by the Norse goddess idun
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-11,Forced diversity. -_-
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"And Kratos is played by a black man and not someone who is Greek.

And Angrboda is a Jotun, she‚Äôs not a human/Midgardian"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Listen. There's a Greek god fighting norse gods while carrying around a disembodied talking head with horns and golden eyes, and you're worrying about nationality?"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Mythological character with blue skin - ""It's fantasy. The artists can be creative with the designs.""


Mythological character with brown skin - ""WRONG RACE!!!"""
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,J√∂tnar are literal extra-dimensional aliens with bejeweled eyes that can see the future

pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"She does look so pretty though!!! Honestly the fact that she didn't look Scandinavian didn't occur to me until I saw this comment. Now I'm kind of torn, because if the intention is to offer more racial representation, they probably could have done better than have a person of color play ""The mother of monsters"" and the only Jotun in the group. Well, I guess they've already done the thing, and she does look very nice, so..."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,..Atreus IS Loki.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Why you got downvoted lol?
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-11,Because it‚Äôs the destructive leftist way
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-30,"It‚Äôs literally mythology bro it didn‚Äôt happen, they can do whatever the fuck they want so long as it‚Äôs not disrespectful - which this isn‚Äôt."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,I mean he did chug the fucking ocean and ate a wedding buffet.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Get over it
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Found the incel gamer.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"The Last of Us Part 2 was incredible, so this game could stand to do worse than be like it"

pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Do u hate gays
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Well it's part 2 of the atreus story
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,The original games played all the same
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Because everyone calls him a big, dumb, fat idiot in the last game.

He is a drunkard and violent person with no self-restraint in either eating, drinking or fighting"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,He looks like that in the original mythology
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Educate yourself first
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,You do know that thor looks exactly like that in mythology right?
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Because he eats a lot.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Because it‚Äôs accurate to mythology.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Atreus is Loki.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"He is a guy that drinks enough water to lower the ocean and eats enough to outpace the personification of fire Loggi.

Also a drunkard and generally unrestrained asshole, it is supposed to give abusive dad vibes"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Said only one person.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,What exactly was the old ps3 style?
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,">Also Thor looks a bit tubby lol.

That is the accurate representation of Thor in Norse myths"

pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,How‚Äôs it an artistic choice when it‚Äôs the exact same actor
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,[deleted]
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,How?
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"GoW 1 through 3 (and all the in between titles) covers his warpath through all of greek mythology.

In the end he hates gods and being one and all the ruin they bring. So being the last god left, he gets on a boat and starts sailing, to leave it all behind.

He ends up on the shores of the world of norse mythology. He does his best to live quiet and as hidden as he can  but since he is a god  the other gods/beings of norse mythology sense something is different/alien about him.

The open sea/ocean, seems to serve as a void between all the different pantheon of gods. ""Norse-land"" is just where he happened to have ended up."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Definitely play the PS4 one first, it's awesome anyway"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,New game
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Shut up, head."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,I would quite literally just sit on the voat to hear his stories
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Agree, Mimir's voice, tales and accent made the game for me as well."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Just listening to Mimirs stories just made feel giddy and child like
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"No, the theory was that he would go on to become tyr and learn everything along the way and I believe they hinted at tyr being able to time travel so that's the basis of it. Not that I agreed with it. Particularly but it could've been a cool arc"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"The theory was based on the idea that time travel was involved. The world serpent was supposedly thrown back in time by Ragnarok, and the Tyr=Kratos theory posited that Kratos was also going to be thrown back in time as well, where he then takes on the persona of Tyr. As Tyr, the Norse god of war, he then travels to other lands gathering things he needs and setting up his temples and stuff so that past Kratos and Atreus can get to where they need to go."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,First thing I noticed too. But it makes sense if this current Atreus/Loki hasn't spawned Fenrir yet. Of course jormungandr is timey-whimey
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Tyr in the picture holding his hand like üòê
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-11,Oooooh shit maybe it‚Äôs another God and they fake us all out? It‚Äôd be a very Odin move to disguise himself as Tyr or someone important to get close to his target and learn their secrets
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Oh yeah that‚Äôs right whups
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,I'm half expecting Fenrir/Hel to just be some kind of Atreus Spell
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Norse Mythology. 

So, spoilers."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-11,It gets bitten off by fenrir
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"He's not obese, he just... drank half of the ocean"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,That's a weird way to spell melted ice cream

pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,He died in god of war 2 and came back. If he dies again he is just going to end up in helheim and make his way back to midgard
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,This.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"The director apparently said this is the end of the Norse gods, and someone in another sub said maybe Kratos dies at the end and atreus takes him to the Nile to try and resurrect him. And that's how the Egyptian gods are introduced since we already know they were playing with the idea of Kratos visiting the Egyptian gods."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,but I don't want to play as Atreus
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,And Hel
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"I don't think Norse Mythology has much to do with it; GoW4 mostly used the characters and world in their own way rather than following the myths, sort of like Marvel does. For example, Balder is not a vengeful psychopath in the myths, and he's not Freya's son; he's Odin and Frigg's, alongside Thor and H√∏der."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Makes sense from a story point of view but then again, Kratos is so iconic with the God of War series, it would be the same as removing Master Chief from Halo.   
They actually tried that with Halo 5 by making you play half the game as some other Spartan called Locke and fans didn't really like it. 

Besides, Kratos died a couple times already and always came back soooo"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Yeah I ain't playing any more GoWs if they make Atreus the main...

Sorry, but I just won't stop seeing him as a kid. Same issue I had with Ellie in the Last of Us 2. They killed off the character I wanted to play to ""pass the torch"" to the ""new generation"" or whatever."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,I can guarantee that this part of the script will be repeated a whole lot.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,My favorite part in the script is when the stars align and Kratos stumbles into the Asgard cafeteria during lunch time.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Not the first time...
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,I just realised. if kratos dies at the hands of Thor Atreus will want vengeance against the norse god for taking his family and the cycle of hatred begins anew.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,He was already married to one of the gods. She would hold a basin to catch the poison from the snake when he was tied to the rock. When the basin filled he would get dripped on (in the eyes) while she poured it out.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"LETS FUCKING GOOOO, I DONT HAVE TO BUY A PS5"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-11,He might not want the downgraded version.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"I think it's the different races. Thor, Tyr and Mimir have the same symbol (Aesir?), Freya has a different one (Vanir), the dwarves all share the same one and Atreus and Angrboda share the same symbol."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Wasn't it originally slated for this year? I'm kinda expecting it next year. Plus what we've seen in the trailer looks like it's pretty far already
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"What is mythology? I only know Marvel.

pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,He‚Äôs actually an ally in GOW4
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"He is. Only to the jotnar, though. Not sure if in the games universe he is the one to bring Ragnarok. Would be sweet, though."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"I guess. I'm too use to their depictions as tall, muscley , blue people"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Kratos is technically Jotuun as well, though the game doesn't mention it directly, Lokis father is a Jotuun who's name translates to ""he who strikes dangerously."" 

The Jotuun live in a land seperate from the gods, but are equal in power, the PS4 game made a very very smart analysis that that could mean the Jotuun were gods of foreign lands"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"I know. She just doesn‚Äôt look Norse like every other character in the game. So I was wondering if there was significance to that. 

Maybe she creates the tie in to the next pantheon of the third game?"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"""erasing white history"" in a game with a completely fictional contest and ""they couldn't be any"" diversity in a game with dwarfs, dark elves, giants and gods?"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Same thing
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Ok ok, soo ankboda in the norse mythology is loki's wife and the mother of j√∂rmungndr, hella and fenrir"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Agreed, they have not disappointed yet. Still skeptical."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"And we were very happy with CD Projekt and then cyberpunk came out.
I truly cannot think of a game where the hype train was better than it would've been to not hype it so much."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-11,What do you mean?
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-11,dude she hasn‚Äôt been revealed till now wdym ‚ÄúOut of character‚Äù?
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Yeah but kratos is greek
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-11,Reee black wamen bad.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-11,Forced diversity and interracial agenda since they will be hooking her up with Atreus
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,[deleted]
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,But cratos is white? And also from Greece(/Sparta)?? What you‚Äôre saying is irrelevant. The ethnicity of his real world voice actor has nothing to do with the story
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"When everyone else looks like Scandinavian (Brok too, despite his blue skin) her appearance does break immersion, made me go ""huh?"" for a second.  


Then again, she's the only proper Jotun(there's the World Serpent, but he's a snek) we see for the first time since Atreus is half Greek. Maybe that's what Jotuns generally look like in GOW world? Still odd that they found a need to do this though."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Then why is she west African and not giant looking at all
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Characters had blue skin in Norse mythology...
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Yeah that's kinda my point. That particular character seems like the least preferable to choose. It would be like making the only non Greek looking character in the original GOW Medusa. It seems like the worst possible way of going about it to pick a character that is already somewhat stigmatized in the source material. You just as easily could have had him run into a trader from a far off land and involve them in the story (I bet you didn't know that the Vikings traded extensively and the archeological record shows they were visited by traders from Africa, the Middle East and Asia)"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Because of the blackwashing advocacy
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Because they are nervous about the skin color of one of the characters
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"""I guess""

Like it's automatically a problem"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-13,"Wonder why you're getting downvoted for stating the literal truth, probably salty ps fans."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Nope
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Respectfully that game sucked and ruined what could have been a great franchise.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Wait what?
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,That was half drunk and has room temperature iq
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Huh. I always thought she voiced Freya in 2018. Turns out she had no role in that game. My bad.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Yeah, I figured it's the same actor, but he chose not to go the earnest, arrogant, or unsure route. He was just going to be a whiny zoomer. Not a huge reach for said actor."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"The span of time , i mean maybe because of covid GOW 4 seems very recent."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Is there a specific title to get?  God of war (something)?
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Yup, they were quite enthralling"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,I agree but I think the Loki reveal was already the  big focus and it would have been a little hat on a hat
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Yeah he wrestled an old lady instead, and lost. 

But she wasn‚Äôt any old lady."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Thor basically chugged an olympic pool worth of mead and lowered the ocean, that's a few calories"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,oh yeah right haha
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Oh no oh no oh no no no
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Why are you just copying other people's comments?
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"I mean sure, when he was a much younger god in his own realm. There‚Äôs like 2,000 years between Greek mythology and Norse mythology. So I think it‚Äôs safe to say Kratos has probably aged a thousand years or more since he was cheating death last. Those were all in the last series as well, back in the fixed camera angle button mashing days, this is a new series with a different direction. Also, in case you haven‚Äôt noticed, the giants don‚Äôt usually miss with their prophecies. It‚Äôs why Odin hates them, they can basically see the future because of their different perception of time and he was immensely jealous of that gift.

However, Kratos does like to fuck shit up. Who knows what will happen, I just wouldn‚Äôt be too surprised if he did die next game."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,make his way back to midgard and then egypt please.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"See my reply to the other guy that brought up how he‚Äôs died before

Edit: you aren‚Äôt wrong tho. I think he‚Äôll die, but honestly who knows."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,[deleted]
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Well Mj√∂lnir can resurrect the dead...
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"I think it‚Äôs the only logical way to move the series forward. 

There‚Äôs still years between the Greek and Norse eras that we could look at too. Like how did Kratos get to Norse, how did he actually survive the end of GoW3. 

And, again, I think we‚Äôll be playing Kratos the majority of this game. I just think it would feel right to finish the game as Atreus, especially since he‚Äôs been learning from Kratos this whole time."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,But do you want to play as Fenir? Because it looked to me like that's what is was implying for Kratos.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Fenrir and Jormungadr are overrated, Hel is the most badass"
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"I'd highly recommend watching this video. 

https://youtu.be/yegRHiaao7U

It shows how all of the changes made were actually *very* deliberate and centre around the big reveal of Atreus being Loki. Loki is one of the gods who appears the most in Norse myths, by removing him it completely changes a lot of the relationships between the gods which leads us to getting things like Baldur being as insane as he was."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Didn't Mimir say that Freya was another name for Frigg in one of the boat tales?
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"That's why you slowly change the main character, rather than just immediately drop kratos. By working in atreus you get the player more familiar. You start the game where he's just some arrows and a whiny voice, by the end he's a crucial mechanic in tougher gameplay and stopping baldur."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"I see your point but atreus has actual character growth and you know where his power comes from, not to mention he can be worked in over the course of 3 games.

Why is Abby so strong? We don't really know... (I've never seen a woman with arms like that) 

Why is Atreus so strong? He's a part god, part mortal, part titan, part giant who is trained by kratos the Greek God of war, the ghost of Sparta who is apparently world renowned for killing Gods. 

And SM isn't Neil Cuckman, they put actual life in their games, and is built around a love for their players, their employees and the story they create. 

Just curious, what would they have to do to make atreus look more like an adult?"

I hate passing-the-torch stories because it kills all emotional investment I've put into a character. The ONLY time it was acceptable to me was the end of Red Dead when John's son got his revenge. Thats the one exception. But everything else just feels like ""We're bored of making this character, so we're gonna replace him. Here's he's infinitely less impressive replacement who you have no real investment in!""

Without Loki there is no vibe check which means Gods ultimately have free reign to do as they please."

pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"If I remember correctly, there is an actual theory with evidence that suggests Frjgg and Freyja were once the same goddess, but got split later on. Many of their ""domains"" seem to play off eachother in ways that make sense when you put them together (goddess of weaving and a goddess that can see things in a Weave), they have a number of similarities such as a husband that is often travelling, stuff like that. Plus, I think Frigg is more of a title than a name. So their decision does have some merit in that there are debates on this idea between scholars.

I think one thing I had heard was that some Christians decided they didn't like how important and powerful a woman was in their mythology and so they split her up, but I'm not a scholar so...

Could remember it wrong though, someone can inform me otherwise, it's been a while since I looked up a lot of norse mythology stuff."

pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,">Just curious, what would they have to do to make atreus look more like an adult?

it's not that he looks like a kid, it's that I've been playing his father. It feels wrong to go from playing Kratos to playing Kratos's kid. Like all the emotional investment is fucked up because the character I have played is dead, and now suddenly I have to be feeling and thinking what an entirely different character is feeling and thinking and it's really jarring. Same thing that happened with Joel. I know that Joel wasn't ellie's father, but it was like an adopted relationship - so that getting completely destroyed kind of just killed any emotional investment I had going forward and I couldn't play through all of TLOU2 because of it.

So if they kill off Kratos to have Atreus be the main character, it's just not going to work for me. Because I'm Kratos, I'm Atreus's father. I can't suddenly just be Atreus and be fine with that mentally. It's why I hate the ""passing the torch"" storylines - because its basically throwing out all the investment you've put in to that point. Just doesn't work for me."

pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Yup, the enchantment on Thor's belt Meginjord gives him a lot of extra strength, though he is quite strong on his own. The hammer Mjolnir's enchantment is it's accuracy when thrown such that it will always hit it's target as well as Thor being able to recall it to him. Marvel actually got that part fairly accurately compared to the mythos. Odin's spear has a very similar enchantment. The dwarves who made the hammer actually thought it was a failure at first b/c they ran out of materials to make the handle a proper length but Thor really liked it and was able to use it anyway."

If I remember correctly, each pantheon rules a different land at the same time, so the Egyptian gods most likely are alive and well during GoW Ragnarok, but merely in Egypt. Also, I think it is mentioned in the book (or comic) that it has been just 50 years between gow 3 and gow 2018, which goes hand in hand with Cory statement (right before the launch of gow 2018) that the game happens before the time in which the vikings were around."

pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"It‚Äôs ok for one story but not another? Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love Red Dead, but how can that be a stronger emotional impact than literally getting revenge for the death of Kratos? I can only imagine how crazy it would be if Atreus was able to use the Blades of Chaos once Kratos died, and in a duel of rage he just goes to town essentially bringing the end to this chapter of the game. 

Kratos has had his story. I‚Äôm sorry you don‚Äôt understand the payout of seeing a story come to an end. We‚Äôve had 4 main series games, going into a 5th, with Kratos at the helm. He has been around for PS2,3,4 and now PS5 eras. 

Kratos trained the shit out of Atreus in God of War, trying to make him a better man than Kratos ever was. I wouldn‚Äôt say you need to currently have an emotional attachment to this character, but hopefully by the end of this game you realize how important this is to Kratos and his story. 

He‚Äôs not some angry guy searching for vengeance anymore. That died with him in GoW3."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Lol how is your one good example RDR? That was so limply handled and honestly made no sense. It exists SOLELY so you can continue to enjoy the open world and awkwardly wrap up any sidequests. 

And in this case, we would jump to Atreus who we have had for 2-3 games already. Jack had like 3 cutscenes before taking over."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-11,If kratos passing kills all your emotional investment into the character then you weren't really invested in them or that is a you problem.  Having him live forever cheapens and limits his character and story and also makes any threats to him seem silly.

pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-11,"It's heavily implied he's the game's version as his mother is named Laufey (Fey, as Kratos calls her) and the tapestry called Kratos ""Farbauti"" (Loki's father in mythology)."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"It seems like he *is* Loki as there wasn't any reference to another Loki in the game. 

Obviously, he's not the Loki from Norse mythology though because it doesn't seem like he is Thors brother etc."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"I mean, you still can if you want, but I finished the game not too long ago and can confirm that that is indeed what Mimir said.

Specifically, because Freya was one of the Vanir and Odin couldn't have anyone thinking the Vanir were anything more than dirty scrubs to be slaughtered, whenever Freya did something awesome, he attributed it to Frigg, which was explained as his pet name for her."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,I'm pretty sure mimir did actually say that ! I know i've heard it when i was boat riding looking for treasures
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Oh, yeah, I see your point. I dont feel the same way towards atreus, mainly because I usually don't feel like I'm the character in a game (unless it's 1st person). To me, atleast when I'm playing, the main character is different from me, as in I don't believe that I am kratos, mainly assisting him get to his goal. 

I think what would be different in gow5 from tlou2 is that kratos's death wouldn't be for ""shock value"" or an ""interesting twist"" or to ""pass the torch"" or even to ""make gameplay different"" kratos's actual death would serve as a pivotal part in the story showing how atreus's growth (that being kratos's training) has well... grown. 

Like I said earlier, atreus is strong because kratos was strong not because the studio wants it and as you play as atreus you will have the pleasure to know that probably one of the greatest god of war there was."

pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"If I remember right, his belt and his gauntlets both double his strength, and he's already one of the strongest among the Aesir. Mjollnir is kind of a failure since the handle got screwed up, which is part of why Thor is the only one that can use it properly. It's awkward as hell since the handle is too short for something meant to be balanced on a two handed hammer. You're also 100% right on the hammers enchantments, but there is also one that is often forgotten: he can shrink it to fit on a necklace, so it's really portable. The dude loves that hammer. 

After Ragnorok, Thor dies and the hammer is taken up by BOTH Magni and Modi because they aren't as strong as Thor, so they have tovwork together to use it."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-11,"The gloves being back mjolnir, not mjolnir itself."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"I reckon she is Norse and will be portrayed as Norse going off the clothing. 

I believe the reason why people are not engaging with you is that the previous game took many liberties with the mythology, for example elves were portrayed as humanoid insects when in the mythology they can be described as winged but not as literal bug people, and Loki is the god of mischief who fathers Hel, Fenrir and Jormungandr, yet in the fourth game he is a good natured child unrelated to the characters I've just mentioned.

It's highly doubtful you and others who are upset by the skin colour of Angrboda were critical of those decisions, therefore it's quite clear that you're quite happy for them to take liberties with the appearances of the characters and their stories, as long as they are not ethnically black.

This leads us who are against racism to assume that you are at the very least prejudiced in some form against ethnically black human beings, and that's a you problem. 

You may wish to protest that you only want the game to stick within the boundaries of the mythology when it comes to human skin colour but many people are indifferent to what skin colour Angrboda has, so again it leads back around to only you and others who are prejudiced against your fellow human beings.

Kratos for example is not voiced by a white Greek man, but a black American man, and Kratos the video game character does not speak Greek but English, yet where is your displeasure at that inaccruacy? It all circles back to you disliking one visible ethnically black person."

Does it fundamentally change the video game (which is, of course, a work of artistic fiction) we're talking about?  Nah.  It's just a silly, pandering move that is disjunctive with the historically based narrative.  I'd love to hear from an African American that said...yes, including a young AA teenager in a game about Greek/Norse mythology is going to positively influence my purchasing decision with regards to this game.  Sincerely.  If you're reading this and this casting choice makes it more likely you'll buy this game, I'm dying to hear from you."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,Some people also bothered by Thor. Since it's a work of fiction they can make whatever they want but it doesn't mean consumers shouldn't have a say about that. It is nothing but simple deisgn criticism imo.

Kratos, however, we've basically been with for what, almost 20 years? through multiple games? He has a much stronger emotional investment to me than John does. Started out as essentially an arcadey gorey beat-em-up into one of the most emotionally impactful stories I've played in years. 

Atreus can never fill Krato's shoes, and as far as I'm concerned Kratos is God of War. Without him, you don't have a God of War series anymore. And I'd rather not end with him fucking dying after everything he's gone through, just to have his unlikable son take over to repeat the process. I'd like him to finish his fight, and them end the series with him triumphant.

TLoU2 wasn't for any of those reasons either. It was directly tied to the plot and the logical conclusion of Joel's arc as a character. You seriously don't think Joel dying served the story they were trying to tell aside from to be a ""twist""?

pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"What about my comment suggests I'm upset?  It's white people myths.  Greeks and Norse.  No one is arguing Greeks and Scandanavian people weren't historically white, right?  It just doesn't make any sense to include a dreadlocked black teenager to the cast at this point.  Any more than throwing John Hamm into a movie about Anansi or Kali.  

That said, I agree completely that representation is different than pandering.  Is the suggestion that the devs *finally* got the message after eight GoW games without any racially diverse characters and absolutely no publicized comments or complaints about it?  Or is it a marketing reaction based on the current sociopolitical climate?  As I've argued elsewhere...I don't have (too much of) a problem with the decision to include a black character...I have a problem with the motivation behind the decision.  I guess if I were African American, and female, and a teenager...I'd still wonder why the hell I'm being ""represented"" in a hyper-violent video game story about a bunch of white people."

pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Except, as I already said the story is barely historically based. Firstly its inspired in mythology, not history, mythology is already a fictional medium, the Norse from back in the day most likely didn't think Angrboda was black, but thing is Angrboda didn't exist, there is no correct way to represent her either because descriptions are very vague from what I've seen and they vary quite a lot.

I'm not saying every videogame SHOULD have black characters and women and disabled people but I believe its nice when they do. And there's absolutely no reason a fictional game about the fictional stories ancient Norse people told each other to not have a black character.

And it's not as if the games were thaaat faithful to the actual mythology. Atreus acts as Loki with all the changes to the story that causes, because the difference is not only race, last I checked Loki was not raised by Kratos. Kratos didn't kill the whole Greek pantheon either.
Actually, making Angrboda black probably changes the story way less than making her a pre-teen. I mean, Hela already exists in the first game and she's supposed to be the daughter of Loki and Angrboda.

Idk mate I just find it hella sus when realism and fidelity only matters when it comes to race, sex and sexual orientation."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,">disjunctive with the historically based narrative. 

Yeah, all that ""history,"" like a fake Greek god fucking a Giant and having their kid be Loki? It's not like they're sticking to the mythos very closely. Criticize ""accuracy"" as much as you want, but you're a hypocrite if you also don't criticize the other, much more blatant inaccuracies as well."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Idk mate, I can't think of a time when criticising the design of a game that doesn't even have a release date has been productive whatsoever.
I understand people being surprised by the designs of Thor and Angrboda because most people did not expect a fat Thor or a black character.

Thor critics get shut down fast because there's always someone to explain how Thor acted in the mythology and how that looks more like a strongman than MCU Thor.

But the only criticism against black Angrboda has been that it's not historically accurate. And saying that about a completely fictional game about a Greek demigod killing Norse gods sounds pretty dumb. 
Like ""you're not being historically accurate on your mashup of two historical fiction lores"""
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"No, because it‚Äôs artist interpretation. If I felt compelled to be upset or butch about I‚Äôll just make my own.

pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,I‚Äôd say most of the cast from the original games had Greek motifs. Although the design to evoke the cultural aesthetic has definitely improved with time. I mean the Norse costume design is fantastic.
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"I thought I remembered Mimir saying that, but I couldn't remember if it was actually him or some fan theory I read on Reddit. For Skol and Hati I think the only other thing that validates the idea that Fenrir was bound a while ago, is that Mimir mentions the unbreakable chains and says that they're a legend. 

However, if we look at Tyr in the trailer we can see that he has both hands... Meaning Fenrir hasn't been chained yet since that's when Fenrir bites of Tyrs hand. Damn time travel."
pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Well in the myths he ended tied up in a rock with a drop of poison burning his body from time to time...

pldszu,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,I get a feeling that Angrboda being black will actually be a plot point. I'm thinking she has some relation to Tyr and his travels. Maybe she's originally from some other mythology like Kratos and like Atreus has a name from that mythology and from Norse mythology.

Maybe, as someone pointed out, this character being black ties into the story, or maybe they decided to make her black because her skin colour is irrelevant to the story and they wanted to not be snow-white anymore.

Yes. Nigh any kind of fiction should have authenticity. Otherwise, we could only make dreams of addicts (without any world-building and authenticity) and the previous games are anything but dreams of addicts.

yrcmm2,2022-11-10,2022-11-10,"In Romania, things work differently. We have a very rich street culture, so painting it supports the artists and also the city's aesthetic (we have a lot of painted trams, but usually they have a generic design, not sponsored or something). Also, I took this particular tram to work today, so I m telling you, it's the real deal."

yrcmm2,2022-11-10,2022-11-10,Would you clean it off? I would of figured you'd just paint the next design over top.
yrcmm2,2022-11-10,2022-11-10,"There's a wall near one of the train stations I use (in Australia) that has advertisements painted onto it. It gets a new advertisement painted onto it every few weeks or months. I've seen them painting it, and they trace the image from some kind of paper, and then paint over that. It's about a few days to a week until I see it finished? Then when they do a new one they just paint over it.  Don't know how much it costs, but I guess it's profitable enough that they paint a new ad every now and then."

yrcmm2,2022-11-10,2022-11-11,No. It's gotta be done by foot.
yrcmm2,2022-11-10,2022-11-11,"""hand painted"" means done by hand, not a machine."
yrcmm2,2022-11-10,2022-11-10,So then it's hand painted.

yrcmm2,2022-11-10,2022-11-10,"lol, we have 30-year-old trams that are never painted, nobody cleans or covers paint, my man"
yrcmm2,2022-11-10,2022-11-10,Why would they? Those guys are payed to paint the trams. The trams in Bucharest are not the newest or the prettiest so the city hall contracted artists to give them a fresh coat of painting.

When they miss however‚Ä¶ Well, just look at the state The Last of Us releases in and how messy the Uncharted ports still are.

Respawn needs to take classes from Sony Santa Monica, Nixxes and JetPack Interactive on how to optimize and engineer their games.



Eurogamer interviewed JetPack and a cool tidbit from one of the¬†devs, who did the GoW:R PC port, was it's a lot easier making a great PC port when the baseline game is in great shape. Also, like 15 people did this port.¬† Makes Rockstar's delayed PC ports look even more pathetic.

Most of the puzzles take a minute of exploration so yea, not sure what feedback they listened to for hints to be added in the first place. It should be auto toggled off, but one of the first things I saw in the pre game set up menu was that toggle. I know people rush into the game but it was staring everyone in the face üò¨"
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-22,"That's wird, because I can't even remember any of them spoiling any of the puzzles. To be fair, every single puzzle was super easy and I figured them out right away.

1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-22,I don't get why they didn't do it the other way around tbh. Let people solve the puzzles themselves and include an option that let's people that are just playing for the action basically skip them.
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-22,Worst part about the game imo. That never should have been included the game it could have been almost perfect otherwise.
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-22,It's like they learned nothing from the complaints about Skyward Sword.
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-22,As a dad with young children who loves video games and gets literally no time to myself it was my favorite part of the game. Let me play and rush if I was short on time and if I had some I could change it up and exercise my brain
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-21,I didn‚Äôt get GoWr to think!  I got it for touching father son moments and cleaving MF‚Äôers in half with an axe
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-21,Doubt it's 10 seconds cause I usually solve the puzzles faster then then the help comments can come in
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-21,Its a modern game. If you use your brain at lest 10% you wont get stuck for sure
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-22,"the naughty dog games did it really well, it was extremely clumsy in this one. they tell you what to do instantly. i felt like gow2018 was very immersive but this was the opposite of immersive."
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-22,there was no option on launch (not sure if it got patched in later for console) and horizon had it patched in post launch too. definitely not standard
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-24,I dont mind it if its a story game with easy puzzles if it feels seamless. When it feels like a punch to the face or the gameplay is puzzles then its bad.
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-22,"yeah fair enough, i lasted about 2 or 3 hours and then i just sold my copy. i heard something about santa monica not being sure the game would be any good like 2 weeks before it dropped, i feel like its cos it wasn't good it was just pretty and riding on the coattails of the MASTERPIECE of gow2018

how about the crawling sections every 2 min for the PS4 version to be able to keep up? this game made me irrationally angry it was so disappointing"
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-22,"Reduced is off in my experience. I've not had a single one since turning it on, at most an occasional 'up there' which never makes any sense anyway. Just finished Alfheim where the puzzles were abundant and had no help ü§∑üèº"

1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-22,"We can have both, the PS5 games have been good on pc with a few misses here and there but generally they're very competent ports, some even have ray tracing elements implemented. 

We'll soon enter the 4th generation of graphics cards with dedicated ray tracing hardware, it has come a long way since the rtx 20 series came out 6 years ago, we have AI upscaling and frame generation for a while now. Sony even added their own AI upscaling to the PS5 Pro.

Ray traced global illumination is becoming more and more prevalent, Avatar and Star Wars outlaws have it as default for example and Metro Exodus enhanced edition came out more than 3 years ago.

While the more taxing ray traced options weren't really attainable before the 3090, that card came out 4 years ago. This current gen of console is starting to hold back more capable hardware and it sure doesn't help that they still develop games for the PS4 and that Microsoft shoot themselves in the foot with the series S."
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-21,It can be a double edged sword. Games like uncharted 4 and God of war 2018 don't look that great on pc to me and have noticeably lower quality textures due to originally being a ps4 only game and just having upscaled assets. But developing both versions in unison seems to be a good way of having lower quality settings that actually do what they say. Usually when you play a game at low settings it's more like high and has a 10% difference in terms of performance vs ultra.
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-21,You need a PSN account. I think that's where the majority of the negativity is coming from.

1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-21,"That doesn't matter in the slightest and is in fact part of the problem. When the product is free you're the product. Account linking means sharing of personal information across platforms and data compromising. 

It's more about the principle. I'm not going to budge on it. PSN can get removed and then I'll buy, but I won't spend a cent for a product with strings attached. Account requirements have no place in a single player game."
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-21,Oh thank god
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-21,"It's extra odd because Uncharted figured this out on the PS3. After a couple minutes a ""Press R3 for hint"" would pop up. Then you could decide if you wanted a hint or not."
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-21,"It was really annoying.

I'd reach a puzzle section. Start having a gander around while thinking in my head and then atreus shouts the answer as I'm about to have my ahaa! Moment

It happened very frequently"
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-22,Hopefully it‚Äôs patched in I‚Äôve been sitting in my PS5 version
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-22,"Oh damn, it might be bugged for me as I didn't really notice a difference when toggling it to reduced!"
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-21,"I just found a thread saying this feature will come to the PS5 version in a update soon, maybe it was something else"
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-22,The Atreus parts are a slog on replays. Never wanna see Ironwood again
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-22,I've never heard this saying before but I love it lol
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-22,"Sorry, you can‚Äôt have highly optimized and chase an ever changing ‚Äúbest graphics‚Äù finish line.  You can choose to keep complaining about it, as you did."
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-21,"Just look at GTAV, it looks like it still has some of those PS3 assets in game.  It‚Äôs weird to have it on PS5 supporting some form of raytracing and then being able to pixel count the resolution of some textures."
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-21,"Oh okay, then maybe i will get it then.   I already have it on PS4 AND PS5, so ive already got a PSN account, but ive just not been able to buckle down and finish it.  I keep getting to that first Realm in that Dwarf city, but then life takes over.   The portability of Steam Deck would really help me buckle down and finish


But its full price right now, so im fine waiting longer until a sale pops up"
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-21,It's on Steam.
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-21,I mean it‚Äôs all PS4/last gen graphics.  It‚Äôs not bad but it‚Äôs nothing new/amazing.
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-22,"I'm so glad I don't have principles, this game is so much fun!!!"
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-22,"You know reddit is collecting your data too, right? If I had to guess, I would say reddit collects way, way, way more than Sony."
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-22,"OR

You can just lie on the account creation, but you enjoy that imaginary high horse"
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-21,"I like that idea üëçüèº. Sidenote I've really been enjoying the dialogues when you do something, odd? E.g. going back to the Yggdrasil jump and Artreus says something (won't spoil), also throwing your axe at the 'creatures' from the 'treehouse' triggers one. I've come across a few and each time I find myself responding irl ü§£"
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-22,Well I guess they thought people that play God of War were mainly playing it for the action and would get annoyed by puzzles. Uncharted is an action adventure so puzzles are common in this kind of game and why people play it between all the other reasons.
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-22,Maybe each studio not talking to each other¬†
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-24,"I think a tomb raider game also did that, but for some reason they figured pressing a button is too difficult for people"
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-22,"Hmm yea that is interesting, sorry I can't help much more than that really. Maybe verify the files and see if that makes a difference? Hope you get it sorted ‚úåüèº"
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-21,"~~I'm re-downloading Ragnarok to double check, but I'm like 90% sure.~~

Edit: Apparently 10% idiot is enough"
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-23,"I hated the Atreus parts the first time through; they're a big reason I'm hesitant to play through again, unless I find a mod that let's you skip them entirely"
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-21,"I‚Äôm sure there are a lot of PS3 era assets in the game across the board. When they ported to the PS4 era they didn‚Äôt upgrade every single thing, some old assets snuck through. At the end of the day it‚Äôs still a PS3/360 era game with some new paint on top"
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-21,"You can't play it offline on steamdeck if you sign into PSN, at least, at the moment anyway. Maybe that's a bug idk, and maybe it's fixed by the time I'm writing this, someone can test it. I got deluxe on cd keys for ¬£45 üëçüèº depends how you feel about grey area sites."
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-21,"Oh, it's published by Sony, isn't it? My region doesn't have PSN, so is not on steam for me. gg."
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-21,No. It's a modern game on PC and you can run it in actual 4k. Looks awful on the ps4 in comparison.
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-21,"From what I can see there are already options to reduce hints, but new update is to turn it off completely"
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-21,"Been awhile, but the PC and PS4 era versions did see increased fidelity.   I‚Äôm sure you can find endless comparison videos on YouTube.  Hell, just the resolution jump itself was huge."
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-22,"I see no need at all to be connected to PSN, such a stupid decision that prevents many from enjoying this fabulous game."
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-21,"It‚Äôs not a modern PC game graphically.  It was built for the PS4 and ported over to PC.  It clearly shows.

I play it DLAA 4K on a 4090 and I‚Äôve played every cutting edge graphics games."
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-22,Dude I was so wrong. I apologize to you.
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-21,Yeah a lot of it was but my point is there‚Äôs still some thing you can find that went unchanged as well
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-21,Cool story. It still looks fantastic.
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-22,"It's okay lol, I'll be keeping a eye on for the update, I want to replay the game after seeing people playing it on PC"
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-22,Agreed. People arguing the latter just seem ignorant to how game development works
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-21,It looks like a ps4 game at 4k dude
1fmay4k,2024-09-21,2024-09-22,"Don't have the PS5 version but you might have stumbled over a similar worded setting which allows to extend the time to solve some puzzles. Like when you have to hit two points consecutively within 5 seconds it will grant you 10 seconds instead.

I know I did. Got Ragnarok on PC launch day and having heard about the annoying hints and the newly introduced option to reduce these hints I immediately went to the settings. Stumbled over the timing setting and thought that can't be it."

10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,Do they work or are they just cosmetic?
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,If you think about it its a perfect place for kratos he gets to kill gods and slay insainly powerful beings.
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,Bruuuuuh how to take a screenshot is like PC 101.  Uugghhhh this bothers me way more than it should.

10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,I hate when people mod Skyrim to the point it isn‚Äôt even Skyrim anymore

10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,It took me a minute to realize what was wrong with the image
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,When Kratos' stuff never lost and his boat drifted a different direction.

10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,When Kratos killed Margot the fell it was prob one of the hypes moments
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,"For the people that don't know, this is an Elden Ring mod, not the actual god of war game."

10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,"Ignoring PC mod (really funny though)

This game deserves GOTY and not Elden Ring. I don‚Äôt care if people disagree but God of War Ragnarok was a platinum game!"
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,Where on PC? Steam ? I need this game.
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,"I was about to angrily comment thanks for the spoiler, but then I realized this screenshot looks much better than GoW"
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,"Those weapons are probably in Elden Ring, but they also look like the gauntlets Hercules uses against Kratos (and then visa versa) on God of War 3. That's cool"
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,I like the 666 upvotes
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,I also take screenshots of my pc monitor with my phone.
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,Looks like a better version of GoW Ragnarok to me.
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,"Ahhh yes. Yet another PC gamer who doesn't know how to screenshot.

Please let me introduce you to Lightshot."
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,That could actually make Elden Ring interesting for about 30 seconds.
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,"Man, it would be nice to play Ragnarok with an actual functioning combat system.

And before anyone comes in here with ""git gud"", keep that shit to yourself.  I beat it on GMGoW; it was absolute cancer in combat.  The story was absolutely fantastic though."

10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,Was gonna say the combat is great when you get comfortable with it and find that rhythm. Bought when I fought Modi & Magni is when it clicked for me and the experience went exponentially better.

10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,I mean i appreciate it well enough. Never seen his weapons modded in.
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,Lmao at these screenshot elitists ü§°ü§°ü§°
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13, Hulk voice action?
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,Wait are those the tiger fists you get from Hercules in god of war 3? Are they in the new god of war?
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,"I didn't conciously notice it.

The FP baloons gave it away :D"
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,Ctrl + Shift + S is absolutely the best and most important shortcut I use TBH. So convenient and quick.
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,"Pfft. 

Windows+shift+S, let's you take a picture of a specific part of your screen.

You're welcome"
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,TIL
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,I didn't even know about using only print screen because it did absolutely nothing for me
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,"True, but last I checked (which was like 3-4 years ago), sharing from PS4 to Reddit was way more effort than it's worth."
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,This looks like a screenshot from Elden Ring or Skyrim.
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,There are a hundred ways to get a picture from your pc to phone
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,I think that was his joke
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,"Skyrim looked fucking great for it‚Äôs time, and still does tbh"
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,You have no idea how wrong you are lmao
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,More amazed at people's prevalent stupidity and laziness.

10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,Ok cool. I've got that on my wish list.
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,"That's great, crazy what can be modded."
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,"You realize you're arguing FOR my point, right?

There's a hundred ways to do it....but taking a picture of your monitor from your phone is horrific and has the same energy as a boomer not knowing how to email.

I only mentioned Lightshot because it's my favorite screenshot software."
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,"That would be in GOW 2018, which I think actually had better combat than Ragnarok."
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,"Nah, is not. Is a massive downgrade from the OG trilogy in that department."
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,"No he's not. Playing as Artreus is painfully boring. The pacing on this game was seriously bad. I couldn't put the last one down and I truly do not care if I ever play ragnarok again, having stopped around halfway.  
Edit: If you enjoyed the tedious, awful Agraboda section you are a masochist, a liar, or can't accept you wasted $70."
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,Is there even need to explain?
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-16,"Might be, yet I still find it disgusting to see such a great game end up like this. Go mod sekiro, great game but still lacking some stuff."
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,"The game is too good to end up being modded. I would understand doing it to minor games, but not to this kind of games."
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-16,"Oh definitely not, mods are awesome...with different games. Mods should go into games that aren't that good like Sekiro for example, great game but there is a lot which could have been done. Or like Minecraft which has lot of potential which kinda gets shown by mods. I could tollerate like graphic mods (even in ELDEN RING) but this is just too much."
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,Never played elden ring but thanks bc u almost had me tripping
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,"No shit , i know"
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,"Its funny, this is my single most downvoted thing ive put on reddit"
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,No they aren‚Äôt.
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,"Yes they‚Äôre the fists, no it‚Äôs not in ragnarok"
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-16,This is 99% of my emails. Clip stuff without showing private info or verbiage.
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,You‚Äôre so smart! Good job!
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,Yeah you're right idk why you're getting so many downvotes
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,All that effort for a screenshot ü§£
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,Weird comment. ‚ÄúLooking good for its time‚Äù implies it doesn‚Äôt look good now.
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,Wanna provide an example? ü§î
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,"It‚Äôs definitely amazing, it always surprises me how much talent the community has."
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,"I was agreeing with you and adding to it, not arguing against."
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,To each their own I guess
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,If you want people to understand things that don't make sense
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,"Yes, please explain your absolutely wrong opinion"
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,I dont understand what is wrong with a game being modded? A game has to be bad or mediocre to warrant mods?
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,You're good; haven't played it either but that big glowy tree in the background is in tons of screencaps.
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,"Thanks, that was a nice thing to say."
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,"He was stating something obvious and being a picture of Skyrim makes literally zero sense, there's no Elden Ring map mod on Skyrim and the graphics look like Elden Ring anyways, even with mods Skyrim doesn't look as good as Elden Ring or God Of War."
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,"I didn't make fun of colored people, so the joke didn't stick."
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,"All the effort for a mod then all the comments shit on it for a bad screenshot

Why not just do it right?"
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,"Can‚Äôt remember the name, but that underground cave with the glowing mushrooms is pretty fuckin dank"
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,But what is there to explain? Skyrim and fallout being on PC and having mods completely killed them as games /s
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,"It is a shame that such a great game like ELDEN ring ends up getting modded. I would understand for a game like FIFA or any Basketball game or similar (also non sport) game, but for ELDEN ring?? Nhaa"
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-16,"More or less. When it comes to moddig already great games, I honestly don't see the point. Like Sekiro could be modded without any complaints, it is a good game but still isn't as great as this one."
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,Dude said elden ring or skyrim. And I didn't notice it was elden ring at first so there you go obviously it's not so obvious for some people.
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,Skyrim with mods looks wayyy better than Elden Ring.
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,Fuckin what?
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,Do it right he says! ü§£ü§£
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,Blackreach?
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,Its cool but doesn‚Äôt look as good as this area
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,Yeah that place is pretty cool.. haha okay maybe there are a few examples üòÇ
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,"Ahhh so THAT is what he meant.

I guess that makes sense. Being able to modify your single player game in the way you want, in the privacy of your own home, is detrimental to the entire franchise of course.

I apologise for not getting that sooner"
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,"Wow. Maybe you should try having fun sometime, you might be less of an asshole. Who gives a fuck what people mod into their own game? I personally love the mods that change some move sets. I like to beat the vanilla game first then see what crazy shit some random modders come up with. Some people are very creative with what little they have to work with."
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-16,What the hell are you on about? Skyrim is mid? Minecraft and terraria are mid?
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,"No, it obviously isn't Skyrim, the exact game isn't 100% noticeable but it's very clear that it isn't *Skyrim*."
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,Funny joke.
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,"Ya know, people like it when someone makes fun of some CHARCOAL ORANGUTANS from time to time, and since I went with the pc route people didn't like it."
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,Bingo!
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,If we‚Äôre considering how old Skyrim is tho.. it holds up pretty well
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,"Apart from that, you should count in the age difference. Skyrim is close to 10 years older than elden ring, yet it can keep up and at some points even outmatch elden ring."
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,"ELDEN RING isn't single player and that isn't entirely what I ment. What I really wanted to say is that it is a shame that a great game like that gets modified like this, thus certain games should never make it to pc to avoid this kind of situations. Ofc that's just my opinion."
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-16,"And I am not saying they shouldn't do it, just do it with different games. What necessity is there to mod such a great game? Like what is it, are you not satisfied with what the game is? Why do you feel the urge of changing this masterpiece. I would accept graphic mods but don't change the gaming experience too much...it is such a waste on an already great game. Try mod sekiro, great game but could be even better with mods."
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-18,"Skyrim is an old game just as minectraft and terraria (never playied terraria). Plus they all have so much potential which isn't ""well used"" by the producers. But I want to remark that I never said that Skyrim nor Minecraft are mid, I simply said that Skyrim can be modded for the same reasons I have mentioned in this comment."
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,Thank God if you read his comment he says elden ring or skyrim.
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,Only someone who has never properly modded Skyrim can say that Elden Ring looks better than a modded Skyrim. Or maybe you've not played games that actually look great to see that Elden Ring has mediocre graphics when compared to other AAA games.
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,Charcoals orangutans????? Ha
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,Some people become messed up from the internet but others like you are messed up long before using it
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,That's what people don't really consider
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,It can certainly outmatch elden ring in how many times they use the same VA lol
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,It definitely hasn‚Äôt outmatched ER in any regard
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,"Actually, if I'm not mistaken, it becomes a single player game once you start to mod. As From is very strict against alterations.

So it is a single player game at this point.

And you still haven't explained your ""like this"". What the hell's the problem?"
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,It is a single player game with optional multiplayer functionality. People should be free to mod singleplayer aspects as long as they don't force those changes unwillingly upon others through multiplayer.
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,What a stupid fucking opinion
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-16,"Ok, I get it now. You really are just an asshole who thinks he knows better than everyone else. For the good of all mankind, please don't procreate."
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,"Yes, but the map of Elden Ring is very unique and it's very clear it isn't Skyrim, his comment wasn't exactly needed, and he wouldn't have gotten downvoted if he hadn't said something both stupid and quite obvious."
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,"I've played Spider-Man 2018, God Of War 2018, Spider-Man: Miles Morales, and God Of War: Ragnar√∂k, and more but those are just the ones I'm listing, all of those games look better than Elden Ring yet Skyrim doesn't come close, I've seen it with mods."
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,"Or MUD DONKEYS or whatever else the left calls black folk, politics is also fun to bring up."
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,"Probably, still on here interacting with normal people on the regular, and guess what? They don't even fucken know just how radical my political agenda is becoming."
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-16,"I would tolerate like graphic mods or similar stuff but adding moves, weapons and anything that essentially changes the game is just too much. And also, considering that the company itself won't allow you to play ""the full experience"" with mods (doesn't change the fact that the game remains a multiplayer game even if you can't acces the feature) says it all. Games that were supposed to be modded had an in-game feature which allowed you to do so, I am thinking of Skyrim and Fallout 4 (on console you have a mod menu right from the start, idk about pc) or like Minecraft. ELDEN RING is just too good to end up being modded, go mod sekiro, great game but lacking some stuff."
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-16,There is nothing wrong with modding this game but the thing is that I consider it too good to be modded. I would accept graphic mods or similar but mods that change the gaming experience too much are just ruining the game.
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-16,As you wish buddy.
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-16,So your saying that there is a point in moddig that game? I would kinda tollerate adding new moves or animations...but Kratos????? What on EARTH?
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,Its obviously Elden Ring or Mario Kart
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,"I can't help but notice that all the games you mentioned are/were PS exclusives. And you are saying ""I've seen it with mods"", so I can safely assume that you are not a PC gamer, and haven't played extensively modded Skyrim yourself. Which would make the assumption in my previous comment accurate."
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,"By radical, you clearly mean it in a surfer bro context. Like a ""TOTALLY RADICAL POLITICAL AGENDA"" That's ""FAR OUT"" Dude!"
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-16,"Actually, it is a single player game then still. It just has a few multiplayer features, which are promptly turned off. You still play by yourself 99% of the time. Ever played an actual multiplayer game? You should be able to tell the difference..

Bethesda games don't have a mod menu.... have you ever actually modded anything? It's a debug menu, modding is something different entirely. Try understanding modding first before judging it

And again, that's still their own damn decision. If you can't grasp the simple fact that people's mods are their own damn business then I don't know what else to tell you. 

Sorry that \*you\* dislike it, but \*your\* dislikes are \*your\* problem. Using that as a reason to ban a game from an entire platform is just petty, and the kind of behaviour only toddlers are expected to deal with"
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,"No, those PS exclusives are just the best looking games I can come up with, I play PC too, and have played Spider-Man and God Of War on PC actually, you can't just assume that because the games were PS exclusive and actually not even exclusive because they're on PC too, your comment was not accurate."
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,"Nah, extremist middle all the way bro"
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-16,Fallout 4 and Skyrim do have a mods menu in the main menu...go look for it. Moddig great games like ELDEN RING has just no meaning. I would understand (kinda) additional moves or additional features...but this kind of nodding is just too much. It would be like buying a Ferrari to then have Lamborghini stickers on it...
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,"God of War Ragnarok is PS exclusive. And the rest were PS exclusives initially.

You have never said that you have played properly modded Skyrim on PC. In which case you don't have enough information to base an opinion, making our discussion pointless.

Have a nice day. Bye."
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,"Noice broh! I ripped through the EXTREMEST  wave today bro. I shot down the MIDDLE of a friggin' gnarly tube dude . I rode that wave ALL THE WAY to shore. I totally like, vibe with your vibes BRO. For sure"
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-16,"No, that is the creation club. It is not your standard mod menu, it is an attempt by Bethesda at monotizing mods.

Mods are an effort by a large user-originated effort. Not something done by the original devs. If you want to see what an actual mod platform looks like, visit Nexusmods.

And again, you don't decide shit on what is too much. It's really fucking amazing that you think Elden Ring is perfect the way it is, truly. But there are people that want something to add to it, which is when mods come into play. 

How completely and utterly selfish do you have to be to declare that *your* opinion is the rule? To declare that Elden Ring is not to be modded?

If you can't grasp utterly simple fact of life by your next comment, then I have nothing more to say. Have fun living in your fantasy world Mussolini"
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-14,"Brou, that's totally fire. Haven't surfed since my bitch ex gave me aids"
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-16,"Man jeez Luise creation club is a thing separate, there are mods created by people. Have you ever played Skyrim or Fallout 4 on console??? There is an actual mod menu in the main menu. You know, technically you are ruling over me since you are imposing that only because you CAN mod something it means that you SHOULD. Can and should are totally different btw. I am not saying that ELDEN RING is perfect but from a small mod to graphics and animations to adding a totally not related character to the game there is big difference. Too much is just too much and that it too much. I am not saying that my opinion is the rule, actually quite the opposite. I am just trying to share to some people that what has been done in this post is an example of how people will never be satisfied with anything. This game is one of the best ever made and even just the thought of moddig it is extreme, imagine how much more ""out of the ordinary"" is to actually do it. In addition to that, you were victimising the poor modders who spend time and energy to create mods. They are true artists and I am amazed with what they do and sometimes wonder why companies don't hire them all...but I hope that you do realise that the same thing can be said about the original programmers which spent much more time and much more energy to bring to you a game that not only you are enjoying and have enjoyed but you also dare to suggest (because if you mod it and add stuff which isn't there in the first place it means that it isn't enough) that the game they have worked on isn't nearly enough to what you would like to have. This is an exaggeration ofc, just like yours."
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-16,You actively suggested that Elden Ring should never have been ported to PC because it is being modded upon. How is that not forcing it?
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-18,"It isn't forcing because I didn't come to your house to make sure that you will never be able to download the game on pc. I am just sharing an opinion which I think should be in more people's minds but I am not in the need of you thinking the same thing. I am explaining to you my reasoning and my claims, nothing more."
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-19,"So what that you don't do it in practice? Your opinion is entirely based on not being able to let others have their fun. That is garbage no matter how you look at it.

And the fact that you think others should think the same way is just revolting. I'm done talking to you, quite frankly. Maybe your parents can still salvage some of it.

Have a good day. I'll have one too, as it's my damn choice"
10ar9gd,2023-01-13,2023-01-19,"Again I am not forcing my opinion on anyone, otherwise it would be much more effective. I am simply sharing an opinion dude, why do you keep saying I am imposing it on ppl?"
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-30,"Awesome.  The previous PC port for God of War was great, and I've heard Ragnorak has been a great sequel."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-30,Oh hell yes! I've been waiting for this ever since God of War 2018 made it to PC. That game is a beautiful experience and send me scrambling to play the rest of the series. Hopefully this PC port will be just as a cleanly executed as the previous one.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-30,"The comment section on the PlayStation blog website is just full of people malding over more people getting to play the game. Kinda sad to see people supporting exclusives, because I think the more people that get to play a game, the better.

1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"Nice, as a PC/PS5 player, I'm glad the PC only crowd gets to play this awesome game.


That being said, have fun in Ironwood..."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"Why do I need a PSN account for a singleplayer game?

I already have one so it‚Äôs not a big deal for me, but why are people in nearly 200 countries barred from playing a singleplayer game because PSN accounts can‚Äôt be made in their region?"
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-30,I‚Äôll wait for the mod that makes everyone shut the fuck up so they don‚Äôt tell me the solution to extremely easy puzzles 2 seconds into me trying to figure it out

1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,One of the fans' favourite game is coming to PC. It's good news for most of us.

1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-30,Awesome.  I'm stoked the pc players get to play it so soon. I really enjoyed it and would love to share the joy!
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,Another reason to sell my ps5
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,...with mandatory PSN network/steam account linking.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"That's why i sold my ps5, everything is coming to PC. Love it"
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,Only in 18 countries.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,c'mon Spider-Man!
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,I did 100% couple days ago. A Great sequel.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"A little bit bittersweet to me because even though I really liked God of War, I was a lot more excited to play TLOU2 on PC, and with this one releasing in September, it basically confirms TLOU2 would come even later, perhaps next year.. to coincide with the new season"

1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,Im so hyped I just skipped to the end for the date because I'm not getting spoiled now after 2 years of avoiding them (please dont lol)
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,idk but not a peep on talking about this on ps5 sub at all.. find that very odd.

1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-06-03,One of the best games in terms of combat system...
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-06-27,Oh great... Another PC PlayStation port before bloodborne port. ITS BEEN 9 YEARS SONY. DO SOMETHING WITH YOUR GAMES! WHY DO YOU HATE MONEY???
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"aaand you need a shitty PSN account for it, there goes all my excitement. fuck sony"

1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,Too little too late. I want to play a game like that while its in conversation. Now they can shove it.

1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,Good. Will get it after some mods are released to skip or remove the most annoying parts of the game.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"lol it's not coming to PC, PC games when they release are not region locked, this one is.

it's only coming for the select few PRIVILEGED countries, make that clear.

  
The game is going to be locked behind PSN accounts again and only launch in supported countries like Tsushima did because we're not all priviliged American.

The Americanos stopped giving a shit about us when they got their helldivers demands met, Helldivers got removed from our steam stores and now the 170+ countries they pretended to care about are nowhere to be mentioned anymore on their never ending culture war videos."

1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"So many games require specific account requirements, what is the deal with everyone getting up in arms over PSN? I wish people threw the same fit over other companies to be honest. Activision/Blizzard might be the worst one for me."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-30,"It's amazing and worth the time, however great the first one was is definitely eclipsed by this one.

Can't wait to play this again. I might just sell my PS5 at this point"
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,You won't regret playing this game when you do.

1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,Totally awesome sequel.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"Honestly controversial but not so much no. Having played both 4 & 5, both are kinda pale imitations of what God of War used to be.¬†


The Greek Era games were a lot better. Ragnarok kind of wrote Kratos into an endpoint you can't narratively recover from, and more or less ruined what the character once was.¬†


That and the changes from 4 that didn't appeal made me give Ragnarok a 6/10 and 4 a 7/10, as compared to the masterpieces of the greek era which I universally give 10/10 and 11/10 scores, especially God of War 2 and 1.¬†"
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"Good mechanics, awful main characters with ultra cringe lines like ""BOW BEFORE THE QUEEN!!!"" and super stupid main plotline."

1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,2018 is better
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"I game on ps5 basically exclusively (I have a steam deck but mostly play emulators on it) seeing other ps players upset over shit like this is so fucking cringe and weird. Why would more people enjoying something you like make you upset, it makes no sense. If anything the more the merrier, if the game does well and you like it supporting the devs is the right and best thing to do. It at the least would raise the chances of a sequel or expansion, this situation is a win win for everyone involved"
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"sony simps are actually insane. as someone who already owns the game on ps5, I'm underwhelmed that this is the only announcement, but of course I'd be excited about being able to play the game in more places."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"Makes them feel superior. As if ports can't take advantage of superior hardware. Invariably it is always the ""other system"" that is inferior."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"Wtf? I've been a Playstation guy for 25 years and nothing makes me happier than seeing my favorite gaming franchises get more recognition. I wish XBOX users could play Helldivers 2, it would make the game better. What a weird cult-esque mentality to have over a gaming console."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"It's all about the power. People want to do everything to feel it. One way to achieve this is to believe you belong to ""exclusive group"", silently thinking this group is superior. Simple psychology. Surprising thing is, people don't grow out of it."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,Can't understand those people. I got my PS5 because of Ragnarok and I'm happy my friends who don't own one will e able to play it on pc.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,Kids being kids. This stuff is life or death stuff if your balls haven't dropped.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"doesn't matter, those people won't affect the company's decisions, what speaks to companies the most is money, not a bunch of immature fans who might be loud enough so you will recognize them but are still insignificant compared to the majority of their audience that supports PC ports or doesn't care if the game will come out to PC."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"One argument is that these games were original and good because they were exclusive and financially supported by Sony. So if games are going to lose exclusivity, Sony may not invest so much, because they will no longer be system sellers. Therefore the quality could decline."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,The people wanting it to be exclusive and the people screaming about making a PSN account/link should all be forced to live with each other in some shitty gamer camp.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-30,Unfortunate and quite sucky. The game doesn't have an online component to it. All this does is restrict who can play the game. Because PSN is only available in like 60 something countries.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"Serious concern: So does that mean it will be subject to region blocks, like Tsushima?"
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-30,FUCK SONY! Fix this shit!
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,Gah!!! Bunch of bitter little bitches in there because more people get to play the game. I don‚Äôt understand those people at all.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,Yup. I won't be buying. There is no reason for single-player games requiring yet another account and Internet connection to play. I don't have a PSN account. I will not make one.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-30,"And thus here comes the wave of gamers likely unaffected but still angry they have to make a free PSN account. 

It is a bit odd to require it on a sololy single player game however."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-30,Hopefully modders will fix that BS like with SimCity.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"This new drama is such a non-drama, it really is a slow news time... guess what people I had to log into my ubisoft account to try xdefiant. I didn't write an article about it."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-30,"I mean, I‚Äôm excited for the port, but why preorder?"
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-30,"I'm hyped as fuck, finally!"
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-30,"About time? It came out on PS5 18 months ago, by far Sony‚Äôs fastest turn around for a first party game"
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,Demon's Souls!
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,Just imagine all the bitching and moaning when it's announced that a PSN account will obviously be needed.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,pc port for bloodborne would've made a super underwhelming state of play actually decent

1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-30,What do you mean fast? The game is soon two years old.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,oh no... so you dont game at all anymore? Thats literally every game on every platform
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,Ironwood is one of my favourite parts in the game
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"Yes.  I actually quit the game in the middle of the first area, because I had HEEED and BOY just yelling out, ""Have you tried this rope?!"", ""What about this platform over here?? Looks suspicious!!""

You don't even get a chance to look over the whole thing before they start yelling out the solutions.

I have no idea what the hell they were thinking, why not just put in a QTE, ""PUSH X TO SOLVE PUZZLE""?"
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"Your mom was required for you to be born, I think thats annoying but here we are and im not writing an article about it because its fucking obvious and not important at all."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"It's going to suck if the game will use Denuvo, that crap tanks FPS like nothing else."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,Happy to gargle every other company that needs an account though?
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,Turn the difficulty up so the combat becomes a challenge. Once you have to master the mechanics to make it through fights I think it becomes a lot more fun. Just my two cents.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,What parts are you talking about exactly?
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,If you hate America so much you're on the wrong website.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"Some people do not want to deal with the time and cost of building a PC/PC ecosystem or buying an expensive prebuilt or dealing with driver issues, faulty components, or growing number of launchers and accounts for games. They just want a simple, reasonably-priced plug and play machine."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"You need to spend about $300 USD more for a custom PC that can match a PS5's performance. That's not an insignificant amount of money for many people, and if someone is going to be playing mostly single-player games, PC isn't going to be worth the extra cost. PlayStation will be fine, you're overreacting."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-30,"People shouldn't preorder games honestly. It just reinforces the ""we'll fix it later"" mentality that's seemed to infect a lot of companies. Look at the awful TLoU release where the game was an unpotimized waste until the performance issues were fixed."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,I preferred 2018 to Ragnarok. But I think Valhalla is my favourite of it all.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,oh dear you seem to be injured in the head
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"this is shit redditors get mad about it doesnt actually affect sales or public opinion. same with drm. Im not with it, but it doesnt matter"
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-06-02,Oh noes!!! Not a PSN account!!!
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"Cool, and?"
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"And Ragnarok is still a great game, god damn some of you need like actual IRL interaction lol"
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,Could not disagree more. Imo Ragnarok builds on the previous game and surpasses it easily. The last 6 or so hour stretch is some of the best video game moments I‚Äôve ever had. Ready yourself!
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"PC gamer here, the reason why is because it devalues their purchase. ""Why did I buy a PS5 when every game I want is coming to PC anyway but with higher settings."""
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-06-04,Because there‚Äôs absolutely no reason to own a PlayStation aside from their exclusives. It took two years for the ps5 to be able to display the most common gaming monitor resolution never again lol.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,">Sony/Nintendo/Microsoft simps are actually insane

FTFY."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,I got it for free with my PS5. Havent bothered to play it yet.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"Given all the people replying to me about how much they enjoyed Ragnorak and are happy for PC users to share in this, I'd wager that most Playstation players are like you.  It's only a tiny amount of fanboys who would be upset that a good game is able to reach a new audience."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"If they actually would do it ""silently"" but they don't. They are fucking loud."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"Yeah, I can't really see a positive to Sony pushing PSN on PC. Dunno why they'd want to limit their own sales."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"But without it they wouldn't be able to steal your information, won't you take pity on a poor megacorporation?"
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"So sucky, making a free account. Literally, makes you want to give up, right? Crying about the most trivial stuff and the gaming community. Name a more perfect pairing"
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"Its opening it up to the same people who could have bought and played on playstation but now on PC, in the regions where sony makes business.... how is this drama even real"
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"Unfortunately, yeah"
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-30,Downvoted because people from 170 countries can't buy this shit?
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,Yeah. Same reason I skipped out on Baldurs Gate 3. Larian doesnt need my personal data either.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,So you wont be gaming at all for the rest of your life.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-30,Maybe they're affected because they can't buy it? They can't even access the Steam page for fucks sake
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"""a bit odd to require it""

weird way to say absolutely unnecessary and that it brings 0 value to the customer and only benefits Sony in this case."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,What argument exists for requiring a third-party account for a single player experience?
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-30,"Aside from ""encouraging"" Sony to release more on PC, I can't find a reason."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,Why not? Steam has a good return policy.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"If you are going to buy it anyway, might as well get the pre-pu4chase bonus costume.¬†"
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-30,I really liked GoW 2018
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-30,"Yeah, should have released on PC and PS5 at the same time."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"I forgot about the remaster. The OG is playable on rpcs3, sounds like online is available too."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"60fps and better online, anti-aliasing and 4k support. All it really needs imo. Over 60fps would be nice, but knowing From I ain't holdin my breath."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-30,It doesnt need PC sales for more GoW games lol
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-30,kiss normal tie books alleged arrest nine cagey close ask
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"I think this is more towards the comment that was literally just made from a sony exec that PC players would definitely buy a ps5 for good exclusives that just happened today.

The irony of this turnover is absolutely hilarious."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"Eh, I would say 1.5 years"
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"Oh shit, I need a PSN account to play Half Life?"
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"I don't think they would because they haven't before but who knows, maybe they'll start since they keep insisting on a psn account"
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31, I definitely did not master the mechanics and admit that's on me.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"I didn't used to hate Americans until they poisoned the world with their woke politics and culture war, I still like the ones that aren't part of the far right or far left cult don't worry."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"Guess what, we can play Xbox games and emulate a ton of previous gen exclusives without a problem too."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,Cool. I'm still not gonna waste an extra 300 when I already have a pc that plays most of the same games and way more
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-30,This is the truth of it.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,That was mainly because they wanted to release it as close as possible to the release of the TV show
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"Honestly I think ragnarok was a 7/10 game. 2018 was fantastic but I thought ragnarok was kinda up its own ass. The entire plot focused on >!destiny and how Atreus was destined to kill kratos. Then at the end he just‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt? Like it‚Äôs that easy? Then the entire time kratos is telling Atreus he doesn‚Äôt want to go to war and doesn‚Äôt want Atreus to end up like him but, doesn‚Äôt make any concessions or try to de-escalate the conflict once. That and the loading gates every 5 seconds!<

It certainly had its highs but also some very low lows."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,They‚Äôre gonna be disappointed
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"I could see it being this, but well for me personally, I feel the trade-off of getting to play the game much earlier is fair. Sure it'll eventually lose its exclusive status, but thats usually a couple of years away from release. Also its not exactly a certainty that the game will go to pc eventually. One of my favorite games, Bloodborne, has only been in the ps since 2015."

1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,Like all companies it is because they think that someday it will make them more money. Eventually they may even try to do the EA Origin thing and make their own platform and pull everything off steam. Having their own DRM baked it can help with that.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"They want to get into the data mining game just like everyone else. They want to be able to sell ""anonymous"" user statistics to big name publishers as a side hustle."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,Ypu can't but they can. That's why they're doing this.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-06-02,Because the psn accounts give them more than those limited countries would get them in sales
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"What information are they stealing? You're on reddit, you likely have a smart phone. Why is this the last straw?"
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"When over 100 countries that have access to Steam but not PSN and can't even buy this... Yeah, it's kind of a big deal. Maybe not for you personally, but the world doesn't revolve around you."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,And the people who live in countries where psn isn't available?
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"I'm from Montenegro. Try making that free psn account here, I dare you."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"Defending data harvesting from corpo assholes who already have your money with a  ""free account."" Name a more perfect pairing."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"I owned a PS3 in the past, so I already have that account. However, a fair share of countries just don‚Äôt have PSN available to them and those people will be out of luck."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"I owned a PS3 in the past, so I already have that account. However, a fair share of countries just don‚Äôt have PSN available to them and those people will be out of luck."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-30,"Sony bots, likely.


*confirmed"
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"You can play offline tho and you don't need to make a larian account tho.

Not sure what you're on about tbh."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"You don't need a Larian account to play BG3. It's optional. You only want to use it if you're playing with other people cross platform. I bought BG3 on GoG.

When the Larian launcher opens, go into the launcher settings to stop asking you to sign in/create an account. Again, it's optional and not forced on us. I chose not to create an account.

Next time you launch the game, you will get the launcher pop up, though this time you only need to click 'play' on the launcher."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,BG3 is completely drm free‚Ä¶..I literally copied the files from my Steam install to a flash drive and loaned it to my friend.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,No. I won't be playing future Playstation-PC games. I can live with that and spend my money elsewhere.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-30,"Lets be real. 95% of these gamers complaining are likely in regions where PSN is supported. They use the whole Region thing as a crutch, then type ""My dataaaaa"" across reddit, facebook, ect...."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"Literal tax laws, government laws, distributions laws.

Did you know that australia ban violent games unless they change the color of the blood? am I really teaching you about laws like what the fuck. 

If you can't buy a playstation and god of war in a region then these people already had no chance of playing that game in the first place, it being on steam changes nothing and in most case, these regions usually have bigger problems to deal with in the first place than fucking videogame distribution. Ask their government if you want a real answer.

You wanna talk about stupid account for stupid shit then why aren't we roasting peripheral companies? why do I need to sign in for razor to be able to configure the lights on my keyboard? now these accounts makes no sense and have no laws to explain them."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"OK? They're not gonna run out of copies. Of course you're free to spend your money how you want, but if it's a bad port you don't get to complain because you gave them your money without even seeing how it would be."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"It's their biggest console mover, they're not gonna fucking do that lmao. Me playing 2018 on pc made me get a ps5 for the sequel so let that settle in"
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,Should all PC games be released on PS5 at the same time or it should only be one way?
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"Sony just came out and said live service games will be day and date, but single player games will have a delay to entice you to buy a ps5"
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,I've still got my ps3 and copy. I'll play it again without hoops on the PC if they release it.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,Today I saw the PC gaming show is in a few days. I swear I feel like the show they did last year with the boring AI thing was just a few months ago. Can't believe it has been a year already.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-30,Yeah and the older you get the faster they vanish. Sucks to be honest lol.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,Need a Steam account
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,you need steam brah
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"Haha! I will agree that the extreme of the left and right are annoying. Most people are moderates, they just don't make a lot of noise."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"I play on PC. I know its advantages over console.

PS5 definitely has a customer base, mostly people who play Sony single-player games and don't want to shell out the extra money for a PC. Playing Xbox games isn't going to be a big draw because they'd have an Xbox over a PS if they cared more about Xbox games. Emulation will fall into the same boat."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,Im a PC gamer and hope that one day this elitist cringe will stop.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"...Okay? I think you're misunderstanding what I'm saying.

I'm talking as if I'm someone deciding to go PC or console, and I'm saying that there're still plenty of reason to choose the latter. If you already have either of them, you're obviously not going to buy the other."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"while an understandable reason, they should've just started work on the port sooner so that they didn't release an unstable mess"
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,">!Kratos is trying to deescalate the whole game, and even succeeds in not having to kill Thor. And as for the fate thing, they didnt just not do it. They reveal that Atreus‚Äôs mother, who was a giant, went against the rules of her people and changed fate by destroying the murals they find in ruins in the first game and creating the new murals that angrboda shows kratos at the end.!<"
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,Yea the final act of that game was a let down. Definitely would've been much more ballsy to do what you suggested. And would've had a much greater impact in Valhalla.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"Nah, not really. Both games are great."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"Party pooper, you love to ruin someone's day don't you? look, I just want to see the continuation of my GoW 2018 experience, idc if it's not as good as that one, at least I can continue the story on my PC."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,Don‚Äôt underestimate peoples pettiness
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"Fanboys in the term of fanatics? Idk, but Xbox does have a ton of fans"
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"Used to be one, until I bought a gaming pc and never looked back. Shoulda done that 10 years earlier"
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"Man I fucking hate this website. I try to crack a sarcastic joke, and along comes that one guy who has nothing better to do with their limited time in this hellish plain of existence than to try and make me look like a moron. Seriously is it so hard to go 5 minutes without going ‚Äùum aktchually‚Äû? Why do I even fucking do this to myself. Why am I even wasting MY limited time replying."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-06-01,Try living in a real country
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-30,True enough. Brainwashed individuals
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,You have to make a larian account to play steam BG3.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,We also care about people in affected countries. You don‚Äôt need to live there to have some empathy and stick your neck out for other people.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"So just because I don't live in one of the affected countries, I don't have the right to be pissed that Sony is intentionally limiting access to their games for millions of people, simply because they want to force PC users into their ecosystem and deem them a worthy sacrifice?

Yeah, no. It's bullshit through and through. And FWIW, I hate every game on Steam that requires a third party launcher. I shouldn't have to log in to EA Play, Ubisoft, Battle.net, Larian's launcher (they don't get a pass just because BG3 was good), whatever to play my games I buy on Steam. When I click play on Steam on a game I bought on Steam, it should just fucking launch."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-30,There are like 170 countries affected. We just want to play the game legally.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,Holy shit you‚Äôre so cool bro
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,It's called empathy you bootlicking son of a bitch
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"I am aware Australia has some weird laws when it comes to M and 18+ ratings for games. But that's kinda besides the point. Linking a third-party account achieves nothing here, as the storefront or the publisher can ban the product from sale anyway.

Sure, there can be other stupid products requiring accounts and people shouldn't have to put up with this sort of bullshit.
But just because other companies do it in a more egregious fashion doesn't mean we can't complain about Sony doing it with 0 benefits for the customer."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,Steam has refunds‚Ä¶.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"Me playing GoW2018 on PC made me hope they'd release Ragnarok on PC without a huge delay, so...¬† yeah. I am glad we didn't have to wait 4 years."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,Why should it only be one way?
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,Right on.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"As a centrist myself who used to be left leaning, now im neither leaning, I know many americans are centrist I still have american friends I love dearly, but overall as a country, their politics, the way they screwed us over here in the Balkans, especially my country, Macedonia makes it very difficult for me to tolerate let alone like America and its culture as a whole now."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,I've played console for most of my life. I just don't like the direction consoles are going. Especially when Sony and Microsoft has few exclusives. It just doesn't make much sense to me
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,Oh ok. Yeah I guess I did. That's my bad
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"The *entire* story of both games was the idea that you are not destined to achieve a certain fate, and prophecies do not have to be followed. 

It would be edge-lord worthy if they wanted to fulfil the prophecy without going back and completely overhauling the story of Ragnarok."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,The ending is awful
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"I have to side with the anarchist here. I‚Äôve played and enjoyed GOW III Remastered and GOW (2018) and loved them but whenever I tried Ragnarok out it didn‚Äôt intrigue me one bit. I got bored in the first hour or so and haven‚Äôt picked it back up since release.

EDIT: Probably could‚Äôve chose to say something better than anarchist"
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,Have fun with cringe YA romance
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,Yea I am thinking of the guys that carried the Xbox banner during the height of the console wars who insisted that Xbox was the be all end all. I don't know if it's just because I'm not young enough anymore but I just don't see them. I still see the Sony Stans though.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"Could use ""/s"" for sarcasm."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-06-01,Try exiting Sony's asshole.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"Nah man you can click past all that shit. It even has a box saying ""don't show again"".

I never once made a larian account and just finished that game."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,No? I don't have any larian account and I'm able to play online with no problem.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,Lmaooooo you don't
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,No‚Ä¶
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"They're doing it because they do not have the right to sell their shit there at the moment, how hard is it to understand... Do you think sony hates money??????

Do you think pornhub is happy to be unavailable in Texas right now???? Do you think they WANT to be unavailable to people in texas?"
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,Idk just seeing what you want trying to make u happy man
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,There are far less console exclusives than ever before.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,It‚Äôs a great game what you mean?
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"Personally I didn't like those segments either, but they're such tiny nitpicks overall to the rest of the game that calling the game bad as a whole is being disingenuous."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"Out of the entire game, that's your focus?"
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"We will, and?"
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"Yeah if you go on shitter you will find them in droves, usually coupled with a blue checkmark (I don't recommend this though)"
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"Figured it'd be obvious, but I suppose there's an argument to be made."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-06-01,I don‚Äôt even like Sony. Don‚Äôt even have a ps5. Just think it‚Äôs dumb that people cry about a free account
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"Exactly, you can even use the executable to bypass the launcher altogether"
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"How were previous games released on PC without PSN required? Horizon games, Spider-Man, Last of Us, first God of War..."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"I got a backlog on PC that could fill the gap between PS5 and PS7, I can wait. Thankya though."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,All the more reason why I'm gonna stick with pc for now
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"I personally don‚Äôt think it is, but hey that is what opinions are for my friend."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,I mean the rest is just a retread with a spear added
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,I personally take it at face value as it is something that people have been saying haha. Didn't mean to cause anger.
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-06-01,"Then don't comment on stuff you know nothing about. Literally over a 100 countries don't have PSN access, whereas around 70 do. Now think about why people are ""crying over a *free* account""."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"It could probably really help to clarify why. 

Most people who enjoyed 2018, enjoyed Ragnarok, because fundamentally it's just one *really* long game. The gameplay is the same, the quality of writing is the same, the tone of the world is the same, Ragnarok just expands 2018 into a wider world."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"Ironically enough, your comment was the actual last straw that released like 2 years of pent up anger. That's why the response was so disproportional. I wager if I kept saving it up just a bit longer, I'd gain the ability to manifest Tulpa pipe bombs. All good now. No hard feelings I hope."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-06-01,"Like I said, live in a real place. I really don‚Äôt care."
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-06-01,As if VPNs don‚Äôt exist
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-05-31,"All good dude. In a weird way, glad to help! Haha"
1d4fvve,2024-05-30,2024-06-01,"If you actually think that that's funny, I suggest you see a psychologist."
z1o6a3,2022-11-22,2022-11-22,You leave out the most notable part. Chad Gaspard died while saving his 10 year old son from drowning after a riptide caught them. A true hero meant for Valhalla if there is one.
z1o6a3,2022-11-22,2022-11-22,"I think this is fantastic and a wonderful parallel to the games. Kratos' whole goal is to protect Atreus and Shad died protecting and saving his son. 

What a good man."
z1o6a3,2022-11-22,2022-11-22,Shad Gaspards was welcomed into Valhalla 2 years ago.
z1o6a3,2022-11-22,2022-11-22,Pop a 40 and check your rolly! It‚Äôs CRYME TYME!

z1o6a3,2022-11-22,2022-11-22,Sacrificed himself to save his son.  Art imitates life.
z1o6a3,2022-11-22,2022-11-22,"When i had been playing GoW, i caught myself on thoughts that some of Kratos moves really remind me of wrestling moves."

z1o6a3,2022-11-22,2022-11-22,"I had no idea about this (that he was motion capture actor for Kratos), nor about the circumstances of his death, even though I love the game so much!

I also didn't expect this sudden knowledge would hit me as hard as it actually did. Almost like the whole game now have additional hidden underlying meaning.  
""rEaL mEn dOn't cRY!"", yes, they fucking do..."
z1o6a3,2022-11-22,2022-11-22,I remember him from Cryme Tyme back with JTG in WWE. One of my favourite tag teams in that era
z1o6a3,2022-11-22,2022-11-22,It's so cool knowing the physical actor and VA played 2 separate roles in the same character to get Kratos right
z1o6a3,2022-11-22,2022-11-23,"Strange that all the documentaries on the making of the game never mentioned him at all when it comes to MoCap. Instead, it's being credited to Christopher Judge (who plays Kratos) and Eric Jacobus (who performs the combat). Gaspard's name does appear in the credits, but not specifically as Kratos."
z1o6a3,2022-11-22,2022-11-22,They changed up the face and head shape though

z1o6a3,2022-11-22,2022-11-22,I mean they (generally) kept Kratos‚Äôs facial features from the original games. It‚Äôd be weird if he looked like a totally different person.
z1o6a3,2022-11-22,2022-11-22,They changed *so* much it's probably more accurate that they used his outline as a reference and then did whatever they want with it
z1o6a3,2022-11-22,2022-11-22,A black voice actor wasn't enough?

z1o6a3,2022-11-22,2022-11-22,Three people portrayed Kratos. Shad Gaspard for the model and some movesets. Christopher Judge for performance. Eric Jacobus for dynamic action.
z1o6a3,2022-11-22,2022-11-23,What? Kratos is Greek. Of course they changed the facial features to match that. But the rest? The human body it‚Äôs self is fairly racially neutral.
z1o6a3,2022-11-22,2022-11-23,He was the mocap guy. That's what's meant by digital image.

z1o6a3,2022-11-22,2022-11-23,I think they got away with it largely because the characters were roguishly lovable faces. Can you imagine how much worse they would be if you had heel characters whose entire gimmicks were being Black and stealing things?
z1o6a3,2022-11-22,2022-11-23,"They knew the whole time they were taking a big risk lol. I remember seeing the disclaimer before their first appearance on TV and I just looked it up for the exact wording:

‚ÄúTonight a new tag team, Cryme Tyme, will be introduced to the Raw audience. In an effort to humor and entertain our fans, the tag team known as Cryme Tyme will be parodying racial stereotypes. Shad Gaspard and JTG do outlandish, outrageous ""stunts"" to ready themselves for tag team action on Raw.

z1o6a3,2022-11-22,2022-11-23,Based off of how many behind the scenes have the Voice Actors for both Kratos and Atreus doing their lines in mo-cap suites I'm pretty sure this is correct.

z1o6a3,2022-11-22,2022-11-22,Or just limit the types of actions Kratos is capable of.
z1o6a3,2022-11-22,2022-11-22,It's called cratos can fit in all ass holes. And in next game he will become gay trans. Ohhh and I don't mind it's okay to be gay with trans kid

The police alleged he was resisting arrest. Josh Barnett and his wife were with Shad arguing that there was no reason for OH Police to even approach Shad at all, let alone hold him down while people are literally jaywalking right in front of the Police.

https://bleacherreport.com/articles/629029-wwe-news-former-wwe-star-arrested-claims-racial-profiling-major-update

z1o6a3,2022-11-22,2022-11-23,So fucked up. That is absolutely racial profiling
z1o6a3,2022-11-22,2022-11-23,Can't resist arrest without them first attempting to arrest you. For Jaywalking. I'd probably resist arrest too because I'd be afraid the obviously racist corrupt cop was going to drive me to my house rob me and kill me.
z1o6a3,2022-11-22,2022-11-23,He‚Äôs one of the rare one that it‚Äôs not an accusation and that is on TV every week.

And the charges were dropped after three months. 

It was definitely racial profiling, as Gaspard wasn't the only person crossing that road, and there were many witnesses who attested to the incident and conditions, which again, in the video we see multiple people crossing the road while Gaspard is detained.

[This one TMZ uploaded shows four Police holding him down while another says why they're arresting him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6km3yUZWE). This had occurred during already tense times between black americans and the police, who were already under fire across the country for police brutality."
z1o6a3,2022-11-22,2022-11-23,"That last sentence could've been talking about 50 years ago, 10 years ago, or yesterday"
z1o6a3,2022-11-22,2022-11-23,"True. Though I suppose I mean that, since the incident at Fruitvale station in 2009, more people were starting to stand up against police brutality, and the brutality had gotten so bad by 2013. Black Lives Matter movement started roughly at the end of that year as a whole. 

BEfore that, incidents like these were treated as a joke."
z1o6a3,2022-11-22,2022-11-23,By white people. This has been a sticking point in the black community since before I was born.
z1o6a3,2022-11-22,2022-11-24,"By the corrupt and the racist, who can't be caught as often that people can joke about police brutality as much, now that the communities across the country are standing together against it."

Edit: Perhaps not obvious but the question is rhetorical"

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Got curious about this and did a little counting. Of the publishers that have gotten more than one nomination for ""Game of the Year"" at TGA, the list looks like this:

\- Sony: 13

\- Nintendo: 10

\- Bethesda: 4

\- Capcom: 4

\- FromSoftware: 4

\- EA: 3

\- Atlus: 2

\- Blizzard: 2

\- Square Enix: 2

Fromsoft self-publishes in Japan so I went ahead and counted their Namco and Activision international releases as their own games. If we went by developer instead of publisher, Bloodborne would also be theirs but the whole list would look very different.

Also split the companies that publish under multiple labels. Xbox, Activision, Blizzard and Bethesda were counted separately and the same goes for Rockstar, 2K and Private Division."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,How many of them won? There are definitely some all time greats on this list.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Pretty great track record in the previous years too!

They've been doing just fine since the PS1 days.

As a Nintendo fan, I'm actually proud of Sony for releasing great games to this point, because this makes for a great rivalry and competition in the gaming industry. For me, I have way more respect for Sony and Microsoft than any 3rd-party dev.

For goodness sake, they've humanized Kratos, they've surprised Japanese historians with Ghost, gave us TWO stellar Spider-Man games when the series had dropped stinkers up to that point, Aloy became a very likeable character in Sony's portfolio and now they're competing for GOTY with a child-friendly robot whose purpose is to make players experience all of the Playstation's features.

No joke, good on them :D"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"And while they didn't have any noms in 2014 for the first The Game Awards show, they had nominations in 2010 - 2013 for the SpikeTV Video Game Awards show which was the precursor to the current Game Awards. Those game were God of War 3, Uncharted 3, Journey, and The Last of Us.

Nothing in 2009 from them, but 2008 had LittleBigPlanet and Metal Gear Solid 4 which isn't owned by Sony, but was a Playstation exclusive and was directed by Kojima who also did Death Stranding of course. Sony has done well at the VGAs for a long time now."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Not to be a party pooper but everyone knows that GOTY is a huge circlejerk for the marketing department. They ARE great games, and I'll celebrate the development studio, not the publisher."

Xbox has had Deathloop and Phsyconauts 2, but Deathloop was exclusive to PS5 for that year and Phsyconauts 2 was a crowdfunded multiplatform game, if we are talking console exclusive (Xbox + PC) they havent had any since before 2013"

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"And if there was a worst game of the year, SONY will probably have a nominee for those every year as well."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,They pay for it
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,They havent made any of those games. They pay studios to make games which they then sell.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"ive never played any of these games, am i missing out or not"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I suspect bribes. ""Death Stranding"" was a lot of things. GoTY candidate it was not."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Should Death Stranding really qualify?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Does Death Stranding still count now that Kojima bought the rights back so he could release it on Xbox?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Was death stranding worth it? Never played it. Genuine question, I'm looking for good solo games"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Astro BOT is so boring! A ""cheap"" game that's not worth it."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Is this not like all other industries where you just fill out a form and pay a fee to get nominated for industry awards?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,How the heck did Death Stranding sneak in? That game was a turd.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Cool but Forbidden West does not qualify as a GOTY nominee on the grounds that it's a sequel which is inferior to the first.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,This would be like saying I won a popularity contest every year when my mom is the judge. Those fake awards are Sony bias.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,I wouldn't count studios that they don't own as PlayStation
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"13 games listed, and if I'm being generous, maybe about four of them are actually worth playing."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,And only one of those games actually deserved the nomination lol
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,but wins nothing
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,Idgaf about those snobs at Gaming Awards
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,"you see that 2015 game, do that again please."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Red Dead Redemption 2 not winning GOTY still pisses me off so much
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Shouldn‚Äôt rebirth be listed here too? I know it‚Äôs square enix but it‚Äôs still a ps5 exclusive the same way bloodborne is a ps4 exclusive despite being made by fromsoft.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,AstroBot's gonna win this year. For sure.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Honestly some of these being up there feels in support of the idea that nominations are rigged and that Geoff just wants a designated ‚ÄúSony‚Äù spot to ensure they keep supporting and show up to the event. Ratchet and clank was not a top tier game and uncharted and death stranding were so niche in their audiences that they feel forced. One of my biggest problems with the game awards rn is how token a lot of the category nominations feel. There‚Äôs always the token Indy, token Sony, token PC game and then the 2-3 games that actually got the most attention buzz surrounding them that actually will likely win. Then they have 16 categories so every triple A game can get something despite the title really grasping at straws."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Hot take: All of these are mid
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"A. The ""nominees"" are chosen by industry shills.

B. That doesn't make them good games.

C. GOTY isn't a real thing. It's a popularity contest decided by industry shills.

D. Sony didn't make Death Stranding or Bloodborne.

I own every single one of these games. I've played all of them, more than once. The second time was only because of PC releases so I could get the achievements. They aren't experiences I'm desperate to have again, though I will definitely buy Ghost of Yotei, Venom and whatever Naughty Dogs next game is (assuming they don't somehow fail to deliver a very well produced game.)"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"They deliver but I still don‚Äôt like PS exclusives games, im glad final fantasy will no longer be a PS exclusive."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Looking at the nominations for GOTY this year Astro Bot is the clear winner for me. Team Asobi taking an already great game in Astros Playroom and somehow improving just about every part of the gameplay is a rare achievement in game development these days
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Well considering there are probably 100s of publications giving out GOTY awards that‚Äôs pretty meaningless.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Because the whole thing is pay to win advertising.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Yes, PlayStation pays to have a goty nominee every year."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,wow this is some serious glazing
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,DEATH STRANDING is Playstation?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Literally every game is a GOTY Nominee/winner somewhere.. this isn't an achievement (got nothing against those games just that this ""stat"" is worthless)"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Same goes for PC, not sure what the big deal is."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Astro Bot is good, but it's hard to believe there wasn't any other game this year that would take that spot."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It's pretty wild when it's listed like this. What an absolute banger list of games they've put out over the years.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Shows how good Sony‚Äôs first party games are.

I‚Äôve bought most of Sony‚Äôs Steam releases."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Well it is the Sony awards.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Ghost of Tsushima is such a good game
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Uncharted 4 should have won that year
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"From 2020 onward, only sequels.."

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Okay, what even is Astro Bot? I know every other game but I've not even heard of Astro Bot until it came out and every game journalism gave it 9s and 10s. 

Does it play like Little Big Planet?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Okay how many of them won?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Meanwhile Xbox hasn't had a single GOTY nominee in the past decade.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I'm not surprised since a lot of sony's games are the Oscar bait of gaming. I'm not hating though, they're generally good games."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"It's honestly insane that God of War actually beat Red Dead Redemption 2 for GOTY in 2018. God of War really hasn't aged well with its level design and Ragnarok was a huge step down. Meanwhile, people are still discovering amazing NPC and world interactions in Red Dead Redemption 2 over 6 years later."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Helldivers 2 should have been there as well
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"They make good games

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I was about to say ""where the hell is Returnal ?"" but I realised it wasn't nominated as Game of The Year. Damn, the public was rude with this one."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"With my new PC I plan to build in Spring next year, I can't wait to tackle all the PlayStation games I missed:

God of War (2018)  
Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection  
Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart  
Horizon Forbidden West  
Ghost of Tsushima  
God of War Ragnar√∂k  
Spider-Man 2

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Isn't that a given that the platform has a nominee for goty? Why would they not have a nominee? That's like a political party not having a nominee during an election.

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Yeah but how many actually won? Not being condescending just genuinely curious
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Bloodborne is due for a remake.

Seriously. 

If Sony can get Bluepoint to remake Demon's Souls (and quite excellently at that) then surely we can get the same treatment for Bloodborne? 

It's probably some sort of licensing quagmire but if there's a will, there's a way, as the old saying goes so hopefully it happens.

At some point.

Yeah. üòí"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Man im behind. I have played none of these except bloodborne.

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Astro Bot and Bloodborne are the only two not on PC yet. Death Stranding is the only one that (just recently) came to Xbox, but that's because of ownership change. Would it even be considered a PS title anymore, technically?"

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I'm not following. 1 game nominated each year for game of the year? Seems like it should be more. How many has Nintendo had in the past decade?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Did any of them win?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Never heard of astro bot
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Ratchet and Clank for 2024
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Damn, like what is even the point of xbox anymore? Gamepass? Why would i buy that, when i have a console with so many great games on it. Xbox need to step up with their exclusives."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,How's astro bot?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Horizon got smacked both years. Releasing beside a Zelda and elden ring. Amazing games and incredible story telling.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,That happens when you pay a lot of money for your games to be nominated.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Jesus Christ, Bloodborne was 9 years ago üíÄ"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Bloodborne man! What a game
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Bloodborne 2 and they'll actually win it as well
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Why was Spiderman 2 nominated? It was aggressively mid
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Bloodborne is the best game on the list by far
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I have played 0 of these games lol. I'm 34 and I own several of these on Steam. Where is Days Gone? That game was really good.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Wouldn't really call Death Stranding Sony's game. They don't own the developer and wasn't sole publisher for the game.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,2015-2019 are GOAT and winners in my eyes. The rest up until now not so much‚Ä¶. Except Astro bot that was a unexpected surprise
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Call of Duty BO6 could be up there this year
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Good god 8 years since Nathan Drake
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,The only game I've played and didn't enjoy from the list was Bloodborne. Does anyone else share the experience?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Oof Xbox.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I gotta play that ratchet and clank game appearently.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"What a surprise with them having the largest market share in gaming, truly baffling."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I've only ever played Uncharted out of these.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,THIS IS THE SIGN. BRING BACK SINGLEPLAYER ONLY GAMES THEY WERE PEAK¬†
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I have never heard of Astro bot
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Three of those games have already gotten a remaster‚Ä¶
:("
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,2018 was crazy
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,I picked up Spiderman remastered over the weekend and it's sooooo boring. How did that get nominated for goty?!? I LOVE spiderman but even that couldn't keep me playing. After 7 hours I gave up
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"2018 might be the best year ever. God of War, Spider-Man, and Red Dead Redemption 2. What a year."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"My favourite of these is Bloodborne.

I think I'm officially old, media's not being made for me anymore"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,I liked death stranding but game of the year nom is a stretch.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"You're telling me that one of the biggest video game corporations in the world, nay one of the big 3 (Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo), has games that are constantly seen in the mainstream public eye and are nominated in awards shows that target mainstream games?

What's next, you're gonna tell me Nintendo owns Pokemon?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Bloodborne should have won GOTY.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Hopefully we get another Ratchet and Clank game by the start of the PS6
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,The power of money.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Probably because PlayStation is all modern gamers know about gaming
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"It's a shame that as a company, Sony and subsequently PlayStation are fucking terrible. 

Why does every company that makes legitimately good blockbuster titles also have to be complete scumbags who treat their communities like shit?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,2020 was a helluva year.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"weakest year ‚Äò20, ‚Äò22 or ‚Äò24"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Hmmm, I've got some Platinums to catch up on. Couldn't do that all these years later if there are multiplayer trophies (looking at you AC Black Flag ü§¨)"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I think I‚Äôll play Bloodborne again, thanks!"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,4 years later last of us 2 still not on ps premium smh
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,That‚Äôs crazy to think about
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Only one nominee? Or are there others?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Astrobot definitely deserves it. Amazing game.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Bloodborne ü•∫
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,How the fuck is Bloodborne nearly 10 years old...
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,you know it's a slow year for gaming when astro bot makes Goty. not saying i dont have love for platformers but i felt like there were better more mature nominations imo.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Only game I like out of those is Bloodborne, the rest I don‚Äôt care for."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Maybe Sony should just dedicate to games & forget consoles. Same with Xbox, go PC software streaming"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,TLOF is really good
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Not surprising. Nintendo was on life support for the first couple years, third party publishers have mostly been chasing rushed live service nonsense, and Xbox has been an also-ran since the end of the 360."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Have they won?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Ghost of Tsushima is 4 years old but I still can‚Äôt buy it for cheap
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"That reminds me, I still have to play Death Stranding and Ghost of Tsushima from my physical backlog."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"That reminds me, I still have to play Death Stranding and Ghost of Tsushima from my physical backlog."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,That is so crazy
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,With how big Helldivers 2 was i'm surprised it's not beside Astro bot. They really shot themselves in the foot with that one.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Spiderman2 on the ps5 is hot garbage. Hopefully fixed on pc release.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Horizon twice GOTY??? How?? It is a boring-ass game with good graphics
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"It's the entire point of this. They aren't just Sony games, they are Sony exclusive games, heavily subsidized to attract attention to the platform. Yes, the studios are extremely talented, but they Sony was only able to pull this off because they had a big market advantage with the PS4, and they saw this as an investment in their ecosystem. Most studios, even AAA, cannot afford to pull this off."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"A lot of comments like 'it's come to PC or other platform, then it's not sony game', lol."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I question the legitimacy of this. As majority of console players I know only ever have a sports game such as NBA2K, NHL/FiFa/Madden, GTA and Every years CoD."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,And an Ubisoft infection by the looks of it.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,2022 i was eating good
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,At least 80% of these Games are mediocre at best. But these Awards are all PAID.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Spiderman and Horizon are so overrated.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,That 2015-2018 Playstation run was legendary
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"2018 was such a good year, God of War, MH World, Red Dead and Spiderman Celeste. Im blessed to say I‚Äôve played each one"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,If astro bot is all we can muster for goty then it was a sad year for gamers
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Meanwhile, Xbox with all its fantastic IP‚Äôs sitting in a closet like ‚Äúwhat gives?‚Äù"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Nothing to do with marketing.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,2022 and 2023 is a joke (although I liked the Ragnarok).
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Man, 8 years without an Uncharted? And we got that shit movie instead? Sad."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"In fairness 8/10 of those years Nintendo was nominated too. Of course 8 is less than 10 but the variety on offer is broader than Sony‚Äôs.

I can‚Äôt get behind Sony‚Äôs current business plan, we have a Pro console, the Portal and a bunch of Bluetooth peripherals but barely any PS5 exclusive games. Most users are still using the PS4 platform."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I thought astro's playroom and astro bot are just little funny games and was even a bit angry when I saw astro bot is selling for full price. Then I got to play both. Amazing games, totally deserved GOTY nomination, amount of content per level is just... I have no words for this, amazing"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Sony SUS
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"You have to remember : 

Award shows are highly sponsored and often skewed to make those sponsors happy. Nominations are the easiest to do, even if an award isnt won. Sony has a huge budget for PR, and they love to use it. 

Not really a marker of pure quality (not saying they dont make quality games - but there are many others out there similar or better), but a marker of how much marketing money they have to toss around. Or are willing to use."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"They could do something really nice and given us Bloodborne sequel and port the game to Sony's Steam lineup...


Surely with 10 years of GOTY nominations they could spare us this?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Last of 7s, Spiderman, GOS, and GOW only deserving spots."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,"Is uncharted 4 actually any good? I played an uncharted a long time ago, I think if was PS3/4 and it was just a very bland and uninteresting gameplay"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,"Bloodborne and astroboy are the only ones worthy of the title tho.

The rest are just generic triple a blockbuster games. The fastfood of gaming. 

It would be like calling mcdonalds the best restaurant of the year..."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,Crazy part is from that list the only games I kind of care about is God of War and possibly Death Stranding with maybe Spider Man 1 coming in third.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,Atrobot saved this year... next year will be hard to partecipate
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,"Nominating Horizon for GOTY shows what's wrong with the industry these days. An absolute average game, with all sort of mechanics that has been already invented before just put in one game with (apart of hunting which is the best part of the game, but still only hunting). Brand new universe with new characters, story and few twists is way too little to be considered a GOTY pretender."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,I am sorry but horizon game are not GOTY contenders.......
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-13,"I have a Playstion 4, yet as a Xbox player. I don‚Äôt even think any of those games are fun. It‚Äôs definitely rigged."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,We throw the word GOTY around too loosely
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Completely deserved, as a person who plays a lot of single players, almost every one that releases per year playstation have some of the most quality games I've ever played¬†"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Would be interesting to see all Games of the Year since 1994 and first Playstation.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,What is an action adventure game for 500 please
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Astro Bot ü•∞
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,And next year its ghost of yotei. Mark my words. It will win
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Which GOTY award? It seems 6-10 games release a game of the year edition these days.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,[deleted]
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"And not a single game in there I give a f*** about. Well, except maybe Astro Bot. The Playroom was decent.

Shows how much different personal tastes can be. None of these games would be even in consideration for GOTY for me."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,They all deserve it honestly
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Do you think this could be related to selling more consoles than Xbox possibly
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,with all due respect i see absolutely no reason Astro Bot has a goty nomination let alone half of the nominations it does
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Final Fantasy VII Rebirth? That also got a nomination
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Jesus, I did not realise Uncharted 4 was that old now...Still replay it once a year at this point!"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I just want Bloodborne on PC
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Tried to like Bloodborne. I have the game on disc. Couldn't get into it. The witcher is better. Looks more beautiful too.

Bloodborne tries to hide graphic quality with darker environments. Too me doesn't look as good graphically. But most importantly there is just more to do in the Witcher.

Horizon games was awesome too. The ones i have played on PS4 that has frozen wilds expansion. I paid for the expansions for it separately."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"PlayStation really does know how to make amazing games, especially single player story games"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,At least half are mediocre
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,They make the best single player games out there.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"just release bloodborne on PC Sony, omfg You absolute clowns"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Of these I have only playing Death Stranding and can 100% recommend it for game of the decade and/or game of the century.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"WOW ITS ALMOST LIKE SONY RELEASES GOOD GAMES EVERY YEAR AND IT HAS THAT SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT!

OP : ""No, this is clearly Sony paying money to have their games listed on nominee. There is no other way. It MUST be this"""
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Astrobot

Military_Clown.png"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Why is this notable to anyone? Sony is a mega-corporation that is also a game publisher. They aren‚Äôt the ones actually making the games. Stop praising the suits and higher-ups and give credit to the game studios who actually worked on these wonderful projects.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Lots of those shouldn‚Äôt have been nominated honestly
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,We all kno some of them don't deserve the spot but it's sony
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,And i wouldn't have voted for a single game on this list. Shame.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"It's simple, a certain type of game tends to win these types of awards. (same goes for the Oscars, a certain *type* of film always gets best picture) 

Sony is publishing a lot of these types of games."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Every single one of those games I don't give two shits about, reminds me why PlayStation since the PS4 era is dead to me. And I grew up adoring the PS1, PS2 & PS3. 

I'm just expressing a personal opinion. I don't mean to shit on all the millions of people who like these games. it just got to a point where Sony stopped making games that interested me."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Xbox sucks
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Most of these games aren't very good frfr nocap.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,What worthless content. Goty means nothing but marketing
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,And they're all on PC expect AstroBot and Bloodborne....
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,They make good games
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Death Stranding = walking simulator.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I hate exclusives. No reason to have them. You are literally taking money away from yourself. Consoles are sold at a loss.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Well when you have money and own a massive portion of the industry you're going to get benefits even if they're undeserved. I say this as someone who enjoys my playstation, but god damn do the stinkers they pump out get absurdly high reviews."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Major publisher has had a GOTY Nominee Every Single Year in the Last Decade
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,All sequels lmao
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Never played any of them
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Which is sad since many of them dosnt deserve it...
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,So what? Only one really good game - Bloodborne
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,There‚Äôs like maybe 3 games here at most that deserve it lol
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"HZD is mediocre at best, how is that Goty worthy is beyond me"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"and yet they still want to triple down on live service bullshit.

They were banking so hard on Concord. how did so many people see that garbage and go ""yeah, a ton of people are gonna love this"". All it took was one trailer for everyone to know it was a dud, but none of the people making it knew? or did they all know but didn't say anything because they'd get fired?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Astro bot is nice but i don‚Äôt think its worthy
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,And they only won 2
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,They absolutely didn‚Äôt deserve one in 2023.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"games that are platform exclusive should not be nominated for game of the year. They def shouldn't win, at least."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"They didn't make these games, they published them. At least the few that I know of. Fromsoft made Bloodborne, for example."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,BG3 best gave ever
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"As a self-proclaimed sonypony since PS2, a bit worrying I‚Äôve only played 2 of those games, being Bloodborne and Ghost of Tsushima, although all of those games interest me."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Helldivers 2 should be nominated.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Spider Man 2, HFW and GOT don't deserve it, Ratchet was a great game, idk if it is a GOTY candidate, the others are worthy."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Honestly hell divers should be on there too. 
Butttt let‚Äôs just go with the single player narrative."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Like give them a category where they can shine, but None of the games are truly addicting, which was what games use to be.

I like these games too."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,2018 should've gone to Red Dead 2. Absolutely ridiculous.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I really want to play astrobot but I'm 100% certain it will be a PS monthly or ps extra game at some point and don't want to buy it. I really wish sony would do more day one releases on big names like xbox does. PSN is a decent value so I'll keep it, but waiting for shit to be added is annoying."

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Nice to see the walking simulator got nominated (death stranding)
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Love all these games but you can also just see a downward trend in overall game originality and quality each year as well for their best game..
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,crazy how Oc players play the HZD or Ratchet and clank and it‚Äôs all ‚Äú okay games‚Äù
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Returnal was not even nominated?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Just so everyone is aware, every single one of these games are also on PC."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Greatness is what that is.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,They don't deserve to claim Bloodborne
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Wtf is astro bot? Playstation people are so weird man. Tou can get an xbox with literally double the amount of games and the controller isnt designed for sangheili. Like wake upppppp
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Seeing Bloodborne pissed me off because it reminds me Sony is about to own Fromsoft
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Streak probably should have been broken in 2019 lol
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Bloodborne and Death Stranding are not PlayStation games, otherwise impressive."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,What the hell is Astro Bot?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Sony owns and pays the judges thousands of f****** dollars I don't give a s*** what their game wins. I love all those games though. But f*** they're b*******! Like they're the only goddamn gaming console on the planet! Why don't you go remaster another 5-year-old game you f****** moops!
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"How many won again? Not being salty, just busy at work."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Not to mention RDR2
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,No Returnal is insanity
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,The crack someone was smoking in 2016 to nominate Uncharted A Thief‚Äôs End for GOTY must‚Äôve been some good shit
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,2018 was such a good year for gaming
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I have almost all of them and never played them...
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I liked the game, but Spider-man 2 didn‚Äôt deserve to be nominated"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Ghosts should have beat LoU2. A story of a Jin throwing away all honor and samurai tradition as they have showed to be a weakness Kahn knew. To start fighting using stealth and less honorable means to defend there homeland over a story of basic revenge that doesn't solve anything¬†
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Surely this isn't that notable? It's hardly surprising that a major games console has a nominee for Game of the Year every year.

All that means is that the console is popular enough to have games developed for it which are good enough to be nominated for Game of the Year. I'm pretty certain the same is true for PC."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,To bad they are a shit company that scammed me out of 180‚Ç¨ after their paper thin security got breached for the 10.000 thousands time.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I think this kinda shows that in some of these years, either the releases were not that impressive, or a sony game must always be nominated.

Like, you might have liked it, but it's ratchet and clankle that memorable in comparison with other titles in this list?

I don't think so in all honesty."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,How many did win GOTY? I only remember God of War being a winner? Not sure to be honest.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Bloodborne and Spider-Man are fantastic games but everything else seems pretty mediocre. Astro Bot looks like a nice little game but I wouldn't expect it to be groundbreaking.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Tbh no console exclusive title ever deserves to be goty
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"and for half the years, they deserved to have one"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Crazy how bloodborne is still the best on that list
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,How many of them won it ?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Ratchet being nominated in 2021 over Returnal is so wrong...(I'm happy Astro is nominated this year, I just think Rift Apart was a forgettable platformer that overpromised and underdelivered)"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Most of them are the same game with a different skin.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"And I'll never get to even try most of them since I won't go for a low effort, cash grab PC port.  Something getting GOTY or even being nominated for it used to mean being worth buying a console for, but that value has gone down and the games aren't getting better by enough to make up for it."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Weak
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,honestly only a few of those I'd ever touch. but it's cool people get into these awards and think it means something
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"If they can pay for exclusives, they can pay for nominations.

Sony buys a head start to every race it enters, and still manages to lose most of them."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Who‚Äôs game of the year? Culture Crave? Gaming awards? Aunt Beth?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Helldivers 2 is better than Astro Bot. But thats my 2 cents.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Great list, but Spider-Man 2 was riding on the coat tails of the first one"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Gonna be an unpopular opinion but Horizon is one of Sony's most overhyped just ok games of all time with no real reason being nominated. 2017 was really only between 3 games and they had PUBG on the nominees to fill slots, 2022 was when Elden Ring released and you could argue they put half of the nominees that year also to just fill slots cause it was definitely between Elden Ring and God of War."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Isn't the GOTY just an industry price, where everyone is petting there own shoulders and say how great they are?
Also isn't the GOTY a pay to get nominated price?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Nominations don't mean much when you are one of the big 3 consoles and spend hundreds of millions per year pumping out AAA exclusives. If they weren't gonna get any nominations, they wouldn't be paying for those games to be made since if they aren't good enough to be nominated, they aren't good enough to sell to make up for the dev cost."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"""Game of the Year"" according to whom?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"To be real, even though they're all good games, some of them were nominated only because PlayStation¬Æ."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,So you're saying Sony's list for games of the year is all Sony games.... Interesting.....
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Death stranding, nah. Definitely not a goty"

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,What in the world is Atro Bot..?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Spider-man 2 doesn't deserve the nomination, game just automatically gets nomination if it Sony at this point"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Lobbyists
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Astro Bot making this list is a sign of things to come. GOTY quality games have just shifted to platformers designed to only be played for 30 minutes. Gaming is officially dead; as we know it.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"You would hope so right? I mean, they're a massive share of the market."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,":l These games look pretty...but they're boring. 95% of these games nowadays are boring to me. If a game can't hold my attention for YEARS, it ain't my type of game. Not for the prices they charge nowadays. I have a PS5 and still play the same games I bought on my PS4. I don't think I have a single PS5 exclusive game that I play/enjoy more than the games I've been playing for 6+ years"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,The fuck is astrobot?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Reminder.... they think astro bot on the same level as wu kong or elden ring... goty really means nothing
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,What about Sekiro?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Dont let the xbox fanboys see this.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Playstation just doesn't miss. The worst game on this list is probably TLOU 2 which is a damn great game, just has some questionable plot choices."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,How did uncharted 4 get nominated that game sucked. Nevermind it's just the game awards.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Feels odd that I have not played any of them and none of them appeal to me, in the least, to warrant me playing them."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Pussies allowing for dual winners in a year
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03, Can‚Äôt get into Horizon

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"This is a shame, because all these games are mid."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"If this is the list of their best games from each year, it's no wonder they're losing"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Couple of those didn‚Äôt deserve to be nominated to be fair lol
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Just to five an honest opinion as an xbox player.

None of these games would ever make me want a Playstation. 

I've bought 2 play stations in my entire life, one to play grand theft auto 3 and one to play little big planet when it first came out. 

The games on this list aren't enough to make me purchase another."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,A Thief‚Äôs End was sony‚Äôs end.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Shame that 4 of the 9 years had the same IPs.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"All this shows is that the nominee list is far too wide for things like Horizon 2, Rift Apart was shockingly mediocre, death stranding, last of us part 2, and spider-man 2 to get the nods as goty. 

Im not sure if there is a more disappointingly generic open world series than horizon. It's so close to being great, giant mech dinosaurs are cool, but holy hell that story and gameplay."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,How the hell did Horizon get nominated?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Sony should make more multiplayer games
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I get people (fanboys) will celebrate this, but does anyone else feel like when they look at this list, Astrobot (while good) just doesn't really stand up compared to the rest?  

Like Blood Borne, God of War, Spider-man, Uncharted...  Such a feast.   It's just strange to put Astro Bot next to Ghost of Tsushima, or Death Stranding, you know?  

It also feels this year's GotY are a bit light.  Like no game is really bad, but it also feels like none of them would be in the list in any other year."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It's almost as if industry awards are supporting the industry...
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Really? Death Stranding? I felt like a UPS delivery guy the whole game
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Western gaming media has a strong bias to the type of games Sony make, so not surprising."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Really? Astro Bot?¬† I feel like goty should be somthing much bigger than that
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Hell yeah, two good games."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,i would argue that a few of those were undeserved tbh
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Hd2 is so much better than Astro bot.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,And none of them deserved GOTY. GoW stole RDR2s win and TLOU2 was a joke.

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"PlayStation didn't have those nominations just because the games in question are exclusives. Sony didn't make most of those games, third party developers did. Credit where credit is due."

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Horizon is a cookie-cutter Ubisoft open world clone that holds itself back by trying to be everything it shouldn't be.

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,these awards are such a joke what even is astro bot and why would it be getting game of the year over something as epic as the other games on that list.

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Not only that but they're all Third-Person games.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I mean single player games are much more likely to win GOTY regardless, and multiplayer games are more often than not going to benefit from being cross platform not exclusive.

The big 3s major IPs are all single player focused, even Halo and Gears are usually touted for their single player campaigns over their multiplayer."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Why is this a noteworthy question? The PS barely even gets multiplayer games that aren't cross-platform to start with
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Sony publicly announced that single-player is their focus since the PS4 era. Makes sense they are recognised for what they focus on.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Funny enough, I think of multiplayer and single player games as completely different media, and I often immediately associate something like game of the year or greatest of all time with single player games.  I love multiplayer, but to me it‚Äôs like comparing a sport to a book: not really compatible"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I mean, this is also a brand new reddit account go for easy karma farming posts so I wouldn't give it too much attention."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Nope, it is not a coincidence. Single player exclusives move consoles. I was thinking about getting an Xbox but I can just wait till Spring to play Indiana Jones so no more Xbox console for me."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Not that Sony makes many multiplayer games in the first place, aside for their yearly MLB title and occasionally some others (they do also publish MP games every now and then, such as Helldivers 2 this year)."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Sony Pictures understands movies, and their PlayStation division understands games. 



Together they help make some Banger stories and adventures. 



I'm a PC gamer, and I will gladly admit PS is probably one of the best gaming studios and will probably buy a ps5 just for GTA6.(GTA games hit PC 2-3 years later)


Sony has an exclusive marketing deal with Rockstar Games, and also looking to acquire the FromSoft studios."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,No. Single player games are just better
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I still wish for a 5, but I understand that they can't just keep coming up with these massive lost cities that somehow were never found in the modern world"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,UC2 still unparalleled imo
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"What really sucks is it has a fun multiplayer mode.... That you can't play on pc -_-

It's a great game with a fun MP mode locked to ""ps4"" only (ps5 has to run the ps4 version to play) so you are also stuck on 30fps."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Grant us eyes!
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"it seems like the more we ask for it, the more Sony/From Software wanna starve us"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Between how much fans are clamboring for it and how reticent the higher ups are to even acknowledge that it exists, I honestly think that there's something actually *wrong* with Bloodborne. Like, they lost the source code, or the ghost of Kentaro Miura is threatening to sue Miyazaki for copyright infringement or something, and they only recently started making headway on solving the problem."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,The fact that FromSoft has the same number as Bethesda and Capcom is pretty remarkable.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,That simple list took a lot of work.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"This requirement would‚Äôve been limited to only the largest publishers.  Who else can fund the production of many high quality games in a year?  Also, who publishes the title would have less to do with quality than who created the game. 

Is this criteria resulting in a list that is more about size or quality?

Are they the best of the big publishers or the best publishers?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,If Supergiant gets another nom with Hades 2 (I would guess they will based off the EA) it would be kind of wild to see them tied with the likes of Blizzard and Square.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"If I remember, God of War won 2018 and TLOU2 in 2020. That is it from this list I think."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Quick rundown of the GOTY category of the game awards in this time frame. 

2015 - Witcher 3 over Bloodborne, Fallout 4, MGS V, and Super Mario Maker

2016 - Overwatch over Inside, Doom, Titanfall 2, and Uncharted 4

2017 - LoZ:BotW over Horizon, PUBG, Mario Odyssey, and Persona 5

2018 - GoW over Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Celeste, Spiderman, Monster Hunter World, and RDR2

2019 - Sekiro over Control, Death Stranding, The Outer Worlds, RE2 Remake, and Smash Ultimate

2020 - TLOU 2 over Animal Crossing, Deem Eternal, FF7 Remake, Ghosts of Tsushima, and Hades

2021 - It takes Two over Metroid Dread, Deathloop, Psychonaughts 2, Ratchet and Clank, and RE Village

2022 - Elden Ring over A Plague Tale Requiem, GoW Ragnarok, Horizon FW, Stray, and Xenoblade Chronicles 3

2023 - Baldurs Gate 3 over Alan Wake 2, LoZ: TotK, Spiderman 2, RE4 Remake, Mario Wonder"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,just did a quick search: god of war 2018 and TLOU2 are both winners
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"at TGA? Only a few. But overall gotys they win more often. Like uncharted 4 had the most gotys tracked in 2016, but overwatch won at TGA. Death stranding had the most in 2019 but lost at TGA.

I'm still shocked that horizon 1 finished 2nd in 2017 (behind botw obviously) in overall gotys. It finished ahead of mario odyssey even."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Horizon had the misfortune of going up against Breath of The Wild.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Oh man, SOCOM was so good."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Some of those old ones are so funny. Like wow didn‚Äôt get a single nomination in any category in 2004 or 2008.

Madden 04 beat Kotor. 

COD 4 didn‚Äôt even get a nomination for goty. As stacked as 2007 was and there was only 3 nominations to begin with."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Well this post seems to be about GOTY from TGA. I don't think there were TGA goty awards before 2015.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"UC2 being the one that won it is kind of wild imo, and maybe i‚Äôm looking at it through 2009 lenses but for as much as i love UC2 i think Arkham Asylum was a far better game"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Idk about that, Spider-Man 2 felt like a step down from the first one. I liked it alright, but I was a little disappointed as a follow-up to SM1."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Not when some are taking up space where much better games could be included. The Outer Worlds being there in a year that gave us Outer Wilds and Disco Elysium is crazy.

Another example. Nominating Deathloop when you had games like Hitman 3 and Inscryption.

Then you've got cookie cutter open world games like Odyssey, Horizon, Tsushima etc. Games that have great elements in them but the lack of creativity in their open world design is very apparent. So not games that really stand out enough to be one of the best of that year"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,">and now they're competing for GOTY with a child-friendly robot whose purpose is to make players experience all of the Playstation's features.

No kidding. And (from what I've played of it so far) Astros Bot is *fantastic*. It reminds me of the old Mario Galaxy games."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I've only owned a PS4 and PS5 but I have zero regrets. I've had some of the best gaming experiences I've ever had on those two consoles. I have limited time to game so I'll take one good single player experience a year over endless multiplayer.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I just miss the ps3 days when they were more wild and experimental
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Bloodborne on pc.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Now if Xbox could manage to step up their game. Because at this point they are looking more like late 90s Sega. Which isn‚Äôt a good sign. We need at least 3 big consoles. Especially since 2 of them are dominated by 1 country.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Naughty Dog hasn't released a new game in 5 years.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,To me it's now that I'd rather play their big games on PC and knowing i'll get them eventually means I won't get a ps5. They have blockbuster exclusives but the thing is this list basically is all their notable exclusives for the last 10 years. I can't justify buying a 500-700 dollar system for that few big exclusives. Also this spans 2 generations of consoles.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I agree. The first console I ever bought with my own money was a PlayStation 2 with Gran Turismo 3 and I‚Äôve never looked back. 

Nintendo (NES) was my first actual console - bought by my parents, of course. I cannot say the same for them. They have declined so much."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-06,In 2009 they had Uncharted 2. It was the winner that year too.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Everyone knows GOTY is a circlejerk until it validates your opinion, then it's a flawless and objective judgement of quality"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Not only that but they're just not interesting games for the most part. Or they're sequels, or cousins of other games."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,How many GOTY editions does it take for people to notice?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Matpat has a good video about GOTY bias. Basically it's all old dudes deciding the games so the picks are all cinematic dad games, which is exactly the type of game sony makes."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,They celebrate the developers too lmao. They LITTERALLY bring them up on stage and are personally handed the award every year
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Shout-out to Microsoft's Hi-Fi Rush for being nominated in other categories ;)
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Per the Psychonauts 2 docu though, MS buying Double Fine absolutely expanded the resources available for the game. It was only as good as it was because MS helped out, they definitely deserve the credit on that one."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Nintendo doesn't have one this year either, do they?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Xbox had Forza Horizon 5 and Flight Simulator in 2020 which were two of the highest rated games released that year and neither got a GotY nomination because they're from niche genres.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I mean from this list nowadays the only exclusives are bloodborne and astrobot arent they?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Forza Horizon 5 was the single highest rated game of 2021.

Ori Will of the Wisps wasn't nominated with no explanation given but presumed because it was ""too small"" with a 90 metacritic, same for Ori and the Blind Forest with an 88, but Stray was nominated with an 83.

Gears 5 (84) and Halo Infinite (87) were not nominated, but Death Stranding (82) and Ghost of Tsushima (83) were nominated.

There was no chance an Xbox exclusive was ever going to get nominated at a show where the dorito pope chooses selection panel."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Whose game of the year is this? Don‚Äôt a ton of places release their versions? Is there one that is ‚Äúdefinitive?‚Äù
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"> Deathloop was exclusive to PS5 for that year

It wasn't. Deathloop was a multiplatform release (PC + PS5) in September 2021."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I still think we need to take a step back and appreciate Microsoft once had a GotY That was exclusive to Playstation 5.

This timeline is weird, man."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Probably the Geoff Keighley Show featuring Geoff Keighley and Geoff Keighley.

But he DID do a great job at making his awards show the definitive one (also thanks to the name)."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"The Game Awards, the by far biggest Award type thing we have had going for the last 5+ years?

At least that's what I assumed because its the obvious one"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Agreed, seems like this is to just fill the vacuum left by no E3.  These are just to drum up hype for whatever is next."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"It sort of replaced E3, so yeah, their awards seem to matter more to people now for some reason. I don't see any value in it, though it is nice when good developers like Larian get their spotlight."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"An industry controlled by two companies might not technically be a monopoly, but it's certainly not healthy.

The concerns about industry consolidation are a lot deeper than just the fanboy console wars."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It was until recently.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It's from *the* specific and prestigious GOTY award known as The Game Awards (AKA The Geoff Keighley Show featuring Geoff Keighley)
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,God of War and The Last of Us Part II
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Not really because Bloodborne isn't just made on PS4, it's a Sony intellectual property

It's not just a game that FromSoft made on PlayStation, it's a Sony game that FromSoft made *for* PlayStation

Same deal as Demon's Souls, FromSoft doesn't own either of those games' trademarks"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,They are listing Sony published games. Rebirth is from Square Enix as usual for the franchise.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Bloodborne like Demon's Souls are Sony IPs...

Sony didn't even want to release Demon's Souls in the West which is why it was published by Atlus in the Americas and Namco in the Europe.

They did similar shit with earlier PS IPs like Devil Dice/Bombastic \[XI / XI go\] for the PS1/2.

Sometimes they fund and co-create great things and lock them in the closet until another publisher recognizes its worth and brings it out for the people to enjoy.

Sonys play with Final Fantasy and a lot of other 3rd party IPs is the opposite, they throw some cash at the publisher in terms of marketing or lower license fees for the privilege of not releasing the content on other platforms. They have no ownership there just a fuck you contract to owners of other platforms."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"This is just first party stuff or else youd be seeing FF7, Black Myth, and alot of other exclusives here."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"In that same vein, should Death Stranding even be on that list as a ‚ÄúSony‚Äù nominee? Kojima Productions is an independent studio and DS is now on xbox."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Calling Uncharted niche is wild. It sold 15 million copies.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Did you play Rift Apart? It was an excellent game. I'm not sure how you could call Uncharted niche in any way, it's a third person shooter with puzzles. Crystal Dynamics made an entire trilogy of Lara Croft games, which the first two were great, almost based entirely around the same gameplay aspects. Metaphor: Refantazio is nominated for GOTY and is about as niche a game as you could get. A lot of the categories are for specific genres too, do you want it to just be 16 awards for indie games? What are you even complaining about?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,And Spider-Man 2 was completely mediocre.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Dude you bought and played most of these twice, and liked them enough to state you will be buying unreleased and unannounced future games, but they're not good? lol"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Sony‚Äôs Japan Studio approached FromSoftware for a new game, it was a cooperative development."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Seems like they're just stating facts.
Like the fact that Xbox hasn't dropped a game that's been nominated for like a decade"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,that‚Äôs what she said
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,They owned the IP until just this year when Kojima bought out his contract. I do agree it's kind of a grey area where more 3rd party though.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It was funded by Sony.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"It was a PlayStation exclusive at launch, but was made by an independent team and has since come to PC and Xbox."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"It's only referring to The Game Awards, which is generally the award show people mean when they don't reference a specific one."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Astrobot and Metaphor ReFantazio are the best reviewed games this year and share the highest metacritic score of 94. No other game this year scored above 93
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Guess they weren‚Äôt good enough?  


I don‚Äôt get the point of down casting games cause my favorite didn‚Äôt make it. Hell I didn‚Äôt play Balatro but with the way ppl spoke about it all year I ain‚Äôt gonna say it doesn‚Äôt deserve it."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Making consistent bangers for a whole decade and winning multiple GOTY awards isn‚Äôt some mundane accomplishment, it‚Äôs the epitome of consistency"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It's a platformer like Super Mario Galaxy
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Same. Not heard anything about it until I saw it was a nominee. Thought it was one of those free demo things you get with sony and really didn't know what it was doing there
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,1st 3d platformer outside of Nintendo to really hit the quality of Mario imo
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Meh, not really"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Nah, both those games are fantastic, and that's coming from someone who never played a previous ratchet game or astrobot game until these ones. They're both so well polished and pure fun to play."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I didn't enjoy God of War. I skipped out on Astro Bot
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,They definitely putting money in someone‚Äôs pocket
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,God of war won that year. And I believe tlos2 as well
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,The Game Awards hasn't been going since 1994 though.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Out of about 14k games released each year, a list of 10 games is pretty short."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,This list is just Sony owned IP nominees.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,You‚Äôre not alone.  Couldn‚Äôt care less about a single one of these titles
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"IP wasn't owned by PlayStation at the time of release(it's why Death Stranding is on this list) 

FF7R is a Square Enix game."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Which one?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I quite enjoyed Bloodborne, TLOUS2, and Uncharted 4.  Rift Apart was quite fun, tho the game was a bit light."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Bloodborne maybe, but you are right about the others."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"There have been many winners and nominees that aren't cinematic and graphics heavy tho.  But yes, Sony does make a lot of cinematic heavy games.  From that list tho, Bloodborne and Astrobot are very different from the rest."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,What games do u like?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Hey if you want to play on PC that‚Äôs perfectly fine!
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Who cares
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"With thier new timed exclusivity policy, it's probably a matter of time before Astro Bot comes to PC.

No comment on the other one though."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"There are several very valid and legitimate reasons to dislike the game or find it boring, but calling it Walking Simulator = ''I didn't play the game and I'm not basing my opinion on what the game actually offers''.

It's more of a logistics planning game like Eurotruck Simulator but in the apocalypse, with horror touches, tons of unlockable futuristic devices to tame the terrain and optimize your deliveries, an innovative asynchronous multiplayer system, and fights against bandits, terrorists, antimatter ghosts, lovecraftian tar monsters and sometimes skeleton soldiers revived from the world wars."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Exclusives are the reason that Sony is dominating the console market. Seems like a pretty good reason to me.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"There is a business reason to have them. Say I wanted Spider-Man, I‚Äôd have to buy a PlayStation when it released. And now that I have a PlayStation, what am I also going to buy? The other exclusives. Sony continues to get a cut from software because you now are in their ecosystem. You don‚Äôt have an incentive to buy all of their games if you‚Äôre not invested into the hardware to play them."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Exclusives allow for games to be developed faster and better.  Having to optimize for a particular set of hardware is a huge advantage in that process.  It should allow for better games.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I think as a publisher, Sony is the best in terms of the quality of games that come from them and their owned studios. 

If they released their games to all platforms, they would sell so many games, it wouldn't matter about Playstation or not. People who like playing on consoles will still buy them."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,">Well when you have money and own a massive portion of the industry

This reminds more of Microsoft Xbox, do you know the 75 billion dollar Activision acquisition is the biggest gaming acquisition of all time and the only comparable acquisition in the entire entertainment industry was Disney buying Fox in 2019. Xbox has more dev studios than Playstation and Nintendo combined."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,MS is proof owning the market and having all the money don't mean shit if you have 0 talent.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I would love to hear what you find good games then with ur incredible and divine taste.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"You say that like it should be expected, but no other publisher has achieved that not even Nintendo"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Platform exclusive? Most of these are on PC now, just still owned by Sony."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Sony owns the vast majority of the studios that made the games though.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Bloodborne was made in collaboration between Sony Japan Studio and Fromsoft. Sony also owns the IP.

Guerrilla Games(Sony studio) helped with Death Stranding, it was also developed using their engine. Sony owned the IP, but they transferred the rights to Kojima this year.

All the other games came from their own studios"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Santa Monica Studios (God of War), Naughty dog (Uncharted, The Last of Us), Team Asobi (Astro Bot), Insomniac Games (Ratchet and Clank, Spider-Man), Guerilla Games (Horizon, Killzone) all fall under PlayStation Studios.

So yeah, Sony made most of these games."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,bloodborne and death stranding are the only 2 where sony had no say. All other games are made by children studios of ps.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Literally every game listed here expect for bloodborne is from a PlayStation studio
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"""Largest console in the world paid to have good exclusives that mostly didn't win GOTY"" isn't as good a headline, I suppose."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Death Stranding is more like Eurotruck Simulator but in the apocalypse, with horror touches, realistic traversal and management mechanics that no other game has, tons of unlockable features, tools, weapons, exoskeletons, vehicles, accesories and infrastructure types to optimize your deliveries, fights against bandits, terrorists, antimatter ghosts, lovecraftian tar monsters and skeleton soldiers revived from the world wars, and an asynchronous multiplayer system in which players collaborate with each other by leaving ladders or climbing anchors, building bridges, roads, safehouses, watchtowers, recharging points, ziplines, donating gear and materials, signaling dangers and points of interest, returning lost cargo, even during boss fights another player's character can emerge from the ground to give you weapons and healing items."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,If that was the case why is Balatro nominated this year lol
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Journs and shills
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Not Sony‚Äôs list. The Game Awards.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Have you played it? It has 92% positive user reviews on Steam, the majority of people who actually played it enjoyed it, that's why it's getting a sequel. Obviously there are seas of people who don't like it, some for very legitimate and valid reasons but many others just for prejudices and absurdly reductionist memes that don't even correctly portray what the game has to offer."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,One of the highest ranked games of all time.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Agreed
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"You would think so but no other publisher has achieved this, even Nintendo missed 2016,2018, and 2024"

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Not a Sony product. An Activision product.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Not even PS exclusive

I'm happy for playstation owners they got to enjoy these great games. I'm still waiting for the new fable.."

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Yes
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,So having a platform for indies and well some games like Baldurs gate is trash gotsha let them rot
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Calling Death Stranding a Walking Simulator = ''I didn't play the game and I'm not basing my opinion on what the game actually has to offer''.

Although it's valid and respectable if a post-apocalyptic logistics planning game with shooting action, horror touches and many unconventional gimmicks is not your cup of tea at all."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Like give them a category where they can shine, but None of the games are truly addicting, which was what games use to be."

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Playstation exclusive franchise. I didn't realise there had been many Astrobot games until recently. It's weird this one is being nominated because it is actually the same game they've made many times, this one just has references to a lot of different Sony franchises."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It‚Äôs a start to finish Mario rip off

Guerilla Games : Killzone(PS3)>Horizon(PS4)"

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I think they are referring to nominations
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Nintendo had both BotW and Mario Odyssey nominated for GOTY in 2017.

If the company delivered, they should be rewarded ;)

Beside, every year Sony had 2 games nominated, both were great games."

Of the games listed above Only God of War (2018) & The Last of Us, Part II have actually won the award (with Astro Bot as a pending given the awards this year are next week)."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"this lists nominees not winners, God of War did win that year tho"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I actually played all of my old games during the lockdown
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I saw a post earlier that said it was 5 years today they found the first case of Rona. Crazy to think half a decade passed
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Those 2 years blur together for me
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"There will be but from that leak awhile back, it‚Äôs looking like R&C will have a new game every start of a new generation 

Like a launch title

Which as a big R&C fan, sucks"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"There damm well better be. 

Or at least make the old games playable natively. My internet sucks and I can‚Äôt effectively stream them. And the less said about trying to emulate them on pc. The better."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,the devs put out Spiderman 2 after but i think the leak showed that the devs are basically gonna be a marvel studio for the next decade
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Well from what I heard the closest date seems to be 2029... It's a shame Insomniac turned it's back to the game that made them be what they are, but well I guess Marvel games have that much pull."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I played both so my timeline is all sorts of confused. The PS version feels more recent and the PC version feels like it's been longer.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Amen
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,But then how will I know who my mom is sleeping with? There's apparently a LOT of people...
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Also, multiplayer games only have a shelf life of a few years until the player base moves on to the next Call of Duty. 

The Game of the Year award typically goes to something more timeless that can be played again in a few years. So you can actually play the GOTY 2014."

Im pretty sure people playing Multiplayer games just dont give a fuck about these awards. I mean I havent seen anything from most of the games on this list."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,People like competition and playing with friends. Idk that's how I feel these days
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"As an extrovert working from home, gaming is one of my social times. So single player games really aren't something I'm interested and they really just seem lonely.

I'm glad others find enjoyment in it though. I'm guessing it's a good recharge moment for many."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Some people find facing another human opponent mentally engaging
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"100%

I just recently started playing WoW again after almost 10 years (I know...) only because they've finally introduced actual single-player end game content. You can run regular dungeons with a team of NPC's or do ""delves"" by yourself or with a single friend. 

It's so much more enjoyable when you don't have to play with a group full of try-hards that exist purely to shit on people that don't spend every waking moment min-maxing their characters and playstyles."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Man but that is part of the fun of playing online games listening to hateful morans talk utter nonsense is always a good laugh. Don't let some 13-year-old call of duty shitter ruin games for you. That means the troll has won, well in their eyes."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,And even Overwatch winning came with lots of criticism as Overwatch didn't have the most nominations that year but won anyway.

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Baldur's Gate 3 has a very robust multi-player (including splitscreen) but it's not competitive multi-player if that's what you mean.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"There was also it takes two, that wasn‚Äôt single player"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It Takes Two and Baldurs Gate 3
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,True
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Also most reviewers can only spend relatively little time per game, leading to easier story driven games getting higher scores."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Yeah, I mean, wtf would Playstation have on there? They don't make multiplayer games often. The only ones in recent time I can think of is Concord and Helldivers."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Because some random exec once said that it's better to focus on multi-player than single-player and Reddit gamers felt so insulted they can't let it go years later
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Concord ü§ì
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"In 2023 they publicly announced their focus would be live service multiplayer games:

They planned to launch 12 live service in like 3 years.

>Ryan adds: ""The way people play games has changed a lot over the last few years.

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"> Single player exclusives move consoles.

Probably true, but consoles are usually sold at cost or even cheaper, so moving more of them isn't worth much. There's a reason Playstation titles are going cross-platform and Xbox is abandoning the idea of a distinct console."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I mean honestly Xbox‚Äôs first upcoming first party output looks really good imo.

I know the general consensus is that their finished and all their games are going multiplatform, but until it actually starts happening en masse; I still think it‚Äôs pretty worth it to support what they got.

I mean, other then Gears E-Day and State of Decay 3 (and even then both start out as single player games), a lot of their first party exclusives are single player.

With at least Avowed, South of Midnight, and Fable confirmed for this year, with other stuff like Perfect Dark, Clockwork Revolution, Outer Worlds 2, OD etc.

Maybe I‚Äôm just being a dumb fanboy, idk but I personally think there‚Äôs plenty to be excited for."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Agree. Look how many units Nintendo moves because of the new Zelda, Mario, Pokemon, or other mainline series release. On the other hand, Xbox has always wanted to compete in the multiplayer arena. I personally stick with PlayStation because I prefer single player, story-driven games."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,">Sony Pictures understands movies,

Do they? Madam Web is a flop and just 7 years ago Sony was very close to selling off their studio division after like 8 flops in a row. 

Let's not act like theyre a blue chip studio pushing out hit after hit."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I'm on my 2nd, very long, play-through of *Red Dead Redemption 2*.

The first play-through was on the PS4. I've never been able to really get into the GTA games, though I did try and totally get why people like it.

If Rockstar can make even 1 game every ~2 years on the same level as RDR2 or GTA - I feel comforted in knowing that there will be something really immersive waiting when i'm ready.

RDR2 on the PS5 looks incredible, too. As far as i'm aware there's no PS5 specific patches for it either."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It's the other way around. Kadokawa (fromsoft parent) is facing a hostile takeover from a chinese company and went to Sony to get ahead of it.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,You say that but people play multiplayer games way more. People that have friends at least.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"but Nate's Story is over, I prefer a game with Chloe and Sully or a young Sully game"

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"While I love the series and would love another go at it, I don‚Äôt want a 5. Nate‚Äôs story is done and they wrapped it up in such a fantastic way I hope they leave it be. They can still do more Uncharted games, but not with Nate and the rest of the crew."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,4 is close because the story and gameplay are better. BUT that Uncharted 2 pacing is just unmatched
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Yeah the spectacle might have gotten a little too grand imo. But 2 was the perfect upgrade to 1, which was fine but nothing special. The set pieces, solid gameplay (and awesome mp), AND extras (like playing with 0 gravity or fat drake lol) was so fun.

Plus, the graphics looked so insane back in the ps3 days."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I‚Äôm pretty sure multiplayer is 60fps on the PS4 version, only single player is 30fps."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Classic Naughty Dog. They did the same thing with the Last of Us.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Just Sony. They're big fans of buying IPs and then sitting on them.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Nothing to do with FromSoft. Sone owns the IP
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"It's the silksong curse. Every time someone on the internet asks for bloodborne on pc, it gets delayed another day. I think we're looking at a few decades out for both at this point..."

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Not really. Bethesda don't actually release a game as often. And Fromsoft has only been a contender since Dark Souls era started. Like think about it. Since 2011 Bethesda itself has only released Skyrim, Fallout 4, Fallout 76 and Starfield. That's only 4 games in 13 years. And 76 wasn't even really all them.¬†"

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I‚Äôm sorry to be a little bitch here‚Ä¶but God of War winning over RDR2 still boggles my mind man.  Like, GoW is objectively a great ass game sure‚Ä¶but winning over Red Dead?!  Just‚Ä¶wild."

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Surprised GOW beat RDR2. But from what I recall Sony and Nintendo just time their releases to not get in each other's way. Like the year before this Breath of the Wild and Mario Odyssey released, and the year after was Smash Bros Ultimate."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Bro I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶Deem Eternal is hilarious. I spent way too many minutes trying to figure out what that game was, then I realized and had a good laugh over it!ü§£ü§£"

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,2015 was such a good year.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"2017 was an insane year and they didn't even nominate Xenoblade Chronicles 2 which could've easily been in the list. 


2023, also an insane year. So many great games  that didn't make the list but could've."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Yeah, the Horizon series has a track record of releasing extremely close to the biggest and most hyped game of the year. 

I love the Horizon series and feel fully confident that Horizon 3 will be released the same day as a surprise collaboration between FromSoftware and Nintendo for their game: Zelda: Link to the Erd Tree, written by a resurrected Tolkien."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It happening once is tragedy. It happening twice is comedy.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I was like top 150 in the world at that game but it was before the era of esports and I was never quite that good at another game again lol :(

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Even if it was a step down I would still list it as one of the best games of the year.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I quit playing it and I really wanted to get all the costumes and 100% it. It was so bad is so many different ways.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I don't think Spiderman 1 even deserves to be nominated, other than the web swinging (which isn't even new) everything about the gameplay was pretty generic."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Also a great intro to video games overall. It‚Äôs my 5year old‚Äôs first game and she loves it. Been coming home every day asking to play the ‚Äúrobot game‚Äù.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,">  It reminds me of the old Mario Galaxy games.

I wonder why?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"PS2 was the actual innovation era. 

PS3 was the beginning of the modern Triple A market. 

Further, PS3 actively inhibited developers because of its much more arcane and closed requirements. 

Hence why we have never had a port of Metal Gear Solid 4 (unlike the first three PS2 games), because it was designed to work with PS3 hardware and that made porting it a massive headache. 

Compare the ease of transition for example from PS4 to PS5 (generally smooth front-ports), compared to PS3 to PS4 (needed its own emulation service)."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I really miss MAG. Id like to see it done again in some form.

They‚Äôve had multiple chances to catch back up and reclaim a foothold by acquiring multiple studios, only to close them afterwards, and every time they try to bring a classic franchise back to prominence (Halo Infinite), or introduce a new one (Starfield), it seems like they take one confident step forward, and (if they‚Äôre lucky only one) step back."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Meh, I own all the consoles and still spend a **lot** of time on my SX. Gamepass is the best gaming deal available today.

Nintendo and Sony digital prices are ridiculous and whilst PS+ is better than it was it still lacks a lot of exclusives sadly which is all I want from it.

Plus a few decent gems over the last few years from MS backed studios too imo. Just because they aren't console exclusives people dismiss them.

People always apply the wrong metric which is sales, without realising that Microsoft still move a ton of units given they have always predominantly struggled in the East and Sony/Nintendo have heritage"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Rather have game developers instead of more consoles.

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Nintendos a half a year to a year out from launching a new console by all the rumors. It's understandable for them to have a lighter year.¬†

Just that they really ported of those game, except Bloodborne, I don't care about it but I know a lot of people would kill to have it, so it's just sad

I waited Ghost of Tsushima for 4 years, I know, so poor Bloodborne enjoyers =/"

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"See I want games to be available on all platforms so I can play with whom ever I want. They make good games except concord. Higher quality is not really true as we have seen much better titles come out from smaller studios like baulders gate 3 from laurian studios. Sony has good games yes. 

Corporations like sony destroy the quality of games over time. The profits always need to go up. This is why we are seeing studios shut down. 

Studios need to be smaller and create good games without messing them up with corporate over sight."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Yeah they would give them more sales and help finance bigger games

But it is what it is w Sony being wierd"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Ok? But Sony does have talent, 9/10 Sony games are great, I was just saying the bad ones get treated the same as the good. Spiderman 2 was to put it nicely, bad but it still got shoehorned into awards when other games very obviously did better."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"And Sony killed off Japan studio, so there goes the neighborhood."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Actually Sony had 100% say on both of those games and IP and still do for Bloodborne. They just this year sold the Death Stranding IP back to Kojima, and they can do whatever they want with Bloodborne with or without Fromsofts permission or input. It would be pointless and stupid but they could give any dev studio and have them release Bloodborne 2 if they wanted to"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,And those are the best two on the list.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Bloodborne was actually codeveloped with a Playstation Studio and they own the IP, it isnt a stretch to call the game itself a first party game"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Death Stranding was from Kojima Studios which is independent from Sony. They had a contract for DS and Kojima fully owns the rights again as of this year.

You're essentially a deliveryman who walks. If you don't press buttons to walk you trip over yourself. It's hours of just walking at times. It was talked up to be a whole new genre of videogame entertainment called a ""strand game"" by Kojima. The first question I ask when playing a game is ""is this fun?"" If it isn't, it does not matter how interesting the plot is. In my opinion this would've been better as a short series on HBO or something rather than a game.

- Uncharted is like a 7. It's not bad but it's not GotY worthy of any year.
- Walking Simulator is a 5 if you didn't want to watch a movie. If you like watching your games play themselves than I can see this being a 10.

It can't be those that did it

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"> Also, multiplayer games only have a shelf life of a few years until the player base moves on to the next Call of Duty. 

Meanwhile, Battlefield 4 came out in 2013 and is *still* populated with [thousands of players every day](https://steamcharts.com/app/1238860).

It's not that MP games die off quickly, it's that shallow, power-fantasy driven MP games in series with annual releases die off quickly because those IPs are intentionally designed to have a shelf-life of only 1 year."

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Definitely not making multiplayer games anytime soon after the last one
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Bless you for finally figuring out the real question I was asking.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,The strategy shift that brought us Concord
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Nowhere did they say they would FOCUS on live service. The majority of their ongoing projects are single player games. Of those 12 included GT and MLB.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Which is fucking stupid and I think might be start of the decline of Sony. Sony‚Äôs brand is built upon high quality single player games. A lot of the people that buy Sony consoles are single player gamers that like their single player games. To completely ditch that to go to live service is basically alienating the type of people that buy your console.

I‚Äôm guessing they recognized this was an overall bad decision and that‚Äôs why factions and the Spider-Man live service was cancelled. Yes they need some live service games so they have a secure moneymaker that allows them to pump out high quality single player games, since costs of games keep rising. However to turn all their brands into live service shit was dumb from the beginning. 

Last 4 Sony games, only 1 was the usual sony good quality. Concord was the biggest flop in triple a gaming history. The until Dawn remake got questionable reviews, and same with the lego horizon game. Astro bot was the only one of the games that you would expect from Sony.

They might be fucked and there is no right answer. They clearly want to shift away from single player games because dev costs keep going up which makes them to risky to make. However out of any dev or publisher on the planet, Sony is known for its single player titles. They are literally built around that market."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"PlayStation is going cross platform because they recognize they can profit from PC players who continually ask for their games to be made available to them. They have been successful in their ecosystem and recognize that they can profit even more from PC players who quite literally demand their products. 

Yes you are right, consoles are typically sold at a loss, that‚Äôs what makes exclusives so important. They are the incentive to invest in a specific console. Similar to what I said about exclusives move consoles. Xbox is abandoning distinct consoles because theirs have been underselling by comparison and need to offer up their products across the market to remain profitable after purchasing the largest casual gaming market for close to $70 billion. 

The difference is Sony has done well in their contained ecosystem and now they are pandering to PC players while Microsoft needs to offer their products everywhere to help them turn over a profit after spending way too much of the company‚Äôs Monopoly money to make overpriced purchases."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Avowed and clockwork revolution might move the needle for me. Those look good from what I saw. But will they stay exclusive? Microsoft‚Äôs strategy now is taking the ‚Äúmoral high road‚Äù and make their games multi platform. Nvm you that they are double dipping in profit margins because they recognize that in order for gamepass to continually release quality day one exclusives they need to sell games as well as take in subscription money. I‚Äôm worried Xbox is going to be more about profits than quality experiences like Ubisoft or EA became. The examples you provide do help dissolve those worries a bit.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"One thing I've appreciated about the games Microsoft has put out over the past generation is the fact that they seem to be taking risks with the games they put out. Yeah, they've released a lot of stinkers and haven't really managed to achieve Sony's level of quality when it comes to their games, but just look at the kind of games they put out this gen. We've gotten multiple flight simulators, multiple RTS titles, a wonderful survival crafting game (grounded), A multiplayer pirate FPS (Sea of Thieves), several smaller scale RPGs from Obsidian, as well as a game like Psychonauts 2, which in all likelihood wouldn't exist if Microsoft didn't purchase Double Fine. Meanwhile when I look over at Sony's first party titles while I see nothing but great games, I also see almost nothing but single player third person action games. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, and those titles would absolutely make me pick up a playstation over an xbox. I just appreciate that Xbox seems to be letting developers take risks rather than be stuck in the back half of the 360 era where everything was just Gears of War, Halo, and Forza."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Right? Sony has a couple exceptional movies surrounded by an ocean of garbage. The gaming division is probably the only thing keeping them afloat. Even then I'd argue it's not even thanks to a superior platform. They simply own the right devs and have THE recognizable brand
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Sony can afford to gamble on bad movies, it's part of their strategy.

But acting like they haven't delivered absolute bangers like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, Venom, Bullet Train, Elysium, or even the delightful chaos of Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs? That's willful ignorance.

Here‚Äôs the thing, Sharknado 7 isn‚Äôt a masterpiece that demanded sequels. It exists because studios can milk tax write-offs from movies that bomb just hard enough. It‚Äôs not about the audience, it's about the balance sheet.

When you're as rich as Sony, bad movies aren‚Äôt failures. They‚Äôre calculated losses, paving the way for even bigger wins on the projects they actually care about. It's the cinematic equivalent of throwing a pawn to protect the queen."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I mean... if you're a game Studio and you run to Sony to save you, than Sony it's probably the preferable game Studio you would want to work for."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"> People that have friends at least.

You say this as if the modern multiplayer games *weren't* designed around matchmaking complete strangers with each other. I'm not sure there's any correlation between having friends and playing popular multiplayer games, and I'm certainly not confident which direction that correlation would point."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Playing a game more doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you enjoy the game itself more. Personally my enjoyment in multiplayer games come largely from the social aspect, whereas I only play single player games if I really want to play that game itself. I can only speak for myself, but I‚Äôve hopped on a game countless times for countless hours that I didn‚Äôt necessarily feel like playing at that moment, but did anyway because some buddies hopped on."

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Nah that‚Äôs literally the Microsoft playbook. 

Sony at least releases games, even if they stay console exclusive forever. I can‚Äôt remember the last time I was excited for a Microsoft game release. Maybe Gears of War 3 was the last time"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Others addressed that Sony didn't ""buy the IP and sit on it"" but also sometimes things don't need 27 sequels."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"yeah but I really wonder what they're getting from that. From a financial perspective, there's absurd amonuts of money to be made. Instead, they remaster demon's souls..."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"You are thinking of Bethesda the studio, the stat refers to Bethesda the publisher which has way more games than Fromsoft"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"This is about Bethesda as a publisher which would include the games from Id Software, Machine Games, Arkane etc. In fact, of the 4 games counted here, only one was developed by Bethesda Game Studios."

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Yet, the scale of that achievement really depends on the competition too.

Also, in the gameplay reveal trailer, one of Sam's first lines was ""I make deliveries, that's all'', and then we see him traveling through rugged natural landscapes, unholstering an assault rifle in front of an enemy camp, and sneaking through BT territory."

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"The term ''Strand Game'' refers to the game's Social Strand System, the asynchronous multiplayer feature in which players collaborate with each other by leaving ladders or climbing anchors, building bridges, roads, safehouses, watchtowers, recharging points, ziplines, donating gear and materials, signaling dangers and points of interest, returning lost cargo, even during boss fights another player's character can emerge from the ground to give you weapons and healing items, a multiplayer element about connecting players instead of having them fight each other."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Seriously? and the vehicles? the tons of new features and devices of all kinds that you unlock throughout the entire game? building infrastructure to facilitate and optimize your deliveries? the BTs? the Mules? the terrorist faction? the travels to the world wars? planning your route? planning the gear and tools you will take with you to overcome the dangers and environmental obstacles along the way? the collaborative multiplayer features?

It's also valid not self-impose you to walk everywhere and ignore the interesting game content just because the first opinion you heard about the game was from someone lying that that walking was the only thing it had to offer. That or you only played for 1 hour and assumed you'd seen everything"

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Ragnarok had incredible pacing and acting and writing as well. It flowed like an incredible epic action story. Elden ring is amazing in it's own ways but is best experienced in your own path carving your own way. And essentially has no writing or acting performances besides one off characters and boss intros. And deep lore for the writing.

Lol, No. 

Sony makes great phones, cameras, TVs, audio and musical engineering equipment, ect. Video games aren't even their specialty and they still do it better than most.


Because they are a dominant force in the Tech industry is exactly why they have a dominant console in the first place."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"> The gaming division is probably the only thing keeping them afloat.

That's not true, the music record label makes them [more profit than the gaming division](https://www.statista.com/statistics/912798/sony-operating-income-by-segment/). The gaming division is second and the camera and entertainment hardware businesses are third and fourth in terms of profit, respectively.


> They simply own the right devs and have THE recognizable brand

They have the recognizable brand because they built it from the ground up and know how to nurture new developers and build them into powerhouses. Look at Naughty Dog and Insomniac, which were both making lower budget platformers during the PS2 era and are now releasing critically-acclaimed blockbusters.

Invalidating this and acting like they got there by chance is weird considering Microsoft has significantly more resources than Sony and still can't compete with them in gaming."

It's kinda dated and I'm tired of the way the characters control, where you touch a rock or a slight incline and your character flops immediately like they are a wet noodle. There's some cool ragdolling, but it ends up hurting gameplay a lot (like in another game that tries this, dragon's dogma 2.)"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Red Dead's problems is that it's too bloated.

the campaign is way too long for it's own good."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"And some of the flaws are HUGE, unignorable, and completely pervasive. Down to the very basics like ""controlling your character is clunky and unfun.""

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I think it's because RDR2 was a much more popular game than GoW with nearly 3x the sales. So I don't think it's so crazy for people to assume that would reflect in awards.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"The length of RDR2 is one of my favorite parts tbh. It added a lot to the world and characters and made the emotional moments hit a lot harder. I would disagree with it feeling empty, maybe if you compare it to a linear game like god of war but for an open world game, the world felt very alive and there were always unique moments wherever you went. It‚Äôs not for everyone but for the right audience (me) RDR2 is basically perfect, I‚Äôve spent hundreds of hours doing nothing but hunting, fishing, gambling, taking care of my horses, robbing, and just riding around looking at the world."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Rdr2 had better story and character writing, better world design, and more attention to detail across the board. GOW had more engaging active gameplay on average though. Still red dead was the better game by a long shot."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"GOW 2018 is a good story-based action game.¬†

RDR2 is a creative masterpiece."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I thought Deathloop was pretty good as well. Resident Evil Village while not the best RE game is definitely a solid addition to the series
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Yep.  I'd have picked TotK myself but I can definitely see why BG3 won, it's been a gaming sensation."

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"True, and the thing that made them both stand out was the characters, writing, and story. Peter and Otto, Jin and Shimura had such great chemistry, the family to adversary shift was so well done and the tragedy of both was just so well executed in spite of the relatively cookie-cutter framework they were build upon.¬†"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"FH5 and Flight Sim 2020 were two of the highest rated games that launched that year, but these awards always never nominate niche genres for the GotY position."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Highest rated game that year I think. Racing games never get nominated, or even looked at. TGA has a style they like, and I would be very surprised if any heavy multiplayer, live service (launch), or gameplay heavy game will get a win from it. 

Let us be real, CoD has more or less perfected the 'fps' genre, but itll never get a nod because we are used to that sort of perfection for a fps from CoD. Heck the tech from Flight Sim was incredible, but it didnt have a story so it doesnt get looked at."

You like it

That's ok

It's too dry and too long of a start of just hours upon hours of walking. I tried to like it but can't. It's a walking sim. There's QoL stuff later on but most of the crap your thinking about is the directors cut shit to make the game more tolerable"

So if it came out 2016, I stopped playing in 2018ish which means I‚Äôve been playing single player for 6 years and I can honestly say I‚Äôm happier because of that choice."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"It's still Elden Ring, even looking back on it. I've played through both multiple times, but GOWR doesn't hold a candle to the worldwide capture that ER had on the masses. It literally got casual players into the Souls series.

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"True. It was one of those years where I wouldn't have begrudged a win for either game. I might prefer Ragnarok a bit more personally, but both are great."

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Honestly that's my current favorite live service game. The only reason I don't think Sony has gone all in on it is because they don't own Arrowhead. They own the helldiver's IP, but the studio that made it isn't owned by Sony.

Sony struck gold with helldiver's, and I think if they owned Arrowhead they would be doing a lot more support for it and advertising it, as well as having support studios helping out with content. Iirc Arrowhead doesn't want to be bought, but I can see them being worried if Arrowhead changes their mind down the line and Microsoft offers them a fat buyout. That would completely fuck them over."

Dread was amazing, Village and Psychonaughts were both very good, and Deathloop was a great premise but I found got a touch stale after 30 hours. The only game I found to not be worth a nomination is ironically the winner It Takes Two.

The problem with that year is that, imo, any nominee from any other year would have likely won the award that year. Ff7 or Ghost of Tsushima gets delayed or Horizon or XC3 release earlier? Sure win."

As I said in my first comment, it's okay for people to dislike it for legitimate reasons, but if you say that the game is exclusively about walk everywhere you clearly didn't played it for 40 hours, that's the length of the main story alone, you would have seen bosses, enemies, vehicles and everything I mentioned and more."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"If after the first few hours you are walking everywhere instead of using vehicles, raiding enemy camps to farm resources and building infrastructure to facilitate your deliveries, you are doing something deeply wrong, did you stay in the tutorial area for dozens of hours or something?"

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,i think some people just expect every main story quest in a single player game to be mission impossible the entire way. imho those are just adhd teenagers used to high octane cod campaigns or some shit. sometimes single play RPG's and action RPGs need slower pacing at times to have dialogue with new characters and build relationships. such as atreus and angrboda going around the realm on her little quest. and so forth. i am okay with all of this. its developing a well written story with fully fleshed out characters etc.

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I‚Äôve been playing it a lot recently since they did a Halo 2 throwback playlist (Halo 2 maps and settings adjusted to make it play more like Halo 2) and it‚Äôs super fun. Infinite had a really rough launch and while it‚Äôs not the best Halo game the current multiplayer experience is fun and active enough to be a good time. I still usually pick it over the sweatfest that MCC has become (and the more or less dead game that 5 is).

It's only recently picked up again where we're seeing good games and a lot of them. Uncharted is a popcorn game. It's not a 9 or a 10 imo. I didn't say it was bad... A 7 is good... 

A 9/10 is like Zelda level. Is this anywhere near that? Hell no.

Why don't you talk to me about the game you're mad about.


Last of Us people tend to be unhinged and have fringe opinions. It's like what's going on with that Wicked movie. You have movie watchers (last of us fans) who want to just watch a movie in a property they enjoy and a bunch of theatre kids are singing and being rude in the theatre (last of us two fans), gatekeep it, and start crying at a child's movie. If someone asks them to be quiet or stop crying about it they go on a long winded explanation on how a trope-filled story is the best thing ever written and you ""must not get it"" even though it's the most simple story concept ever.


I'm only expanding on my opinion btw because you had to ironically say I'm wrong on my opinion. I'm not shoving shit in your face that you didn't ask for."

Pretty sure we saw Svartelheim in the trailer (the Dwarves' realm).

The rest of the screen looks similar to those sunny places, so I'm assuming it's just the same realm with some different trees

It leads perfectly in to the Judeo-Christian setting with Lif being Eve and Lifthrasir being Adam. But most devs don't really have the balls to go after that pantheon."

plyo3p,2021-09-11,2021-09-11,Pretty sure they don‚Äôt care about historical accuracy which is fair. People need to not get but hurt over things a game does. God of War has always been SciFi and magical and not real except the myth stories on the gods they try and keep accurate. Characters and areas and effects are all fake. It‚Äôs a video game.

plyo3p,2021-09-11,2021-09-11,The devs talked in the past about wanting to do Egypt before they settled on Norse so it wouldn't surprise me if they're coming back to those ideas.
plyo3p,2021-09-11,2021-09-11,"I don't remember exactly what these panels were about (Tyr's journey I think), but it shows references to religions of Egypt, Greece, Japan and the Celts:

plyo3p,2021-09-11,2021-09-11,Maybe it‚Äôs still a trilogy after all. Ragnarok ends the north sage and they have to run away to egypt or some shit and the third plays out there.

plyo3p,2021-09-11,2021-09-11,To be honest I thought it wasn't going to be the end. I thought thor would be the main boss in this then Odin the final boss in the 3rd game similar to the first trilogy where you fight Zeus at the end (as well as kill the rest of the pantheon).
plyo3p,2021-09-11,2021-09-11,Technically magni and modi are supposed to survive Ragnarok as well. But then they met Kratos.
plyo3p,2021-09-11,2021-09-11,It did but the format of gow123 worked through the pantheon I expected the new series to follow that by thor being the big bad then a 3rd game with odin as the big bad

Still though, The judo-Christian pantheon doesn't strike me as something that would work well in GoW. There's only a handful of archangels and God himself, all of which are effectively immortal/don't have any beings close to them in power."
plyo3p,2021-09-11,2021-09-11,"Magni and Modi, sons of Thor are fated to survive as well, but as you saw in the last game... Good news is some other gods survive too like Vidar and Njord."
plyo3p,2021-09-11,2021-09-11,Yea but as iv said in another reply. Motherfuckers misdirect all the time. And God of war 1 2 3 had a pattern I thought this new series might follow it mainly did in gow4. Kill one main boss plus a series of minors then in gow2 we killed some more and worked up to zeus in the third. Its not outwith the realms of possibility that the new series would follow this format. At this point I'm not entirely sure I'm still wrong on that as them jus saying it makes me dubious as to why they just out n revealed that. Could be to prepare us for the end of that journey or to misdirect
plyo3p,2021-09-11,2021-09-11,"Could also be Tyr, though right? Also yeah death is a minor setback for someone like Kratos.

plyo3p,2021-09-11,2021-09-11,Death does not tend to stick for Kratos. Curses worse than death don't even stick.

The Roman pantheon was big on grabbing myths/heritage from everywhere and *making it fit*. Especially as the Roman religions had a bunch of religious cults adding their own god/s to the mix.

The Norse pantheon is setting the stage in this as well, as its the merger of two or more tribal mythologies and several of the characters presented in the last game spell out that they were from other pantheons and they defined/were defined into their current positions.

I personally think the son choosing which name to go by is going to be a key point in Ragnarok, and the consequence of that would go into further games."

A minor deity could take the mantle of Jupiter for instance, but they wouldn't have control over the air like Zeus did. Same thing with Pluto and Mercury. Triton or Oceanus could take Poseidon's place, but other than that, the fallen Olympians wouldn't have someone to fill their shoes.

Not to mention Mars was a central figure in the Roman pantheon, and Kratos is the Greek god of war now that Ares is dead. I doubt anyone would want to potentially provoke him by claiming that title.

Plus many of the minor deities, Titans, and other powerful supernatural entities are gone too: Heracles, Charon, Helios, Thanatos, Kronos, et cetera. 

The Norse pantheon wasn't merging two distinct ones, at least not in GOW 2018. In Norse mythology there were two tribes of gods - the Aesir of Asgard, and the Vanir of Vanaheim. Both were part of the Norse pantheon. Freya wasn't an Aesir, she was Vanir, which I think she mentioned in the game. 

The only one who might not be Norse at all (in the game at least) would be Mimir, who mentioned he traveled quite a bit. Even if he wasn't Aesir, Vanir, or Jotun however, it's hardly merging two pantheons to have one character that isn't a native."
plyo3p,2021-09-11,2021-09-11,"Perhaps. That seems like it would trivialize Kratos's struggles against the Olympians in the previous games however. And I'm not overly interested in some supreme being overseeing everything in the God of War universe. I prefer the idea that there are separate pantheons, each with their own distinct realms."

Part of the problem is the fact that so little remains that can be definitively attached to the time period in question, as opposed to the Classical mythologies.

plyo3p,2021-09-11,2021-09-11,"yeah it was mostly structures on the central island with some mountains and trees around, couldn't say for sure because I was on PC, I still may have a screenshot or two lurking around."
plyo3p,2021-09-11,2021-09-11,"You‚Äôre a white knight, keyboard warrior twat. Lmao"
plyo3p,2021-09-11,2021-09-11,"Yeah, but you could have been a bit more chill, that last sentence was completly unnecessary and felt wrong just to read it. Besides why check other people's profiles when discussing? I don't think I ever did it."
plyo3p,2021-09-11,2021-09-11,I was wise to not say impossible :D

plyo3p,2021-09-11,2021-09-11,Where did anyone say or imply they weren't going to play the game because someone was black?
plyo3p,2021-09-11,2021-09-11,"Yeah , obviously a black character won't make me not play this game. Besides it's Angrboda, she's a giant, she's either from Jotunheim or Midgard. Which means anywhere and her skin color therefore doesn't matter."
plyo3p,2021-09-11,2021-09-11,Dude. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôve been saying thank you. Skin color doesn‚Äôt matter or relate to any exact location or land

zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,What did it cost? My entire ps4 exploding...
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,If only we could hear it over the roaring fan
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,I bet ya shit sounds like a jet engine though lol
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,"Excuse me, there's no reason to objectify Mr. Kratos like that

He's a strong, independent god WHO DON'T NEED NO DESTINY!"

zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,YOU have no right to be so beautiful üòò
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,I feel like the amount of optimization put into this game deserves a separate award. It looks really good for something that runs on ps.

zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Is this Ingame or a prerendered cutscene?
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Kratos beard has no right to be that beautiful on PS4
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,It's called passion and as much time as needed for the developers.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,I legitimately didn‚Äôt know this released on last gen consoles and thought this whole post was a troll‚Ä¶
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,That scene in Vanaheim. Beautiful!
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"I don't get it with everyone else's PS4 lol. Literally 15 minutes ago from this post I platinumed the game and in 1 month of playing this game on my base PS4 the only time it made excessive noise was when my girlfriend put the laptop on it when I was playing. The rest was plain sailing. And I'm not even one to clean it that much, just the dust off the edges. Is it really that bad for you guys?"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Goty by leaps and bounds
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"thats fucking kratos, he has every right to look like the god he is."

zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Bro

Your PS4 is a nuclear threat to humanity with that graphics"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"That is actually a very nice screenshot for PS4.

Is the PS5 version much higher?"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,I am impressed how we have gone from 8bit to this.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,How good the beard looks is what's most impressive.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Holy shit that looks better than my PS5. My TV is too big even though it's 4K.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Last one looks pretty incredible as well.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,consoles allways reach their peek when the new version comes out :( i remember shadow of the colossus.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"I love that playstation squeezes every last bit of optimization out of their consoles.

It's amazing."

zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Kratos has no right to be this beautiful in general
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"It's almost as if it's the story that matters, as graphics are already good enough, and you don't need to throw down $500...."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,I'll have to wait for PC release console isn't on the budget for a while.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,"I'm not trying to sound negative since this honestly is impressive, but how many fps does this game run at on the ps4?"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Photo Mode usually loads up the highest quality character models available
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,Oh yeah it does.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,Awesome game!

zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,Dude that's what decent textures and decent lighting can do. It's why I'm so confused why everyone wants dumbass raytracing.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,It was made for PS4 so makes sense
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,head looks kinda off.. like it's pasted on the pic
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,It's literally a PS4 game. They are just upsampling on PS5.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Is, is this a joke about the camera?"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,No right to be on PS4 period.  Time for PS4 to die.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2023-02-22,***~~this great~~***
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,Kratos manages to be both fat and ripped at the same time‚Ä¶
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,You have no right to post such a stupid fucking title with such a nonoriginaloverused phrase
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Yes it does man those fucking things are like 700 bucks.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,I honestly didn‚Äôt even know you could play it on PS4
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Developer said they focused on the PS4 version. Sorry PS5 users. Oops.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08, I agree it should be on Xbox aswell

zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,The ps4 still has better looking games than the ps5
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,"you mean, got no right to look so good and still have weird graphical glitches like kratos head going straight through the log in the beginning. (and that's the 2018 release, so they had a long time to fix small mistakes like that)

i want to like these games, GOW, Horizon and so on, but they all just seem to try and dazzle us with bling and then when you look real close, you realize 'the diamonds are fake'."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,I find that hard to believe.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,"Well, it sacrifices being beautiful on PS5, so..."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,I've been afraid to get it on PS4 because I'm scared of clunky gameplay. Is it good? Or should I wait for ps5 whenever I get one
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"I can think of a lot of positive words for this man, beautiful isn't one of them."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Is there slow down on a ps4?
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,It is a good thing in the long term bcs what kept us all the years from nice graphic are the adaptation for consols.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Why is that
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"I mean it was built specially for the ps4, and looks like it. Imagine a god of war built for and only for ps5."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"My friend lent me his old PS4 *slim* so I ended up playing a long list of games on it such as - Ghost of Tsushima, Red Dead Redemption 2, Bloodborne and even Elden Ring (bad idea) and God of War 2018. Most recently though I installed Ragnarok and inspite of all the Tiktoks and memes of the PS4 exploding it has been by far the most stunning game on the device and runs exceptionally well with close to no stutters. Crazy."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,it has no right? bru what you talking bout
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,It's beautiful no doubt. however the combat camera is trash at times.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,I thought this was a cosplay for the first few seconds of scrolling by this post
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"It's time for Loki to have his own game.  It might have to titled something else than GOW, but would be epic to see Loki become an adult and his adventures in a step away from Kratos.  It would be the perfect chance for them to get close enough to retire Kratos character.  I mean he's pretty much no longer a God of War anyways."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Why not?
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Why not? It's a PS4.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,I started hearing jet engine when I looked at this post
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Stephanie McMahon is one lucky woman
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,They finally made a game that looked the PS4 tech demos
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Why not?
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,He looks like a fat Captain Spalding.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Idk why you all are saying your PS4‚Äôs were too loud. I didn‚Äôt hear mine straining.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,What does it have a right to be?
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"It looks good on a PS4 becsue it's a PS4 game...

Would have loved to see what it could have looked like maxed out on ps5"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Too bad it's objectively a bad and shallow derivative game. A typical Sony 3rd Person Game. They have no creativity. 

I'll stick to Gamepass where objectively superior games exist."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Move over Aloy, here comes Kratos."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"That's one thing that amazes me about the ps5. In most operating conditions, it's silent. 

I could hear my PS4 screaming from across the room. 

I played GoW 2018 on my blade stealth + eGPU recently and the fans were full tilt, ready for takeoff, averaging 60fps. 

I played Ragnarok on performance mode with my ps5 less than a foot away from me on my desk and all I could hear was a faint whisper when I paused the game. 

Sony fucking nailed the thermals on the ps5."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,I was playing it a week ago on my PS4 and my wife came into the room asking why I had the hair dryer on. She heard it all way from the living room. I was to involved in the game to care how loud the fan was going.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Lol I had to use headphones
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Maybe my ps4 is different somehow but I never hear it running.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-09,"I bought the game, the first ps4 game I've bought and played in years, and stopped playing after 6 hours because of noise. I even took the damn thing apart and cleaned it but nope it still sounds like a fucking plane taking off in my living room. Sorry, guess I'll just watch a let's play..."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Bro, I thought my ps4 pro was gonna blow up a number of times."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"That's a tradition with impressive late games on ageing Playstation hardware, going at least as far back as to Shadow of the Colossus on the PS2, which made my slim model sound like an angry hairdryer."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Best way to fix that is changing the thermal paste, fixed mine before Ragnarok came out and my PS4's running like the day I bought it."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,No problems for me
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,pro really sounds like jet engine (or two) but slim is pretty quiet
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"You know what‚Äôs odd, I bought both games recently because I hadn‚Äôt played them and 2018 makes my ps4 soooo much louder than ragnarok"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Have a PS4 slim. So silent, I hear food in my stomach"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,WHAT?
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Just make sure the fan is clean to reduce noise, won't be silent but bearable"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,[deleted]
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,From this screenshot no but this isn‚Äôt really the most helpful way to show this character models have looked good for a long time it‚Äôs not like this looks much better than the characters in Red Dead
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,I'd say no. I played em back to back and they looked essentially identical to me. Like an expansion would look.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Yes. Much better graphical improvements.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"No.

Maybe a little improvement on lighting but its really dependant on each area"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,Enlightened armor gang rise up!
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"I was going to ask what that armour set is. I'm like 25 hours in and still just upgrading the survival set whenever I can, lol

Edit: apparently I have this one unlocked already and have just never used it. Might have to upgrade it and try it out"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Ingame
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"I mean, when i started booting the game, yeah it made a jet noise, but after the startup it went quiet like any normal game... I'm on Slim

Don't wanna argue with most of them so i just kept quiet about the ""PS4 blowing up"" joke"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,It's the desert
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2023-02-03,"Not really, just more sharp"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"seriously.. in game graphics reached reached its tipping point a couple years ago, i think weve gotten to the point where juice just isnt worth the squeeze anymore"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,I'm playing the previous one on PC right now and it's fantastic! My R5 3600 and RTX 3070 are cranking out ~100 fps at 1440p with everything set to ultra!
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,"30fps 1080p, the pro can either do 4k or 60fps, ps5 can do both"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,I think it's 30fps according to what's advertised. Not sure if it dips though or not. I play on PS5. Hard to ever go back to 30FPS after upgrading.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Most secure Elden Ring player.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"I think not.  As good as God of War (2018) was, this game goes above and beyond that in greatness, and that's saying something.  Even the Horizon games, as great as they are, don't top this."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Fact
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Which ones?
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,No there aren‚Äôt. There also aren‚Äôt better playing ones
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,That‚Äôs called steroid gut
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"kratos isn't fat though. despite the blocky abs, his stomach is pretty flat"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,">and xbox series s

This is dumb. Xbox serie S is already stronger than a ps4 pro. 

When studios will stop producing games on base ps4 and xbox one we will be able to talk about how the serie S is keeping the new generation behind. Until then..."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Its weird, im getting a lot of Stories of GOW:R and TLOU2  making base ps4s sound like they're gonna take off, and in a few cases breaking them. I also don't think Ragnarok is crazy good looking for a PS5 game, and is definitely the limit of what a PS4 can do. The main flex on this gen seems to be the image quality at 60fps. So far the only true next gen titles I've experienced, I'd say are Ratchet and Clank, and Demon's Souls. Give it 2 years and cross platform will be dying off."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Most games are out on PC these days, so they're being gimped by that, as they have to account to loads of people who don't have good PCs. I don't think any PC game has even required an SSD yet."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,...Raytracing is lighting.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Irrelevant.

There had been plenty of PS4 games and none seems to be this beautiful.

This game seems to be much begter on the PS4 than other PS4 titles."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,How on earth is he fat? Lol
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,That‚Äôs funny because good luck playing at 120 fps on ps4. Shit looks crisp on ps5
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Better Performance and more beautiful graphics
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,Imagine being this upset over a head clipping through a log. Hope whatever else you‚Äôre clearly going through gets better.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,"Jesse, wtf are you talking about?

If God of War have the same graphic as a Borderlands games, it is still a fun, good and well written game...never had a game breaking bug in 2018 and 2022 and i played both on release...so i don't get to have that complaint...

>the diamonds are fake'.

I just showed you an actual screen shot from the game on my ps4...the diamond is very real"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,Horizon is extremely mid.... but GOW.... really???
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,"Dude, I don‚Äôt know *what* you‚Äôre on about re: God of War: Ragnarok. The game is massive with tons to do, whole massive areas full of bosses and side quests that are completely optional, a long, very well written story, great characters, great performances, a deep and incredibly fun combat system, tons of build variety and ways to approach said combat. I won‚Äôt say that it‚Äôs perfect, because nothing is, but damn it‚Äôs damn close. You‚Äôre either being contrarian for the sake of it, or you‚Äôre not a Playstation player so you‚Äôre being negative about it for that reason and are resentful for it being an exclusive.

I mean, if you just don‚Äôt like it because it‚Äôs not your thing, that‚Äôs fine of course, but don‚Äôt try to say that it‚Äôs all nice looking graphics with nothing underneath."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,God of War Ragnarok on PS5 is probably the best looking game I've ever played...
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Gameplay works great on base ps4! Plays similar to GOW.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,It played completely fine for me. Thought my ps4 pro was gonna explode at some points though.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Depends on how much you enjoy 30 fps or whether it makes you want to gouge your eyes out.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Not at all
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"According to Digital Foundry, it's a locked 30 fps most of the time, at a fixed 1080p resolution, and only occasional drops in performance:

zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,PS5 is quiet. But to my ears Xbox Series S is even quieter.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,">That's one thing that amazes me about the ps5. In most operating conditions, it's silent.

The bluray drive meanwhile..."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Xbox series X is easily quieter than ps5. Common Microsoft Win.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-09,"I bought a fan attachment for my PS5 due to how warm my room can get, and the fan makes about four times as much noise when it's on max setting than the PS5 does when running any game on-disc. And the fan isn't actually all that loud itself; the PS5 is just ludicrously silent."

zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Lmaoooo
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,I had a PS4 pro and it barely made a sound.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,I keep hearing about this but I‚Äôve had no problems whatsoever. I play on a PS4 Slim.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Wait really? My PS4 Slim makes decent sound but it's never jet engine loud. I dunno what's happening, either I'm deaf, or extremely lucky"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,My ps4 would be loud as hell playing gtav. It was a noisy system from day 1 compared to my ps3 and Wii U lol
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Yeah iirc Playstation relies more heavily on overclocking to achieve target performance, whereas Xbox isn't quite as willing to put stress on the hardware ever since the Xbox360 red ring fiasco. 

As someone who has enjoyed consoles both sides, I think Xbox's quieter running noise shouldve been a much bigger selling point than it was."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"RDR killed my launch 60gb PS3. part of the plastic legitimately melted. 

I had to cut a hole in the top of my PS3 slim when I played TLOU to stop it overheating.

RDR2/TLOU2 pushed my launch PS4 to it's limits. 

I'm expecting rockstar to really push the PS5 when they finally launch GTA V ultra premium edition in a few years."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,I read that as angry tax payer and it still worked lmfao
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,My PS4 sounded like a rocketship from Day 1 though.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,True but the PS4 consoles are by far the worst. All the PS3 models got loud but not as loud as an Xbox 360 and while the PS5 is louder than the Series X it's whisper quiet compared to a PS4 or PS4 Pro.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,You got one of the good ones lol
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,I'm updooting you in a futile attempt to counter act the dinks with broken senses of humor.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,"He's literally a god, he can afford to wear armour like that"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Well, I mean, you're not wrong.  That has happened to him on multiple occasions. Daddy issues will cut pretty deep."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,People seemed to not realize your comment was sarcastic lol
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,He was
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Your wording is unclear, but for those wondering: it looks better than rdr2"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Yeah Ragnarok is pretty much a dlc for me. There's no next gen on it, technically. I finished it in 32 hours and haven't gotten back to it again. I enjoyed my playthrough and the game is great but it's not worth buying a new ps5 and a new tv just to play it, which I did üòÇ (same with 2018 which was very much worth it). I could have played it on PS4 Pro and my current TV and my experience would have been essentially the same."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Survival set gang brother. Never took it off, got it to level 9 and beat the entire game with it. Also never used anything but the standard handles on all of the weapons."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"I remember thinking this around 2003. Looking at titles like [Max Payne 2](https://i.imgur.com/XIeDRPt.jpg) and [Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb](https://i.imgur.com/wyaC1AE.png), I thought that games couldn't possibly look any better and that there really wasn't any point to going any further. I was wrong then just as much as you're wrong now."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Not quite, you say that but ps4 is not gonna keep up with unreal engine 5 and that‚Äôs a game changer for graphics"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"The juice you're working with is still running games at 30 fps so.... 

Perhaps it's time for some new juice."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Got a 3080 a few months back and finally have the time to put it to use and my god this game is beautiful
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"I need to get the game, but that's also not in the cards right now.  Plumbing is partially out in my house.  Thankfully I have another bathroom but it made the belt tighten pretty hard.  I will be getting it on a good sale."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,PS4 Pro doesn't do 60 fps. Its around 30 to low 50s.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,"Don't ever get a PC, I've turned into a big frame rate snob. 240 fps ruined me for life. 60fps is still great for games like gow or elden ring. Now I need to get a 1440p high refresh upgrade. 

I'm glad consoles are now supporting both high resolution output and options for 120 fps mode."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Horizon might be my personal GOTY this year, it scratched all the right itches for me"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-16,Lmao
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Ghost of Tsushima and TLOU2
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"There are both better playing and better looking games at least for me

Better looking: ghost of tsushima

Better playing: DMC5"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,the roid belly!
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"The GPU of the Series S is less powerful (4 Tflops) than the Xbox One X (6 Tflops), which was the most powerful console of the last gen. It can't possibly be more powerful than a PS4 Pro (4.2 Tflops). It's based on a newer architecture though, which allows it to make use of features that aren't possible on PS4 Pro and One X, like ray tracing, if only to a limited degree, and it has a more powerful CPU as well as fast SSD storage instead of an anemic HDD so that it doesn't hold current-gen games back. RAM is also more limited though, since there is both less of it and it's much slower than on Xbox One X.

As a side note, this lower GPU processing power compared to the One X is also the reason why backwards compatible games have none of the enhancements (resolution, frame rate) they are enjoying on Xbox One X. In that sense, the Series S is just as limited as the old Xbox One (S), with the added handicap of no disc-drive making it impossible to make use of cheap used games."

zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"lol give it 2 years, the console has been already out over 2 years,"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"IIRC console generally support previous gen until at least mid life of that generation, even that it is only reduced, not totally cut off.

Totally cutting off prior gen comes near the end of this gen."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,"And it‚Äôs incredible. Take a look at some cyberpunk 2077 screenshots with full photo mode on, it‚Äôs incredible."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Ray tracing is still kinda meh though, most of the time you can‚Äôt even tell the difference between it being on or off. It hasn‚Äôt gotten to that point just yet where is really makes a difference"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,[deleted]
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,"the best to you as well

though, i don't think upset would be the right word to describe where i'm coming from here, it's not really the tone set is it ? or am i coming through wrong with my words here ?"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,"well if a game is leaning on graphical experience, animations should follow the same ""perfection"", you can't have kratos head go through a log that he HAS to carry for the story and not expect people to lose some of the bedazzlement that was intended.

i'm not saying it's bad, i'm just saying, when you cater a specific audience, you should follow through with it or AT LEAST, fix the obvious flaws along the way.

watch the first couple of minuttes of a playthrough and you'll understand what i mean.

&#x200B;

unless you are one of those, that just wants to argue because you think we have to, just because our beliefs are different from each others."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,"it wasnt ment as the games had nothing else to offer, i was just focusing on the graphical aspects of the games."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,it‚Äôs very nice but RDR2 and Forbidden West both sweep it away
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,"And that's being hold back by the PS4, imagine if they could actually use the hardware. It's a real shame"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,30 fps is absolutely slow in 2022.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Games have sound though‚Ä¶
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,No wonder. Its about 60% weaker.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Ha!

I got rid of my disk edition and bought a digital edition. Haven't bought a game on disk since 2018. I have a friend who has complained about disk drive noise before."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-10,"It is huge.

I had dark plates on my disk PS5 before I sold it for a diskless, and it does make it blend in a lot more. 

I think I prefer the white plates though. Even if it is hidden behind my TV now."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Yeah? I don't know where people are getting their systems at but seriously I've had two PS4s and neither one has made a sound. My first unit I had to return because I couldn't make the payments but my current system I bought is used and yeah no noise at all.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Man same here, I keep reading about how loud GoW makes the ps4 get but I didn‚Äôt find it that bad at all. Red dead redemption 2 made it sound like a jet engine for me though"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Same, pretty quiet here too."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Obviously both!
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Yeah TLOU2 would remind me now and then that there is apparently an F-18 sitting next to me
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,I guess so. Runs like dream on my ps4 slim

zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"To be fair it isn't an open world sandbox like red dead so a lot of the processing power can go to rendering a lot of assets in closer proximity to the player giving you better visuals.

Red dead does still look amazing."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2023-02-03,Agree. Difference in graphics vs. 2018 GOW are not really noticeable
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"I've dabbled with a couple other sets when I didn't have the resources to upgrade the survival set, but whenever I can get it upgraded I always seem to switch back to it. 

Haven't followed that philosophy with the weapon handles though. Do the standard ones get significantly better with upgrades?"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"It's hilarious that you mention games from 2003, because here we are, almost 20 years later, still playing games from 2005, with just a few graphic upgrades. I agree it looks ""better"" on the PS5, but it looks beyond good enough on vastly less expensive, and far more available, hardware."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,We dealt with plumbing issues earlier this summer. I do not envy your position. Good luck!
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"yeah, sadly the performance mode is so unstable that I find the better graphics options at 30 fps much better"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,Ya haha I can see that. I have a gaming laptop that's super outdated now but I played that for a couple of years and went back to console. Man it literally hurt my eyes with the combination of low FPS and low refresh rate on my TV. I didn't want to invest in a brand new computer setup so I decided to just go next gen. 60fps is the minimum I play now. I don't even bother with ray tracing since it forces you to be at 30fps. Not worth it.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"I briefly had a 180Hz screen for a few weeks before it broke and returned to my more than ten year old old 60Hz display (which actually has a slightly higher resolution, 1600p instead of 1440p). Honestly, it's quite easy to go back. Took me maybe half an hour to get used to the much slower reaction times of the old screen again, a screen that was slow even at the time."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,"The trick with PC is running everything in 1080p@60fps! That way, you won't be a framerate/resolution snob!"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,mmm the buttery high frame rate
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"TLOU2 is BY FAR the greatest graphical achievement on the PS4.

GOW, GOT, Spiderman, RDR2 all look amazing, but TLOU2 looks better than amazing."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Lmao got def does not look better. And I played dmc5 on pc, not ps, but it def did not play better imo."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"I buyed a Serie S because I made my research on the machine before. It has still long years before it. 

Saying that the serie S hinder the Serie X is like saying that mid range pc stop high end pc to publish games that can work on both. 

Not really no. Game won't be as beautiful on mid range pc as a high range but most games will work on both. 

And it is especially dumber to say that the serie S stop the serie X when we still produce games on the base Xbox one, nearly two generations before."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Yeah the first 2 years nobody has been able to get one, so there's been no point in investing heavily in anything other than cross platform titles"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"So around 4-6 years in it would be reduced, so 2 years time makes sense?"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,That's more expensive
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,">watch the first couple of minuttes of a playthrough and you'll understand what i mean.

That's the difference, i played it, you watched it

>"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,RDR2 isn't even in the same ball park. GoW has the absolute best character models of any game.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Well, Im grateful they didn't leave the ps4 behind. I wouldve been terribly sad if I didn't get to play it."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,30fps was slow 10 years ago.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,PS4 is 54% weaker than Series S and it is much louder.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Look at the rich guy!
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Ah, I have a launch day PS4."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Fashion, duh, he has moved on from his naked fights, he has a family now."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"The exposed armor gives more strength/less defenses.

He has super tanky looking armor (think Warhammer) that has huge defense without any boost to strength.

You can build him to sacrifice health for more offense if that is your play style."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Red dead does look amazing. Boring af with shoddy controls, but gorgeous and vast with a solid story."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Yeah if you hover over the handle and scroll over the upgrade levels you can see where they get to. The starter armor and handles are the most well rounded in the game I think. They give you a bit of everything which is kind of my style
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,No.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Thanks, got an endoscope coming Saturday to get a idea of what the hell is going on."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Bruh it's 2022.. even with a shit video card if you are still running 1080p you have 250 frames.

Also if you're running a competitive game at 60 fps you're hamstringing yourself."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"DMC5 has the best gameplay, you probably suck at the game Nero alone has more depth than Kratos in Gow Ragnarok

And TLOU2 is another example if you say TLOU2 looks worse than GOW ragnarok then you should get your eyes checked"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,[deleted]
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Depends.

Many people foreseeing this gen may be prolong, due to both a slow start, and potential meaningful technological advance."

zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-07,">That's the difference, i played it, you watched it

no i played it, i just asked you to watch it, since i thought that would be requiring less of you, than having to boot up the game. Just being polite is all."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"RDR2 has the upper hand in literally every other aspect even though that‚Äôs still debatable

and i would still argue that TLOU2 has better character models or even death stranding"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"And jet, the Series S has not a single game that comes even close to GoWR"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Not sure how selling a console and buying a cheaper console makes me a rich guy.

Re: only buying digital games, I usually get them cheaper digitally by buying them on an Alaskan PSN account, so no digital sales tax."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Beside my big love for rdr2, and i can understand some people don't like the controls.

Still gow does feel to me as a game with limited control of the character that's probably just me. 

Just my 2 cents"

zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,How much then?
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Idk how you can say that while the PS4's version of Kratos is staring at you.

Characters from those games still have plasticy smooth faces while Kratos looks photorealistic."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Dude, stop being a fanboy. Both consoles are great."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"You don't really buy xbox because of exlcusives, you buy it because of the convience and games  


not only does it have gamepass which is neat for trying out new games, but it also plays pretty much every game from last generation and a ton of titles from xbox 360. My PS4 is great and all but its more convient to boot up my xbox and play"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,What do you mean limited control of the character?
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Like 40% is horse riding. They used the GTA model but with a 15 mph horse instead of a hundred different vehicles.

zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Exactly. XBOX is for broke boys
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Just the part that you can't crouch or vault small obstacles (I understand that's part of the level design)

The fixed camera is also a thing I'm not big fan of.

I'm just big rdr2 fan(rockstar overall before the gta online era) 

Don't mind me. Cheers"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,What though if you found out you were both?
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Buddy. It's like 550 Euros.
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Not even  


Its just a gameconsole that is better for casual gaming than playstation is in my honest opinion. I literally own a xbox one, PS4 and even a PS1."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Yeah. I guess I just don‚Äôt see crouch as really necessary or helpful in the game. And idk what small obstacles you‚Äôd vault over. But if you haven‚Äôt played it, ragnarok offers a lot more mobility than 2018 GoW did.

Rockstar is cool and all, I just feel like their games are wildly overrated and the flaws are consistently ignored. The movement and controls in them feels janky and outdated. Like, shooting sections sucked in rdr2 and only worked because of dead eye mode. Cool games, fun, but by the end of rdr2 I was so sick of janky horse rides that would randomly crash into boulders and trees.

I don‚Äôt mind the fixed camera. it works for the style."

zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,What does that even mean?
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"I haven't played  ragnarok because I'm mostly on pc  Don't feel like upgrading from  my ps4pro yet. So yeah maybe a good point. (I know it's on ps4 Aswell but rather wait )

Pre gta4 rockstar games were very different in way of character movement ect .

But because rdr2 is one if of my favorite games ever i can't agree with the rdr2 bash no offense. end of the day to each its own. But that's a good thing"
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,Google lies then?
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Ok

So its just easier and more convient for me to hookup and find something to play on my xbox than my other consoles

Not trying to say one console or the other is better im merely defending xbox."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"I see why people don't like RDR2. It's a pace thing, some people want games that're more immediate with their actions. Attention spans and all that.

RDR2 is definitely one of the best crafted games I've ever played though. Everything just goes so well together, and the attention to detail is as good as it gets last gen."
zfe6a3,2022-12-07,2022-12-08,"Personally feel RDR2 on console is a whole different experience to PC because the shitty frame rate just makes the clunkyness feel even worse.  

I couldn't play through it at all on my base PS4 but loved it on PC. I think a lot of the RDR2 critiques you see here are people who have only experienced the console version and I would absolutely agree with them on that."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,That's awesome dude enjoy! You'll probably love the Valhalla dlc if you still haven't gotten your fill.

190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Bro honestly it's just nice to see someone enjoying games like this. All of my friends and I have been slamming our faces into CS and Escape From Tarkov for like 10 years and everyone is so dead inside. I think I'm gonna break free and buy a console now and just fucking chill and enjoy gaming again finally.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,I‚Äôm still waiting for the PC port.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"I love it, currently also playing it but I wish my companions would just SHUT UP and let me figure out the puzzles sometimes. It takes a lot of the fun out I think, I dont need a step by step Atreus, I know I need to go from a different angle just give me a second."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"I just finished it recently and honestly it felt like a bit of a letdown from the previous.  The story didn't really grab me so much and it just didn't feel as fresh.  It was probably an improvement in most ways as far as graphics, gameplay, etc., but it didn't have the same wow factor or emotional draw between the characters.  The previous God of War felt like it had more of a purpose and I liked the dynamic between the characters better.  It felt like the makers really had a story they wanted to tell, this just felt like an obligatory sequel that didn't have the same passion behind it.  Still a solid 8.5/10 but the previous was a clear 10/10 in my book."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"I dunno, I'm truly loving PS5 over the last few months, I did Demons souls, then armored core 6 then ragnarok, such sick games"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Should I play the first one first?
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,I just got my OLED TV at the beginning of Dec and booted up the Valhalla DLC. Mind Explosion.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,">‚ÄùRagnarok is just that game but better in every aspect‚Äù

IMO it‚Äôs the opposite, 2018 is much better than Ragnarok."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,I have trouble not seeing past the fact that the previous game had more punching moves available. There used to be a stance change that expanded the punch combo - one would think like every other part of the combat in Ragnarok we would see an improvement to the formula - instead it got cut down to one combo and my day is ruined just remembering that.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,[deleted]
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Easily the best game I've played the past few years
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"I thought Ragnarok was worse than 2018 in pretty much every meaningful metric. It had a ton of filler, more than a few characters I cared nothing for. Gameplay was mostly the same which is ok? Worst part was the NPCs constantly telling me what to do, where to go, how to solve a puzzle."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"The pacing of this game was a nosedive from its predecessor. In 2018, the single-take thing felt more novel and effective. Here, it just felt like a gimmick and chore."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"I loved GoW 2018 and felt invested in Kratos‚Äôs story, but I came away from Ragnarok pretty disappointed despite it being a solid game. I found the gameplay to be more of the same, and not in a good way, and I largely didn‚Äôt care for the story  and what it leads up to was disappointing (but what the game ends on was really fantastic). I feel like Ragnarok is the same as Horizon: Forbidden West and even Spider-Man 2 (which I like better than either) in that it‚Äôs a great game but as a sequel it‚Äôs weirdly underwhelming. I‚Äôm hoping the same thing doesn‚Äôt afflict Ghost of Tsushima 2"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Solely for just how many amazing classic solo story based campaigns they have....a PS5 (or ps4 pro) is a must

2 x God of war
2 x last of us
2 x horizon
4 x Uncharted 
2.5 x Spiderman
Ghost of tsushima
Detroit become human 

Man the list of games that get you emotionally attached just keeps going"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Just finished the Valhalla DLC. Perfect ending it. Santa Monica studio is just awesome. Can‚Äôt wait what comes next. I personally hope Egypt
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Im getting flashbacks to everyone sucking this game off at release and being branded a hater for saying anything critical about it from people who were in the honeymoon period
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,I think so too. Loved every bit of it.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,I just finished it and i never wanted a game to end more than this one (ok maybe FEAR3 but that's another category of bad). The whole thing is generic copy paste of the same stuff troughout the whole game. Puzzles don't exist and when they do the NPC's give you the solution within 5 seconds after you start looking around. Boring generic fights every few steps. Every area feels the same just a different skin on each one. I seriously can't fathom how anyone can give this game a 10/10 unless it's the first game they ever played and don't know about anything else.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Glad you‚Äôre enjoying it. For me, it was too similar to the first one to be a true 10/10 game though. Kind of felt like an extended DLC."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"In my opinion the game is too slow with too many cut scenes and a boring story, gow 2018 was much better because of the way it felt despite Ragnarok being a big tehnical improvement in all aspects"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,I really need to get around to playing this game. I loved GOW 2018.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,The story was a huge let down for me.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Ah I see you're probably not at the three hour walking simulator part yet.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"I'm playing now, the last one I played was the first god of war on ps2. I'm surprised how linear it is, you are almost completely on a rail, and the puzzles are so simple they take almost zero thought. Also if you don't figure them out in .5 seconds you are bombarded with hints. There are also like 80 in-game currencies that only work for a narrow band of upgrades so you get barely any choice in what you are upgrading. The number of enemies is about 2 to 5 at a time so you are almost always fighting single enemies. It's fun, but you really don't feel like a bad ass god. I feel like I'm just watching a movie."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,I love how the developers listened to players when they complained there wasnt enough enemy variety and then proceeded to craft dozens of unique monsters for Ragnarok.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"More walking and talking. I have to finish it yet, turn a hiatus after all the walking and talking started getting to me."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Purely in terms of interacting with and looking at it, Ragnarok whips ass. I felt it was both a little bloated in terms of mechanics and story, while on the latter front also powering through a number of ideas that could‚Äôve used more room to breath (or been tastefully edited out) so I was, relatively speaking, not as blown away by it as 2018.

But importantly that feeling mostly developed in hindsight, because again, in the moment the game as you say demonstrates a clear mastery of its vision.

Other than some of the puzzles, which can be one new mechanic too many."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Completed it and feels like a walking simulator to me. Glad you enjoyed it though.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Ill be the guy


I love hard games i am speedrunning souls got 1000's of hours into thwm and play everything on hard to very hard


But i fucking hate the overloaded combat of ragnarok

I am fighting the controller more than the actual enemies"

190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"If you're a fan of older GoW games, wait until you get to Valhalla DLC"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Did you like the bit where Kratos eats J√∂rmungandr to gain his strength?
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,I uninstalled this game when it required Kratos to use a rope in order to descend a very short height. The killer of gods is unable to jump from there but had to use the rope.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,It‚Äôs a fun game.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-02-20,"Perd√≠ la empu√±adura de forsbrandr y solo esa me hace falta para platinar el juego, que hagoooo?"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,I concur with you mate. I‚Äôve been in love with this series from the beginning and Ragnarok just brilliant! Keep having fun! I hope you are playing it in god mode ;)
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,I couldn‚Äôt play any other games for like a week after I beat it because it was such an amazing gaming experience. They really nailed every aspect of what I look for in a single player experience. And when you‚Äôre done you get a free DLC that‚Äôs pretty damn fun too!
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Lovely game I‚Äôm sure the graphics are off the charts but can I bypass the puzzles and thinking parts of the game. Just wanna play lol
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Then your standard is too low
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,I couldn't get in to it. The little kid character whines too much and I don't care about his problems or motivations.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,The combat is no where near as good as the first game. Real smart of you to judge a game before you even finish it.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"And there's me getting bored of that franchise because of too many cinematic and assisted gameplay. Give me the game story into a tv show and I'll binge it but as game, I'll skip. I want to play a game, not watch something. Too boring as video game and sorry, but Kratos kinda lost his badassness in those 2 recent GoW"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"I bought the game a month ago, but had to finish 2018 before going into it. I already spoiled myself with the Valhalla DLC lol.

I played every entry besides the mobile game and Ascension. I loved seeing Kratos going from a vengeful little shit to a Dad of Boy."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"It's one of the best games of all time. If not, the best game of all time (for me)."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Graphics/Performance 10/10  
Art Direction 10/10  
Music 10/10  
Voice Acting & Sound Design 10/10  
Story 9/10  
Gameplay 8/10

Absolute masterpiece and could easily have beaten Elden Ring for GOTY in 2022 except that it's a PS5 exclusive so not as many people played it."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Good for you. I could never get into GoW 2018, it‚Äôs way too repetitive."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Blew my mind on my PS4Pro because of how awful and soap opera like the writing was. Also whenever action gets going mid-game it‚Äôs stonewalled with that awful exposition.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,I'll never understand when people think any game today is video realistic. We are so far from not having to suspend disbelief its crazy. I can only assume their thoughts are relative to an atari game or some other old ass platform. This game isn't even unreal 5..... awesome game but come on.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"I liked it much better than the first one too, although both are top notch but I prefer Ragnarok due to amazing boss fights, better set pieces and story."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"I just got it on Boxing Day sale and it is indeed even better then the last one, between the visuals the story and the gameplay it‚Äôs just top notch"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"if GoW Ragnarok doesn't blow your mind, you have the wrong opinion."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,I couldn‚Äôt finish it. It‚Äôs too much. You have three different weapons with all different move sets and two main characters each with a different companion and they all have different moves. I felt like I was THAT GUY playing Eddie in Tekken 2 and just rolling my face on the controller because I couldn‚Äôt remember all the weird little moves.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,yeah it‚Äôs decent
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Ragnarok was the first game I played coming from the ps4 to the ps5, and it truly blew my mind as well. So silky smooth gameplay without any bugs or glitches. And the detail like in Kratos‚Äô beard was so good as well. I loved that experience so much"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"I agree! 10/10 for gameplay, frame rate and smoothness, story, graphics, and art style."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Only thing is Kratos is now a little bitch
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,I feel like they just nailed the writing in the game. Characters were just excellent. The fact that I finished the game is a testament to how good it is as I rarely finish games anymore.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,It definitely blows!!
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Give Horizon Zero Dawn and Forbidden West a try when you‚Äôre done.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Yeah it's rad
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,It looks amazing and if you have a TV with VRR it runs uncaped at over 80 fps.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,2 is hole game
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,As a huge GoW fan I agree. Ragnarok is an amazing game. I do think 2018 was slightly better though.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"the game came with my ps5 but i still haven't tried it yet

there's so many things to play lmao"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Glad you're enjoying it. Hoping it gets ported over to PC in a couple of years myself. Really enjoyed the previous one.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Loved the game. One of my favs. But I regret selling it and deleting its save data to free up my ps5 space.

Now they released Valhalla and I gotta buy it again smh."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,\*Cries in PC\*
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,I liked it except the ending. The build up was so high and it ended in a big low in terms of story / satisfaction for me.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Just a tip, if you're planning to platinum it make sure to at least get the trophy for collecting/crafting  relics/hilts, there's a bug in ng+ that prevents you from crafting relics. I had to go back to my old save after finishing ng+ just so I can craft what I didn't for the platinum."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Just wait to play Valhalla then...
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"I found the story and writing stronger in the first game by a mile but everything else is incredible and an improvement in Ragnarok. One of the very few first party games  where using the performance mode doesn‚Äôt feel like a compromise in fidelity. This game is running black magic under the hood or something, it‚Äôs incredible"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Wait till u get to the atreus missions
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,On a proper display it's easily the best looking game there is.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"I just completed it last night, amazing game with a great story but had a few things really pissing me off on it. I had to lower the difficulty all the way down (skill problem I'm getting old now) the camera and movement of enemies was really winding me up lol."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Yeah this is up there for me, minor quibbles aside still a top notch h linear experience."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Unpopular opinion, but I couldn't even finish god of war base version, let alone Ragnarok. I felt like the old games were better for my style. I liked the arcade nature of the fighting. This new one felt more generic."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,I liked the story of the last one a tad bit better but the combat and flow of Ragnarok is superior IMO.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,I got shut down by the axe throwing puzzles which really disappointed me.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,I feel the same way about Spiderman 2. So good!
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,was going to wait for pc port but maybe picking up a ps5 will be worth it
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Santa Monica is just so good! Released really good games, without gamebreaking bugs AND a free story DLC which has a high replay value, awsome story and is free"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,lowkey makes me want to buy a ps5
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,My only complaint is about halfway through I had to drop the level down as I was spending hours getting killed over and over. The difficulty is just insane to me on balanced. Some battles I need about 100 well timed hits to kill them while it takes one shot from them to kill me.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,yeah i kinda regret getting the spiderman 2 console bundle instead of GOW. Spidermans ok but its a kids game really.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Wait till you play Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,I would be very surprised if it blew your mind on another platform.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,It‚Äôs a decent movie
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,You reminded me its about time to do another play through
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,the most recent ratchet and clank looks amazing as well
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"the mechanics of the game and the general story have been good so far, but what I hate about this one compared to the last is the lack of all the little lore stories that were told while you were just running around exploring or on the boat paddling around."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,I love where they took this game. 10/10
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-08,"Definitely, to be honest I haven‚Äôt really been able to enjoy games for a long time and it sucks, knowing how I enjoyed them in the past. God of War & God of War Ragnar√∂k just reignited that feeling of gaming I had when I was much younger. It‚Äôs a beautiful story, gameplay and all the mechanics feel realistic and finished. It‚Äôs the full package. Even after beating the story, it has so much more to offer with side quests that actually have some lore and story to them and are not just filler fights or walking events made to make the game feel fuller. With all of that they just drop a Valhalla DLC for free, absolutely incredible game."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-08,It's ok for half of the game
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-08,You're going to love the Secrets of the Sands part of the game. I've never stopped playing a game so much to just stop and look.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-08,"I just got into the game as well for Christmas.  I beat it pretty fast but there's a ton of fun to be had, even in the dlc. The visuals alone are great and the final parts of the game were both full of hype and satisfaction.  Its definitely not for everyone, but I enjoyed it a lot."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-09,"It's really just more of the first game, hardly an improvement at all. Not that that is a bad thing"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-09,Ok
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Valhalla DLC was so good. It's awesome it was free. I would've paid money for it.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Seriously, Valhalla feels like a free separate game. It blew my expectations away. And it was FREE!!!"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Goddamn, I never heard about this free dlc somehow. My mind is kinda blown that they added even more to this monster of a game. How did you like it?"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"F%#& 

What happened to the first year spoiler warning"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Spoiler the second: He does so very brutally.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,üòñ
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Indeed
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"PCs I think will always be a necessity, fps games are great. But consoles just have that calmness. They do give a different experience for whatever reason

Get a couch, great lighting around your TV & a console. It's worth it"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"I did this last year. Been gaming by myself playing fun single player games. The fps games were getting too sweaty for me. I'm the worst of my friends at these games, I had no desire to get better either, but loved playing with friends."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,And then another 4 to 6 months to patch out all the problems with the port.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,I do prefer to figure it out myself but it is a pretty minor compaint
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,There is a option in the settings for this exact thing
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,">I wish my companions would just SHUT UP and let me figure out the puzzles sometimes

This is why I dropped those game after 1-2 hour of play. It's annoying and a break the whole concept of video game. Those game are all about great visual and play like a movie. Let player be player."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,agreed one hundred percent. loved 90% of the game. last act of the story felt very rushed and unsatisfying with weak af boss fights. replayed the last one a couple of times. dread replaying this one cuz of that one whole bit with angrbodas grandma
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Agree completely, I think the pacing of Ragnarok was all over the place, and it just felt like too much content for the sake of content at times. A good chunk of the pre-Atreus going to Asgard content, like the Ironwood, could honestly be cut and the narrative would benefit from it in my opinion."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Totally agree to you. The moment in the first one, when you get your blades of chaos back, was awesome üòç sadly never had a moment like this for example in the second game"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,100% this! The tone/atmosphere is so different in Ragnarok. It feels like a Marvel Movie. Its a good game but the first one was better imo. I really DID NOT like the handholding in Ragnarok. Companions constantly telling you how to do a puzzle or where to go. Very annoying.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Fights with gods were really a let down tbh, I expected them to be much more difficult and epic... And here we go, 2 strangers with axes give me more challenge than entire Heimdall fight lol"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"I agree that 2018 is the superior game and had a stronger vision behind it.

However I think it‚Äôs unfair to say that ragnarok is just a paint by the numbers sequel. There are lots of compelling and memorable moments, and you can see that the drive to tell the rest of the story was there from the start. It just suffers from the fact that the story doesn‚Äôt stand on his own without 2018, and the pacing is off at times."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"That's a shame to hear cause its the opposite for me. I can't seem to put it down because I'm so invested in what happens next. Every clue, new reveal that i find out gets me excited and engaged. It's been a long time since a game actually made me feel this way."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Played the first and second games back to back and the 2nd is worse somehow. The differences are subtle but a lot of the changes were for the worse in my opinion.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Yeah even though the gameplay was better than 2018 game the storyline just didn‚Äôt do it for me. Definitely has replay value though
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"The story was truly awful this time around, the writing was very poor, the dramatic scenes felt like something out of the worst Marvel movies."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"It was the main plot for me. I don't want to spoil anything but there's a certain part of the story they build up as being a clash of epic proportions and it ends up kind of ""womp-womp"". Felt rushed/like they cut a corner somewhere."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"I didn't even finish Ragnarok. It is so far from the god of war series. Kratos is just soft. It is just too mopey and it is trying so hard on the story. Anywhere you go, the stupid head tells you that that is the wrong way or something. You can't explore or shoot an arrow without someone telling you it's the wrong direction or you're using the wrong arrow etc. I loved God of war. All of it from the beginning. But the last one was just bad. It's sad to see. But hey ho....it is what it is. Where is the angry, mean kratos who wants to kill all the gods? Not in Ragnarok and that is for sure..."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"It's great but the pacing is all over the place, some parts are just so boring (we didn't need an hour or 2 of Atreus picking fruit come on).

The story is also whatever."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"My only grip is that we deserved at least one more encounter with Thor before the endgame and the end itself was very short... Valhalla came to complete that so... 

Maybe before 2025 ends we will have a new game."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Should I grab a PS5? All I've been doing is playing online competitive games and I think it's maybe time for a console.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Ghost of Tsushima dude
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Armored core 6 goes insanely hard
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Treated myself to a ps5 digital after a long ‚Äò23. Feels like such an upgrade in a way. Ageing gaming PC, Xbox line up was kinda weak so sold it, and game pass isn‚Äôt as big a value proposition to me as others with families for example. Solid machine. Been playing CP2077 2.1 and have been absolutely absorbed into it."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Try Returnal! Also out for PC.

I will always evangelize Returnal. Such a great, slept-on game."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Yes
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,The first one is better so yes
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,[removed]
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"If you haven't gotten far enough into the game, there's a good reason for that"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"But it didn't. It entirely changed the combat, outright removed fantastic combat options from 2018 writing took a nosedive, and the pacing is awful compared to the first game."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"That's a shame.. I'm playing through God of War 2018 for the first time, on PC and I'm finding it a chore to get through in alot of ways. I just finished Elden Ring then Tears of the Kingdom so I got used to that level of freedom in an open world.. GoW 2018 feels really linear and the combat just feels dull and not engaging and the puzzles are basic. I'm enjoying the environment art, graphics and production value more than the design."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Filler? Are you kidding? They had to cut stuff out to release on time.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Funnily enough I loved all 3 games you mentioned there more than the original. GoW is probably the closest because I love the new gameplay mechanics but prefer the original story. Although Ragnarok is actually the only game I‚Äôve ever 100% and platinumed on my PS5
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"I'll say it: angrboda was a huge negative point. 

I loved the giant boss but the rest? Everything angrboda was ugggh


I loved getting to know Odin's family though, especially his granddaughter."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"It has its issues but most of the criticisms I'm seeing here are ""X thing I don't like means it's a trash game"". The gameis good. Majority shows, but anyone reasonable recognizes its faults as well"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Well I'm not exactly a hardcore gamer like alot of other ppl. But the best single player games ive played (personally) are Red Dead 2, Ghost of Tsushima and Fallout: New Vegas. Ragnarok has brought the same feelings i had playing those games. Ive enjoyed it an immense amount. Its easily in my top bundle of games EVER, and again thats my personal preference. Its all subjective bro"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,What's wrong you don't want to spend 45 minutes complimenting a random girl on her paintings?
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Kojima cutscenes would be better than this shite.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"It's not for everyone. I read a review a while back calling GoW and TLoU 1 ""Dad simulators"" which made me chuckle.

Both games are great but that critique was on point."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Idk, I feel the reverse. I could never get into souls games because the controls were so braindead simple"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,People are saying that? Why? Didnt the GTA 6 trailer break a record for views or something? Gaming isnt dead
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Who is saying gaming is dead?
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Gaming is one of the biggest industries in the world. No one is saying it's dead, in fact it's just getting bigger and stronger every year. 

Some of these games made today are bigger than most movies put out."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,I haven't heard anyone say that since 2022
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Man, now I want to buy Ragnarok."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,That seems like a really weird and nitpicky take tbh
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"I mentioned in another comment that I just finished playing through Elden Ring and Tears of the Kingdom, and now playing GoW 2018, and yikes, I feel this. I realize now I took the freedom of movement in those games for granted.. so funny that Kratos can't jump down a small ledge (or even fall off one)."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,I'd suggest to skip the main game and just play valhalla. It's atleast actually fun.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,After finishing it I started it again on give me god of war. Only have gna left to beat.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"You‚Äôre in luck because four-seconds after a puzzle starts, Mimir chimes in with the solution."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,No. But the puzzles are easier than they were in 2018 (so far)
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,I mean that is playing... it's part of he game
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,I feel like yours might be too high
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Always that one user. Yikes.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Did he? I feel like it's just a different sort. Old Kratos was edgelord Supreme wreaking at every opportunity and upset if he hadn't murdered something in 5 seconds.

Older Kratos is worn down and outgrown those old ways but no less of a beast. This one doesn't need to yell to be heard and has wisdom to impart. Honestly the story of these two entries trumps the original trilogy quite handily"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Honestly it might surpass Red Dead 2 for me by the end
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"I‚Äôm sure almost every critic played both, which is like 90% of the vote."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"nah elden ring was perfection. I get frustrated by being a literal god who can't go passed some rocks or rope and has to do this really obtuse climbing and problem solving. like in some scenarios and cut scenes he can jump like mountains but others he cant make it 10 feet?

that alone makes it not as good."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Elden Ring deserves game of the decade, no game would've stood a chance against elden ring as GOTY."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"I miss the old games. Those were my jam. Huge boss fights, loads of different types of enemies. Not these games. 3 different enemy types, all with different colors. Both of these games are guilty of this.
I beat them both, but the last one wasn't as good as the first. Felt fairly hollow comparatively."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,skill issue
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Shut up
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"I don't get this take. New Kratos is way more mature than old one and doesn't need to yell to be heard. The growth from shitty absent father at the beginning of 2018 to genuinely heartfelt moments in ragnarok feels organic and hits hard. 

Heck, 2018 was already a good father son story, after mine was born in 2019 I played it again and it just hits harder"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"wooow , how so?"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,GoW is the only reason I bought a PS5
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,ng+ increases difficulty so i just did it on balance without ng+
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"the old ones gameplay haven't aged particularly well.. in terms of cinematic scope and the whole game feeling like a huge, grand adventure (missing from the modern games for the most part), totally.. but the button mashey combat isn't as fun anymore.. there's very little feedback in what you're doing and the blades of chaos just don't have a ton of impact. Plus all the button mashing to open doors and chests. It's definitely an amazing game though and product of its time"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,I beat it on the second to hardest setting and for me the most annoying thing was the narrow FOV during combat. All you're doing is watching for purple indicators that are telling you you're about to get hit by a projectile that will one shot you. Just pull the camera out and let me see what's going on for fucks sake.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,I loved it then hated it (repeatedly getting my butt kicked on the final fight and then having to work my way back there) but it started to click and I loved it again and the satisfaction and feeling of finally beating it was amazing.  Very cool that it was free.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,The dlc was annoying af imo.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Wait what! I got ragnarok ps5 bundle in March and didn't even know there was a dlc. Guess I know what I'm gonna go do lol
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Sucker punch did the same got ghost of Tsushima, that legends mode was so good an free"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Having binge watched all of SG1 just before playing God of War, it took me a while to not hear Teal'c every time."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"This is the only way I game now. Had a good PC for a while in my 20's and very early 30's, but now all my professional life is on a computer and I mentally need SOMETHING different during my gaming time.

I'm a couch and console gamer until I retire, I wager."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,">Get a couch, great lighting around your TV & a console. It's worth it

They could do the same with their PC. Just connect it through HDMI and it will the exact same thing than a console. We're not in the 90's anymore and console/Pc are pretty much the same thing and offer the same kind of game and accessories.."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-08,"I agree. Used to have to defend this position and somehow try to explain that consoles just ‚Äúfeel‚Äù different, even when you use a controller on a PC it does not feel the same as a console experience. There‚Äôs just something to it‚Ä¶"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,No it very much was a big reason I quit the game. It is insufferable having them constantly treat Kratos and the player like they're too stupid to solve a puzzle withing 5sec of me entering a room. Just give me a fuckin second to look around.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"No, there isn't.

190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Really? I looked for it and didn't find it
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"GOD OF WAR 2018: Great story and buildup

Ragnarok: Generic MCU story and ending, shat all over the 2018 buildup.

&#x200B;

The game should've had a different story with more gods to fight and a follow up using the same engine and assets where you deal with Odin like how GOW 1-3 went. Ragnarok felt really rushed and only the starting hour and a couple of moments felt as good as 2018. Still a solid game tho otherwise and Valhalla is pretty great.."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Writing is just ass. All the dialogue is worse in Ragnarok. From constant quipping to constantly treating Kratos like he has amnesia. 

I dunno how Ragnarok is so praised tbh. I thought just about every aspect was worse. Especially the combat goin from Doom2016 ""kill em all!"" to ""ah ah ah, Simon Says"" combat of Doom Eternal. Removed the hand to hand and shield combat? Fuck outta here. Everything staggers THE GOD OF WAR, everything ""skates"" around, and every enemy has a ranged option. It's fucked on harder difficulties. 

I could go on and on but I'm genuinely shocked at the praise it got after the 2018 game. It waa day and night to me even just an hour in."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"In addition to the hints, I just generally got annoyed at always having someone with me. Kratos and Boy are fine but a lot of the beginning is Atreus hanging out with a girl and kratos escorting Freya BORING"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"while 2018 has the better story id still argue that ragnarok has better gameplay, 2 weapons from the start >!and the spear halfway through!< the different rages, shields, and not every boss being a fucking troll and more then 3 enemy types really makes the gameplay part refreshing."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"I‚Äôm an adhd gamer that has issues finishing games, Ragnarok is the first game I had played in a long time that kept me playing all the way until the end. Such a good game. I wish I could forget it and start all over."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"I‚Äôm in complete agreement with you - ragnarok was one of the few games that I‚Äôve wanted to continue playing even after the end credits and ended up near 100% everything.  

I found the game‚Äôs story so much more engaging and fleshed out and the combat and enemies so much better than the previous GOW. It felt like that game laid the groundwork for this game to shine"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"100%. Play God of War (+ Ragnarok), Uncharted 1-4, The Last of Us, and Ghost of Tsushima."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,I'm a huge PS5 fanboy but honestly the single player exclusives are the reason to own one... I think XBOX does online better but I don't own an xbox or do online competitive (I despise it for killing off good games for this fucking micro transaction FOMO bullshit.)
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"I own all 3 plus PC, and if I were recommending a console to a new player, I'd probably recommend PS5. If budget were more of a concern, I might point towards Xbox and gamepass, but while I enjoy all 3 consoles, the consistent quality across PS5 wins the day."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Only if you like singleplayer 3rd person games.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Play ps4 exclusive titles that came out on pc. If you love them and can‚Äôt wait to play the sequels then you might want a ps5
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"It‚Äôs funny that the only game you mention is multiplatform, lol"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"The story is better... But the sequel beats it in every other aspect. Gameplay/control, graphics, side quests, varied locations, villians, etc"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,You a elden ring defender bot?
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,What fantastic options did it remove other than making elemental weaknesses way less important than individual build options and making runic attacks way less oppressively OP
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"This one has a different game director, and if I remember, Kratos' voice actor had some health issues, who knows what else went on, but the fact that the game went through development hell and had to have content cut because of too many cooks in the kitchen doesn't mean there wasn't filler content. Those scenes with Atreus and the Giantess were so painful. I was mostly disappointed as well by visiting all the other realms.. none of them had much wow factor."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,but toxic masculinity bro. the gaming landscape has changed bro.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,We went from Kratos brutally annihilating gods and being a savage to 2 kids picking fruit for 45 minutes
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"I didn‚Äôt make that connection on TLOU 1 since it had a bit of action. TLOU 2 was too walky talky for me as well at some points but I did get through it. Dad simulators makes me laugh though, I can see it."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Yeah I don‚Äôt really think anyone is saying that idk what that comment is talking about.  Anyone claiming everything is ‚Äúcopy paste or shovelware‚Äù is clearly not at all tapped into the gaming scene.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,People!
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Sad nerds on the internet.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Old guys that get mad at people buying skins
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,People don't really say it's dead but I see so many saying modern games suck. I think a lot of gamers let nostalgia hit too hard
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-13,"Oh yeah , Thanks for tip."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-13,Dig it!! Ur right
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Oh I thought it was 100% fan-voted
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"This is a really odd point to argue, this kind of thing is present in pretty much any RPG.

In Elden Ring you can take down an eldritch god with a stick and swing a boulder around with one hand but God forbid you come up against a locked wooden door...

They're gameplay elements that provide a break from endless hack and slash combat and drive the exploration elements.

If you want exploration, you need barriers and obstacles. Unless you want everything justified as 'you can't pass here because magic' then you've got to lean on the old suspension of disbelief.

Start adding in Kratos cutscene capabilities to GoW and you'd just end up with a poor Arkham Knight or Spider-man clone."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Elden Ring is seriously held back on a technical level by the Dantelion Engine.

This engine looks and runs like shit, it's really obvious when you compare it to the Demon's Souls remake which was made using Bluepoint's Engine.

But yeah if all you care about is gameplay and art direction, Elden Ring is the best of both."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Yep, it‚Äôs definitely that and not the recycled enemies and mini bosses."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Did you play the game? He gets verbally slapped around by his own son
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,for the platinum
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,You can play ng+ on the easiest difficulty.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Sounds like a roguelike to me!
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Weird, I think the boss was the easiest part of the DLC, very generous with the health drops."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"The final boss never seemed particularly difficult, but the game can screw right off with how often the bonus fight in the second area is King Hrolf."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Stack relic refresh glyphs and get the invincible barrier relic and you can give him a taste of his own medicine. 

Almost Infinite invincibility makes for a funny fight."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Do you mean the regular final boss before the credits? Weirdly I thought it was pretty chill and did him first try every time without any problems.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,That's almost exactly my experience lolol
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-08,"The unlock at the end is great.  Nothing game changing, but it's pretty cool."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Idk why man it just works with consoles for whatever reason.

I think it's the experience of optimization in general with PC games. Most ports today are trash. Unless you have some rich tech the experience just doesn't feel as smooth"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,think its under accessibility.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,They both use the same engine and assets‚Ä¶.?
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"literally just cleared ng+ give me god of war this past weekend, if you have a decent build you'll do just fine, but with it being GMGOW and ng+ it will punish you if you bring in random shit.

&#x200B;

Gna can eat a bag of dicks on ng+ GMGOW though."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Every new Sony game has some aspect of the NPC tagalong now if you've noticed.  I'm guessing it's a directive from higher ups to ""increase engagement"" or whatever other bullshit buzz word executives are jerking themselves off over. They look at how successful and beloved TLOU is and want to replicate it in every game."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Days Gone too, if there‚Äôs room for all 4 Uncharted games in there!"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Don‚Äôt forget TLoU2 or Death Stranding.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,I believe both PS and Xbox do online the same way. There's no difference at all.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"i also second this opinion, compared to my other consoles and pc, i am getting more enjoyment out of my ps5, but mostly because of the exclusive games are absolutely top tier"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"I do own all of it (except xbox but who need xbox when we have PC) and I'll recommend the Switch as video game console. Ps5 top game (TLOU, GOW, HZD, etc) can barely be called games. They are mostly interactive movie with their assisted help and their constant interruption with cinematic or useless dialogue. Want to play game? It's PC or Switch the best option You want great visual graphics? then Ps5 could be a choice"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Yeah I was thinking about getting a switch and playing Mario and Zelda etc. cause I love those. What are your favorite PS5 games? And how come the switch isn‚Äôt one you‚Äôd necessarily recommend?
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Not funny, just what I‚Äôve been playing"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,Oh wow that would actually explain the comment.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Entirely removing hand to hand and shield as valid combat options, similar to Doom Eternal overhauling melee. Along with a shockingly low amount of alternative finishers. Like in 2018 where you could use melee hand to hand to build up the stagger meter or whatever faster for a finisher. With various finishers depending on the weapon you use. The combat was completley overhauled in Ragnarok and it's weird a lot of people didn't really notice lol."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"It plays amazing, I have a lower mid range pc, I am easily able to run it at 1080p 60fps on medium settings."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Lame complaint, given how extraordinarily good the rest of the game is"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"no i didnt , why you think I asked?"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,ik but then its kinda... too easy i guess?

190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,You mean 2018 and Ragnarok? They do a lot. But I meant a third game with the more or less just the same to expand the main quest line.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Same with movies and other media. 

They‚Äôd have better success sticking to the formula for longtime fans but who knows"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"I think the same too, it's not the 360/PS3 era anymore."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"You might already know this but most of PlayStation‚Äôs best games are also available on PC, so if you were already considering a Switch, I‚Äôd go the Nintendo route. It‚Äôs also worth noting that the Switch‚Äôs successor will likely be released this year."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Algorithm-kun saw God of War praise, thought it was the 2022 game awards season and swooped in playing defense for Elden Ring."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-09,It would not
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Except you still have that stun focused stance in the third weapon, it's just not unarmed anymore.  2018 was co.pletely reliant on runic attacks or stun blitzing. There's so many more viable options now, but still runic or stun builds for those that want them.

Almost every enemy has 1 or 2 finishers for each weapon atill"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Yeah, except when a major part of the game is fighting said enemies, LOL."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"I said that because you said ng+ increases difficulty, which is not true."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Yeah okay, that‚Äôs the problem then. I always got 20-40k echoes there and spent it for everything possible"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,I meant he was obviously missing something. That was definitely not a hard part of the game
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,I have heard that I am guessing if I wait for the new switch that I can play all of the original switch games on the new console? Does a switch look good on a 4k OLED TV?
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-09,That DOES make sense!
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Again, hardly an issue"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"yeah sorry, it increases difficulty on goW 2018, not on ragnarok. im an idiot"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"The next console will likely be backwards compatible, but there‚Äôs no official announcement yet so it‚Äôs not exactly a guarantee. 

It won‚Äôt look bad, but you definitely won‚Äôt be taking advantage of it since the Switch tops out at 1080P docked and the internal resolution of most games is typically lower than that."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"yea, you‚Äôre delusional at this point. TLOU and Uncharted better lol"
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,No biggy.
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"TLOU and Uncharted are great. 

GOW 2018 is a phenomenal game with the one flaw that it suffers from limited variety in enemy design and you couldn't play it? That seems delusional to me, but it's your opinion, albeit a strange one."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Your complaint about GoW is lack of enemy diversity and  TLoU and Uncharted are your choice to compare against?

There's less than 10 enemy types in either of those two across their whole series; hell, Uncharted has ""Guy with gun"", ""Guy with automatic gun"" and ""Guy with rocket launcher"" and that's about it.

Don't get me wrong, they're both fantastic games but when your complaint with a game is repetitive enemies, comparing it to those two is quite something."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Yeah, it‚Äôs a pretty big flaw if you ask me. Also garbage side quests and a lot of backtracking."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Your lack of understanding game design is astounding.

Uncharted and The Last Of Us features combat encounters that are different from one another. Uncharted has these big, sprawling fights with different map designs, varied gameplay, crazy ass set pieces and cover placements, which force you to adapt. The Last Of Us, in the same nature, also has different approaches to level design, from cover shooting to hide and seek to all out kiting enemies while utilizing every thing in your armory. These games make it a point to always expose the player to varied combat encounters, even with the enemies technically being the same.

God of War however has NO variety in enemy type or environments. You‚Äôre always going into a zone and fighting the same enemies in a big circle for 20+
hours. There is no strategy or randomness, just stand there and hack and slash until every thing dies on screen on repeat. The story isn‚Äôt as good as TLOU, the set pieces aren‚Äôt as good as Uncharted. It‚Äôs a solid game that is brought down by its horrid repetitiveness, which critics agree is the game‚Äôs Achilles Heel."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Yeah, the 94 metascore says otherwise. Sounds like you were just bad at the game and need a place to lash out."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"Wow, you either really like to exaggerate or you never played more than maybe an hour of GoW?

In your second paragraph you state no variety yet you can Google the enemy lists and see the good 20 or so different enemy types split down to 7 or so sub groups. 

I'm not even arguing that it has a wide variety just that it most certainly has more variety than TLoU and Uncharted. 

Remember your original argument was that there's no variety in enemies.

Since it's pretty clear that's not the case you also shifted the goal posts in the first paragraph from enemy variety to environment and encounter design. 

You're comparing apples to oranges here though since in both TLoU and Uncharted you have stealth as an option most of the time. This isn't a possibility in GoW and would be weird if it was considering the nature of the game and it's story.

GoW does have very simple combat arenas but they're not just flat spaces. There's often an element or two of traversal but it's limited because when melee is your primary mode of combat you don't want to spend all of your time running up and down annoying obstacles to chase down enemies.

As far as strategy goes in fights, stick GoW on an actually challenging difficulty and try playing it then. If you're just hack and slashing and everything is dying you've got to be on story or casual difficulty.

You say I've got a lack of understanding of game design which I find hilarious. I think you've just got a hate boner for GoW and it pisses you off when people actually like it.

Is it a flawless game? No but no game is. Do those flaws make it unplayable trash as you seem to think? Not at all, hence the astounding success it had."
190gnsy,2024-01-07,2024-01-07,"You can‚Äôt be bad at God of War, it‚Äôs made for children lmao. I did not die once in my playthrough. I also can name 10 better games than this garbage."

ypzs2j,2022-11-08,2022-11-10,A quick estimation for this one I'd say was around 200/300 Euro.
ypzs2j,2022-11-08,2022-11-10,"That would be the belt/hip armor. It took a lot of time to measure, draw out the patterns, create a mockup, and then cut out all the seperate parts and start detailing them. And after that, priming, painting, assembling the whole thing, making sure you can still move and sit etc. It was intense, but fun!"
ypzs2j,2022-11-08,2022-11-10,That doesn't seem too bad considering the quality of the final product.

yniwno,2022-11-06,2022-11-06,That's fucking cool.

Not trying to say it's wrong, just the thought process behind it."

yniwno,2022-11-06,2022-11-06,"Thats a very fancy looking Mjolnir, but the overall shape is at least a lot closer to how it is usually depicted in ancient Norse art."

yniwno,2022-11-06,2022-11-06,It did! Collector‚Äôs Edition and Jotnar Editions have different ones
yniwno,2022-11-06,2022-11-06,It is very accurate to described Norse mythology.
yniwno,2022-11-06,2022-11-06,It fits. Its a bag of holding.
yniwno,2022-11-06,2022-11-06,You just have to warm up it first
yniwno,2022-11-06,2022-11-06,"It looked pretty hefty from the official unboxing video from the way they were handling it, so I too would like to know lol"

yniwno,2022-11-06,2022-11-06,"Game discs aren't included anymore due to digital consoles. You wouldn't buy the CE if it came with a disc you couldn't use with a digital console.

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I've just got done playing _the Sinking City_, a Lovecraft-inspired adventure game which is sandbox style. It was over-ambitious of the studio and it has some jank, but there are some interesting ideas.

One of those ideas is that since you're a newcomer, you don't know the town and no one will tell you shit, so if you're looking for a guy, _you don't know where he lives_, if you're looking for the old steel mill, you don't know where it's located. So, you actually have to talk to people, or go to city hall, or the police department and try to scrounge up some records, then you place a marker on your map.

I liked the inmersiveness of it, but there is definitely a flip side to the quality-of-life ease of markers."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,You're not getting too old. You're just playing games that are made for the masses. Have you ever played any isometric RPG's? That's the way to get lost in a game. I am living in the land of Eora right now for Pillars of Eternity and am fully enveloped.

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Try playing something Nintendo like Mario Odyssey or Zelda Tears of the Kingdom. Consider Elden Ring or Baulder's Gate 3.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I wholeheartedly agree, immersion is a big deal for me and many games nowadays just break it for no reason.

Games I like in that regard:

Dark Souls 3 (literally lets you hide the entire UI except for when you use it / take damage)

Subnautica (UI blends into the game well)

DOOM is also pretty great"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Subnautica is a good exploration low hint game.

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I finished Fenyx rising yesterday, and while I enjoyed the game for what it was (Had to jack up the difficulty to nightmare because it was mind-numbingly easy on normal), it had Ubisoft's slime all over it.

Why the fuck is there all this microtransaction cosmetic trash for what's a lesser BotW/Totk?  Made it even stranger when I found out that you can get all of those cosmetics for free, but only by grinding a currency doing quests that are on a server timer as if the game was supposed to be a live service game despite being single player only.

But mechanically the game was *mostly* fun.  Near the end it started to do what I affectionately refer to as a game ""Fucking me around"" with how the puzzles seemed to become more of just wasting my time for the same tiny rewards and not actually challenging me.  That and the final boss was quintessential anti-climax, even on nightmare.

If there's anything that I find more irritating than anything in modern game design is how they add things to just waste your time rather than actually challenge you."

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Start playing more indie games.

Modern AAA games are designed for broad market appeal, which means they need to be playable for the lowest common denominator, i.e. the *stupidest* person you personally know. Can't have them getting stuck and complaining to their friends how ""confusing and stupid"" a game is, because that shit will hurt sales, and less sales might be the difference between your studio getting the axe or not from some bean counter in accounting management.

Indie games don't need to worry about that."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I feel the same way about a lot of AAA ""serious"" games.

Try Ghost of Tsushima. It's got the Ubisoft/Assassin's Creed style open world, bases to beat, etc, but the gameplay is actually fun, there's minimal HUD, and not excessive hand holding. The swordplay is top notch, possibly the best in any video game ever. One of the few ""serious"" AAA game I've enjoy 

Also, Nintendo games. Mario Odyssey and Super Mario 3D World, both new Zeldas - fun gameplay and not really any of that stuff you're describing."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Definitely a lot of hand holding in AAA story driven games these days, I feel the same way. Maybe try Breath of The Wild/Tears of the Kingdom where you're given much more freedom!"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I felt the same for a while.  I tried Remnant 2 and I'm hooked.  There's absolutely no hand holding, you gotta figure about almost everything by yourself.  My personal 2023 GOTY."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Play elden ring without a guide. See you in six months
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,I highly recommend Sea of Stars to avoid all of this. It's a very nostalgic feeling game while being extremely well polished.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Hollow Knight is what you need. It's one of the most immersive games I've had the honor of playing, it gives you just the right amount of hints in a intuitive not on-your-face way.

Maybe drop the AAA games for a while and explore indies."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I liked fallen order in that if it sensed you were taking long on a puzzle, the game would off to give help, but you could decline if you wanted to. The puzzles weren‚Äôt extremely difficult but sometimes they could be confusing and I think games should offer help rather than give it to you outright"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,It sounds like you need to hop on a Souls like game. Tried Elden Rings?

I'd suggest taking a break or perhaps you could dabble in some indie titles; however, the high-risk element of development virtually ensures that a wealth of games nowadays are more iterative than evolutionary, hence the weariness."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Have you played Breath of the Wild? No ads. No BS. Pure open world. I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôve played it if you went for Immortals, but if not then you should."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,There needs to be a middle ground because the only thing more frustrating is wandering aimlessly or being stuck with no direction and not knowing what to do for an extended amount of time.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Play Elden Ring.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"That's why I bought a retro handheld and pretty much just play PS1, GBC, GBA, and SNES games that I never played growing up or replaying classics for nostalgia."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Because those games are genetic AF
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"The pinnacle of player agency is a game that nobody even knows about.

La-Mulana.

This game is a journey where you do all the work. Record hints, find hidden rooms, unlock areas. You can hard- and softlock yourself. There are failable puzzles related to the main plot that require you to load a save or restart the game. There are traps everywhere that you need to remember. Enemies are assholes. Everything is a puzzle, the world is interconnected. The map is gigantic, the bosses seem insurmountable at times and you are married to your jump direction at all times.

And the remake is the nice version. The original version has only one save point, you cannot cross spikes by walking in from the side, and you have to figure out what software combinations even do, ranging from life changing comfort, like being able to warp to certain map areas, to stupid bullshit, like changing the end credits color, or transforming all your weights into Oolong Tea. You really had to experiment and learn.

The game rewards you for being persistent, but it also rewards you with...more game! It's a soul-crushing journey to do blind, but it lets you be the master of your own success. And I respect that."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,And then you play an old game and get stuck for hours
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Play something other than the mass-appeal AAA games

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"These games are similar in that they want to be movies more than video games. I think you just don‚Äôt like the genre of games that you seem to be playing, I don‚Äôt like them either. Outer Wilds is an incredible game that doesn‚Äôt hold your hand and explicitly requires you to explore around and figure things out using your own logic. I highly recommend it."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,I would recommend you play Elden ring or any of the from software titles. Challenging and no hand holding. The witness is a great puzzle game with no hand holding. For FPS go play tarkov if you want immersive.

Factorio

For example."

Sure it's mostly the usual open world go here do this but a lot of the time the ""do this"" part involves a lot of player freedom. And yes, you CAN get lost in Night City and just wander around doing whatever you want."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"These games bore me now so much. The stories are replayed and they struggle to be fresh any more. 

What does float my boat at the moment is Satisfactory. I played a good 400 hours of factorio and really enjoyed that, tried satisfactory but couldn‚Äôt get on with the first person-ness. Now I‚Äôve got back to it and it‚Äôs superb. Problems, solutions, damn, I made more problems. I have pencils and paper, calculator. It‚Äôs great."

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Play Elden Ring. You seem to be fed up the formulaic open world games that hold your hand and don't let you express yourself like you want to. Elden Ring might be considered hard but it doesn't force you to play a certain way or play the game in a order that is designed by the game and not decided by the player.

Edit: If you feel like ER is not for you, maybe one of these is interesting to you:  
Outer Wilds (not Outer Worlds!)

Return of the Obra Dinn

SOMA

Talos Principle

Celeste

The Witness

BotW or TotK if you haven't played them yet

&#x200B;

Or if you are struggling with new games. Try to play some old games you loved in the past maybe they will reignite the love you had for games."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Because puzzles confuse players, and if they get stuck,  they just give up and call the game bad.  

All they want is skippable story elements and 57 combat rolls per hit combat where the enemy boss needs 400 hits to die,   and they need to do it on a dk jungle beats drum controller or something stupid...  

They don't want story at all.  Just achievements.  And so developers put in the achievements,  and add these dialogues to ensure you get them."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Sounds like some Metroid Prime with div-prompts off is in order (there should always be an option to turn them off, if I'm that stuck I can look it up)."

I cannot stress how much fun of a little action puzzle game it is."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"To be honest, you may just be burnt out. I've been there several times, some of my burnouts can last a couple months. If you can, another hobby may help you rebuild the desire to game in the meantime, then you can come back to whatever really quality titles you've missed to ensure you have a good start when you return"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Try switching up genres and styles of games. Sometimes the things we enjoyed aren't what our brains are craving as we get older. That's okay. But I promise you there's others out there you'll enjoy.

Maybe look at what your general life looks like and try and find some games that help support it. 

For example a super high intense stressful day isn't always the most fun and enjoyable to then throw ourselves into stressful gaming environments. 

If you work a very mind numbing job. Play something that's very brain game kinda feel. Puzzles and things like that. 

I hope this helps!

I felt very similar at one point and eventually switched up to some more cozy and party games, did the trick."

The joy of Factorio, besides growing your factory, is not knowing how to make a new item, feeling a bit overwhelmed, then you slowly start to tackle the problem until you finally create a solution, take a step back, watch it work, feel really proud of yourself and what you did, until you notice something is wrong, and you forgot that you are more using more iron ore then you are producing so the process restarts itself just in a different area, with different parts and machines."

One measure I've taken is to never buy the ""Ubisoft formula"" ever again. And I'll never buy a God of War anymore either. Every single scene with the kid was awful. (And worse when you had to play him.)

It's not your age, it's the games : most suck.

I'm no spring chicken myself (my first TV was in black & white) and I still enjoy games from time to time.  I've loved Elden Ring and every ""Soul"". Recently I've played Afterimage which was a pretty good Metroidvania.  A few months (years?) ago I've done ""Subnautica"" which was very enjoyable. As for Baldur's Gate III, it became an obsession for several days.

It's a matter of finding the right ones.

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-11,">Am I just getting too old for videogames?

I used to be a hardcore gamer. Like, REALLY hardcore. From the time I was maybe 5 years old and my cousins had an Intellivision, and I later got a Coleco, Atari 2600, eventually NES, Gameboy (the original brick), etc. Later, in my young adulthood, and even through my 20s I gamed \*constantly\*. At one point I was in a top 3 US WoW raiding guild, and was myself one of the top 10 shadow priests in the world at my peak. At some points throughout my life, I gamed just about every waking moment for months at a time. I have a Steam collection that's probably worth over $10,000 retail.

It seemed like overnight at some point, it just switched off. It was right around the time of Skyrim, GTA V, and Fallout 4 (these were some of the first AAA games that I would get about halfway through and lose interest in). I'm 42 now and can't recall the last time I purchased or paid a subscription to a game; probably not long after that Skyrim/GTA V/Fallout 4 era. I don't play any of the games I have anymore. I WANT to, I really miss those days, but for some reason, as I said, one day it was like a switch turned off; there weren't any incidents that seem to have caused it, it just kinda happened.

Occasionally I try to sit down and play something for a little bit, but I just can't do it. I can't get immersed, and seem to have increasing trouble sitting still or not getting distracted for long enough to do anything meaningful in any games (should be noted that I was diagnosed with ADHD as a kid and re-diagnosed with it again as an adult -- I'm not sure why games used to be able to hold my attention before but don't now, but that seems to be the biggest part of it. Maybe things can change with ADHD as you age?)"

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-13,"Alot of samey, uninnovative mechanics from following trends has stagnated gaming as a whole in many cases. A growing number of us have ""been there done that syndrome"" as games simultaneously copy their peers instead of creating their own original ideas and rebrand old concepts as ""love letters"" to this or that. Not to mention the reselling of established franchised games that have notoriously bastardized their games with repetitious, predictable and uninspired fodder or fluff just to get the next iteration out to market.

Point being that it's all been done, many to tedium, and much like the infamous E.T. game's symbolic death of the Atari era of gaming with an oversaturated market of low quality standards, the market has to shift back to basics in quality product to recover from the abuse the industry's success has wrought. The open world pitfall needs a course correction also to get games back to a realistic budget and deadline. The fiscade that games need to be huge and graphically detailed or ""realistic"" to be good is finally waking people up to getting back to making limited, but joyful games again. Both to make and to play. Because when there's vision and passion for making the game, it translates to the players and they recognize it.

In short, there needs to be more games that aren't indie OR technical marvels, but some space in between where the average good or even great game used to exist. We need Rush and SSX and old school arcade sensibilities again to get us back on track with a healthy balance of complete, finished games again that can bolster studios reputations instead of shutting them down. Make ""A""gaming Great Again."

Divinity: original sin 2 doesn't have any map indication, you just need to figure out where to go yourself. And there are usually several routes. Divinity: os 1 is the same, but I found it harder to find way to go, because some routes are not really obvious. And of course no puzzle hints and no microtransactions, at all."

The only thing I can play now that immerses me is multiplayer games like Tarkov and League. 

If I play a single player game it has to be a strategy game or something that I need to figure out how to play. Mount and Blade sucked me in when I first tried it because it was a sandbox type game that didn't really tell you how to play and you had to figure it out, kind of the opposite of what you experienced.

These are action games wanting to appeal to as broad of an audience as possible and want to use puzzles as a change-of-pace, but doesn't actually want people to get stuck on them, because they aren't puzzle games.

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I'm deep in my obsession with the connected games made by Remedy, so I'm gonna say check out Alan Wake, Control, and Alan Wake 2. Rather than hand holding, they reward thorough exploration and sometimes the solution or path forward is so unclear you might even get lost. The gameplay style varies quite a bit between all 3, but the story is connected and really the story, characters, and world building are the best part of these games. If you like ""weird fiction"" like Twin Peaks, X-Files, House of Leaves, SCP, etc. Combined with some fun and quirky Finnish humor throughout, and great multimedia elements like music and live action TV/commercials/movies within the games.

Alan Wake is the oldest of those games, and in terms of gameplay it shows. It plays like a 3rd person action shooter with horror elements. The combat is basic and fine. You have a flashlight to burn darkness off of enemies and guns to shoot them to death once the dark is gone. You basically are Stephen King trapped in your own story, trying to save your wife and yourself.

Control is not a sequel to Alan Wake, and is instead an over the top action shooter with badass superpowers. They do take place in the same world so you can find references to the events of the first game and some characters featured in Alan Wake. It has a story based DLC called AWE which is a direct tie-in with Alan Wake, dealing with some of the aftermath of the first game. Control has spooky elements still, but since you're basically a super powered Jedi in this one it's the least ""horror"" of the games.

Alan Wake 2 just came out a couple months ago and is straight survival horror. Limited ammo and resources, dangerous enemies, combat plays in the vein of a modern Resident Evil. You alternate between playing Alan Wake and a new character, an FBI agent investigating a crime that she doesn't know is connected to Alan Wake at the start. You also get a fun detective crime board like something out of True Detective. The pieces of evidence you find by exploring the world, don't explore enough and you'll miss information that helps flesh out the world, characters, events, etc. You can beat the game with an incomplete board without punishment, finding those little details is left to you if you like that.

If you don't want to buy 3 games, skip the first Alan Wake and watch a YouTube recap of it so you understand the story. You won't develop bonds with any of the quirky characters from it that show up in the other games, but it's not going to ruin the experience."

but that doesnt mean challenging games dont exist. it doesnt mean buy2play and never spend another dime dont exist. 

its your choice as consumer to choose those products that fit your preference. 

you are not getting too old for videogames, but you seem to become that facebook uncle blaming others for his choices ;)

And I can see that nobody has proposed the last game that really was worthy of being called a game. 

Witcher 3 (for medieval action and a gorgeous story with plenty of side quests that actually build up the world around you)

Or 

Cyberpunk 2077 (lots of action, a good enough story but not on the same level as Witcher 3)

Nothing else is worth your time I am afraid."

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,This is what happened when the hobby became mainstream. Devs switched to making games that would appeal to the ‚Äúmodern audience‚Äù instead of appealing to actual gamers.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-11,"Yeah, you need Elden Ring. Simply just make it your kind of game cause it is one of the best games out there that is exactly what you're looking for. Change your perspective and open your mind to it being your type of game lol same could be said for any Fromsoftware title."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-11,"Not sure why this is a surprise to you. Modern gaming has gone downhill ever since AAA games were geared toward casual gamers. This has been the case for years now. It's no longer about gameplay, but providing a scripted story experience appealing to the dumbest common denominator."

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Accessibility seems to be overtaking immersion in many games these days. Gameplay is number one, but even more than story, I think immersion is number two. Even in multiplayer games, I‚Äôm so sick of seeing damage numbers, hit markers and so on. I get there is a place for that stuff and some games need it, but I just wish we had a good balance of choices."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Games are very unfinished and unfun nowadays the only want moneyüòî
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Casuals are the majority friend. We have fought back every step of the way, but at the end of the day it's the brain dead majority that dictate game pacing, balancing, and hand holding. It's not going to get better. Games for gamers who want to figure everything out and take a long time to finish are becoming more and more rare. 

It's not worth getting stressed over anymore, you'll just always be stressed. Look to indie games and lesser known devs. AAA titles are going to be that way."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Baldurs Gate 3 gave me that feel where you goto bed thinking about the game and you're excited to wake up and boot it up again. Lies of P also did that for me. I do find that harder to come by as I'm aging since I've experienced a lot of good video games. I think a masterpiece or a game that feels like it was made for you comes around every few years.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I only find that problem on ""AAA"" games or what you want call them. They don't trust players to do anything and have nice graphics and tell you all you need to do. 
I couldn't finish god of war because that got bored after 3 hours.. 

I do enjoy games that are older like recently started playing Skyrim again. And was fun.

New games from big game studios aren't worth of anyone's time since they either focus only pvp or make sure everyone can finish them no matter how bad they are at games. I don't find any challenges in modern games really.

Try some indie games they are awesome most parts. They not have resources to solve puzzles for you and some are challenging but not many have good graphics etc. They may not look pretty outside but inside they are better that any big game studio can give"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I think it's your choice of games. Those games are all mediocre and kinda the same in a lot of ways. Try a different genre, maybe. If you find those games boring, then maybe we have similar tastes, and I could recommend some if you want."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Why are playing Western garbage? play better games
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"That‚Äôs why I keep going back to playing Skyrim. :)

I agree though, it‚Äôs all too much. As I‚Äôm older, I also don‚Äôt have time to die a million times either. I‚Äôve tried almost every Souls game and end after a couple hours, so I would expect no different from Elden Ring. I don‚Äôt have time to master a boss by dying 50x before figuring out the nuances of his every move to survive.  I would have loved them when I was in my 20s, not now.  

Jedi: Fallen Order is a game recently I enjoyed putting my time in to beat.  Not too easy or hard, didn‚Äôt hold your hand, and easily doable in small 30min-1 hr chunks. Can‚Äôt wait to play the sequel."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Stop playing games designed for babies? You say Elden Ring isn‚Äôt your kind of game but based on your crying I think you just don‚Äôt realize it yet.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-11,Yes you're getting too old for video games. If your older than 18 and still playing games then lol
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Because you playing nothing but handholdy minimap-hunt skinner box games that were made by 500 people and for 500 million dollars in order to target exclusively your short-term-reward monkey brain and don‚Äôt ever ask any actual real participation of you.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,play games by developers who respect the medium

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"People who make games are smart. People who make blockbuster games for blockbuster audiences are also smart. All of the things you're complaining about were added because during testing, a significant number of people could not figure out the answer to the puzzle/problem on their own. Or they lost track of what to do and got bored. Or they forgot that X mechanic exists.

Ubisoft just wants people to sign up for and use their programs, which increases their ability to be marketed to.

FOMO, microtransaction, and skin nonsense is here to stay. 99% of people ignoring/complaining about it means nothing when there's that one percent that will happily burn hundreds to thousands of dollars without batting an eye."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"You need to stop playing games made by AAA studios man, check out some of the smaller games that are still focused on just being games rather than trying to be cinematic experiences."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I don't know if you'd like the genre, but Elden Ring and Genshin Impact have annoying puzzles and hidden quests that make me pull up my phone and check for clues. Genshin has more puzzles because there's always new areas, new hidden quests, and new characters coming out every 2 months. Elden Ring is good but it feels quite dead at times."

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,This post feels like it‚Äôs from 5 years ago. Every outlet and subreddit is full of talk of popular acclaimed games that are not any of this.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"So if you're on a trip with someone IRL, everyone else stays silent the whole time? You're the only one that can talk and make observations about your surroundings? A companion in game talking and making observations about the environment should be *more* immersive, not less."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Modern Sony games be like that unfortunately.  If you don't want hand holdy cinematic games,  you'll have to cut them out.  Plenty of great games came out this year that don't do the things you're complaining about. Baldurs Gate 3, Armored Core 6 and Alan Wake 2 to name just a few.  Also, I'd recommend looking into indie games like Dredge, El Paso Elsewhere, and Last Epoch"

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I felt that way with Hogwarts Legacy. Maybe it‚Äôs the difficulty I was playing in, but I don‚Äôt see the point of puzzles if you can just ‚ÄúRevalio‚Äù and be shown everything. Even if you don‚Äôt, the game gives you 30 seconds to solve a puzzle before you get a repetitive dialogue on how to solve it. What‚Äôs the point of the butterflies (or whatever they are) puzzles showing you a location when you can just revalio and immediately know where the butterfly is?"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Play Starfield.
The UI is very minimalistic and the game doesn‚Äòt really hold your hand much. It gives you time to breathe."

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"You are playing the wrong games for that. Most new games are *terrible* with HUD and direction they give. Follow a marker A-B? I will not buy. Here are a few awesome games from the last couple years with none of that nonsense:

* Elden Ring
* Baldur's Gate 3
* The Talos Principle 2
* System Shock Remake
* Outer Wilds
* Subnautica

tl;dr your answer is Soulsborne."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Try Elden Ring. They do not hold your hand.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Have you tried Baldur's Gate 3? Most lost I've gotten in a game in a LONG time
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I mean, folks have already recommended RDR2, which would be my number lne recommendatuon for this. Idk what yypes of games you typically play or what system, but if you haven't played any Elderscrolls titles I would highly recommend those as well as Fallout series. Both have minimal HUD and can be customized down to nothing. Also, if you play PC you have an immense amount of mods to choose from that are great for immersion. 

I also could add some weird niche pc games that are quite old but quite cool if that's what you use. Either way, RDR2 was the game that got me back into gaming. The intro is slow, but the game is so worth it"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Buy new Prince of Persia. It will have this option. Or play Zelda game. Typical AAAs are not for gamers.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Try Outward, they are so hands off you might miss it. It's a great game, so really you might like it."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Try out Tunic, really fun game that doesn‚Äôt hold your hand and is a love-child of DarkSouls/Zelda"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I don't know if you've played Star Wars: Fallen Order, but it was the first game in a very long time that I fell in love with and actually looked forward to getting home and playing.  Solving the puzzles, going back to previous areas with my new stronger powerups and opening up new places to explore and new enemies.  

The combat was tight, controls felt great, environments were fun to explore.  I really didn't care about the story much, but IMO it was much better than a lot of games released today that handhold you through everything."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Might not be for you but DayZ gives you literally nothing and the start is brutal for newbies.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,That's why i love doom 2016 finished it in 13 hours single sitting remind me of my childhood gaming for some reasons.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I don't know if you have a switch but I got Breath of the Wild recently and it sounds like what you're looking for.  You have to do a short tutorial portion but after that you're free to do practically whatever. I heard you can even go right to the final boss if you want but I never tried it myself. 

I don't think there's any ""hints"" in puzzles at all in that game. Plus the puzzles actually feel rewarding. They're challenging without breaking rules the game established already, which it seems a lot of games do if they want to make a really challenging puzzle. 

Even confrontations with goblins can be approached from multiple different ways of your choosing. It quickly became one of my favorite games and I'm not even finished."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Try indie game stoneshard
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Play BG3

Dishonored 1 & 2, outward, dredge, hollow knight, prey, lies of p, any dark souls game"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Play better games.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Go play Outer Wilds and enjoy.

Tunic is also a masterpiece of letting the player discover the world and figure out things by himself.

Ubisoft-style games are just brainless. They are not inherently bad, they are just the ""fast food"" of gaming : you know the game, you know the recipe, you know how to play it since 10 years, you turn off your brain and enjoy the exact same game with just a different map and a different story."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Because you are playing main stream garbage that has to cater to the lowest common denominator of gamer to make sure they can hit all their metrics and sell to the largest audience possible.

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,I would say try Dragon's Dogma or Dragon's Dogma 2 (when it comes out). Sounds like you want to explore without being told what to do. I am currently playing Dragon's Dogma and I get kind of lost sometimes. It is fun but I run into higher end mobs lol. Overall Dragon's Dogma is growing on me the more I play it.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I'd say RDR2, GTA V, Judgement, or any of the Yakuza games would be good for you. They don't beat you over the head with menus, or key jangling prizes. You play them at your own pace."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I mean, you're spending money on these games like you didn't expect these things to be in them? Maybe spend money on games you like? It's 2024, you can know whatever you want about a game before buying it. Just watch some gameplay on Youtube first. Did you beat Elden Ring or what? It's exactly what you're asking for. If you don't like it, you either just don't like video games, or you're depressed and the things you used to like aren't stimulating your dopamine like they should."

Darktide

Darkest Dungeon (2 if you want it to be less punishing)

Terra Nil"

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,I think that‚Äôs why I enjoy the DS type games. They don‚Äôt hold your hand and let you figure it out on your own minus the small text left behind for you to read.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I feel as you do about most aaa titles. Singleplayer games that still got me hooked in the last year were:

\- Chained Echoes (felt like playing stuff like Chrono Trigger or Terranigma again for the first time, loves it)

\- Sea of Stars (imho not as good as chained echoes, but still very nice and lighthearted, with great optics and soundtrack)

\- Jedi Survivor (you played it, you know, why its good)

\- Hogwarts Legacy (just so much to discover, very fun gameplay, nostalgia)

\- Baldurs Gate 3 (everything has been said about it, cant stop playing)

\- Super Mario Wonder (just not to much thinking, great gameplay and flow)

\- Halls of Torment (half hour of power, and maybe another one, and another one)

\- Pokemon Infinite Fusion (if you remotely liked any pokemon game, you should try it, i mean somewhat like 90k custom sprites?)

\- Sons of the Forest, Ark, Grounded (played it in coop with friends, but still solo sometimes some grinding and building is just what you need to feel happy)

One has the best open world experience imo where you WILL get lost in exploration and finding new places you wouldn't have otherwise. The game truly does not care if you stick to the main path and even encourages having your very own experience on the huge map. Also very clean and simple HUD and almost no markers on the map, except your own and stuff you discover yourself. Hell there isn't even a map for any area before you find one. And it keeps expanding, the more you explore, you won't even know the true size at the beginning.
And the other has one of the best stories i have ever experienced in any games/movies/books etc. I really don't wanna spoil anything so i will just say that it's been years now since i finished the game and i still think about SOMA fairly often because of the impact the story and especially the ending had on me. Also the game does not babysit the player and is also quite simple gameplay wise so it should be a chill play for you.
Just don't think too much about it and give one them a try without expecting or knowing too much about it. It will make the experience a lot better, generally for single-player games"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Recently playing batman arkham city. They do puzzle/problem solving right. A little hand holding but let you figure things out for yourself mostly. All of the batman arkham games are good like this.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"God I wish there was an option to turn that shit off...

A STFU button or toggle...

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I'd recommend Hi-Fi Rush, Sea of Stars, Chained Echoes, Subnautica and its sequel, Minecraft, Stardew Valley, and Doom 2016 and its sequel.

I'm not sure what your preferences are, but if you want a decent story and fun gameplay these are my go-to games...among a bunch of retro SNES games."

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Here's your problem. All of 3 of these games are from some big triple A studio. That's not me saying triple A games can't have the feeling of getting lost, it's just that very often they're  appealing to a specific audience. 

RDR2 is amazing to get lost in. Hollow Knight is a very different kind of game, but it's great for a game not treating you like a child at times(I find any moment to mention hollow knight, smh). Many soulslike games are also great for that, though not as in face of a story as the games u play."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I totally agree, I loved Horizon so much but the puzzle hints came on way too fast. Sometimes I'd stop to take a drink of tea, forget to pause, and before I put the mug down the puzzle was already ruined!

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I've recently completed my 200th hour in Tears of the Kingdom and still have plenty of sidequests I want to complete.

Also; Rimworld.  Just let the game happen, and it'll tell you a story.  Here's a write-up I did after one surprisingly emotional game:

&#x200B;

>This game can be so brutal, but at the same time, surviving all of the nonsense thrown at you basically is the game.  
>  
>If I wanted, I could set it on ez baby mode for babies and complete all the research/do all of the things, but then I'll have a playthrough filled with stuff I don't remember.  
>  
>Instead, here I sit, with the memories of Sam the Child Ranger who was the only one left standing after multiple attacks, who fed and cared for her fellow colonists.  Who was the only survivor after more attacks.  The one who kept everything running!  
>  
>Up until I decided to take in  someone running away from an army of bandits - I had guns, they had bows.  But I had 6 colonists - they were fifteen.  
>  
>Sam lived.  She was the first to be injured, but she was tough (literally, it said so on her bio sheet) and while she hid in safety, she still took occasional shots at the enemy and eventually they retreated.  However...  
>  
>It was eventually just Sam, one of the newer recruits, and the asshole I provided protection from the bandits that I redubbed ""Reason"" - as my saving his ass caused the loss of so many actual good colonists.  
>  
>And that alone wasn't why I hated that jerk.  It was because he was ALSO a jerk.  He'd constantly insult the other two.  Pushing them to their breaking point - but not Sam.  She never broke.  She was close *so many* times but she amazingly held it together.  
>  
>Then, tragedy.  
>  
>Sam got sick.  So did other guy.  Maurice or something?  It wasn't good.  Sam, having had to do everything once before, was the best at doctoring, Maurice was the second best by default, as Reason couldn't be bothered and was incapable of even being forced to do so.  
>  
>Reason utterly refused to do a lot of things.  
>  
>And so, Sam slowly succumbed to her illness.  The toughest, most badass colonist I've ever had, brought low; her friend unable to help and Reason unwilling to.  
>  
>  
>  
>When she died, Reason wouldn't even bury her.  
>  
>  
>  
>And so, I let the game run.  Reason soon snapped and just got himself killed because he was an idiot.  Thunderstorms burning buildings, raiders breaking and stealing things.  
>  
>Hilarious sidenote - the first band of raiders to happen across my lifeless colony went all pyro - two of the three ended up burning themselves alive as they set fires to their exits.  
>  
>Eventually after a year and a half went by, even the raiders found little to do in the wreckage of my little town.  A single raider walked through, smashed a chair... and left.  
>  
>And yet, through the year and a half, after everyone else's skeletal remains had been turned to dirt and dust wherever they lay (mostly outside, after succumbing to the elements or other natural causes, such as bullets, which, naturally, kill you)... Sam still lay peacefully in her bed, her final resting place.  Claiming the entire mountain she lay under her tomb, as she rightfully deserved."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"they simpy cannot afford to take the risk. If a player doesent figure out the puzzle he will get frustrated and after spending some time they will get off the game if they dont figure it out, which could result in bad reviews. Like sure most ppl could understand the puzzle but some don't and they want to make a game that as many ppl can play and enjoy."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"The real and true answer is you need a dopamine detox. I've been a hardcore gamer for pretty much my whole 32 years of living and I've encountered this quite a few times in my life. We are playing games too often to the point where the rewards and feeling of satisfaction of accomplishing something in a video game doesn't do it anymore. You ever notice whenever you don't play games for a long time and when you come back, they seem extremely more fun than before? You had a dopamine detox."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Probably already been suggested multiple times, but try out Fromsoft games if you don't want hand holding. Dark Souls, Sekiro, Elden Ring. All amazing games with next to no hand holdings."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Find other games. Baldurs gate 3, jagged alliance 3, witcher 3, dragons dogma ish. Red dead redemption 2.

I don't mind the hints myself. More the quality of everything else"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Try Baldur's Gate 3.  Make your own damned decisions and live with the consequences.

Its not an action game, though."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"maybe try indie studio games. my recent and probably all time favorites are from such indie studios.  

The Long Dark from Hinterland Studios  
Frostpunk from 11bit Studios (don't know if they considered indie studio anymore, they have some interesting games in their repertoire)  

both produced my favorite games in the last couple of years. admittedly with the early access trend BS you really have to do your homework and have faith in unknown (to me) indie studios, but in those cases it paid off greatly (for me)"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,We need a standardized hint disable button in all games.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I have the same problem with Hogwarts Legacy.

My character keeps repeating shit even when I am doing that part of the puzzle, it annoys me a lot.

I believe that in the Tomb Raider games you can set the frequency of tips and I love that. Set it to low so if I get absolutely stuck I get a tip."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Check out Ghost of Tsushima if you haven't already. They only system they have for hints is the wind blowing in a certain direction and even that you essentially have to manual trigger with the touchpad. Probably the last game I got lost in.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I grew up addicted to gaming.  Then around 19 or so, Halo 4 came out.   I beat it and had zero connection or interest in playing again.  

The game was good, just had so much going on in life it was hard to  dive in and feel lost in any game.

GTA5 was literally the only game I could enjoy just cause I like driving.

Took until about age 28 before I got lost in a game again.  This game was Rust.  3k hours later it's still my favorite game.  I absolutely just get lost in it.

Star Citizen is my newest game I've been able to get lost in.

What I'm getting at here is, you may never feel the same about games as you grow older.   But there will be a game eventually lol."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"This is part of why I have been playing more indie and AA games than AAA games these days. The AAA games definitely are moving towards ""lowest common denominator"" gameplay, and the ability of indie and AA devs to make really solid games has increased."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Yeah the constant hints are ruining the experience.

In my opinion the game that stuck gold in balacing hints with letting the player figure it out themselves was Uncharted 1 with its hint system in the puzzles.

Although I don't know if that will work just as good in open world games."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Okay Baldurs gate 3. Cyberpunk. Elden ring
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"If you don't like those games then find other ones. There's not an infinite amount, but at this point millions of games out there. Don't just stick to AAA titles, there's something out there I guarantee it."

You just aren't the target audience anymore. Developers figured out that they make more money when a player stays engaged with a game. Today's gamer children can't stay engaged long enough anymore to actually solve shit even with the internet full of hand-holding video guides.

You want a game that truly lets you play uninterrupted, go play some DayZ."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,That‚Äôs why souls games are the best
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Also painting yellow everything you can interact with, Found it especially annoying in RE4 remake, I blame the last of us for starting the trend, it is just another way of dumbing down the games and takes the immersion away"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"A ton of triple A games are like this and on purpose. They want their game to be able to be played by literally everyone. This includes people who will drop a game if they get stuck for a few minutes because they missed something. It is just another reason why indie games have the amount of popularity that they do.

I get into slumps sometimes as well with thinking ""maybe I don't like games anymore"". I usually swap genres or try something new to relight the fire."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Just play a mindless game like warriors, they have many different flavors: one piece, Gundam, edo period japan, zelda, fire emblem and just slaughter like 1000 dudes. It's good fun and they barely tell you what to do"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Makes me appreciate that in the new Tomb Raiders Lara didn‚Äôt do this unless you pushed a button and you could ignore the vision hacks if you wanted.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"The first issue is an issue with Ubisoft, EA, and Actiblizz most vibrantly. Sometimes also capcom depending on the game. Avoid games with microtransactions. 

The second is an issue in particular with Sony games, I find. An edgier person would describe it as ""soullessness"" but I think it's more to do with development mentality. The combat, story, and exploration of many Sony games feel like they are made by separate teams, and designed to be completely skippable. Difficulty settings are flat tuners and the games don't have obvious, polished defaults. Puzzles are hinted so aggressively they may as well be cutscenes. The actual story is through cutscenes, rarely with major player interaction. 

The result is that, for me, GoW,  Horizon, Ghost of Tsushima, and the new Spidermen all feel like the same games, and all are 3 vaguely flavorful parts of games stapled together as a polished but incongruent amalgam, designed so that anyone who wants any one piece of any can enjoy that and ignore the rest. The result is that people who want a game that feels like a cohesive whole can't get one, but can't quite say what's wrong because these beautiful, polished, ""open"" experiences aren't satisfying. 

The successes lately have been games with singular visions, cohesive wholes, and frankly crackhead passionate dev teams. Fromsoft after Miyazaki became a lead director and then president became nothing but this, and Sekiro and Elden Ring remain crown jewels as modern cohesive games. Indie games like Hades, Hollow Knight, and Celeste all succeed for similar reasons. Doom 2016 and Eternal present fantastic, polished single player challenges that are easy to get immersed into. BG3 is so functionally cohesive that it goty'd as a crpg in 2023, and not just for Astarion's voice acting. 

And finally, there's Nintendo. Metroid Dread alone got me off the keyboard and helped me appreciate single player games, and the game is very happy to let you get lost and kill you. Both Modern Zeldas are excellent immersive unguided exploration games, happy to let you die and get lost and hide their deeper mechanics for you to find. 

There's plenty to enjoy. What you're seeing is primarily an issue with microtransactions and projects too big to risk failing. Both are avoidable."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"It's more like you are getting old and used to it. You won't get the same amount of dopamine when you experience one thing twice. Though there is a way, you need to quit gaming untill you will start feeling excitement again. It may take years to do so though."

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"It's sort of important to remember that most games, especially big AAA blockbusters like the ones you listed, have to be lcd because they need to sell as many copies as possible just to make money back. The average adult in the US reads at a 7th or 8th grade level and, given the typical work schedule, can't afford to spend 30 minutes of the 3 hours they get to play during the week failing a puzzle. Or, at least, they are unwilling to stay engaged when they feel like they're failing while clockwatching. I'll be 40 this year, so I don't think it's necessarily ""aging out of gaming"" but more ""my tastes have changed dramatically since I was in my 20's""

Here's some stuff I've played recently that really sucked me in:

Cyberpunk 2077 (with the PL expansion) - The main game is way better than it was, PL is amazing. Still has some bugs and it still has the optic batman vision thing, but it doesn't really lead you around by the nose too much.

Baldur's Gate 3 - Just solid all the way around. Tons of choice, tons of secrets, puzzles and quests that will just let you fail, while the game continues.

Pentiment - honestly sounds like the most boring thing on the planet, but it's well written and is willing to let you just fuck everything up. Not much action in the typical sense though, kind of like Disco Elysium where it's mostly just talking to people.

Neon White - pure action, story doesn't matter in the slightest, so maybe not what you're looking for. It will show you where some of the planned shortcuts are after you've gotten a certain number of points in the level, but there are more shortcuts they don't show and it doesn't preclude you from finding those shortcuts before they're revealed.

If you want a pure puzzler that's not going to help you in the slightest I'd recommend Return of the Obra Dinn or The Case of the Golden Idol(which, to me, isn't quite as good as Obra Dinn, but still scratches that same itch). I'd also point to rogulites and metroidvanias as genres that generally don't do much in the way of handholding. If you haven't played Hades or Hollow Knight, those are great entries in their genres.

There's also a ton of games these days where the whole point is to drop you in a world where you're clueless about everything and have to piece it together yourself, maybe even what you're supposed to be doing. Elden Ring is a big one, and I think most of the souls games can fit into that genre; but I'm talking about games like Tunic, Outer Wilds, and Chants of Sennar.

Also idk many good memory games, but Card Shark is a game that's solely about learning how to cheat at card games and then executing those cheats under pressure."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Play Project Zomboid, the tutorials pretty helpful but not very handholdey!"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Part of the immersion is being a child, the game could have had graphics from the 90s and people were still  immersed and hyped. 

If you're just after stories many mediums provide great stories for less effort and less  time investment. 

Community is one of the last things that get me excited about games and interesting mechanics. This is why some mmos are good for me and some esports.

Ultimately you don't have to play games. I only really played one game for a long time and I wasn't really much for a gamer. After I quit I tried other hobbies like reading and history/politics, last year I even bought a piano."

I think a lot of games just miss that option. Skyrim is one of the best examples of a stand-alone art imo. It tells you nothing, explains very little and leaves you to explore which leads to amazing discoveries and puzzle solving. I agree with you completely that games hold your hands too much, I was playing Street Fighter 6 and there's this option for easier moves and I was honestly just pissed because now you don't have to have any skill to be good at it, there's no challenge or satisfaction of doing it."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"If you can enjoy the struggle, Soulsbornes normally scratch that itch of not much hand holding. Elden Ring is probably the most guided but Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Salt and Sacrifice, etc. normally rely on player learning rather than hand holding.

Sadly, gaming has turned into a delivery vehicle for micro-transactions.

That's why everything is spelled out and you're not allowed to fail anymore.

There are plenty of indie games that are still made by gamers for gamers. And not by marketing executives for marks to be fleeced."

You‚Äôre just out there fighting and a high level orc comes along and interrupts your battle with an unskipable cutscene. And then once you get control of your character again, another one comes along. It just takes me out of the game. I also feel that way about the Lego games. Yeah they‚Äôre designed to be kids games. It‚Äôs just annoying when they take control away to show you something. You get your character back and two seconds later they take away control again to show you something I‚Äôm sure even a kid would get. I did try Elden Ring but I‚Äôm terrible at games like that."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,I am getting lost and having fun in Elden Ring. I recommend.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I highly recommend the Metro series. Once you've played the first one you can pretty much turn on Ranger Hardcore mode, which disables HUD. The immersion is absolute. Only your eyes, your ears, your weapons and a hostile, haunted world to navigate. Metro Last Light also has such a great story for a shooter, and some really gripping moments. Love creeping around and one-tapping fools with throwing knives and silenced revolver. (Just don't kill anyone important if you want the good ending, in fact follow a guide to get it, because it is that good.)

I recently started playing Cyberpunk. I don't think I've ever been so impressed with a game world. I spent 30+ hours in act 1 just exploring, doing side quests, finding movement exploits, and holding my jaw so that it doesn't drop to the floor and hit me in the balls. Yes it's still an open world game with objective markers. But even if it were a walking simulator with no story at all, it would be worth full price just to explore the incredible detail sculpted into this world and characters.

It's also surprisingly optimized. It's the best-looking game I've ever played, yet I get 60fps on 3060Ti with everything on high including raytracing, 1440p with DLSS set to Quality. I turn raytracing off during combat which gives me 100+fps."

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10," I'm sorry but that game is...not so good, try something else maybe xenoblade series or fire emblem"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,The game you've been searching for is Cyberpunk 2077.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Sony is making a killing turning games into shows and now us gamers have to suffer thru their design ethos shift to make the games more easy to parlay into Netflix series
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"If you want THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE, play La Mulana."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Try Outer Wilds or Elden Ring brother
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,BotW and TotK are good games that avoid the hand holding that is so prevalent in games nowadays
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Play from software games and kingdom come deliverance on hardcore
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"go play Morrowind

a lot of that comes from watering down mechanics in order to make the game accessible to everyone"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Thankfully, I got lost in Starfield. Before that it was Witcher 3."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"If you enjoy sandbox games modded space engineers on multiplayer servers can be fun, currently paying an expanse themed server, no story line but tons to do."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Go play Escape from Tarkov. I guarantee you will be lost for the entirety of your first wipe. And also probably your second or third wipe lol
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Elden ring
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Jedi survivor gives you the options to turn off hints. It's glorious. Some of the puzzles had me thinking for a bit, and a lot of them have different ways to complete them (some abilities make it easier than others)."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,It‚Äôs these giant open world games. Try something smaller scale. Nobody Saves the World is a really fun monthly game PS this month.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,\*cough\* Elden ring. Darksouls. BloodBorn. Demonsouls. \*cough\*
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"When I was younger there were no hints.  We had to figure shit out on our own.

Get off my lawn."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"You should try indie games. I recommend Tunic, Kindergarten and Hollow Knight"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I think I know what you mean, it's called ""handholding"", and yeah I also find it pretty annoying when a game does that.  Where's the adventure if you just keep giving them the solution?"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Not justifying anything,  but the games you mentioned are designed for the masses. The masses aren't very bright and need hand holding."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Gamers are dumb babies for the most part. This is why games point things out all the time.

People in testing get lost and can't figure out what the fuck to do."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I think this is why I've been really into FromSoftware games over the last couple of years. In addition to being fantastic games, they don't hand hold at all. Make the same mistake that results in you dying to a boss 10 times in a row? You can be damn sure the game won't lift a finger to remind you what you're doing wrong.

Like you say, it feels like very few game developers actually respect the player anymore. I don't need Aloy to tell me what to do with a puzzle the instant I walk into a ruin like I'm 5 years old and can't think for myself."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Go play a Souls game.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"As others have said - the developers you mention seem to think everyone is an idiot, so try games from better developers. Anything by Fromsoft will not hold your hand, it will bite your hand off if anything. Elden Ring is a masterpiece.

Also Larian - I haven‚Äôt played BG3 but Divinity Original Sin 2 is amazing, it‚Äôs a different kind of game but it will not help you solve puzzles/challenges in the way Ubisoft does. 

And then Rockstar, specifically RDR2 - probably the greatest world to get immersed in."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Expand your genres. Look at AA and indie games as well.

If you really don't want any hints or help, go play Elden Ring.

If you want to go to sleep at 3am because you wanted to do just one more thing, go play Baldur's Gate 3.

I can list suggestions all day, just give me some ideas on what you like."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I went through a similar thing a few years ago and thought I was getting too old. Really, I was just getting too old for certain types of games. 

Similar to how kids will absolutely fall in love with dumb movies and shows, it's a lot easier to get immersed in games that are just... sort of ok, when we're younger. You're going to have to start seeking out deeper games from here on out. Trust me, there are tons out there, you just have to dig a little deeper (and definitely make sure you're checking out indie games, counterintuitively they're often more immersive than the big budget AAA games)."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Some AAA games are like this but still lots of  games that will give you a run for your money.  I just went through my steam library and for third person action games yeah probably gonna be tough to find a game that isn't going to hold your hand.  I went through a point n click phase just because I needed some harder games.  I also went through a Gamecube emulation phase for the same reason.  I got stuck on Chibi-Robo for like 2 hours and it was just something stupid I wasn't looking for.  

It's bitter sweet.  I don't want to waste time doing stupid stuff but I don't want to be told how to do everything.  I played Witcher 3 with the compass off for \~30-40 hours and that definitely enhanced the experience.  NPC says ""go talk to that person on the hill"" and instead of just looking at my compass I actually look over and see them waiting in the distance."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I highly recommend Starsector or even Escape from tarkov. These games have very basic to almost no tutorial, and you don't get obnoxiously distracted by crazy amounts of pop ups or company ads."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Solution, Elden Ring"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Try playing a game with minimal UI, elden ring or resident evil remake 2 or 4.

&#x200B;

Or"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"stop playing AAA games, they‚Äôre made for the lowest common denominator, namely the stupidest possible gamers."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I remember playing World of Warcraft as a noob. My first ever MMORPG. Getting lost in Dun Morogh as a Dwarf Hunter and Gnome Warlock. 

Didn't know about addons didn't know about anything. A special feeling in a game that you can only experience **ONCE**.üò≠"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Star citizen cultist here.

That‚Äôs one of the things I like the most about SC, the game lets you ‚Äúsubmerge‚Äù yourself in the theme of it all. Not shit that takes you out of it.

Until your ship decides to do the lambada on a treetop and you end up inside the planet for some reason.

But yeah. You ain‚Äôt getting to old, it‚Äôs just that for some damn reason game development is doing that shit now."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Might want to try out Dragons Dogma
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I got Sekiro for Christmas. It has barely any pop ups or u.i for that matter. Generally speaking it's you and your sword.

Best part is it starts off really hard but eventually you hit a point and you just think fine I'll play the proper way, so you git gud and start deflecting everything and the game becomes a lot more smooth.

Wish I could erase my memory and do it again."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,This guy is seriously asking why he isn‚Äôt enjoying a Ubisoft game.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Play Balder's Gate 3
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Seems like your in need of some terraria
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Also try Don‚Äôt Starve Together (you don‚Äôt have to play co-op). Great little game
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Just read in another thread about folks playing Kingdom Come Deliverance without using the map or any map markers. Very easy to get lost but you eventually find your way around using landmarks. Seems like a much more immersive experience. Also, The Long Dark on survival mode might scratch that itch. You turn off the player prompts (‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been so hungry in my life‚Äù) and/or turn off the HUD if I remember correctly. That one is fun to get ‚Äúlost‚Äù in but you‚Äôll probably die. A lot."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I was feeling or not feeling it before new old Ark arrived. This is a very sad feeling and I hope you get freed from this shit soon. A hint, it probably has to do with your personal life."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I concur with the excessive handholding, it is quite annoying.  In playing through Horizon FW now myself and the constant chatter of hints is annoying, it's really the only negative about the game so far, but i can ignore it. Every game should have a setting to remove handholding. Remember when games just threw you in and wouldn't even tell you which buttons did what?"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"It's because you play shit tier games.

My rule is to only play genre-defining masterpieces or games I really want to play.  Don't play games just for the sake of playing them or engaging in the discourse.

Just finished: Witcher 3 and Mass Effect Legendary

Currently playing: Elden Ring and Baldur's Gate 3

For me to invest 50+ hours in a videogame, it better be a masterpiece.  ""Good"" or ""really good"" games don't cut it for me anymore.  I'm too busy, so I only make time for the games that are actually worth it."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Same thing here.

When I was younger, even in my 20s I would get lost in pretty much any game, nowadays... Getting older sucks.

Just bought hogwarts legacy and... I'm not liking it.

Previous game was cyberpunk phantom dlc and I'm getting trouble getting into this Harry potter game."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"It's about target audience. Some games want to be as inclusive as possible so they have as many sales as possible. Had a friend literally say yesterday that puzzles in games are stupid easy these days. 

One thing to consider is not everyone is a gamer, but lots of people enjoy games. So while things are obvious for you, this might be their first non-COD game or something and they might not recognize all the things you do in a game. We've played for decades and know off colour walls can be smashed, or whatever. To others, it could cause them to stop playing. 

Also, keep in mind, these studios do a lot of play testing. And I'm sure the points where it says ""hey check that out"" is where a lot of people stop playing, or at least the data shows that. I think a worthwhile consideration for developers is an assistive mode that will take a line like ""We need to find a way through here, find a path!"" and that after a minute or two, if on assistive mode, the dialogue will say ""Hmm, those stones look loose, maybe we can knock a way through there!"" kind of thing. Gives them a chance to figure it out, but get help if they need to. 

Not to mention, games are so god awful huge that sometimes, there's too many things and some people might get overwhelmed without some assistance. Very rarely are games, outside of souls-bourne games, designed for long term hardcore gamers."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I thought like you a year ago but the reality is that you are choosing the wrong games honestly. Try not playing triple A games with enormous budgets, you‚Äôd be surprised at how better AA games or indies can be.

Also, avoid open world. The way they work now is they just add boring filler or grocery lists, choose games with laser focused story and content."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"May I suggest elden ring, a game that actually treats its players like adults with brains."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Interesting once you leave the tutorial area in Tears of the Kingdom, the game really stops holding your hands.

Like it‚Äôs really easy to miss some key basic power ups like expanding your inventory, increasing your battery capacity and auto build (which is the thing that makes the building mechanic actually useful).

Hell it‚Äôs even easy to miss the paraglider if you go out to explore before heading towards the central hub first.

The game also rewards players for solving puzzles the wrong way which is pretty unique."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"dude go back and play hollow knight if you dont want a game that holds your hand. 2d platformer that doesnt tell you where to, or give you a map to start.  and once you get the map, good luck knowing where you are at one it with out the thing you have to know to buy and equip to for it to happen...."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Probably because you are generalizing all video games using Immortals Fenix as an example. So it's the definition of a you problem.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,The dumbing down of games for a younger audience to make more money is the correct equation.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Maybe try some older games? With some exceptions I couldn't really stay invested in games recently and then I played L.A. Noire. Was absolutely enthralled
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"May I suggest the extremely atmospheric and super easy to get ""lost in"" game called DayZ.

Some might disagree, those people should be ignored :D. 

Best game imo to get ""lost"" in. 

We all go through ruts or dry spells with games sometimes, usually I'll just pick something up completely different for a little bit to get out of that funk. Good luck on your virtual journey friendo o/"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,The world is getting worse and it stops you from enjoying games.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,myst. the puzzles are hard and it doesnt hold your hand in doing them but its rewarding when you solve them. i played it in vr and it was fucking good
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Remnant 2 is my GOTY of 2023, but on Day 1 the ‚Äúwoo, yeah, ha ha!‚Äù cockiness of the character every time you beat an enemy was unbearable. Gunfire Games soon fixed this, which was a relief."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"If you want to get lost, try either of the newer zeldas or, and I can't stress this enough, ELDEN RING. It's not as hard as the internet likes to make it seem. Just takes a second to get used to weapons and enemies having different timings."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Have you played the latest tomb raider? Game is ok but whenever lara is talking about the story and you listen while playing and you use instinct or try pick up something you have full inventory she just stops and says ""cant take more"" or ""need to close that"""
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Last times I ""lost"" myself in a game was Diablo 3, Genshin Impact and WoW."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Sounds like you should play Baulder‚Äôs Gate 3
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"There are a lot of games that let you do that, maybe you can try another devs that are not aboard that train. Try Outer Wilds, Pillars of Eternity Elden Ring, Dishonored saga, some old Zelda games like Ocarina of Time, Tunic, Return of Obra Dinn, Psychonauts 2, etc."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,I think there's too much handholding. And definitely too much P2W. I was hard-stuck for days once in Myst.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I've been playing games for about 17 years now, mostly RPG/adventure-y sorts. I think that there's a point where you reach where tropes become too blatantly obvious because you're so practiced at seeking them out.

Of course enemies can't see me while I'm crouching in the bushes. It's been like that for over a decade, stop reminding me.

Of course that differently-textures section of wall is breakable, it's been that way for over a decade....

Of course the giant glowing mark on the boss is it's weak spot...

And so on. But because new people who haven't played games for as long (through lack of interest or lack of time alive), need the reminders that we veterans find so grating. 

It would be kind of interesting if there were some way to introduce hint frequency as a setting more broadly. I know the recent Tomb Raiders had a setting where you could set how obvious traversal points were marked in the game world, from bright white paint, some white smudges, no marks at all etc."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Tey Baldur's Gate 3. First single player game in a while that really just sucked me right in.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Other people wrote Elden Ring, which is the correct answer.  That's a game you get lost in.

This is the love/hate relationship that I have with Rockstar games.  GTA 5 and RDR 2 are incredible technical achievements with great immersion but GDI every single element of the games feel like fetch quests."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Tomb Raider is the opposite, figure it the fuck out ya dumb fucks"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I just finished playing Kena: Bridge of Spirits and was soooooo happy that there is hardly any hand holding when doing puzzles. Like to the point where there isn‚Äôt even a single hint throughout the game. It was so enjoyable. I hadn‚Äôt enjoyed a game like that in a long time.

I HATE the hand holding. Zelda is my favorite series, but lately I feel like they hold hands a little more than they should. Ocarina hardly did that - I want to go back to that. Or at least don‚Äôt give me a hint unless I specifically ask for it (like talking to Midna or something)."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Elden Ring is waiting for you.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Try terraria there‚Äôs no hand holding there. Sure you have the guide to help you but without the wiki open you‚Äôre running blind especially if it‚Äôs your first time.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Sunny Suljic (voice actor for Atreus in 2018 and Ragnarok) even states in a short interview he doesn't like the sound of his own voice constantly calling things out in game for Ragnarok. He claimed he got ""annoyed"" by his own voice regularly LOL"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Try Elden ring
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Hogwarts Legacy came close for me.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Fromsoft games are the only place you can confidently not be hand held every step of the way. And Minecraft, lol."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Similarly Nintendo does shit like this too. I know they make Pokemon for kids, but if you grew up on it you're probably around 30 like me now, and still want to be able to play them.  

The damn EXP shares can't be turned off in the newer games I've played (Sword/Shield and Diamond/Pearl).  I don't need to be 10 or 15 levels higher then the gym leaders by the time I get to them.  Seriously games need to have options in them.  Does anybody know if Scarlet/Violet or Archeus have this same dumb mistake.  

People are literally modding their consoles to mod the game and turn this shit feature off"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,I had this same opinion/issue before I started playing Fromsoftware games.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Not sure about HFW but in SOTTR, there is a setting where you can adjust puzzle difficulty. Easier difficulty means Lara provides voice clues and pathways have some visual cues. Those are turned off on the higher difficulty"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Play Elden Ring. It doesn‚Äôt give much in the way of hints or guide. I got lost forever before I realized I was only in the first cave at the very start lol
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,You should go play Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3. Let us know when you do.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I had the same problem until I decided to ignore 95% of the AAA gaming industry.

Tons of diamonds out there that are way better.

Suppose it depends what type of games you like though"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Maybe try a game that isn't just the latest AAA title. Hell, if you do want AAA that you can get lost in, I know it's a regurgitated point now, but Baldur's Gate 3. That or Elden Ring. Aside from that, go play indie or AA games."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Hogwarts legacy, as pretty as it is, is the worst offender of this. The checkpoint lady almost felt patronizing, and your character immediately blurts out the solutions to puzzles the moment you encounter them."

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Play Outer Wilds.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"It sounds like you should try playing some smaller indie games. Stuff like risk of rain 2, wizard of legend, heartbound, hollow knight, dead cells, no man's sky, valheim, 7 days to die, rust, ark, Conan, once human, dark and darker, world of warcraft classic.....elden ring, sekiro, dark souls, lies of P, all sorts of stuff. Doom 2016


I also highly recommend lots of stuff in the Nintendo catalog, Zelda tears of the kingdom and the first one really sound right up your alley, they don't hold your hand at all and have tons of puzzles. It really sounds like your biggest gripe comes from the ubisoft and EA side of video games where they just simply can't trust you to do anything and the game must be beatable by anyone at all. 



There are a lot of games that just plop you out there and don't hold your hands at all, some of them with varying levels of difficulty."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"you probably play the wrong games. i'm kind of old myself, and still enjoy playing games. However, I have found it far more interesting lately playing older games from the early playstation era than modern spoonfed games. i also find a lot of good indie-games that are much better than most AAA titles."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Wanna get lost in a game and relax? Play **Death Stranding**! Trust me. The story will get you hooked, and you will get lost in it. I recommend playing it offline (it adds a lot to the immersion because the world is untouched, beautiful, and you will slowly see your tracks being made and it's just amazing to see how far you have come). I feel great learning the map and the lore. Try it! The atmosphere that the game creates is exceptional!

Plus, it solves your problem with game puzzles because in Death Stranding, you have to brainstorm how to get from point A to point B and plan your deliveries (the game hints at some equipment and that's it, the rest is up for you to think how to do it). The only handholding is at the first delivery, which is showing you 3 possible routes: long one through the valley, short one through the mountains and one crossing the river, and also, the game is telling you after you done your first delivery 3 possible routes to escape/confront the enemies (it is part of the tutorial), but for the rest of the game you have to figure it out on your own.


I am having lots of fun  figuring out how to traverse the terrain. (especially offline cause there aren't any players to help me indirectly with their structures/signs).


**Online/Offline**


If you really don't want other players to help you indirectly and figure out everything on your own, I recommend playing it offline. After you beat the story, you can connect online if you want to experience the **connection** message and vibe that the game is trying to showcase.

If you are a fan of Death Stranding and you are reading this message, I only want to tell you:


 *Keep on keeping on, fellow porter!*"

It does have some objectives/bosses but the entirety of the gameplay just plops you down and says good luck lol. You have free reign from there & honestly I have played for hours just building different things & exploring or resource gathering.

There is a bit of combat & upgrades as well, but once you start getting your base, you expand it & before you know it, you‚Äôve spent days building a cool looking base in the side of a mountain next to the goats.

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"If there is a modern AAA game that lets you get lost in the world and doesn‚Äôt holder your hand AT ALL it has to be Elden Ring. What a refreshing, amazing experience that was.

I also found Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3 to be one of the greatest game at allowing you to tackle obstacles using a countless different approaches without holding your hand. While the game is not Elden Ring hard, I can see it be difficult for people unaware of 5e‚Äôs ruleset and the changes Larian made to it. Overall, another refreshing, amazing experience.

There are definitely plenty of games that exist out there that don‚Äôt hold your hand, don‚Äôt bother you with micro-transaction/online connectivity to their eshop, and are fun as hell. These are countless AAA and indie games that will give you that experience. Some of them came out this year like Talos Principle 2, Tears of the Kingdom, Jusant, etc. You‚Äôre not getting too old for games, there‚Äôs not such thing. Do yourself a favor and uninstall the Ubisoft launcher, and use Steam, GOG and/or Epic (many people hate this one tho). Beware of Ubisoft made games that will launch the Ubisoft app launcher even when bought from another platform. But, if you bought a Ubisoft game, it is only fair to suffer in exchange."

If you think of all the games that you stopped playing half-through in the past, it was typically that a weird puzzle or unclear mechanic stumped you in a way that broke your immersion by over exerting your patience. 

It's not as if in these days we have shortage of alternatives, so whenever a game is \*either\* under or overstimulating, we won't hesitate to just play something else. 

That said - I agree they're indeed going too far in the hand-holding direction. An option to turn these hints off would indeed be an ideal middle ground, for sure."

Or what about games that tell you the same thing every time you pick up an item? ""That's 100 rupees!"" Yeah, I know, you told me that the last 30 times I picked one up. 

I've had a sore spot for this type of thing ever since I saw a list of the 100 hardest games and the PS1 Metal Gear Solid was in the top 5 of the list. When I saw that people considered that game to be hard I just started getting annoyed at how far it's gone now. Basically that list was the harbinger of a bad future, and now we're in it. 

I'm tired of games that have no consequences for dying. I'm tired of puzzles that look fun only to figure them out in 10 seconds because the game practically gives you the answer or the puzzle is really just a facade where the actual solution is so simple it might as well just tell you to tap A three times to progress the story.

One AAA company that doesn't do this is From. In Elden Ring all you get is a map and lights in certain places that indicate where ""grace"" wants you to go, but following the guidance of grace isn't even necessarily a good idea.

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I would wager hand holding in gaming is becoming more popular because of the rampant microtransaction/battle pass/constant stream of information offered by most free and increasingly, paid games now.

The constant dopamine drip caused by these trends in gaming has created a generation where they crave it causing attention span to suffer as a result. 

If you didn't have the hand holding in longer, narrative driven games, it's likely the modern generation would give up playing them.

Unpopular opinion: None of the games op mentions have difficult or even somewhat difficult puzzles in them. They're just perceived that way because of what I mentioned above.

Even The Talos Principle 2, a masterpiece in the puzzle genre, has easier puzzles overall than its predecessor.

Game design is just reacting to the trends in the industry and the shifts in behaviors and attitudes of their general audience.

Edit: My childhood was spent playing games in the mid 90s to early 2010s. The gaming industry overall approached game design entirely different from what it does today. Game guides were popular both in print and online and I actually felt rewarded for completing a game. I agree with op on their take on today's games. I pick up a lot of them and can't even push myself to complete them, not only for the reasons they mention, but for other reasons that just weren't prevalent in gaming a decade or two ago."

Playing Remnant 2 currently, just by not telling you directly where to go (and keeping the area reasonable in size) it does give you that discovery to look around and figure it out. That said no one way always just works, it takes proper execution and sometimes I'm a guide me player and sometimes I'm not.

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"sony games are probably the worst games for hand holding, which is odd as the actual gameplay in their first party games is always rather shallow and simple. I was recently playing through the last us part 1, and got very frustrated by the game design. there isn't much to the game already (cutscene, go down a corridor, combat, cusctene, cutscene, cutscene, combat), but then to make things worse, after each stint of combat, I just want to look around the environment, find stuff or just appreciate the environmental design, but after 5 seconds you get a loud noise, and a big flashing button icon to press for the game to tell you where to go. sure, it's giving you the option to get the hint, but you are interrupted over and over by the noise and massive button prompt over and over. the game is already frustingly basic regardless. I've loved playstations games since ps1, but probably about halfway through the ps4 era I started to get really tired of their lack of gameplay mechanics and over reliance on cinematic set pieces, QTE, and just an overall lack of engaging gameplay, or actual gameplay for that matter"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Turn off (or minimize) the UI in games that you are good at or very familiar with. 

In a game with good level design the world itself will guide you where you need to be, and you'll find yourself doing more exploring and noticing the world around you since you aren't just staring at a marker on your compass or checking your ammo. 

Combat without a UI is a bit different from game to game, but in most games once you ""click"" with it you're already most of the way there. You just get a ""feel"" for how you're doing based on the sounds and feedback. 

Sorry if this is a silly answer I've just been playing Doom 2016 and Eternal with no UI lately and realized how much cooler of an experience it is!"

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Play tears of the kingdom. Ironically it was the thing that put me off from the game. I do not have much free time to game so I try get as much out of each play session as I can. I was constantly finding myself having to go on YouTube to figure out what to do.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Those are all stupid games.  They're designed for morons.  They count on the graphics and audio presentation as their ace up their sleeve so that non-morons will still somehow enjoy them.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I play Star Citizen. Being a full sandbox that doesn't make me do any particular thing has helped me. I decide what I want to do, and then I go do it. And I can't get enough. 

I think I'll strictly focus on sandboxes going forward. I prefer to control my content directly, rather than be guided ""themepark"" style through repetitive activities that are just dressed up differently to appear ""varied""."

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Games are holding your hand more because people are getting stupider and gamers are getting younger. You should try Hifi rush. You can really get lost in it and it‚Äôs very fun

you are not getting too old for that, modern games are shit"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Another reason to enjoy fromsoft games. I would get lost in the world just exploring. 

Monster hunter world is also pretty good about drawing you into the ,ahem, world."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"its called 'mass appeal'

the entire industry is increasingly geared towards people who dont play games and being accessible enough for people as young as 12 or as old as 70.

the inevitable outcome is games that 'gamers' will find boring and simple, Starfield is a *flawless* example of a bland uninspired game designed to appeal to everyone: you cant even 'fail' quests, no one swears, half the NPC are immortal (heaven forbid you kill the 'wrong' person) etc.

its like this for almost all games, Baldurs Gate is the only release i can think of in *years* that actually respects the player and treats us like we are capable adults who have a few braincells.  


Gaming has entered the Marvel era: design by committee and the sole purpose of creation is to maximise views. to do this they make everything bland and simple, cant have complex grey narratives no you need to be able to tell who is bad just by looking."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,You play the wrong games.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Have you tried Elden ring?
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,If you haven‚Äôt played Elden ring brother then that‚Äôs the perfect game for the complaints you‚Äôve given. Doesn‚Äôt hold your hand aside from giving you a general idea where to go but even then you can easily get lost
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Should play Hardland. Fantasy game no map/quest log etc No hand holding at all. Reviews are mixed cause had a long early access.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"It's difficult but Elden Ring doesn't hold your hand at all, doesn't even tell you how half the mechanics work üòÇ You have to get lost in it to understand it"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,I love loading up Spyro games for this reason. It‚Äôs so fun to explore and find hidden eggs and dragons without the game spoiling the locations or how to get to them.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Do NOT play AAA games ESPECIALLY UBISOFT if you are looking for immersion, they are filled with pop up."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,OP should definitely try Alan wake 2. The amount of mind fucking layers upon layers with little to no hint.. I'm sure you'll like it
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Not all games are like this and if you're someone who grew up with the development of the game market it's especially off putting. I think the reason they did it is because gaming is a vastly under utilized market that is growing very fast, so big developers sometimes care more about accessibility to the masses, I don't think it's having the intended effect though. But it's still an emerging market and people and companies are experimenting. Both of those game your mentioning are by far the worst offenders in recent gaming news too. 

Try lies of P. For a new game it's amazing and very hard. So much so that immersion has to be a part of the design otherwise you will die or have no motivation to continue. Fromsoft and their style has grabbed a lot of my attention lately because of that.

Also fuck ubisoft. They just destroy franchises at this point."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"First off, you can get lost in a game. Depends on the game you're playing for how much it will hold your hand and guide you. CRPGs like Baldur's Gate 3 will tell you where the main quest is, but otherwise it's on you to find side quests, hidden items, NPCs, etc.

Second, knowing where to go/what to do is a good thing, some older games could result in hours of retreading old ground just trying to figure out what to do and that sucked. It's just a matter of how aggressive the game is about it. God of War definitely backseats way too much, but there's a middle ground that works. Dead Space for example got it right imo. It has a button to press that will give you a guide if you need it, otherwise do as you please."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"The problem is you're playing AAA games, aka trash.
In recent years indie studios have been putting out the most innovative and immersive games."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Play Zelda Tears of the Kingdom
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"To me it seems like most modern games AAA are afraid to allow the player to fail, they also seem to assume that you've never played a video game before.  I had the same problem in horizon forbidden west, most of the time Aloy told me there was a puzzle in the area before i'd  had 2 seconds to notice it myself.  I guess its so they can have more mass appeal but at least let me turn that stuff off in the options, I have played the first horizon game, i know to use the focus any time theres a puzzle around, i've also played tons of games, i can figure out if theres a cracked wall it might be breakable.  Subnautica was one of my favourite games of recent  years because they just plop you on an ocean planet and task you with finding a way home.  You get vague hints as you go but it relies heavily on the player scanning things and reading the entries as well as thoroughly exploring themselves.  The sequel, below zero, went and added these typical modern game features, you get more hints and they are more obvious too, any time you go vaguely near something important they give you a marker for it, it really ruined alot of the fun for me after the first game.  This is also the reason i like soulsborn games, they aren't afraid to let you fail and the only hints for puzzles you get are item descriptions and npc dialogue."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,What ruined gaming ? For me as sad as it is online play. I enjoyed not having access to online battle royals. Get lost in games all all the time as kids but yeah. Battle royals CoD and MTXs imo.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"The handholding has been a trend I've been upset about since Legend of Zelda: OOT like 25 years ago. It's gotten worse for a lot of ""mainstream"" games but the core problem isn't new.

The live service problem likewise has been growing for a (console) generation or two now.

On one hand it sounds like you might need better games (many great suggestions here) but also you might need to look beyond video games for managing your mental health."

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"You're playing the wrong games then. Sony first parties are especially bad in this regard so if you only play those, no wonder you feel this way. Give something like Elden Ring or Armored Core a try."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"You need to play older games, and i mean ""older"" where there were no prompts or anything you were just off on your own to figure out puzzles and mechanics. Those were the days.....

Nowadays they hand everything on a plate to you."

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I fucking hate how you can't turn this off for Steam. Completely ruins the immersion.

Also, just started playing Civ 6. I was ready to win. Hit ""next turn"", and before the game had a chance to play out the computer's turns and declare me winner, the Steam pop-up comes up congratulating me on winning my first game. Pretty annoying to steal the game's thunder like that."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I really enjoyed Metroid Dread, but when I finished it, I just thought it felt. . . off, somehow. 

I loaded up a second playthrough and it didn't take too long before it clicked. Ah ha!!

You don't get to explore in that game! Yes, the map is very big with lots of branching paths and twists and turns and hidden passages, but you ***never*** get lost or have to backtrack. In fact, ***you can't*** get lost, so you never need to backtrack. That game does a very good job of railroading you along the one correct path that you need to be on. Especially in the early game, you are constantly falling into pits that you can't jump back out of, or sliding down hills that you can't climb back up, or closing thermal doors that can never be re-opened, but the end result is always the same; you have no choice but to forge ahead the intended way.

Great game, but I felt it was a little lacking in the ""exploration"" department."

They implement some of these ideas of having to ask around, investigate various records etc in Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One as well and though that's also not a perfect game by any standard I had a lot of fun playing it.

Also they're a Ukrainian studio, so this is a particularly good time to support them by buying their games."

I recently learned this trying to teach my friends how to play a few games. There was no effort and out of 10 people, 7 required serious hand holding. 

It honestly made me quit logging into discord and just playing by myself for like a month. Pure laziness taking over.

Edit: Some days I like to throw on a chill game with 0 brain power as well."

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"My only annoyance with bg3 is that you can know 100% there is a secret button or door or whatever, but you can't push it if you just got unlucky and every single person fails the check. There's a quest I just never completed because the only way forward was through a hidden door, but everyone (even went into camp to get others) failed the checks.

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-11,"On paper I shouldn‚Äôt like Returnal. I‚Äôm not a big shooter guy. It was the first PS5 game I completed, I just got hooked. If you get a good run, good weapon RNG and progress beyond the third biome you can really start melting stuff (it can melt you too). Once I finally beat the 3rd boss I finished the game with only one death due to my own stupidity.

The ascent to Hyperion is just so atmospheric too."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Returnal was a great game and needs a sequel asap

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Yeah but Elden Ring isnt a story driven game like the others. Its meant to be explored unlike Horizon and God of War which are mainly story driven games.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"> even then the masochist in me continue on regardless.

I found myself in Caelid waaaaay too early and forced myself through it. Took so long to get to the bottom of the Caelid Tower, and even the dude outside the Godskin Noble would fuck my shit regularly. I just assumed the game was THAT difficult (First From Software game at the time). Felt sooo satisfied when I defeated him. Then went south to the Weeping Peninsula and was stunned to find it easy.....

God I love that game so much."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-11,Any fromsoft game is the antithesis of modern hand-hold game design. The earlier games are even worse for not knowing what the fuck to do or to go

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"dunno how Elden Ring isn't OP type of game when all the other games he mentioned are third person, open world games (idk if god of war is open world haven't played it)

is it the difficulty that makes it not his type of game?

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I can't second this enough, no hand holding. The whole game is about learning and figuring things out by your self."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"You haven‚Äôt got long, but it‚Äôs all the time you need."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Just finished this. I cried. Perfect ending.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"For anyone looking here, Outer Wilds is incredible and another game which gives a similar feel plus terror is Subnautica. Subnautica is very immersive for better or worse."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,I can not second this recommendation enough. Personally it's one of if not my favorite game of all time.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I tried to play this game like 4 separate times but everywhere I went nothing happened. I found a few places that looked like puzzles, but couldn't do anything.

I followed the music, it would lead me to a person, they would talk to me, and that'd be it lol.

Go somewhere else, run around, try to go back to my ship, it got sucked into a black hole.

Got so damn lost I had to give up I guess I'm just stupid as hell."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,This is both the best game to ever exist and the least replay-able game at the same time.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Can only play it once and then it lives in your head rent free forever.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Arguably the best game of all time in my opinion.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-11,"The first time I realized what was happening before the first...event. I was standing on a planet looking at the sun and the fucking music was so epic and I was like ""WHAT IS HAPPENING"" and it was glorious and I think about it every day"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Upvote for Subnautica. I‚Äôll have to try the other 3 thanks for this list!
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"sons of the forest too when they finish it, looks like its close."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Play Terraria blind until you get pretty deep. Use the game resources and ask Reddit if there's a hint when you get stuck. It's a fantastic experience
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I wasn't able to understand Valheim. Is that game a serious grind? It felt like the loop was repeating the same thing again and again until you have enough to make equipment.

Compare that to Terraria, which has you either playing in the rich underground or gives you constant monster action during the required grind parts. Or V Rising, which wants you to have a similar large amount or resource, but has more interesting travel and more interesting ways to loot.

Valheim is beautiful and seems like it has a lot of work put into it, so I hope I'm just misunderstanding something."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,All great games
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,+1 for Subnautica.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"The witness is one of the best puzzle games I have ever played. 

At one point I got out colored magnets and a whiteboard to work out some of the puzzles."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Have you tried Tunic? It‚Äôs also a masterfully crafted game that you might like (like outer wilds try not to spoil yourself too much)
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"If you liked the witness, you should give the looker a check. It's a satirical take on the witness, it's only a couple hours long and free on steam"

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"That game is a god send for immersion.

To the point where if you try to play Hardcore you have to start like 7 times because you die before the game even starts because of things like breaking a leg and getting an infection and dying as a child, being generally disliked enough to get pitchfork mobbed, etc. 

10/10 will die as an infant again"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"My only problem with this game is that it trains you to fight 1v1 all the time but keeps putting you in 1v3 situations. Now, i can take 1v2, but 1v3 involves constantly backing away and parrying which is just not fun to me... 

It's a shame because i loved the open world, the story and characters."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,This. Such an amazing game
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-11,"I finally got around to KCD this year and my god, It's everything I ever wanted out of a Bethesda RPG, except it wasn't made by Bethesda. 


Fantastic RPG elements and the unforgiving save system makes every decision and action have weight to them. The only thing is the combat is REALLY clunky at first, but once you (and Henry) get good it starts to become very satisfying."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,What are you talking about? It's the story of how you died!
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-11,"Project Zomboid is the first game that ever truly sold the ""oh please don't let that scratch be infected"" feeling for me"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-11,"Not only doesn't hold your hand, but slaps it away."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-11,"I had a character last for almost 8 YEARS in game. And I accidentally added bleach as a random ingredient.

PZ will fuck you raw, no mercy."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"By the time I remembered the story I was so loaded I maxed the camp out entirely and owned all the guns. The ""we just need the money"" made me crack up every time since I had like 10k or more consistently."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,It‚Äôs so jarring though because in the missions you need to do EXACTLY what the fuck they say or it‚Äôll restart the mission. Odd game design choice imo but when games get so big I guess you can only let us feasibly do so much.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Lol the missions definitely hold your hand though
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I should really get this game. Ive tried it twice. Installed, played 30 minutes, uninstalled. Couldn't get past the intro. But maybe it's time.."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Seriously? RDR2 is one of the most strict, guided, restrictive games I've ever played. You have to do things in the exact sequence the game tells you, in the exact order and place, and if you try to do anything creative or different it fails the mission.

For fucks sake, there's a mission where a *required step* is ""**pick up your hat**"".

Doesn't babysit you much, my ass"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,A lot of these are def good examples save for maybe Mario Odyssey if you're wanting something with very little guidance on what to do.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-11,"BOTW and Mario Odyssey are probably the most lost I‚Äôve ever in a game. And it was absolutely wonderful. 

Nintendo REALLY knows how to immerse their players. My worst mistake ever was going into TOTK with a walkthrough guide. I had completely forgotten how immersive the BOTW exploration was, and completely spoiled the experience for myself with TOTK."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-11,"I've played both BotW and TotK with pro hud (just the healthbar and nothing else). Lets you truly appreciate the visual design of the game, I barely got lost because you can ask NPCs for directions, there are road signs everywhere, you can almost see Hyrule and another landmark to guess your direction. Not to mention you can use the sun as a guide too. There hasn't been a more immersive experience for me"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I really liked the green lights on jump platforms in doom. It helped to see where I needed to go, but wasn't immersion-breaking"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,The politics in that game alone are cool as shit
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Yeah... I remember paying that game and trying to hit a woman and couldn't. Could not hit her. I had to run away and got lost. Wound up finding a Dwarven ruin and got lost in there too.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I played Fenyx Rising on Switch after playing BotW. I enjoyed it for the Zelda-clone that it was. Combat and cosmetics were both better than BotW, but the world map littered with collectables did get a bit stale.

Still, wish the sequel didn't get cancelled."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-11,"I loved loved *loved* Fenyx. I got it on Steam and didn't have any Ubisoft pop-ups as /u/madaboutmaps mentioned. I'm sorry y'all didn't have the superb experience I had. 

I agree with you, Jaded, about the puzzles toward the end being more annoying than fun. And yeah, the time fillers + add-on fetish is all feeding these twin gods of Game Length and More Profit Forever."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I had the same thought. I still play AAA games fairly regularly, but most the games I play nowadays are indie games. They tend to hold your hand less, be more experimental, and just take more risks. I have been disappointed by a lot of the AAA games I've played in the last year as they have been really bland for me.  Admittedly, you will have more indie games to choose from if you have a gaming PC, but there's still a good number of indie games on console as well."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"this is the same problem with modern tv and cinema, writers have to craft a story that the dumbest viewer can grasp, making the rest of us sick from the clunky dialogue and intrigue with the subtlety of a screaming child."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"GoT is one of the best games I‚Äôve played. It‚Äôs absolutely gorgeous, soundtrack is amazing and the swordplay feels good. And Jin doesn‚Äôt have something to say about every single thing."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,An absolute pleasure to 100% that game. The multiplayer they added later on was also a blast. A more ambitious sequel can‚Äôt come soon enough
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"\+1 for the BOTW recommendation.

Past the plateau, and even on it, the game let's you do what you want"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-11,"My experience with Remnant 2 was that it goes all the way round the other extreme to having secrets be so obtuse, cryptic and so unlikely to be found by just playing the game that you end up looking everything up on a wiki anyway. Stuff like having to reroll the entire campaign until you get the exact combination of areas that you then have to complete in the right order and move items from one world to the other in the right places with zero indication of anything is just too much."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,I agree with you. Remnant 2 might be the experience that OP is looking for. There's lots of puzzles and discoverables. A lot of which you won't be able to find on your first playtheough
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Hollow Knight is a great one. Looking forward to Silksong this year
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"omigosh, YES.  the indie games are fantastic.  check out SplattercatGaming on YT.  that's ALL he covers.  for over a decade.  he's introduced me to dozens of great games."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I've never been able to get onto a single souls game. They don't do anything for me.. it's also not that I mind easy games. I mind having every step being told what to do. Or pop ups taking me out of a world im playing.

I want to just play a video game without being interrupted every step"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,I was going to say that too. I haven't been able to really get sucked into any games lately. But then I picked up BG3 two weeks ago and I can NOT stop. I even got my boyfriend addicted to it and it's all we talk about.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"""today I'll sleep early.... Is that the sun rising?""

330hs and still want to play it more"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-11,Truth. This is the first game that got me until sunup I years. Probably not since RDR2.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,I'm actually home with a burn out from work. And I'm trying to get my mind of things. But it's not working. I don't have anything else though. I could smoke weed and stay in bed for a month but that's not helping anybody. I go for walks and the like. But that's an hour a day at most. I just can't seem to spend the time without ending up screaming and throwing punches at the wall..
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Yep, especially after you leave the tutorial area.

My most memorable part of the game was early on, just exploring, sneaking past higher level enemies or finding creative ways to beat them.

Years of the Kingdom even more where it can be extremely easy to miss how to expand your inventory, upgrading armor, expanding battery capacity and the auto build ability.

Also, exploring the depths was extremely satisfying early on. Always a sense of accomplishment getting to the next light root."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Surprised this isn't higher, Elden Ring was good but TotK is more accessible imo"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,This is the answer IMO.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-11,"GOWR is very much not ""mid"""
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I have! It was quite good :) still had some stutters and lag despite a quite decent pc (7900xt, amd ryzen 5900 off the top of my head). But enjoyable. Some of the settings were amazing to see. Coruscant especially.. those layers of homes and lights."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,They downvoted him because he spoke the truth.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,People downvoting you are really missing out.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Sad but true
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"haha man‚Ä¶ I remember being a kid with a brand new windows 95 computer that came with a demo disk for a game called Cyberia. Literally no hand holding. 

The first encounter in that game is a man who ambushes you from a corner and if you don‚Äôt react perfectly, and perfectly on time, he shoots you in the head and the game resets. 

Imagine being 11 years old, experiencing gaming as an emergent form of entertainment, looking at a full size computer keyboard and wondering what button is the right button and having to repeat that section x100 times until you clicked the right button at the right time. No prompts. No controller setting menu. No game instructions‚Ä¶ just merciless trial and error. 

When I finally figured out what to do it was euphoric, until the next so or die moment pops up about 15 minutes later and you have to do it all over again -and get good at memorizing the timing and buttons for all of your moves.   

Then later a game called Myst came out‚Ä¶ arguably the first ‚Äúopen world‚Äù game filled with obtuse, abstract logic puzzles, with no minimap, well no map at all. Just exploration. Do or die. Need a map to remember where certain things are on this seemingly immeasurable island? Grab a pencil and some legal pad and draw one!

Games today are definitely easier than they used to be, for better and for worse. The better: less fussing with mechanics and being able be immersed in the stories. The worse: a real lack of mystery and magic, when the game's mechanics aren't explicitly spelled out for you at every turn, you miss out on the sensation that anything is possible here... and there was some magic to the negative space in your imagination that a situation with seemingly infinite possibilities for solutions opened up. Those were the situations that lead to many a magical school yard debates!"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Best stupid horrible masterpiece I've ever played. It's definitely one to get lost in.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-11,Happy cake day!
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,I love these accessibility changes. Let those who want a difficult game have that and others choose their own. I liked GoW Ragnarok especially the auto loot thing. I ALWAYS forget to pick stuff up after battles
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Just got started on melvor idle.   it's got the old-school RuneScape feel.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"you know, you can play myst on ios so give that to them to see if they can figure out and temporarily turn off the router so they cant look up directions"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Need to try some indie games out! I might be able to suggest a newer one if you wanted and gave me an idea of games you like
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I'm trying. But I don't think it's 100% that. The makers of horizon forbidden West I think care heaps. And the game shows that. The story is awesome. It looks phenomenal. But it gets temporarily ruined at times by the commentary.

League of legends is obviously a money printing machine. But I like it loads at times. Other times I can't stand it :p"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,I never played this. Was waiting for some reports that the stutteryness had been patched out. Then came the dead space remake and I realised I never wanted to play the callipso protocol. I wanted dead space and TCP would have just been a nicotine patch where what I wanted was a ciggy
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-11,"You're playing it wrong.

There's a million sequence breaks if you actually bothered exploring, in fact the game gives you little hints that you can do so. Fusion railroaded you to a ridiculous extent by comparison, and Dread has a very similar feel to ZM."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"You'd be best off putting it off for a month or two, due to legal issues the ""good"" version of the game isn't currently available, but should be available again next month."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,I do want to stress that there is some jank here; I think this game would have been better served as a narrative adventure in the Telltale games style.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,They do get the feel right for the most part.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-11,"Yeah, there's a whole story about that. There was some major fuckery going on."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-11,Ugh I just never wanna stop playing. Haven't felt this way playing a game since Witcher 3.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-11,"Ive been put off trying RPGs where you need to click a spot to make your character move before, but I‚Äôm hearing great things about BG3 consistently

Does it grow on you? Should I try it? I‚Äôve never played a game with that type of movement/attack system before so I have no idea"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Mimir being especially funny as he's usually looking in the exact opposite direction
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"My favorite was watching a streamer play Forbidden West, and Aloy wouldn't stop talking, even under water."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Sometimes we'd just get to a puzzle, not even have a chance to examine and they'd be hand holding. I want to go back to finish but I do kinda dread being in those situations"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Forbidden West was really annoying for me, because I would be searching the area for collectables and whatnot, but she would just be yammering on and on about the puzzle I was standing next to.  You just had to be close to something for her prattle on about. I ended up disabling any sort of ""assistance"" the game offered because Aloy either constantly pointed out incredibly obvious shit, or was ruining the actual puzzle as I was solving it... like ""Shut the fuck up and let me play the game, Aloy!"""
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Forbidden West is ATTROCIOUS i had to turn dialogue volume down to 0 and turn subtitles off so i could get some peace and quiet from her yapping
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Well modern gaming thinks accessibility means hand holding so it‚Äôs no surprise. I expect this from games meant for kids, not rated M titles. I can only imagine some of the original god of war complaints today ‚Äúplz nerf platforming hades level too hard checkpoint go back to far‚Äù"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"My favourite was when I got stuck in like a statue room in Alfheim with Atreus and Tyr

And their constant hints simply weren't helpful"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-11,My biggest complaint is that the hints just aren't helpful. They're either painfully obvious or absent when you really need them.

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,I could've sworn there was in the accessibility options?
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,You pretty much gave the reason why devs make the games this way. A vast majority prefer to have arrows pointing where they need to go or how to solve puzzles etc.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-11,"I'll always remember the time I suggested a friend play Portal around when it came out...it requires you to experiment a little to learn how things work but isn't all that hard...yet, they had zero interest or capacity in doing so, not because they weren't smart enough, but because they weren't interested in interacting with a game in a new way, that experimentation that I found so exciting back in the day was a chore to them.

Like...everybody has different tastes, I get that, but the fact that simply being asked to learn new mechanics was an impassible barrier was more than a little alarming.  They didn't dislike the mechanics, they didn't want to even try them."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"yep, mass appeal and accessibility have brought gaming to its 'Marvel' era (and people wonder why movies are doing worse and worse)."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Those were pretty vague and riddle-like, and I at the time felt like you would go long stretches of time without her saying anything."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"And then she'd give you a very vague hint that didn't help you get through the lost woods whatsoever..... and going to that farm...OK, no one is frigging talking to me over here and telling me where the heck I cam find king jabujabu...."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Still couldn't find where to go in the water temple without help.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Yeah the hints 10 seconds after getting to an area was dumb and Ironwood might have been one of the most boring sections of a game I've ever played. Gotta grind out the berserker grave stones and defeat Gna, I wouldn't call the gameplay against them stale I thought they were a fun challenge."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Me too. I had a lot of fun until i just totally stopped 85% through.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"You can turn those ""check rolls"" off so the game doesn't tell you when you fail them. The prompt letting you know you failed is remnant of actual D&D, since you know damn well when the DM is rolling dice.
You can also take a long rest and return, and you'll re-roll those skill checks. Failed exploration rolls are reset after a day."

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10," To be fair, that is role playing.  You the player are not the actor in this situation"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I hear you, that's the rough balance of role playing. You as a player know a thing  but your characters who are present there do not due to failed rolls. As players we want to use this meta knowledge, but in a game thats using rules similar to tabletop rpgs we cant always do that because our characters are not omniscient and will not find every hidden door."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"For a lot of them you can still interract with them it just doesn't highlight them, like the dirt piles. 

Others, you can reroll the perception or arcana by re-entering an area (like the traps). For Gale's personal quest with all the traps the game is pretty much like ""PICK A CHARACTER WITH HIGH ARCANA TO AVOID TRAPS"" if you talk to actual npcs."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Control is a great example indeed.!
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Alan Wake 2 is a bit like this, at least at the beginning of the game. It might get better tho and the story is wild."

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Definitely going to pick it up sometime, was waiting to see if they optimized the pc version since I heard it didn‚Äôt run well on PC release"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-11,Agreed! Returnal is a masterpiece all across the board! I remember beating it before they added the ‚Äúbiome checkpoints‚Äù so you could take breaks during gameplays.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Definitely my favorite game this generation thus far between every platform. Challenging, fun and rewarding gameplay. Also not as insanely difficult as FromSoftware games that you want to punch a wall during parts of the play-through"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-11,"100% agree with this, almost 3 years later Returnal is *still* one of my favorite games this gen.

Tight gameplay & controls, captivating environments & exploration, demands you learn its systems and stay on top of your game.

I cannot wait for Housemarque's next project."

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I played Demon Souls when the PS5 released and gave up on it after about an hour or so. This was before I understood there was a very specific way to play ""Souls"" games.

&nbsp;

Elden Ring looked a bit odd, and people kept referring to it as a ""Souls"" game (which, again, I didn't understand what that meant other than it being hard) but I bought it anyway after the overwhelming positive reviews and feedback.

&nbsp;

First off: It is absolutely beautiful, right out of the gate. The story was a little annoying at first, until I learned that it is *supposed* to be vague, and you are supposed to go out of your way to learn the lore, which again, annoying at first until I started to surprise myself with how much fun I had doing so.

&nbsp;

Also, with the help of a ""Mage"" build for my first playthrough, it finally helped me *""learn""* how the game is supposed to be played.

&nbsp;

Honestly, this was the first time **in a very long time** where I initially didn't like a game, but as I kept at it it naturally became more, and more, and more, **and more** amazing. Fucking 10/10 experience and game."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Elden Ring made me realize how much I use in-game journals as a crutch, because unless you're checking descriptions of everything and logging the information away personally, you're going to miss plenty of side-quests and other cues.

And I love it for that! A great game to go get lost in."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"To a point though, I spent 2 months traveling and came back and couldn't remember where the heck I was in the game, I've spent like 10 collective hours trying desperately to find out what or where or who I'm supposed to go to next, just keep running into mobs way too tough. People say follow the essence directions from the campfires, but those keep leading me to dead ends. I just wish I at least knew exact which major bosses I've killed and which would be a good place to go. Like damn man, just give me a tiny hint, make me have to pay that person like 10k runes for a hint or something so it's costly to me. Just....I need a tiny something goddamn man I'm too old and feeble to wander around another 30 hours with no feeling of progressing anywhere



And you can't really look up online where to go if you don't know what the next step is in killing a boss"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I loved Hollow Knight for exactly this - few to no directions, next to no hints on where to go next and you can just explore."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"A buddy and I started at the same time and were chatting with each other so we could go to the same areas while talking about what all we found. Like having an extra set of eyes but still being single player. He got to the ruins first, made it through and was like ‚Äúhey a chest! Wait‚Ä¶what‚Ä¶ummmmm.‚Äù Served as a great warning for me!"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Trying to find all the hiding spots to not get shot full of holes, all hope of getting those runes back passed a half hour ago, and sitting in a little cabin ""safe"" area so I can turn bones into throwing knives...  

It's a good trauma, I swear."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Mage is so versatile, though. 

And getting teleported to Caelid is good for a mage, if you know where to find the Rock Sling spell."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I have it installed and played through the first area and was very confused the whole time.

I've heard nothing but praise for this game, so I think I'll give it another shot."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Just be sure to stop and smell the pine trees before it's all over ::)
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"If you guys enjoyed the main story, I HIGHLY recommend getting the dlc. It‚Äôs just as good as the main game for sure. Man i wish i could erase my memory and replay that game again."

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Your comment just made me buy the game for my Switch
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Did you read anything?
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Same, I was about to answer Subnautica and also wrote these 3 down"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Next month is when 1.0 gets released!
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Try not to use the wiki too much at first! The guide is your friend, despite what other might say, and what he might lead you to believe..."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"No, you understand Valheim.

It's very much a slow, slow game. Much of it is even set up to be intentional time padding. Thankfully, between mods and word settings, you can reduce or remove some of the time padding, but it's still very padded. Lugging 18 pieces of iron out of a crypt 6 times in a row over the course of 6 hours interspersed with having to deal with your crops and hunting so you even have food, eventually having to spend 45 minutes on a boat heading against-wind the entire time, just so you can make a couple things and realize you didn't get even 1/3 the iron you need...

And it only gets worse.

Disclaimer: I've beaten the game and do like it, but god does it have some serious time padding."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I think Valheim is what you make of it.

I generally dislike games that are a ""grind"" for gear, or stats, or whatever. Not my cup of tea at all.

But playing Valheim with a friend was one of the best experiences I've ever had gaming. It was so immersive that I was lost in the game. I wouldn't have enjoyed it nearly as much in single player - it really requires you to play with others to get the full experience, imho. The game had a sense of real risk and exploration that made the game rewarding for me. Going on a long voyage, cobbling together a makeshift shelter in pouring rain before the sun sets and things get really hairy. Sailing 40 minutes away from our base, then accidentally ending up too close to a biome that we had no business trying to explore yet, and nearly wiping and losing all of our gear. Valheim gave me more legit adrenaline dumps than any game I've played before or since - maybe I'm weird, but it was exhilarating at times. The *building* aspect of the game really scratched an itch for me, too. My friend didn't care much for it, but somehow harvesting stone at a quarry and dragging it back and forth to upgrade our crappy wooden fort into a stone castle was super rewarding for me. Some people don't care too much for that subsystem (the building), but I could get lost in it for a *long* time.

I put in 120 hours and wasn't even bored, though eventually I moved on to other things because we had beaten all of the content in the game at that point (and more has been added, since).

I can understand that it wouldn't be for everyone, but if someone had described the game to me, I don't think I would have really cared for it. It was only in playing the game that things really hit. It's one of the most memorable gaming experiences I've had. I look forward to returning to it once it's officially out of ""Early Access"" and finding some friends to play through it with again."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-11,"The game sinks a lot of time in grinding so it appears longer.  
The truth is, once you got the materials needed it's just a matter of building new equipment and go fight the biome boss. The other time sink is exploration but that one is fun at least.

I don't mind a little grind, but the grind for iron for example is just too much. Pressing a button for hours is NOT gaming."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"If you like puzzles and want one on the go that'll make you feel like an idiot, check out Baba is You. It is deceptively simple, some of the puzzles have taken me and my two very smart brothers literal weeks to figure out. It's on steam but I play on mobile and the mobile controls are great."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"If you like The Witness, check out Viewfinder or at least watch a video on it. It's a genuinely unique puzzler."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Just bought the game couple days ago on Xbox and dam dude. Spot on. Game is crazy.

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,The intro and even first little bit of Chapter 2 is tough to get through until you open some things up and figure out how the game really works.  But it is very easy to get lost in it and worth the investment.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I tried it 3 times before finally sticking with it. Please go in with that it‚Äôs a game of immersion, slow and steady. Don‚Äôt go in expecting big hits of dopamine and rewards every 3-5 mins. It‚Äôs a slow game so when you sit down to play it, think of it as a Western Life Simulator. After a while you‚Äôll learn how alive the world is, appreciate the small details from the towns to the wildlife, and you‚Äôll get pulled into the story. By the end of the game you‚Äôll have taken a long burn of one of the best video games of all time. It‚Äôs an experience."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Uninstalling a 150gb game after 30min is crazy to me hahah
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I tried it twice and bounced off. Clicked for me on the 3rd time, and it turned into one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had.

Not gonna lie, some of the overly realistic stuff never *fully* stops bothering you. I found myself annoyed even when I was weeks in and having a ton of fun. But apart from that, awesome game."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"It sounds like you just want a puzzle game. You don‚Äôt like handholding, you don‚Äôt like games with immersive storytelling.

Have you tried looking into more direct puzzle and/or exploration games?

How do you feel about platformers? Those are typically more skill based and less handholding."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"DUDE... do it. It's a slow start, but so worth it!"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"It‚Äôs slow at first, yes. But once you get to chapter 3‚Ä¶it really opens up. I‚Äôve spent hundreds of hours just messing around in chapter 3."

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I love Rockstar games, absolutely adored the first red dead. but with red dead 2 I've done the intro about 10 times now, and never progressed passed it. dunno what it is about that game. I think a few times I did a mission early on that leaves you very far away from camp (like a 30 minute run) without a horse."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"The intro was a sloggggggg. But if you‚Äôre able to just let go of expectations and treat it like a movie, once your set up camp you are free to do whatever. Its worth it."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,The intro is a slog for sure.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"If you give up after 30 minutes when following the story of outlaws who is stuck in the mountains during a blizzard, carrying the corpse of a fallen brother, the desperation is hanging in the air, no food, no hope. You stumble upon a house while desperately seeking provisions for around 20 people and then your friend stumbles upon a frozen body layed out in the cart outside while your ring leader is having a conversation with the murderers of said body then this game might not be for you."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,the intro sequence is frankly torture. it gets a lot better after that.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I suggested Mario Odyssey as an alternative to large open world games, but a game you can still get lost in with minimal pop ups/interupptions. Just explore the levels, collect the moons, have fun."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-11,Why did you do a walkthrough.  The only purpose to playing is exploration and figuring things out.  That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs puzzles in it

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I mean you just described the souls games.. Maybe give them another chance. No pop ups, no quest logs, no maps.

After playing a few of them it's been very hard to get back into Aaa games now that they all feel like they hold your hand and are just fetch quests with pin points on a map."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"you might like sludge life - it's hard to explain, so i recommend checking out the trailer on steam, but it's a great game and has, i think, no ingame popups at all"

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Sounds a lot like what I went through a few years ago. Quit my job over the burnout, even. My answer was Death Stranding. It was a weird and bizarre one, being a Kojima title, and does take a minute/few hours to open up, but the payoff of the rest of the game is absolutely worth it. Got sucked in and it really helped- for the burnout and the weird gaming blues- and honestly became one of my favorite games. Can't recommend it enough."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"You sound depressed. I don't have much advice for you but I do have sympathy. Good luck, bro."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Do you have any creative hobbies? I split my time between making art and gaming. Can highly recommend drawing as a brutally not-hand holding way to blow off steam
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying and there was no YouTube walkthroughs and guides either. You either got good or gave up lol. But damn it felt nice when you‚Äôd beat it.  It simply just made the gaming experience actually worth it.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Shit does get a touch weird in it but the gameplay remains solid.

Look, devs. If your game isn't wowing me with the visuals or writing, the main character describing it for me isn't going to either. If it *is* wowing me, then why the hell do I need to hear someone tell me about it?

Keep dying? It just gets a little easier. Go too long without difficulty? Starts throwing more enemies.

The only objective in souls games is to not die. Whatever play style achieves that for you is how the game is supposed to be played. And that is entirely dependant on the player. It is completely customizable. I favour a high endurance build with a light bleed weapon. Often times I play through the entire game with only a dagger. I have never once used incantations in any souls game.

And that‚Äôs the whole beauty of souls games. They allow you to take on giants, dragons, and gods armed with just a shield and a dagger."

Id be happier with having no objective markers or quest log if the game made it a more reasonable task to find NPCs and complete quests without needing to get lucky or look up a wiki.

I can give you a whole list of games that you can only find on the switch that are considered some of the best games in their genres. The sheer variety in its library is one of the Switch's greatest strengths. That and its simplicity.

I love my pc but I feel like half my time using it is either downloading games, installing mods or troubleshooting. It takes a lot of time and it's something I have to make room for. The switch is something I can just pick up and play and it works and I can't tell you how refreshing that is."

As an example of how easy it is to miss important story beats:   
I didn't even know who tf Ranni was, because apparently I missed seeing her at the church right at the beginning of the game. I didn't stay there until nightfall, just floated in and out, talked to the merchant dude, and left. I didn't get the spirit summoning bell until *hours* later at the hub zone."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,I like the exploration of it but quest givers should give some kind of hint where to find them next. The game kind of expects you to go and do a full relook of all the places you have visited before.  For example I visited that poison castle thing before Pacthes were there. How I was supposed to know when he went there.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Yeah, I agree with you. Overall I loved the game but I think there should be a little more direction when it comes to some quests. Just a little, not quest arrows or logs, but something.

I got this one but I was watching a big streamer play the game, one that is familiar with Souls games and their quests and he still missed a big part of a critical side quest:

>!Specifically the part of the Ranni quest when you need to talk to her in her doll form in Ainsel River. The first two (?) times you do it she doesn't say anything, and on top of that, you only get the prompt to talk to her in that specific area.!<

>!So if you don't realize that you have to keep trying to get a response from the doll, by the time you get to the next Grace the prompt goes away and it's easy to miss the rest of the quest. !<

Most of the quests were less obtuse though, I think this is one of the worst offenders."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,But thats the thing: They are not designed to be quests. Those stories progress or end in different directions with or without your interference.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"My first playthrough I explored all over the place and kind of patched everything together towards the end, but if you follow the guidelines and read the notes, you can make the experience fairly linear e.g. planet by planet."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-11,"Ehhhhh, compared to modern horror games like Outlast or something, the DLC is like just light horror at most.

Although i was pretty terrified, but that's cause I'm a big baby who doesn't play true horror genre games. I don't like it when things touch me unexpectedly, even if I can't feel the touch. Lmao"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,People say don‚Äôt look things up but I think it‚Äôs a better experience if new players understand that the game is about reading text and actually using that knowledge to progress. I bounced off it a couple times as I didn‚Äôt really understand this concept as it‚Äôs so different from modern games using text as lore.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"If you‚Äôre looking for something to ~happen~ other than yknow, >!the sun exploding!<, then you‚Äôre not really going to find much in the game. Progress is made almost entirely through learning. For me, I assumed that the goal was to >!stop the sun from exploding and save my planet!<"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"There is no right place to go first. Every location only holds part of the answer, and is usually connected to multiple other locations. 

There is a log on the ship that keeps track of the things you come across and can help make sense of clues and point in a general direction to find connected clues, I'd be sure to check that if you aren't sure where to go next.

Definitely a game that feeds curiosity and exploration rather than rewarding any specific path."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"The game is built well enough that pretty much everywhere you can go is somewhere you should go.

Several people in the starter village explicitly tell you next steps, and each of those steps tell you pretty explicitly where to go next, so if you want a more linear ""intended"" experience you could always just do what the game tells you to.

But it's not a ""puzzle"" game, it's an exploration game. To the extent there are puzzles they are pretty much all access puzzles based on learning about and understanding the environment you're in well enough."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,I never figured anything out on my own. That game was really cool but it was not for me
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"It feels like I have been waiting for the game to come out on 1.0 for years.  I dont play early access games so I have been waiting for Valheim, Satisfactory, and Dyson Sphere Program to come out for so long."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"> it rewards exploration/experimentation

Now that's gotta be worth a moon"

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Feel free to vent if needed. I‚Äôm digging myself out of a year long hole right now and I‚Äôm almost out. I‚Äôve got plenty of insight
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"What you are asking for has nothing to do with depression imo. It's an obvious see. Some games are giving away way too much, others don't give any and I bet like everything else in life there is a sweet spot if hit the majority would agree, that was done right!

The best I hope for is menu options in both directions. You aren't depressed, you know what you want.

I do not like having to alt-tab and do a google search, to me that is design. There's got to be a better way."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-11,Oh it‚Äôs in the European psn at least (the PS5 deluxe version)
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-11,Damn see shit like that blows my mind. I can‚Äôt believe I figured out to put the mask on to get into Ethel‚Äôs basement even. But it was a waste of time because the last hotfix broke the damn wand so I couldn‚Äôt even rez what‚Äôs her name‚Äôs husband anyway. I saved the wand though hoping that the next fix I can go back and rez him before I get too much further in the game.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"And for all that eagle eye vision, you'd think he'd give us some winning lotto numbers, but nope, just unsolicited puzzle solutions. I guess we're all just here to admire Kratos' stony expression up close."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,I know just enough Spanish that doing that would melt my brain lol. But maybe Russian
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,I didn‚Äôt notice the first one as much. But I didn‚Äôt make it far in number two before I gave up. I was hoping they‚Äôd patch it but I guess that might not be possible
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-11,The sites of grace point where to go....
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-11,"They recently added a ""Custom"" game mode option where you can pick/choose the game options, some of which are hide NPC health amounts and ""do not show failed checks"" and whatnot."

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Yup! And honestly, it's not about pulling one over on the players. DnD is a collaborative storytelling game. If the players aren't at least occasionally in control, then the DM might as well just write their fanfic and assign it as homework. It should be about having fun."

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I came to say this because it's one of my favorite things about BG3. Even if you fail the check you can usually still interact with it somehow if you look hard for the lever/switch/button. Even if you fail a survival check for buried treasure, you can usually dig randomly with the shovel until you find it."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I think you can fail to get the luminous armor if you fail a check. But you also got through a DC 20 lock, so I assume your Rogue will see it usually."

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Yeah, I got stuck at the Ritual Spot at first because I didn't notice an open door and focused way too much on changing the scene lol.

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I thought it was teaching you how to stealth past enemies by using crouching and line of site... At least that's what I learned while going through the entire area (including the boss room) before going the one way that provides an exit

Certainly shaped my playthrough tho"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I don't think you can teleport from there. I think it's disabled. There's a few places like that, for example when you get eaten by the spinning blade guy that sends you to that lava/volcano place (it's been very long since I played so I don't remember things well), you also can't teleport from there.

I think you gotta find one site of grace first."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"What unlocked the lore enjoyment for me was finding a podcast that covered it area by area. I‚Äôd play through an area each week then listen to the few hours long podcast on weekend trips to gather the loose ends, and repeat."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-11,"Yup, same. But to be fair fromsoft did made sure player would come back there because it's the only place u can upgrade weapon to lvl 3 early game. I just didnt bother and just plow through the game so i missed it."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Yeah that one really frustrated me, idk how many people got through that without looking anything up. The game teaches you that if you talk to someone repeatedly and they start repeating themselves you can stop bothering them because they have nothing else to say... Except this one time teehee good luck"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Eh, I still don't find it satisfying in that regard. It worked well in the Souls series cause there were limits to where you could go. But in ER it's so easy to go off the beaten path and now someone is placed fairly randomly on a ginormous map that you can very easily miss."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I never actually got to finish Outer Wilds. I played for quite a while and was nearing the ending (I think) when I decided to get distracted doing weird things. 

I tried to chase the object that gets ejected from the solar system at the start of the game, I successfully landed on the sun (after *a lot* of attempts), I did a bunch of experiments with time and witnessing changes in odd locations as the game progressed. I got lost those aspects. Then my PS+ subscription ran out and I'm too poor to fit it back into my budget."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-11,"Pretty sure that's what most players assume. I mean, that's the Big Event happening. And then you most likely slowly find puzzle pieces about >!what the nomai were doing!< and that reinforces it.

Well... Unless >!you find out the ""let's blow up the sun"" plan didn't in fact blow up the sun, early on.!<

But man. Getting to the >!sun station!< the first time and seeing what's there... I got chills."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Sadly, I'm with you. My friend recommended it to me, and he is, how do I put this, very very picky. I've never seen him gush about *any* game (or really anything at all for that matter), and he did about this one.

I couldn't get into it, I really tried. I liked the exploring aspects of it but I hated the controls. I got a little more familiar with them, but I never got to the point where the controls weren't an obstacle to my enjoyment of the rest of the game.

I'm kinda sad because everyone seems to love this game, some people say it's their favorite game they've ever played, and for me, it's some of the least fun I've had with a game in a while. I wish I could like it but it's not for me."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"As somebody 1,000+ hours in Dyson Sphere Program, it's more than playable. Just give it a shot."

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Thanks for the kind offer. I've done my venting already though. Including to professional help. Ive had bouts of depression before. It's just that this is normally around the time where things pick up a bit. And it's just getting worse somehow.

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-11,"That's when a good DM lets the annoying player find ""signs of troglodytes"" on one of their failed roles that are actually nothing and the character just messed up his tracking skills."

1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"If you don't mind, could you elaborate on this process a bit more? I just started a new game and I want to it to be primarily focused on lore. So for me: I would explore that entire first area, look at all the weapons, armor and items I find to piece together some lore; And then after I move on from that area I listen to the podcast?

Is that what you did?"
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Maybe you're getting older and games aren't going to scratch the same itch that they did when you were younger.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Is it seasonal? I get on anti depressants for the dark months and that works for me.
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Took me a while for my gamer brain to understand this. One chest I wasn't able to lockpick and I was irked and thought ""why can't I just bust it open""... then I tried it and it actually worked. 

Same with the one entrance to the underdark from the goblin camp. There's a big closed gate down there and I spent like 10 minutes trying to figure out how to get around it, looking for a hidden key or something. Jumped down around it and took like 9 damage instead of just smacking the gate twice with Karlach. Now I pretty much brute force every door and chest that is locked."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"ok, you're right, i was being a little too spicy. in act 1 it probably just seems strange, maybe somewhat *off* to some folks. but i've talked to it in act 3, and ever since then >!when it showed me what it is and wants to do!<, i kill that MF the second i free the refugees."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"Its a decent amount when you hit that chest pretty early in the game.  Not a ton of runes, but still enough to hurt especially if its your first time playing."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-11,Pocket change
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,"I played through areas conscientiously, poking into corners trying to make sure I didn‚Äôt just ignore a hallway or nooks in favor of running from one enemy to the next as critical path. I didn‚Äôt necessarily read every item description though. 

I was in a long distance relationship and had ~10 hours of driving most weekends so I would listen to the 2-3 hour podcast episode for the area(s) that I beat that week and on the podcast they would make notes about the items found in the area, what the implications were (say you find a certain NPC‚Äôs item locked in a chest in an area they‚Äôre never seen in, that suggests they were there for some reason), speculate, etc."
1939z2n,2024-01-10,2024-01-10,Ugh.. but why? So I'm just done enjoying things?

1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,People complaining you gotta make a psn account to play on pc? Everybody does that shit ea does Ubisoft does it and are way more annoying
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,"It blows my mind that people get so butthurt now that SONY is having you log in when other companies and platforms have literally been doing this for YEARS. Every. God. Damn. Time. I try to play battlefield I have to change my EA password to an account I had to have to play. Which means I have to go check my email and click the link, which is buggy most of the time, and change the password before I can start playing. Same goes for Minecraft ON PLAYSTATION you have to sign in with your MICROSOFT account. And Jesus Christ don‚Äôt even get me started on how goddamn annoying and buggy it is trying to sign in every time. And there are so many other games that have this, it is not new."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,Its also just a mediocre game like the reboot was.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"It's suffering for not being on steam on launch. Your game isn't going to get big sales if you don't launch on steam. So your game isn't going to big on steam.

The psn issue is at no surprise at all."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,doesnt seem like pcgamesn did... any research???
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,Then just make an account or use a vpn.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"Its the straight fact of i watched a streamer spend 15 minutes making a Psn account to play the game. 

Its ridiculous to mandate it. And turns people off no matter what."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,I‚Äôm sorry if your country doesn‚Äôt have access to PSN. Maybe take it up with your country?
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,Shocker.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"It's not like Sony ever had many pro consumer stances, but goddamn.

It makes no sense! If you want the expand your player base to pc, why the fuck would you make it obligatory to have a subscription service for console?

Worse still! Why would you alienate millions of possible customers because of it?

IT MAKES NO SENSE!

It really seems that every big company nowadays is full of incompetent people at the top."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,a game is game so the game to be reviewed by his quality not other thing since the playstation account does not afflict the game
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"I didn't even know PSN was a compulsion on it...

Yar har har.

This getting downvoted so hard is hilarious. Fuck you shills. Lol. My download finishes in 13 minutes. And I'm gonna seed it harder now."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,[removed]
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,"Oh? Did PSN try to force more PC gamers to get a PSN account?

Personally, nothing will ever entice me to do that."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"Mainly because it's a single-player game. If it's not multiplayer, battle Royale, extraction game pc players aren't gonna be interested."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,"Yea people are reaching, in Helldivers they tried implementing after Launch this is pre launch and you're made aware the need of psn use, you dont like psn dont buy the game."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,I mean it's not struggling. But it hit less than half the peak playercount of the GoW 2018 pc port launch. I imagine it's underperforming expectations.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,Is it shock or anger? I think people are just making their voices known tbh.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,"It's a shitty practice either way, but what's even worse is doing it retroactively like when EA decided to make their software a requirement to play Mass Effect Legendary Edition long after its initial release."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,I think part of the problem is that Sony said the PSN stuff was so they could have anti-cheat stuff for multiplayer so the excuse makes no sense on a single player game.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,Because it's a stupid requirement regardless.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,The problem is that a lot of countries don't have regions to create a PSN account and thus steam does not sell the game in those regions. Heck I live in EU and we use euros and I can't buy the game as the game is not aviable in my region.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,Because if I saw someone get injured high-fiving an electric fence. I would still be surprised to watch them do it two more times in succession
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,"> every game in recent history has it

Thousands of games actually don't."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"Also, years ago, people were begging for PS games on PC, now that they're, they're complaining about free accounts, like c'mon...

I mean it's an issue for countries that can't create it, but for others, can't really complain"
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,PSN requirement is a good excuse PC gamers will use but look at where steam is big.. none of those countries.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,[deleted]
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,My region does not exist when creating a PSN account. Steams says that the game is not aviable in my region. And thus I can't buy it.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"It's definitely required to link your account beforehand on Steam Deck and Linux otherwise you get a black screen. I think maybe for the users that have it working, they already had it linked before via some previous Sony title."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,"Yeah thanks to Sony's region locking, I am able to shamelessly play the game for free!"
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,The game is region locked. You can't even buy or gift it because of this crap.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,I mean it literally says it's required on the Steam page
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,You cant buy the game if you arent in a psn supported country so it doesnt matter if you dont have to
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"First game sold 4 million copies on Steam and has positive reviews, so yes, it is the PSN requirement."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,I just figured I would give them some time to do a patch or two and maybe see it go on sale a bit before I buy it. Needing a PSN account for some features doesn't bother me and doesn't factor in at all in me waiting. I can understand why people from some countries that can't get a PSN account could be upset.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"I think there is a greater plan here, we just haven‚Äôt seen it unfold yet. 

My bet is that they are going to try to get everyone used to PS sign-in, having an account, having multiple games in the account. Then they will try to create a payment mandate for online multiplayer like they do with PS. 

They are certainly aware that this login is costing them, so the only way I can see that making sense is if their projected numbers are showing that cost being outweighed somewhere down the line"
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,"Wow, if it was just that easy. Not all countries have PSN which is the issue."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,"Spider-Man, Miles Morales, Horizon Zero Dawn and a bunch of others did not have PSN requirements.

Now what?"
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,Delayed access? That‚Äôs the most disingenuous way to describe the PC release that I have ever seen.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,Its just an account? You make it sound like just making a PSN account requires some crazy subscription lmao. And greed? If you don‚Äôt like it you don‚Äôt like but what is with the weird hyperbole about making a stupid account?
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"Yup, GOW launched at 49.99


Heck even the new FFXVI PC port is for 49.99

So why is an older game like GOW Ragnarok for 59.99?"
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"No, people dont want yet another sign in for a single player game.  There is no reason for it."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,Name one reason for the existence/enforcement of those extra accounts.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,I'm not complaining. Sony is willingly giving out free games! First Ghost of Tsushima and now God of War Ragnarok that I can download for free and Sony has no right to complain?! Count me in!
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,Imagine only buying games because of hype instead of fun
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,I don‚Äôt think other people making bad decisions justifies them

1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,What are you talking about? You don‚Äôt need to subscribe to anything.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"It speaks volumes when out of all the giant game companies, Valve seems to be the best, not because of some special treatment or policies they give to gamers. They just do the basics, and treat their customers fairly. 

But apparently that's too hard for everyone else. Valve wins by doing nothing, because everyone is too busy constantly shooting themselves in the foot."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,Sony is in full greed mode. Xbox left them with no competition and they always do this shit when they get the chance.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,[deleted]
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,Gamers just like to cry about things
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"Then they are doing it wrong, because buying the game to post a negative review defeats the whole point."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,[deleted]
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"The reaction is surprisingly overblown. I'd be annoyed to have to create more accounts on top of the gazillion ones I already have but that's it, annoyed. It may get me grumpy for a few minutes and I move on.

Luckily I already made PSN account since the blissful days of Ps2."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,[deleted]
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,You can choose another region. Someone elsewhere said they are told to do that by Sony with their PlayStation console.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,I'm very obiviously taking about Sony games.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"The process isn't that simple for every country, even ones where you can create an account. A quote from one U.K. gamer: 

‚ÄúCreating a PSN account was something I knew was necessary in advance and I was prepared to do so, until I was met with the reality of it,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúFor UK residents at least, it requires submitting a mobile phone number to verify your age just to start with, and if that fails (which it did, no texts were ever received) your only recourse is to submit a photograph of your face or a government-issued ID to a third party website. If you're happy with that, go right ahead.‚Äù"
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"There's many countries that can't create a psn account, so it's a big problem, though."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"I think most PC players just aren‚Äôt as used to getting fucked as most PlayStation players. 

So the frogs that are cooked are shrugging but the new ones aren‚Äôt used to the heat yet."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,"Name one good reason for why this crap is required now instead of keeping it optional... you know, like they did it with their earlier PC releases. What's the benefit? Why do they enforce it? What's the benefit?"
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,"You don't need to pay to create a PSN account and there is no need to pay to use online content like in consoles. However, the PSN is blocked in several countriee, so many people are unable to play those games."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,"In the words of Gaben, you seem to have a distribution problem."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,"Have you considered moving? 



/s"
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,Not possibly for Linux since each game uses it's own Windows root partition. It's more likely the difference is something like custom Proton vs Valve Proton
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"I'm not saying you're wrong, but I feel like your statement jumps from A to Z without looking at the rest of the alphabet in between.

There's lots of reasons GoW may have sold 4 million but Ragnarok did not. From people didn't like GoW - or found that it wasn't their cup of tea despite all the reviews of it being a relaunch for the franchise that was really good. To people liked it so much they grabbed a PS5 at launch for the sequel.

Putting it down to the PSN requirement needs a lot more explanation than just ""the earlier game in the franchise moved more units."""
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,Its really not the PSN requirement which big market is it banned in? those 180 countries barely buy games or even use steam.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"Not really, for me I just lost interest. Been too long.

I have other things to play so it can join my 2+ year backlog."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,The first game has a longer wait between when it was released on PlayStation to when it was released in pc. I know of a lot of people who bought it again on pc because it ran and looked better than on the ps4. Ragnarok had a 2 year wait and the graphical improvements are nice but not show stoppers.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,4mil in what time? If the second just came out it's hard to compare it like that. Anyway my point was that there have been games that need extra accounts since the dawn of time and they haven't been struggling.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"It's so they can data mine more players.  Now you can tie that user to other things and know who bought your game.  Also, it gives them more control over offering you a ""license""."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,I‚Äôll never get scammed by these Playstation/Xbox/Nintendo online subscriptions. From my perspective I feel it is like if Steam started selling the ability to play games online. Like what
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-11-14,I think we‚Äôll see a sony game launcher soon
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,Those countries are not relevant.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"Don't you know that we could have played last year by just running the PS5 version on PC!  It would have worked perfectly with absolutely zero work from the devs, that guy on Reddit said so!"
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"PSN is not aviable in 121 countries. Thus the game is not sold in 121 countries. God of war (1) does not require PSN account and thus is aviable to buy in those regions. Heck, I'm in EU and we use euros and we don't have a PSN region and thus I can't buy god of war ragnarok.

This is my ""gripe"" with the need of PSN account."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"It's for data mining.  Why would you need an account for a PURELY SINGLE PLAYER GAME.  If only I could go up to my sega and snes and pop in my game only to be screwed when I have to log into my game account.  

Its dumb that companies feel this is the way."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,Old? It came out less than 2 years ago lol.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"Yeah, I misspoke.

I meant that you need to have the Psn account."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,SO TRUE!
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"So true.  

I remember when Xbox launched games live... Damn, as a ps player for most of my life I was really jealous."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,Probably a very high percentage judging by the generic replies I often see.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-26,Lol they‚Äôre crying about this callout
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"Exactly. It's like when people were buying Nike's and then burining them in protest. lol They already have your money, you fools."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"No? You can buy the game, play it to its fullest, and still post a negative review because of the requirement."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"Agreed, buying the game to put a review still doesn't change the fact they spent money on it. Might as well pirate the game if you want to play it."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,I mean if they refund it immediately after posting the review it doesn't cost em anything.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"Eh, I think there's different forms of protest tbh. This is more akin to a peaceful protest. Besides, like you said, you can't even post a review on Steam without buying the game, but Steam reviews are some of the most visible reviews because it's right on the store front. It's like picketing and making your voice known right in front of potential customers, so I say its valid.

Regardless, I think people should be free to voice their opinions."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,Are they not? I thought GTA V was getting some flak for the recent anti-cheat changes that break it on Steam Deck. People are also bashing Microsoft for how they're handling Xbox at the moment and their dev studios.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,People do that.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,They were already pretty mad at that to begin with
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"Because we made, and these games on my PC don't require internet connection, credentials, launcher or any other nonsense. ü§∑ I treat it as great success."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"It isn't just creating the account that's the issue though. Some people are region-locked out of PSN but not Steam. They were able to play the first game but not the second.

For Steam Deck users, the PSN requirement causes issues like black screens if your Sony account isn't already pre-linked. On Linux, the PSN SDK straight up refuses to run. They have to make their system pretend to be a Steam Deck in order to get it to launch, but then mouse look is explicitly disabled when that option is enabled.

There's also reports from people who say that PSN accounts require a lot of personal info in some areas, all the way down to IDs. That's annoying for people who just want to play a single player game. You may be lax about your privacy but for others it's very important.

I think it is fine if you feel like the PSN requirement doesn't affect you, consider yourself lucky, but others legitimately have issues with it."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,PS5 consoles are being sold in my country and the sellers are telling people to choose whatever region. Which is kinda breaking the ToS and thus you might endanger your account. Some people don't want to risk it (or are honest and want to select their region).
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"You still can't buy the game, because Sony will not sell the game in the region you are in, which is determined by Steam. Also something to keep in mind is that it's still against ToS and should Sony chose to enforce that rule at any point, whatever was said by a support staff member will be irrelevant, they will just say the support staff member gave you wrong information.

So you are basically trusting a corporation (I am kind of shocked people do that considering how anti-corporation everyone seems to be these days) that they won't just yoink your purchases out from under you."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,Steam still says that the game is not aviable in my region and thus will not sell it to me.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,"I got Spider-Man. Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West in my Steam library. 

I could play them just fine without a PSN account."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"No, account linkage is via Sony servers, not via a file in a Proton prefix. Proton has nothing to do with it."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,Then consider the negative reviews. Nearly all of them are about this issue.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"Right so thats YOUR reason. Other are because of the require account. Like not everyone has the same opinion as you, you are not a main character."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,*Spider-Man: Miles Morales* also had a 2 year gap and still sold well and has a positive rating.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,God of War never sold in 4 mil on pc
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"Yeah, but the PSN is also not available in 121 countries, so lots of people are just not able to play those games. And some of the players who can buy it give a negative score out of protest."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"Yeah, but the PSN is also not available in 121 countries, so lots of people are just not able to play those games. And some of the players who can buy it give a negative score out of protest."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"I think people vastly overestimate how much your data is worth. 

I dont see them making up even a marginal loss in revenue with the tiny amount of data they are able to mine from this."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,You‚Äôre one of the few. We probably got over 100M people right now getting scammed every month
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,"You‚Äôre one of those ‚Äúif it‚Äôs not happening to me, it doesn‚Äôt matter‚Äù type, huh?"
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,Maybe you have a problem with countries who don‚Äôt allow PSN?
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,*older
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,and the ‚Äúprotest‚Äù is just free advertising for the corporation lol. saved them hundreds of thousands at least. fucking hilarious
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"And? Why does Sony give a shit? They already got your money and if the requirement was enough to make you post a negative review you never should've bought the game in the first place. I think the PSN requirement is bullshit too, and that's exactly why I'm not buying anything from Sony that has it. If people want to see change they should do the same thing or shut the fuck up."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"That sort of review bombing gets removed from the overall score by default, so the protest achieved nothing."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,Most companies won't care about negative reviews as long as they keep getting money. Byuing the game  to complain about it defeats the purpose. The Helldivers 2 thing was kind of successful because Steam started refunding and it was hurting Sony's wallet.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"It's more like walking past a union strike pretending to care about what the union cares about, then going in and doing work and getting paid."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,ah true the region lock thing. Totally forgot about that.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,There have been people doing this since ps3 days. You aren‚Äôt going to get banned. Hell I often select Japan on a burner account to download demos and stuff that never come here
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,"So then you just don‚Äôt buy the game and move on, what‚Äôs the problem? Torrent it and play for free, find another game, it‚Äôs just a mediocre action game."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,Cool. Do try to play *Helldivers 2* or *Ghost of Tsushima* without one. See if the page store *LEGO Horizon Adventures* doesn't already say you need PSN.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"Oh, I see what you're saying. It's a 1:1 link, not per game login. My bad for assuming then!"
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"See, that's a *much* better argument for your claim.

The counter to which could be ""People who weren't going to buy the game anyhow taking the opportunity to crap on Sony."" However, combine it with your first fact (4 million people bought GoW, much less buying Ragnarok on PC, half the reviews say it's due to the PSN issue) and you have a solid argument.

Thanks for the extra factors!"
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"one person gives their own perspective on the topic and they're now ""the main character""?"
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,Also a ps4 game with a wider fan base than god of war. I rebought it on steam because I had gotten it on ps4 and wanted the upgrade.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"I never said they were selling your data.  I said they want to track their customers closely.  More about control.

Edit: example:  while this game is single player, multiplayer games can be changed to use playstation network, if needed.

More examples: microtransactions that avoid steam"
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,I mean everyone should add access but people here think those 180 countries made up a big % of overall steam users or sales when it didnt.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,Is it the country that doesn not allow PSN or the PSN does not deem those countries worthy?
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"I have not bought the game, but I can understand someone who does not like the account requirement enough to leave a negative review, but not completely enough to boycott the game. Also it could be people with post-purchase problems, I have left a negative review before because I could not continue playing a game 20-hours deep because of stupid launcher stuff.

I also think that you are underrating reviews. Sony would absolutely not want a negative or even a mixed review score on Steam, even if you think ""steam reviews are worthless because it does not give you info about a game"", reality is that reception is important for the long-term well being of the studio."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"Huh so it does. Go figure. TIL, thanks.

Pivoting then, maybe it's like HD2 wherein the players that can actually buy/play the game are reviewing on behalf of the players that can't? If they're buying and playing the game anyways it doesnt cost them anything further to leave a negative review on behalf of players that cant get the game due to PSN."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,"Companies HATE bad reviews, it DOES hurt business.

Anything on steam 'Mixed' I don't even bother to look further, along with a lot of other folks.

But keeping eating at those 'Needs Improvement' scored restaurants."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"Negative press and reviews do work. Many Helldivers players who wouldn't have been affected by the PSN requirement still refunded because they heard the news. Both are valid. You need the action and the call to action.

Also, many of my friends actually refuse to buy or second guess their gaming purchases when they see Mixed reviews on Steam. So negative reviews actually does prevent future purchases, which also affect the bottom line."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"Thing is, steam says that the game is not aviable in the region (I imagine to avoid people complaining or even a potential lawsuit of selling a game that a person can't legally play, because it require a third party account that they can't legally create due to the region not aviable), so even if I could make a PSN account by selecting a different region - I would still not be able to play it (maybe if I would use VPS on steam and purchase it from a different region).

So there is no logal way to get the game on PC. And then they might wonder why people pirate..."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-22,I am interested in the game and would like to have a legal way to play it.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,"Helldivers 2 doesn't require one. And your argument is... what exactly?

There is no need for those stupid third party accounts. So why are they a thing?"
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"PSN is not aviable in 121 countries. Thus the game is not sold in 121 countries. Thus there are less people buying it. God of war (1) does not require PSN account and thus is aviable to buy in those regions. Heck, I'm in EU and we use euros and we don't have a PSN region and thus I can't buy god of war ragnarok."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"What are you even talking about? 

You can only post a review if you bought the game, if you post the review and then give thr game back your review is removed from the aggregated score.
The people reviewing this game are the prople buying it.
Also, 4 million is the all time sales, *Ragnarok* just released and sales figures aren't up yet. You cannot even argue that the sales are bad.

I only mentioned sales figures because the person I replied originally brought it up. Kindly do not hop on conversations when you don't know what is about."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,That's not what he's saying at all. He's saying one person's opinion is extremely insubstantial and doesn't provide the full picture.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,That‚Äôs what I meant too. You can monetize data without selling it. But that data still has an internal value that can be quantified
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,"Some of the people complaining here **are** affected. It is relevant to *us*. That‚Äôs why ‚ÄúMake a PSN account‚Äù doesn‚Äôt work for everyone.

I was lucky enough to buy Helldivers 2 before the PSN fiasco. After that they took off Helldivers 2 from our country‚Äôs steam page and my brother can‚Äôt buy the game anymore on PC. So we can‚Äôt play together because you need a fucking PSN account to play a PC game."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,Typically it‚Äôs because of unregulated policies surrounding online storefronts.
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"Okay, but negative reviews mean nothing to corps once they have your money. Why should they care how angry or upset you are if you're still paying? You should probably remember that Sony didn't budge on HD2 until people started refunding."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,"Yes, it does. They backtracked on enforcing the login for people that already bought the game, but it is currently delisted in several the countries that PSN doesn't support.

My point, which you missed because you don't know anything about the subject yet wants to opinate, is ""everyone knows the account is stupid, but Sony is insistent on it so why are people acting surprised?"""
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,Absolutely
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,"Can'tspeak for anyone else, but I neversaid they do. Only that it costs customers nothing further to review about it."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,"I don't know anything about the subject? What? Why are you like this?

All those third party accounts are annoying and pointless. People don't like them."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,"Yeah, and I am not disputing that, which is why you are clueless."
1flhvzm,2024-09-20,2024-09-21,"How am I clueless?

What's there to know?"
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"You're definitely not the only one. I think it's super annoying and I don't understand why it's not optional for people who want it. Either something to turn on in the menus, or just let you talk to the companion if you want a hint like a lot of old adventure games did. Do I want Sully to tell me how to solve this? Let me walk over and interact with him (or give me a button to call him on the radio.) I don't see why that would lower accessibility at all.

But the developers must have some stats that show that if a puzzle isn't spoiled within 30 seconds a bunch of people will turn off the game and never buy the next one. I just don't know who these people are."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"Easy solution is to just add a separate difficulty slider for puzzles.

Shadow of the Tomb Raider has something like this where you can go into the settings and change what difficulty you want for puzzles. This option only affects puzzles, not the combat or anything else. At the easiest setting, Lara will give you clues on what to do next. Relevant puzzle items are marked when you use survival instincts. And anytime the puzzle has timed mechanics, you get more time to react. Meanwhile, on the hardest setting, you get nothing, you just have to figure it out for yourself.

As someone who doesn't really like the puzzles in games, it's nice to be able to make them easier. But likewise, for those who like puzzles and want a challenge, they can make them challenging. It's a win for both sides. And it‚Äôs nice that it only affects the puzzles and not the other part of the game‚Äôs difficulty. So I can have puzzles on easy difficulty for example, but I can have hard combat difficulty at the same time. You can choose how difficult or easy different parts of the game are."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"Yes, a lot of more serious gamers hate it.

However, I've watched enough develop commentary about making games to also understand that the average player is so incompetent, that they will never figure out these puzzles and will literally stop playing.

Like I've heard devs talk about stuff like one playtester who spent an hour running around in an area unable to progress, because they never even considered that the ladder that lead to the next area was interactable.

So afterwards the devs had to highlight the ladder better, and throw some colour markers so the player would understand what they had to do. Now imagine an actual puzzle and not a simple fucking ladder. 

It sucks, but it's unavoidable for most major games that want to appeal to a large audience. Gone are the days where people would buy a game and then play it to completion no matter what, no matter how long it took and how frustrating it was. 

These days, half the players will drop the game on a dime and refund that shit immediately."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,Horizon Forbidden West did this shit constantly. they don‚Äôt even give you time to figure things out she just blurts out answers instantly
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,Ragnarok was so bad for that. I felt like I had at most 60 seconds to solve a puzzle before the solution was fed to me. Really irritating.
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"Wait til you play *Horizon: Forbidden West* \- the hand holding is so strong that Aloy often tells you how to solve a puzzle *before you've even looked at it*.  I wish I was exaggerating, but I'm really not."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"I write gaming guides for a living and keep up with frequently searched questions and topics posted for tons of new releases. The simplest things catch people out and are searched for daily. Right now, the second most searched Fortnite question is how to get to a location that is marked on the map in massive letters

I know an editor whose site had ""How to jump in *x game""* as their top guide for the week (it was a button press)

Obvious hints are so prevalent now because developers have realized the average person (non-gamer) has far less intuition than you'd think. Hand a controller to anyone who doesn't regularly play games, and you'll start to see they pick up on almost nothing that we would

Hogwarts Legacy was a really good example. Appealed to a ton of people who don't typically play games, and searches were flooded with really simple questions. I legit saw someone asking how to press the right control stick on here yesterday. Resulted in some of the best traffic the site I worked for at the time had ever seen.

So the reason it's so hand-holdy by default is to retain the attention of the average person for as long as possible. Having a toggle, like you mentioned, is definitely the best solution"
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"I really liked how 'Moss' did this, it's a cute little VR puzzler/platformer. If you struggle, the character will subtly turn and look at relevant pieces, sometimes silently point at them or gesture to give you a hint. But won't ever speak. So it looks like they're trying to work out the same puzzle and just doing hand gestures as they think. It's very subtle, but it helps if you're stuck."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"Yup, and in contrast just yesterday I was playing Uncharted Lost Legacy, when doing a puzzle with some statues and shadows, my companion asked me if I was lost, and the prompt to ask her for help appeared over her head, but she didn't spoil the answer, just gave me the option to.

That's how it should be in every game with occasional puzzles , let the player decide and think for themselves, let them choose if they want the help or not."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"I don't mind it in theory but I do hate the speed at which these hints start showing up as well as the frequency. It's like... OK, you put me in this challenge and then immediately starting explaining it to me. Give me a minute at least - or even better yet do some kind of count on my actions and start providing hints based off of that. Like if a puzzle requires 10 interactions minimum and an average of 15 then start giving hints out after I've interacted 16 times.

The other thing that drives me crazy is when it does this in games where exploration is an intended part of the experience. It's like... you put me in a rom with a puzzle and three side areas to explore that have pickups. When I complete the puzzle the game is going to automatically transition me away from this area. This is the only time I'm able to explore those side rooms but you are actively discouraging me from doing so by having the NPCs comment on my apparent mental impairments to hurry me along."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"If you‚Äôre really wanting a good puzzle game that doesn‚Äôt really hold your hand, I highly reccomend playing the Silent Hill 2 remake. The puzzles in that is unlike any game I‚Äôve played, both in the OG over 25 years ago and in the remake. One of my favorites is the noose puzzle. There‚Äôs a difficulty option for the puzzles and they radically change inbetween normal and hard difficulty"
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"You have to remember that the players that come to reddit and other places are not the average gamer. A lot of gamers out there are going to get frustrated at puzzles and may quit, which through playtests is wbat devs found out and is why these hints exist. But, the devs should also program in ways to turn them off or limit how often you see them for players that don't want or need them."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,Tears of the Kingdom changes the music and turns it down slightly so you can think more.

1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"Replaying Okami a few years back gave me this frustration. I had forgotten just how much your sidekick never shuts the fuck up when presented with puzzles (and in general). Still a good game, but good lord a lot of the dialogue could've been trimmed down."

I'm okay with puzzles having less handholding in the side content, like the Batman Arkham games. Main story/campaign? I'm not here to waste time with overly long puzzles."

That said, I can absolutely understand and empathize with this viewpoint. If you're someone that really enjoys that sort of thing, this would probably be endlessly frustrating. There really should be some sort of toggle for the folks that enjoy this stuff. It's a real shame."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-16,"Escape room games solve this by usually having a hint button. GOW could easily have the kid or the all knowing head Kratos carries go ""ah I think I've worked it out"" after 20 seconds and then you interact with them for them to supply their helpful dialogue."

I didn't even get a chance to do shit lol. I'll get to a point where I might actually need to think for a second, then your companion is like ""hey, maybe do this"" pointing where I need to go. And the markings on the path, combined with the invisible walls on ledges and shit lol. Like what?¬†


At least make that crap optional.


What also boggles my mind is auto aiming. I get it for those who can't aim well for accessibility options. But it's been turned on by default, and it's in pvp games.¬†"

1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"Hahaha I have complained so much about it recently. Genshin had some good puzzles for one region a few years ago, but after that puzzles just stopped. People kept complaining they were too hard. I miss having that challenge. It sucks because there's so many avenues you can take with them if you don't know, brute force it or look it up; but instead let's get them removed entirely. We just had a minigame in our flagship event this patch that was like a little 'find 5-8 things wrong in this area'. If you took, idk 20-30 seconds between finding one and finding the next- it would highlight it to you. At least companions you can mute your game. I can't give a glowing yellow beacon. 

I remembered reading someone saying the reason for that is because they could provide hints toggleable; but then people will be too prideful or feel bad they needed a hint (also why some people won't look it up when they're stuck)- and at the end of the day companies have to cater downward to reach a bigger audience."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"I'm sure I saw/read an interview with one of the developers from God Of War who said during play testing, the testers would give up trying to solve puzzles after a few seconds so they had to keep adding more and more hints until it was basically solving it for you."

1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"i think using companion characters, or even the main character thinking out loud, to give the player hints if stuck is a great way to handle it.

\*However\* it needs to be something the player prompts with a key OR at the least you need to be able to customize frequency and be able to turn it off altogether.

They certainly shouldn't do it immediately.

  
I am still perplexed by the bell puzzle in Plague Tale: Requiem where they explicitly give the answer immediately. I assumed it was a mechanic tutorial but no, it never uses that puzzle again."

Its the worst at that"
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"It should be a slider that affects how often they give you hints much like a difficulty slider. From ""Never"" to ""Solve it for me"". There were some puzzles where I was being backseated by the NPCs before I'd even touched the damn thing or finished walking into the room.

I get it though. I watch a lot of twitch and the number of times I've seen seemingly intelligent people brought to their knees by a child's puzzle is too damn high."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"Unfortunately, it's probably not going to go away in mainstream games, at least not for a while. In the mean time, I suggest looking to other puzzle games, like Tunic or Outer Wilds. The Zelda games also don't do this. 

Would be cool to see a game with multiple difficulty settings though, one for combat and one for puzzles. The easy puzzle setting can have companions that tell you what's going on and highlighted sections on the easiest, one or the other for medium settings, and none for hard."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"I despise how we've gone from ""if you can't figure it out, time to open a strategy guide"" to ... ""here's how to solve it, you don't need time to work it out yourself""."

It's not like before where you have to look at magazines when you're stuck."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-16,"So I have some special thoughts on this...

I play TTRPGs, I have been GMing games like DnD and the like for about 27 years now and I can offer some special insight I've gained:

Some people are ABSOLUTELY INCAPABLE of doing puzzles. Like its an actual thing. They can roleplay, and do combat, and retain knowledge, but throw them a puzzle and their brain shuts off. They can't seem to look at it objectively, think outside the box etc. They won't even TRY things. Their frustration mounts and they simply shut down and give up.

So while I have the same complaint as you when I encounter the baby-level puzzles in video games, I completely understand it. If you stick a puzzle in a game mostly aimed at twitchy numbskulls, you have to cater to the lowest common denominator.

When I want games with good puzzles, I go for ones specifically catered to that. Games like Myst, Riven, The Room, Talos Principle, or the oldschool point and click adventures like monkey island etc."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-16,"You should play Immortals Fenyx Rising and one of the DLCs, which was mostly just puzzles."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-16,"QA testers likely complain that puzzles are too hard, so the devs simplify them. Also many people are really just that dumb. Imo devs should just remove all puzzles if they don‚Äôt want to put effort into them. Just make a nice cutscene or animation for the door opening or something, rather than a mind-numbing hacking ‚Äúpuzzle‚Äù."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-16,"I agree. Recently, I've been playing older games with puzzles and it feels so good when I solve a puzzle that tells me very little. It gets me thinking, gets me using my head. Modern games miss out on that. I think it's partly to do with people not having the patience or attention span to do it themselves, so they just search up the answer."

In monster hunter worlds i sank 50 hrs into it without knowing i could buy potions from an npc because the game never explicity showed me i could. 50hrs of farming and wasting my time when i could have just bought them this whole time.

My friend responded ""would it had helped if he was painted yellow?"" 

I realized having worked for western devs in the past that we tend to focus heavily on accesibilty because frustration is bad, but the east tends to see that as a players lack of curiosity, it seems, and it feels like the game inavertly punishes us for not looking

Without the constant hand holding people would complain and not finish the game because they would be frustrated or lost. But making it as obviouse as possible isnt the solution either because we are made to feel dumb. Its a very tricky balance.

A good tutoial is one you wont notice at all.

Western devs, especialy Aaa publishers want to make the most money out of their product, And capturing the widest audience possible is their main intrest, and that comes the need for accesibility."

I think people say Alan wake 2 had a really nice puzzle to solve and it didn't have any hints like this? Then there's also remnant 2 where progress could be locked behind a music puzzle. There's a large flute contraption you have to play a specific melody on to get to the world boss and the notes you have to play are hidden in an old weathered book with little indication the book is showing flute notes and since it's weathered not all the notes are there.

Turns out the majority are willfully and proudly illiterate. Even with text flashing in the middle of the screen in bold there's an alarmingly high chance it'll be ignored.

Audio telling you what to do is merely the latest attempt to make sure everyone can progress. 

I've played a live service game off and on that literally dumbed down puzzles after a certain point because players complained that reading the instructions right next to it was an undue burden.

I'd argue they should go a step further. A skip or auto puzzle option.

That way people who want puzzles actually get it and the rest can progress.

Won't happen though. Why take dev time on something that caters to a shrinking minority?"

While breaking it up is good for pacing, what‚Äôs much worse is taking a break for too long. So they want to make sure you solve the puzzle quickly and move on. 

Could they design the puzzles better? Yes, but then they‚Äôd be spending time on the puzzles that don‚Äôt matter instead of the action gameplay that you‚Äôre actually here to engage with. As action game designers, they‚Äôll take option B!"

I felt stupid not because I was stupid but because I was used to handholding level designs ""If its not obvious, then its not the right way"". I was there and played through when it released 2002.

There is the ""empirical"" evidence that you gather with tools, then the ""softer"" evidence by way of the ghost's actual behavior/actions.

I've spent ~30 minutes chasing a ghost down only to realize the game was giving me clues and info that I just didn't notice. The tools failed me, but instead of giving me a handout the game just kept signaling until I caught on.

So I guess I'm saying evidence > hints. That said, there are some tools that give you hints (at a steep cost)."

You can ask for a hint sometimes if you are stuck on a puzzle for a while, but 90% of the time it just gives you the most basic possible information that you probably already knew, and still makes you figure it out. I have to say I was really impressed after recently playing through Horizon Forbidden West which has much easier puzzles and also has your character loudly telling you without prompting exactly what to do if you don't figure it out fast enough."

You might think you are good at puzzles but even the most simplistic puzzle can have a group of 5 people arguing for 20 minutes and still not have the answer.

I feel like being stuck for 2 hours only to realize there is a crack in the wall you can climb is a rite of gamer passage. Lol.

A lot of the areas in the game had multiple ways to traverse them, but by default the game would highlight the way it thought you should go in red. It made the movement very fluid and it honestly felt pretty good to play that way, but it had very little replayability. You could turn that off in the settings though, and it made the game way more interesting. It was slower, because you often had to stop on a rooftop and look around to figure out where you had to go next and figure out the best route, but pulling off a great sequence and getting through an area quickly felt great when you did it."

1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"I'm pretty sure all uncharteds and the newer 2 god of war games, there is options to turn of hints in the settings? I'm pretty sure I remember that. I could be wrong. You may have to be playing the game on a harder difficulty. But I'm fairly certain you can turn off hints somehow"
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"Imagine if this was real life? You walk into a strange place, and your friend starts nagging you, 'Try rotating it 90 degrees!"
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,Maybe I'm just a dumb person in general but I hate puzzles in games period. I absolutely loved the feature in 2018 spider man where it just let's you flat out skip the puzzles like every game should have that feature. Puzzles in games just completely halt the pacing and honestly why I dropped God of War. Every 5 minutes was a puzzle you had to complete it just sucks.
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"And it's not only puzzles. It's everything. Say your character has tracking quest. You follow basically a pipe into the woods because leaving the path pops up ""wrong way"" message. That's the first. You see highlighted foot prints in dirt a mile away. You get closer the character talks to themself ""hmmh, looks like there are prints in the mud. I should check them out"". You follow the straight path to a cave entrance that is surrounded by 'thick bushes' that act as a wall so it's basically a dead end only to be greeted with another monolog: ""the tracks lead into that cave, hmmh. Good thing I brought my flashlight"" with pop up message or pause ""press X to turn on the flashlight. Be mindful, it has limited battery usage"" and yet when you turn it on it seems like the drain is so slow it'll last you a century or if it drains fast, it also recharges immediately you turn it off.

Makes me feel like I'm a child but of course the game is ages of 18 and above."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"I may be a part of the problem, but I hate most riddles in games. I hate searching for dumb shit that doesn't do anything, I hate using new mechanics that are only used for this one dumb puzzle, and I especially hate when you have to intuition answers because there isn't enough context clues or the answer was purposefully vague.

If I come up to a riddle and have to squirm around for 30 minutes I'm so trained for it to be a bad puzzle that I'll just google it. Often I am googling puzzles that I could have solved just because I don't want to waste my time. 

There's some good puzzles, but most in gaming are dogshit."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"I particularly love the games where you encounter a puzzle and before you've even worked out there's a puzzle there, let alone what elements are part of the puzzle or how to make them work together, some NPC (or the main character voice over) goes, ""you should put the doodad in the thingummy.""

Great. Now the puzzle is all about locating the doodad, uncovering the thingummy, and combining the two. No exploration, no work on my part, just being spoon-fed on how to play the game.

[edit to add] I see some other folks have noticed it as well and called out HFW as particularly egregious. Yeah, that was the one I was thinking of.

Enter a room, look around, and before I've even got any idea of the layout of the space, I've been given the solution to a puzzle I haven't even discovered yet."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,It completely killed my enjoyment of God of War 2018. I got maybe an hour in and I just couldn't stand being told the answer to everything before I had a moment to too think about it
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"It turned me off from Ragnarok. At some point I went online to see if there was a setting to reduce handholding, and when there wasn't I just didn't go back."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,You can avoid this by avoiding AAA games.

1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"It's annoying. Ragnarok is a good example of that. I barely started to look around to see how this works and the boy just told me the solution. And I'm like, why is this puzzle even there if you just solved it for me before I even got a good look at it. If you must have some kind of help system then make it optional with a button press."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"Mack over on the worth a buy youtube channel rants about it regularly. I usually avoid the games he rants about. The games that are worst about this also seem to very frequently have UIs designed for ADHD toddlers. Yes, I can see that fucking quest icon on the map. You don't have to pop up a NPC yelling at me to come do his quest. You especially don't need to do it every fucking time I pass by that location.


IMHO, you should be able to turn the UI completely off and still be able to play the game. No GPS, no world markers, nothing. Morrowind was like that. Even Skyrim doesn't pass a test for this -- you can do OK up until you're told to find some guy in ""The Reach"", when The Reach is like half the map. You don't get vague directions, you can't ask the NPCs. You just get a name and half the map to search. So you can either turn on GPS and follow the GPS marker right to him, or you can just leave that quest in your quest log for the rest of the game. Which I would be inclined to do if every fucking quest in the game wasn't like that."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"I'm the opposite, I get really annoyed at puzzles in shooters and ARPGs.

The less time doing puzzles the better for me. I literally challenged with complex puzzles and detail oriented matching games at work.

I've done enough thinking for the day, just tell me answer so I can get back to the action.

I play shooters to shoot and arpgs for the action and character building, not for puzzle solving."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"Not a fan for sure.

You do have to realize that most of these games are made for people who want to ""hold forward and press attack button"" until they win though."

1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"The new Indiana Jones game seems to have figured out a neat solution to this problem by giving the player a camera, which amongst other things will give hints when pointed at a puzzle.


The hand holding is very easily accessible for those that want it, but entirely optional if you want to be left to figure things out by yourself."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,It‚Äôs because you‚Äôre playing triple A games that need to pander to the widest audience. If a puzzle‚Äôs too hard they risk making people mad. Look at indie games if you want hard puzzles.
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"I think I saw a clip of an interview of the VA for Kratos' son, and he hates even more because he is hearing himself tell him how to solve the puzzles."

1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"If you haven't played it yet, I recommend the Silent Hill 2 remake! The puzzles were fun while still making me feel like a dumb ass occasionally."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"People are shitting on disabled gamers when you ought to be pissed at the developers for being too cheap to properly code in optional and customizable accessibility options. These games are $70 USD these days for 25 hours of main story content. There is no reason they can‚Äôt spend a little extra time giving us the option to toggle on or off hints, puzzles, QTE, motion controls etc."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"You might enjoy The Talos Principle. There's *technically* a hint mechanic in it, however:

- The hints are 100% optional

- If you want to use a hint you have to explicitly seek it out and solve a different set of puzzles in order to unlock it, making it a challenge in and of itself 

- You can only unlock a maximum of three hints in the entire game (which includes something like a hundred puzzles over all)

- You can't even begin to unlock hints until you're already most of the way through the game

- The hints only work on a specific subset of puzzles

- The hints are honestly only marginally useful for most of the puzzles"
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,Yeah it absolutely kills the gameplay like if you need a hint system make it a menu or something. Having characters just tell you what to do isn‚Äôt playing a video game
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,It's the same with quest markers. I remember when games did not have them and it made exploring so much more fun.
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,I hate puzzles and riddles in action-adventure games so I'm glad that they give me hints or tell me how to solve it otherwise I'd just look up their solutions on YouTube lol
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"When games do that, I usually mute the sound while I'm solving.

Kinda annoying, but easy to do."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"I say this as someone who started ""Loom"" at some point in the mid '90s and just found out last week that to get out of the dragon's cave and continue the game, you need to play the ""turn wool into gold"" spell backwards which causes the big pile of gold to turn to wool, and the sleeping dragon then accidently sets it on fire, flys and flys away revealing a secret exit behind him.

I can understand a certain amount of handholding (but obviously nothing as condescending as you described). I think a good compromise would be for puzzles that you need to complete to progress the game, there should be some mechanism to help you out if you are straggling.  

But there should be other puzzles that open up optional areas/quests/etc where if you can't figure it out it's just though shit, thou shall not pass."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,Currently playing Immortals Fenyx Rising and it's been refreshing to have a game that lets you figure out the puzzles on your own.
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"Hot take but I appreciate this feature. I dont enjoy the puzzles in these games and im likely to look up the solution anyway. The game just telling me saves me the effort.¬†

1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,Stop playing games whose target audience can't beat a game without heavy handholding. Even average triple a games aren't as bad as Sony exclusives or the game for people who live under a rock.
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"I remember turning off Horizon Zero Dawn and not going back for ages because of this. I had dropped into a cool looking cave. I was admiring how cool it looked.

1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"I don't mind when games give a hint button. Then it's your choice. But having a character constantly saying shit to tell you what to do is annoying. I could be looking for collectables or just going through the entire puzzle in my head, clarifying I understand it"

I'd be searching for treasure or trying to hit one of those damned ravens and Atreus or Mimir would go ""look by the bridge, fire might help burn those vines."" I'd hear this before I even considered the puzzle and be frustrated. That said I also remember older games where the puzzles were not logical and there was just nonstop trial and error to resolve things and they was probably more frustrating. Need a happy medium."

1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,I probably wouldn‚Äôt look to those types of games for good encounters with puzzles. The games you listed are mainstream triple an action games meant for a wide audience. Most people I would imagine don‚Äôt play those games for the puzzles so they don‚Äôt want to keep people stuck on puzzle parts they just use them for pacing. Maybe play some indie or puzzle focused games.
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,I've ended up just turning the puzzles off where possible for this exact reason. Usually the puzzles aren't even hard they just take longer than the hint timer. I need a design team once to give the player character a snarky response to a hint.

1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,Mainstream games are never going to stop doing that because they appeal to the lowest common denominator. Play The Witness if you want to play a great game with good puzzles and no handholding.
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"I think people who say this are thinking about ""ye olden days"" where gaming was a niche and ""nerds"" was a successful movie franchise.

If you look at AA/AAA ... or AAAAAA games: they are made for as broad an audience as possible. And unfortunately for you OP that's not the hardcore gaming audience that wants to be challenged. Most people want an experience and many folks need some guidance.

If you want challenging you should look at the indie games or just specific games that tickle your type of fancy. Expecting every single high-end game to NOT cater to a broad audience (yes these hints are an accessibility thing) is setting yourself up for a lot of disappointment.

* Realize that you may be gatekeeping by insisting that the bar should be hire
* Realize that some games simply aren't for you even if you enjoyed the franchise before
* Realize that having more people enjoy and buy games means that there is more choice and there is undoubtedly stuff for you too. You've just fallen in to a bit of niche and now need to act that way in how you approach your game purchasing.

Those are my thoughts on it any way."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"Yeah it feels super overboard in a lot of games.

1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-16,"i feel like theres so much hand holding now cuz the devs knew how confusing older games were especially when you werent even told the objective so now its like theyre over compensating in fear of confusing the player. but yeah its a bit much. they should keep that sort of thing in an easy mode called ""journalist mode"" so that ign actually can figure out how to get past a simple tutorial level. in fact i think journalist mode should have it so that journalist dont even have to play the game, they can just watch as the game plays itself."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-16,You‚Äôre not the only one.

1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-16,"If I'm playing on the hardest difficulty setting the hints should be disabled by default. 

What's worse than puzzle hints for me however is outright hand holding that never ends. I'm 80 hours in, on the hardest setting and expertly navigating the various controls/abilities yet I'm still getting the same 'To use Gun hold L2 and press R1' pop up... why exactly??"
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-16,"Developers think the average gamer is an underdeveloped mouthbreather, and you cannot convince me otherwise. 

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because they grew up with IGN reviews where the reviewer would pretend the game was way too hard when it really wasn‚Äôt. But they think that if you have to sit down and think for even 5 seconds, you‚Äôll just give up.


Maybe they have 0 confidence in themselves and their game and think that you‚Äôll just abandon the game at the very first ‚Äúchallenge‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know, but man, it‚Äôs rough."

1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-16,The thing is that all devs need to do is **to offer a switch to toggle hints on and off**.
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-16,"Runescape has a puzzle from the archaeology skill that I think handled this situation in a balanced manner. 

You have a puzzle in the room to try and unlock a seal on a demon being held prisoner in the middle. Each time you fail and the puzzle resets, the demon offers you a hint that you can take or refuse, sort of like he's learning how it works just like you are. Each time you take the hint, the hint gets more helpful. It goes from the useless ""hey that thing you just tried? It was wrong"" to ""that square goes in the square hole, not the circle hole"", so to speak."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-16,"Legend says that the Ragnarok hand holding was because of people like DarkSydePhil being so insanely incompetant at games or anything which requires a functioning brain. (Even with the yellow paint as well he didn't know where to go.)

Going for the lowest common demeanor or something."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-16,You can thank people like DarkSydePhil who are dumb as dirt and can't get through a game without copious handholding

1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-16,"The biggest issue is that these handholding options are on by default.  I am not a moron and enjoy figuring out puzzles on my own.  If I wanted someone to shout the answer in my ear, I would seek that out myself.  The fact that theres no option to turn them off in a lot of recent games is astounding considering how many other options there are nowadays.  Especially when you are playing on the hardest difficulty and your companions still just tell you how to play the game."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-16,Nope. And it happens increasingly when old games are bought by new owners who want to appeal to the lowest common denominator and remove puzzles and at signs just giving the answer. Looking at you Conan Exiles!

1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-16,What games are you playing where they do that? I've never encountered that ever.
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-16,"I wish more games would embrace the old 3D Zelda hint system. If you rolled up to an area with a puzzle the first thing your fairy companion would do is get your attention with a noise. From there if you wanted a hint all you had to do was press a blinking button and they give you the standard ""I think we need to do this to solve the puzzle!"" But if you never summoned them they would just stay quiet and let you figure it out yourself."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-16,"You must've been living under a rock if you think rehashing this incredibly well-worn complaint warrants an ""am I the only one..."""
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-16,"I noticed this over the course of the Warcraft expansions. When I started, you had to actually read the quest to know what to do and where to go. There would be a description like ""three of our machines along this coast are acting up, go repair them."" and then you'd go off looking for them. Same for flowers etc. you could collect: you had to actively look for them wherever you went, and going offroads if you wanted to be thorough.   
At some point, they implemented the system where your quest goals, collectibles, everything you were possibly looking for was pointed out on the map. They also made relevant items sparkle. I thought this was nice at first, since it made things easier... But as I went on, I noticed that it mostly just took any challenge out of it. You didn't have to look around anymore, didn't have to read where to go, you'd just follow the dot on the map. It not only made it easier, it also took any character from quests. Whether you had to look for the secret entrance to a cave, discern which machine was broken or simply search for the next person to talk to, it was always the same process. It took meaning out of it, and made it feel less like I was actually there, talking to people, listening to their woes, and trying to fulfill their requests.   
You could disable it, but by the time I found out, I was already used to not even read the texts and simply opening the map to see where to go. 

  
They simplified a lot of things over the years. I'm sure it had some logical reasons form their side (I'm sure they got loads of mod requests on where to find quest locations), and it was a good addition in terms of accessibility. But it made the game a lot less unique for me."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-16,Sure just take puzzles out of non-puzzle games entirely and let people that want them play those games.
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-16,"To put this into perspective, when I was younger (much younger) I played a game called Loom. I believe it was a Lucasarts game. It was a story driven side scrolling game about wizards who cast spells by playing notes on a magical staff. It was in the days of having to write stuff down so you didn't have to remember every combination of spell you'd learnt. I got stuck on one particular part where I had to unwind a spiral staircase. The spell for twisting wouldn't work, and neither would any other spell that didn't seem relevant. I literally had to stop playing the game, because I couldn't progress further than this puzzle. I could only revisit areas that didn't help."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-16,"I‚Äôbe been designing games since the ps2 era, 15 odd shipped titles 

If you played killzone shadow fall or gears 4 you‚Äôve likely played some of my work

Particularly when you are designing a puzzle it‚Äôs very tough to get the difficulty of the puzzle right. You quickly learn from experience and playtesting that a puzzle that seems laughably simple to you as its designer can be impossibly difficult to the typical player

Additionally often the broader purpose of a puzzle isn‚Äôt to test puzzle solving skills of the players but to provide a pallet cleanser or moment of variety 

Ultimately we design games for players to have fun and a too easy puzzle is a better experience than one that is too hard for a significant portion of the player base"
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-17,"yea i understand what your saying.  30 years ago it wasnt like this, games were almost too hard at times... like HOW would you think of that!    20 years ago we got real puzzles in games, physics, the type of stuff you may encounter int eh real world and devs WANTED to make you think - it was SO COOL.... 

now days however i feel they want everyone to be able to breeze through stuff, they fear alienation by frustration.  lowest common denominator of problem solving skills is how gaming is built these days.   and its not just gaming... tv shows, movies, hell even books spell shit out sooner now than in days gone by. 

i LOVE the reward of figuring this out OR better yet; finding a way that works but was NOT intended!   sadly many modern games are often more on a rail - one intended solution and exploration or unique approaches are not always rewarded."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-17,its would be much better if¬†it was optinal in settings..like in shadow of the tomb raider.
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-17,"That's something that I was able to look past in these games, but now that I played Plucky Squire, I am 100% as mad about it as you. You can't take 3 steps in that game without 2 different characters screaming every solution to things that aren't even puzzles. I don't want to be completely lost with no info like SoulsLike games, but we definitely don't need these solutions shoved down our throat."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-17,"Some of those indie games inspired by Resident Evil have have 0 hand holding.

There's Hell is Us that's coming out in 2025 where the dev talks about not hand holding players at all.

I think games are getting better with accessibility features and other QoL features and it would be nice if they added this to puzzles as well with 0 helping hints, few helping hints (like highlight important text / interactable items) or camera directed towards something, and then straight hand holding. Because sometimes my brain is to fried or fixated on something that has absolutely nothing to do with the puzzle to figure out how to pass it and it's nice to not have to go search up a guide (that may or may not exist)."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-17,Games should really have a separate slider or settings for hand-holding. I understand that it helps games to be more accessible to people who don't like or enjoy them but there are many people who also like and enjoy them. It's not even about this gamer is better than that gamer. It's really a matter of preference.
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-18,"What I don't understand is the ""it's so that people don't give up"" angle.

If your solution to that problem is spoiling the puzzle's solution after 20 seconds, why in God's name would you even HAVE a puzzle to begin with?

Just make a game without puzzles ffs."

1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,Honestly I've never noticed it on Ragnarok and I was also toggling between normal and easy difficulty. Maybe the old Resident evil games and JRPG's trained me enough to figure out puzzles before the ai assist did their thing.

People are fucking stupid"
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,It's like that because gaming is popularized to the degree where (frankly) a lot of straight up un-intelligent people get into the hobby. I watched a leaker play FFVII Rebirth this year a few days before release and this dude was so fucking stupid he struggled to find his way even with the yellow lines that we all learned to detest.
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,People who want hard puzzles play puzzles games. I always find puzzles in action games annoying because they are so easy and feel distracting from the actual game

1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"I don't like puzzles, so I like when companions give me hints and hand hold me. I liked it in Veilguard and liked it even more in the recent God of War games."

I just started playing final fantasy x again for the first time in a long time, and I ran into a series of puzzles where you have to move orbs around a temple to progress.

1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"Sometimes I cannot solve the most basic puzzles in games and the companion gives advice on how to solve them. The problem is if I cannot solve it in my current mental state I won't even understand barely cryptic advice. I want to solve puzzles sometimes, I am good at them sometimes. Sometimes I cannot put the red key into the red lock,  just give me a skip button so I can stop wasting my already limited time."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"The tomb raider reboots (or at least shadows) had 3 separate difficulty sliders. One of them was puzzles. It basically just changed how quickly and directly the game would tell you the answer. On the hardest difficulty, it wouldn‚Äôt. I wish more games did that."

1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"Yep, this is almost certainly it. I'm always astonished when I get an achievement for beating a level in the middle of the game and see only like 36% of people received that achievement. A LOT of people don't finish games and I imagine a good portion of those are people who got stuck and never came back."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"Maybe it'd be different now, but I remember being the kid/teen who was just annoyed by puzzles in my action games, especially something like God of War (the older ones I mean) that leaned more heavily towards combat. In something like Zelda I understood it, because that's not strictly an action game, but in a game like OG God of War the puzzles just felt like abrupt, out of place interruptions.

My attitude was that puzzles are a fundamentally different kind of gameplay than the thing I came for, and being forced to do one in a hack-and-slash was like being forced to do an obligatory turn-based combat section or something. That's literally a different kind of product, one that I didn't choose because I didn't want it. 

The impression I get is that some developers use puzzles more as a pacing tool to break up the action. They don't actually want players stopping for an extended period to think about them, just to get a breather before the next fight, and yeah, maybe market research or whatever the fuck it's called shows that most players prefer that.

I do think there should be an option to turn it off though."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"> I just don't know who these people are.

I do know people who would do that, drop a game at the most minor inconvenience.

1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"The new Jedi survivor does this. I turned off a lot of the exploration things so it didn't just tell me where to go and it made a few of the puzzles pretty tricky. After like 5 minutes of running around and not solving it, you have the option to ask BD-1 for a hint. It was pretty cool instead of the companions just telling you what to do right away."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"I think probably the developers' stats arent as sophisticated as that. It's almost like they got feedback that losing isn't fun, so designed out all failure conditions in any form, including the user being too stupid to progress."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"This is my take. I'm okay with easy puzzles but sometimes I feel let down. I imagine some one who wants a challenge must feel so disappointed if even I am. 

Why not toggle on or off? ""Ah shit, it's been 20 minutes. I'll take the hint ffs. I want to move on now"" is such an obvious QOL situation. Maybe they know ""they'll just Google it"" but that's not fun either. Stopping your game to HOPEFULLY find good direction. 

But also ""Oh. The hardest part of.that dungeon was an awkward half platforming situation in a game not really meant for precise jumps. The puzzle was literally to turn these tablets to match the symbols on the wall right above the gate you're trying to enter that aren't even up high and off screen when you look at it"" sucks. Looking at you Bethesda (even though I love you)."

If you are afraid that some 1% of 1% of gamers are going to quit because your puzzle was ""too hard"" then don't make games with puzzles. make a game that gives people the victory screen as soon as they overcome the challenge of hitting new game..."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"I don't understand the point of including ""puzzles"" if the game is just going to solve them for you.

Hints are fine. ""Maybe this relates somehow to the pattern on the floor."" But flat-out giving you the answer is just too dumb for words."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"I'll say this: I think the puzzles in those games are a joke and barely puzzles. They are pixel hunting at best. They are trivial and often pace breaking. Modern games do puzzles really, really poorly. I'm generally happy when the companion tells me a hint not because I couldn't have figured out -> because I just want it over with.


Honestly calling them puzzles or riddles in the first place is disingenuous."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,Makes me think of the Rick and Morty short mysteries on inter-dimensional cable. Would be funny to see a spoof of a game that‚Äôs like that loading the game up andddd I won.

I think that‚Äôs a great solution: if you‚Äôre hard stuck and can‚Äôt figure it out, click for a hint.  If you‚Äôre not, solve it on your own."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"I don't think it'll be a button because of consoles, but not having it tied to the difficulty slider is childish."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-16,"I think one of the things about the games that provide this as an optional thing is that it‚Äôs almost always defaulted to on. It takes considerable time and effort to add these lines from NPCs too.

Usually \~85-90% have the equivalent of ""started the game"" , which is understandable. People buy a game on sale, then it sits on backlog for a while.. Then there's a quick drop at each early milestones where people stop playing because they didn't enjoy it or something else came up. then it's flattish since people are ocmmited enough to ""finish"" it..  

Taking God of War on Steam :

87% of people got as far as the end of the prologue (""The Journey Begins"")

Then you lose 10-12% for each phase in early game (e.g. New Friend 76%) until Kratos retrieves the iconic Blades of Chaos \[Hello, Old Friend 53%\]

People that went this far usually finish the game \[Last Wish 46%\] 

This is only the story mode achievements, not some crazy completionist stuff like kill every Valkyries or find every Crow"
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"It's totally avoidable.

My master's thesis happens to be about this subject. So far, according to some books I've read (I'm thinking ""The psychology of games"", by Celia Hodent, or ""Learn to play"", by Matthew White), I can kind of understand where the devs where coming from and what they could've done better. It should've been enough to have the companion say something like ""do you need help with that?"", and then if you go and talk to them, they give you hints that would make the puzzle progressively easier.

Even that is not entirely desireable, because you want your players to learn your game by playing it, not because you told them how to do so. If you have to tell your players how to solve a puzzle, yes, they will continue progressing the game, but their motivation will decrease.

In summary, it's not good Player Experience design. Not even for new players (or specially for new players)."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"I would like options to turn up or down hints and such.  Also, map markers have a toggle or different types of markers. 

I can't do puzzles as my brain auto sorts out most details on the screen so I don't get overstimulated by everything on screen. I miss many parts of puzzles this way, so I don't like them.

I also can't navigate my way out of a wet paper bag until I've been guided through it 10 or more times."

1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"I think part of the issue is who you are choosing as a play tester. If you're constantly attempting to conquer a market that largely isn't interested in your product then you're gonna run into these issues. Not every game needs to be designed for someone who's never played a game before. It felt like back in the day there were games made for ""noobs"" and games made for lifelong gamers and both audiences could mix and match but you'd know what you were getting. Now Devs seem to want to appeal to everyone with the same product but all that does is cause problems. 

For me the Assassins Creed franchise is a solid example of this. A huge number of the fans of the newer games in the series weremt really fans of the older games. Some of the stuff OG fans love about the old games is what those newer fans always hated. Ubisofts focus on newer fans hasn't really helped them. If you really analyse their numbers it seems like basically swapped out old fans for new ones rather than successfully combining the two for the extra profits. You traded your long term fans for new ones who might not dip back into your products again like you could rely on with older fans who would but every release in the series"

Then proceeds to continually try climbing the sheer cliff without using the islands to bridge her way to the top.  She spends almost an hour there.  She's never picked up the game since."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"I think there's an argument to be made to let people still wander about. Especially if it's a puzzle that doesn't directly impact the main story progression


If it does impact main story, then give a reasonable time limit after hitting a trigger before giving out the hint. And even still have the player choose to accept the hint.


Narratively it takes you out of the moment when your 5 yo companion tells your character whom is much older the solution to a puzzle¬† after 30 seconds and makes me feel condescended to."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,I agree with this. I once was developing a phone app where there was a map and you needed to input your address to get custom services.

By the way? I would like to add one thing: Even smart and experienced can engage in Arin Hanson errors as I call them. 

One person I know is booksmart and is very much the stereotypical ""Dark Souls is life' type of gamer. 

...This guy not only picked the ""glass cannon"" talent in Divinity: Original Sin 2 and couldn't figure out why he was getting crowd controlled, but said *Pok√©mon* was getting overcomplicated because ""I attacked a tree with fire and it resisted. How was I supposed to know it wasn't a grass type?"". 

Better yet, he said the final map of fire emblem awakening was unfair because he kept getting jumped by enemies who would target him with effective weapons. I told him to hit the X button and it would highlight all enemies ranges and he could look over an enemy's stats by bringing the cursor over them. 

And he asked how I knew this.

You read that right. 

This guy has a degree in computer science. And he didn't even press the ""X"" button or think to highlight an enemy for a game he put 20 hours in.

Turns out you have to then interact with a horn on the wall... in an environment that has a bunch of them. None of the other horns can be interacted with.

Then of course trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator is another big problem especially when the low keeps getting lower by our own design."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"Of course it's the majority of gamers.

Our collective attention span is fucked and people don't recognize that, let alone try to fix it within themselves. Short-form content and hyperoptimized dopamine loops are eroding our ability to focus, push past mental discomfort and actually struggle with tasks.

When people are addicted to scrolling 4-second reels on their phones, of course they're not going to enjoy being forced to sit for minutes thinking about a game puzzle."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,And then there's games like Wrath of the Righteous.
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"Nothing wrong with breathing through your mouth, some of us have a deviated septum"
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,Yup. Just ask any political party.

1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"I have some games I got stuck in and left because of that. I don‚Äôt want to look up solutions online personally. But there are far more games that I tried that didn‚Äôt feel like what I wanted to play early on, or which I grew bored off at some point during the game. Or just left because of different real life priorities."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"Depending on the game this may be more or less true. Uncharted, specifically, was always built in part on puzzles with shooting/climbing/puzzles being the three stools of the gameplay (in that order of importance.) Other games not so much.

But there are multiple ways to pace things. Having a ""puzzle"" where the answer gets spilled out immediately seems suboptimal. You could just make an easy puzzle, or a non-puzzle task. You've said that you didn't like the puzzles in the God of War games (I actually didn't mind them and thought they were thematically appropriate because Kratos was facing trials) but those games had other pacing mechanisms too, like the platforming stuff or non-puzzle set pieces where you just had to hit switches in a non-tricky way.

If you're going to put puzzles in the default should be to let the player try to solve them and then provide optional hints or the ability to skip them (which some games also have now) for people who don't want to engage.

Looking at a puzzle for 30 seconds only to have it spoiled just makes me feel stupid because it makes me feel like the game thinks I wasn't able to keep up. It's like a teacher who looks over your shoulder and gives you the answer while you're trying to work it out for yourself to hurry you along. I don't get anything out of it. If I need help I can ask for it."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,There's nothing wrong with focusing on just action. What's the point of even having the puzzles at all then?
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"I have a few games I have dropped because of getting stuck on puzzles, since I don‚Äôt want to look things up. But there are far more games I have dropped because I got bored or had to change my priorities at some way through them."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,SOME games (mostly single player story games) are like that; definitely not all games. I think that‚Äôs an extremely unfair and inaccurate statement to make about games in general. There are tons of challenging and engaging games out there; maybe you just haven‚Äôt found the right one for you yet.
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"I don‚Äôt think it is as bad as that. Newer games offer a wide variety of playstyles.

But, the old games are always there as well, and they are really cheap and easy to get hold off. Many old games offer really great mechanics, visuals, music and atmosphere, so if you prefer old school designs, and don‚Äôt want to search out newer games that offer something similar, there is a ton of good old games that you never tried."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"But average is a subjective in terms of its magnitude. below average does not necessarily mean stupid, and in fact, given that it is fairly reasonable to suggest a bell curve for human intelligence, the vast majority of ""below average"" individuals have intelligence comparable to the vast majority of ""above average"" individuals."

1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"Half the time they don't even register there is a puzzle, they just wander around in circles increasingly panicking and shouting at things and their characters do this as well.

1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"So for ""Breath of the Wild"", I elected to finish the game without looking anything up. That game did really well without hand-holding, but holy shit I realized how dumb I actually am. 

After spending hours on the first boss/dungeon (forget what they're called), I finally figured it out after 4.5 hours that I had to tilt the controller. Afterwards, I didn't feel accomplished, I just felt dumb. 

I feel like there should be *some* hand-holding for some of the key game mechanics that aren't intuitive to everyone, then build the puzzles from there. And those puzzles or mysteries should at least have clues to make you feel smart for figuring it out. There's a fine line between challenging and frustrating. 

I never knew shield riding was a thing. How to focus an arrow shot. How to block, let alone ""perfect block"". I never knew I could trade in seeds for more inventory slots. I beat the game without ever upgrading my inventory, I thought it was just the default for the whole game."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"The main reason is probably that most people who play games on Steam today have a lot of games to choose from. In addition to a small or large backlog, and other game collections, there is constantly coming out new releases and re-releases of older games that are tempting them.

If people just had a few games to choose from in practice, they would finish much more of their games. But since there is such a wealth to choose from, in many cases also for those with low income, people aren‚Äôt incentivized to stick to finish a game, unless they really want to, or it‚Äôs something that they are focusing on. This is not a problem though, having the freedom to choose from many games is not a bad thing."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"I dropped GoW partly for the hand-holding, but also because the more generic combat failed to hold up across an open world game.  As a fan of the original series, I liked the more arcadey style, distinctive overhead camera and I remember a couple puzzles taking a moment to solve.  So the drop off in interest goes both ways: plenty of players drop games that they feel aren‚Äôt testing or rewarding them enough."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-16,"I agree. Some lighting should've fixed the issue, or not scattering the environment with too many distracting objects. It's a level design issue."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"I feel like the whole thing could so easily be solved by just adding settings for puzzles. This way, someone who's struggling with them can get hints and actually solve it, while someone who wants to figure it out by themselves is also able to do that without the constant handholding. I've sort of been on both sides, I love puzzles and figuring stuff out on my own and it pisses me off when games treat me like a toddler, but I also got an illness about two years ago which severely affects my thinking and memory so I do need help with these things more often nowadays. And it would be nice if you could adjust it at any time, since I have better days and worse days, and I guess when people get too stuck only at a specific puzzle."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-16,"> if a puzzle completely inhibits your progress, then sorry, it's not for you.

Sorry, but if a non puzzle oriented game has a puzzle in it that is too obtuse to be able to figure out in a reasonable timespan then it isn't that the game isn't for me, it's that the devs decided to use atrocious level design.

I'm not someone that struggles with puzzles primarily, this particular part of your comment just rubbed me the wrong way. People who jump to this conclusion are dealing in a logical fallacy, in my opinion. Not liking a single unnecessary aspect of a game doesn't mean it isn't for you -- especially when you clearly enjoyed other parts of it, often every other part of it."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,I've heard they added it but it wasn't there near launch.
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,Did it? I remember looking for something that would disable it at the time and not finding anything. It's possible I could have missed it.
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-16,"Nope, they added one to delay hints but you'd still only have 30s or so to figure it out before being hinted at. Source, just played it a month ago."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-16,The first GoW was even worse for puzzle hints. at least in ragnarok they added a delay option. It didn't fix things but it at least meant I could do half of them without the head annoying me.

Well there‚Äôs a puzzle in Miles Morales that‚Äôs pretty simple, just move a couple cranes to the right place or something. I literally moved one of them just to test it out and Miles shouted the exact order to complete the puzzle. 

Like, at least give me a chance to mess it up first!!There‚Äôs been this push in recent years to make narrative focused games so excessively accessible that there‚Äôs no friction at all between the player and the story. But when you look at how obtuse and un-accessible something like Elden Ring is, and how popular it is, you can see that accessibility is not the only thing preventing players from wanting to finish your game."

By all means if you think it will keep people playing longer (I don't see it myself) then include the solutions in there.  But for the love of all that is good and right, leave it for a several minutes before throwing hints at us.

Do I make something fun with good mechanics and depth or do I make something less fun but anybody can play it while watching a YouTube video on the other screen. 

Most of the time once I'd locked in and listened to what the game was telling me, I'd work it out and succeed. However, some old games were just cancerous and poorly designed so it's not like there weren't issues"

Or I'll get a ""watch out"" after an enemy has launched some aoe attack from way back that has no hit indicator or way to know that they are attacking until it was too late.  
The idea of a system where companions are the attack indicator isn't inherently a bad idea. Surprisingly, enough, the new COD campaign does it perfectly (I never thought Id give cod praise again). But when you aim down sights on a target, your overwatch helo will let you know if that shot is safe or if someone is in sight line. This gets rid of the usual field of view cone on a mini map.

Ding ding ding. That's what most people guides for: using them only when stuck. (I think that's on me you misinterpreted my posts)

Some people who bought those guides, or got them free with games as children, do assume that this is how the games were meant to be played. But I have never heard a game designer say that they intended their games to be played with guides. And common sense dictates they were not.

The game guide market is something that popped up as a secondary effect of games generally being challenging back then. That was however not the main motivation for developers making games difficult.

You can make theories about some companies purposefullly pushing their developers to make their games harder on purpose to sell more guides, but I haven‚Äôt seen any examples of this yet.

The main reason why both action and adventure games were harder back then is obviously to make them last longer. Neither parents, kids or older players would have been very happy if games lasted only a day or two on average."

1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"Maybe not according to your personal definition, but I don‚Äôt think it makes sense to exclude it from things which are considered cheating.

For example in adventure games of the point and click, or text adventure type, the gameplay is pretty much nothing but exploration, interacting with the world and figuring out puzzles/progression.

If you just use a guide, there‚Äôs not much gameplay left there.

Similarly for action adventure games like Zelda and Metroid, you could say that puzzles and exploration is 30-70% of the game, and action elements the other half. If you use a guide for these I would say it is cheating too.

But, that doesn‚Äôt have to mean that you only can play games like these in only two ways. Personally I don‚Äôt look up solutions online, but it is possible to play games in a way where you make some rules for yourself that allows you to look up solutions under some circumstances. As long as you followed your own rules you wouldn‚Äôt be cheating in relation to those rules, but you would still be cheating according to the wider definition of the word. (At least for some people, the definition of what constitutes cheating varies a lot from person to person.)

Pure action games makes the topic more complex however. Personally I don‚Äôt use guides or videos for these either, but most of the people who are really good at old 2D games, like speed runners, do watch videos of other players to get better. And in this case, using a guide/video isn‚Äôt an immediate warp to beating your objective, since you still have to execute it.

It wouldn‚Äôt make sense for me to call the best people in the world who are exceptionally better than myself for ‚Äúcheaters‚Äù for using videos, but for my own personal purposes it would still be cheating in a sense."

Often I approach it very diplomatically and take other viewpoints into consideration when presenting my own. Other times like here, I am more tactless. Which is not always a good choice.

People who like to play blind, or those who like to play games after the rules we think they were designed after, can sometimes be rude and condescending. The ""git gud"" line is mostly used ironically, but not always, and is an example of how not to behave.

But people with the opposite views on what works best for them, can be just as obnoxious and annoying. And project what works for them into what is best for everybody. Or automatically assume that most people play the same way as they do. Insinuations that people with a life and family, don't have the time to play blind, or after the rules, is also very common.

What I think in general, is that it is a good idea for anyone who plays games to reflect on what makes playing them most enjoyable for them, and then perhaps make some rules based on this. Because modern gaming with all the settings within games, re-releases and all the options available outside of games as well, makes having some rules something that could improve your experience. But while having some rules is good, it is also a good idea to be open to the idea of also making exceptions to the rules for some genres or special cases."

>I just wish we had more games that didn't cater to the ""everything handed to the player on a platter"" mentality. The ones that don't mostly only exist in the indie field because almost every AAA game does exactly that.

I also would probably not have any puzzles in there aside from a few framed as a mini game - it would even make sense in universe that some people are playing bar games.

*"" Which was mostly ""Alt tab. Open Firefox or internet Explorer. Enter* [*www.gamefaqs.com*](http://www.gamefaqs.com)*. Look up Morrowind"". ""*

So it was just me misremembering you, not that you expressed yourself ambiguously.

But don't you think that you went a little far in your assumptions about how people play their games? As far as I know, there is no data on this available, and I suspect that if some exist, it wouldn't paint a picture of an overwhelming majority using guides around 2002 or before.

There are also some nuances here, between people finally succumbing to using a guide after a long period, and people who use guides whenever they get stuck. Your original comment seemed to imply that an immediate look in a guide was the norm for most people when encountering a problem, instead of: *""use your executive function to play, you had to think to navigate, figure out quests, you had to plan""* 

Which you specifically cited.

Yes and no. It was A reason (SNESdrunk nicknamed it ""Rigged Rentals"") and often the driving reason. But not the sole reason. Some of the reason a lot of older games have that old school difficulty is just cause design principles were different.

Especially cause it may not he considered a ""proper playthrough"" since I had to load a lot of save states to test it at different stages."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-15,"*""Ever hear of Sierra Online?""*

Indeed I have, in fact I am playing one of their old point & click adventures right now. If any developers ever purposefully made their games harder to sell guides, Sierra is the first company I would think of. Because selling guides was something they did, and because their games were quite hard. I can certainly imagine in my head, Ken Williams mentioning to his designers that the games had to be challenging enough for that reason. But so far I have not read or heard any interview with him, or his game designers which suggests that this happened. So at this point this is just a theory that you have.

It is certainly not improbable that Ken would try to influence them, but it is also just an assumption that you made, just like you made the assumption about most players having guides in the background when they played games back in 2002. If you have ever had any discussion with someone about politics, when they have a very different view of them than you, you have probably noticed that people very easily make assumptions about things that make the world fit in their own worldview.

I am fully open to the idea that Sierra actually made their games harder to sell guides, but so far I have found nothing to support this. Meanwhile Roberta Williams, Jane Jensen and the other designers had other reasons for making their games hard that are obvious.

I wrote: *""The main reason why both action and adventure games were harder back then is obviously to make them last longer.""* But this was a simplification to keep my comment short. What I actually meant by this is a process where several genres of games evolved and took form throughout the 70s and 80s, and these genres then took a firmer and more standardized shape later on. Because some games worked well and were imitated. All this led to genres like platformers and point & click games having a set of expectations towards them, both by players and developers. So for the most part, rather than people consciously thinking ""we must make this game long enough"" and designing the game mechanics after that, this was an ""evolutionary"" process that selected for games that were long enough to fulfill the expectations of gamers, parents and game journalists. I would imagine that developers frequently found their games to be too short at some point, but throwing on an extra level, area, etc, was probably more often the solution than increasing the difficulty. But that probably happened as well, as a game being difficult was generally seen as a good thing by journalists, marketers and many players back then.

So it appears that we do agree quite a bit in this area. Genre traditions, much smaller teams for making content, and the limited RAM and data storage space, especially on consoles, made games significantly harder than they are now.

There is an interesting (partial) exception here, which is RPGs. RPGs could recycle the assets they contained in a completely different way than level-based action games, or graphical adventure games could, (when following genre conventions) so these games could be very long, without needing challenging action segments, or places you got stuck and had to experiment, like in adventure games.

And when playing RPG games from this period today, I personally find them to be a lot easier than action games. Especially JRPGs, which is a very standardized genre, which makes it very easy to pick up and play if you already know it. However the thinking at the time among console players in the West seems to have been very different. EGM systematically labelled all RPGs as ""hard"" when reviewing them in early years, and for comparison, BattleToads as ""medium"" in difficulty. But it is probably a result of many players not being very familiar with how the genre conventions worked back then.

There are a few JRPGs who are noticeably harder than most from this time. Dragon Warrior 2 for example. But even this game is fairly easy compared to most acclaimed action games on the same console. So it seems likely to me that the designers of these RPGs didn't need to make the games as hard as action and adventure games to make them last, and therefore was incentivized to make their games easier for other reasons.

*""Yes and no. It was A reason (SNESdrunk nicknamed it ""Rigged Rentals"") and often the driving reason.""*

I disagree that this was the driving reason. And this is simple to see, because among console games from the NES and SNES era, the games that were made more difficult when they came to the West are far less numerous than those that were. Another important aspect here is that mid-period NES games (87-90) were generally harder than later NES games. NES games were also generally harder than SNES games. In general games didn't get harder when the Japanese games industry started focusing on the American rental market, they got easier.

This doesn't mean that rentals didn't influence difficulty, it was an important factor as you say, but it was not the main one, when you view genre traditions and the practical need for a game to be long enough as one factor. I view them as one, because the need for game to be long enough obviously shaped how genres developed.

But since we do in fact agree quite a bit about all these factors being important in influencing the difficulty of games back then, perhaps you should reconsider the view that selling guides was an important factor for shaping their difficulty. While Sierra sold guides for their games, I bet that this was not something a majority of developers did, and in that case, you can entirely remove that from the equation for those developers.

Exploring a game on your own, solving puzzles and progression, and the satisfaction that comes after getting stuck for a little while, but then figuring things out, is something that a lot of players enjoy a lot. And I would assume that a lot of game designers do as well. If you ever have made challenges or non-computer games for people in the real world, you know the feeling."
1grxb2r,2024-11-15,2024-11-16,"I think every game should have customizable optional accessibility options because otherwise developers are leaving money on the table. If they don‚Äôt include it, they‚Äôre the ones losing out, so that‚Äôs their business."

Just a bunch of fucking crying emojis and trying to talk like you're a serious person when you're just pulling strawman after strawman with no actual substance to anything you say beyond insults.

I guess I shouldn't expect anything less from an ""adult"" who feels the need to proclaim they're a ""real adult"" who just grows up to get over valid problems other people have. It's funny how people with your mindset almost always act the same way. 

""grow up"" tends to just be a way of putting down a valid concern someone else has, and usually your ""mature"" way of handling things gives way to you mocking someone else, _juust_ like you did here. Predictable -- telling that for all your talk of growing up, you couldn't grow up enough to not spam crying emojis multiple times in a row and handle the disagreement like an actual adult, huh?

I'm not really interested in your answer, though. I already know it isn't going to be mature, so I'll pass."

The point is that removing hints from the game isn't the only, or the best way to address the complaints, and people looking up stuff on the internet instead isn't the only, or the best solution. You can just make in-game hints voluntary. Like, if there's a companion, the game can make you ask them for a hint. 

> I would also argue that adding an ""easy win"" button to games doesn't make them alright game design. The player is supposed to maximize their effectiveness and ignoring ""hey win without trying"" temptation turns the player from focusing on beating the challenge to having to actively manage their experience by avoiding circumvention of that challenge.

This applies to looking up things online too. And the thing about in-game hints is that they can check your understanding of the puzzle first, not give you a partial solution. So it doesn't need to be an easy win button."

That is to say the time it takes from when you sit down to when you actually start playing the game and enjoying yourself. Most modern games have patches, checking for updates, connecting to servers, longer initial loading (due to graphics), and then once youre actually in the game it usually takes longer to actually start doing something.

Comparatively older games and or games that a rereleases/modern versions of the same games are basically plug and play. You put in mario and you are genuinely playing in under 30 seconds.

God of War takes atleadt twice as long as you load up the game, load the save, and begin teaversing until something happens.


None of this is to say modern games are bad, just that older games were quicker to the action and so they are generally more enjoyable for the times you are looking for entertainment without preparation."

You captured one of the wounds that never healed in the game but there's a tooth that should be missing as well. 

Several times in the game characters would straight up talk to Kratos about not wanting him to fight Thor for fear of his losing but I was like...I already did it and I gave him two wounds that will never heal...where is this doubt coming from?"

zmx90k,2022-12-15,2022-12-16,"Thor has always represented the fathers in norse mythology, that's why he is often depicted with a dad bod. And before people get excited about arguing, no, Odin represents the wise / the elder not the middle aged father."
zmx90k,2022-12-15,2022-12-16,"So the leading theory on why Thor's wound didn't heal:

In the first game Kratos throws the leviathan axe into Jormungandr's mouth and he retrieves it right back; which basically coats the axe in the venom of the World Serpant....Thor's sworn enemy and who he is destined to fight during Ragnarok. The wound doesn't heal because Jormungandr has the capability to flat out kill Thor."

z3vdpe,2022-11-24,2022-11-25,Well the only difference is that when it comes to villages Ash leaves them and Kratos leaves ash

1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Quake III Arena running flawlessly on a machine the size of a deck of cards.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Keeping in mind that I started gaming in the 1980s, I'd just show me my current VR headset. It's mind-shattering. Remember playing at 320x200 pixels or less? This thing has nearly 2x2k per eye, full depth perception, full sense of scale, motion controllers and even hand tracking and passthrough. As in, you can see your room, you can call up a virtual keyboard with your bare hands, and the headset can track your hands typing on a keyboard that doesn't actually physically exist, floating in front of me in empty air.

If we're talking games, Lone Echo, Asgard's Wrath, Stormland, Half Life Alyx, etc. Any one of these would have shattered my mind in the '80s. I mean holy hell, look at 'Johnny Mnemonic' from the '90s and see that dorky headset he uses to ""go into cyberspace"", with those shitty gloves and wires to track his hands so he can do gesture-based interactions. We sidestepped that shit completely and went into real time hand tracking using on-board cameras."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Red Dead Redemption 2, assuming we could bring ourselves to the current time to see it play and move. 
The graphics and gameplay is way more than I could‚Äôve handled. 
We thought Mario 64 was crazy open and amazingly awesome graphics"
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,I‚Äôd show FF7 Rebirth to 11 year old me that was obsessed with OG FF7
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,I‚Äôm old enough to remember how Mario 64 blew my mind when I first played it on a demo kiosk at Toys R Us so probably Mario Odyssey or Tears of the Kingdom.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,No mans sky. I think that my younger self would just be over powered with pure jealousy over being able to go through space and name planets and shit. Over stimulating as an adult lol little me is gonna have an aneurism
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Cyberpunk 2077 would be a good one, walking through the city at night in the rain.... Showing my childhood self some CP would definitely be mind blowing"
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"I loved the two early 00s Spider-Man games for the PS1, so I would show young me the new Spidey games, especially to get to show-off Mile Morales.

Seeing a black Spider-Man would've meant the world to me as I was just getting into liking the character at that age and loved to imagine myself as him."

1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,I grew up playing Frontier Elite;  Elite Dangerous would toast my synapses.

1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Probably BoTW running on a small handheld and ‚Äòunderpowered‚Äô device. Or honestly any modern game that can run well on steamdeck. Not just the game but the portability of such a beautiful and complex game would be actually mind blowing.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,DOOM Eternal easily

1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Probably either Helldivers 2 or Elden Ring.

I can't choose 1."

1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Ooh, man. There are so many. It would probably come down to either Elden Ring or Warframe. With the exception of WoW, those are the only ones I've put multiple thousands of hours into."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Can I bring a vr headset?

Because playing no man sky in VR, while flying on a spaceship was my dream scenario when I was a kid. I now have a computer and a vr headset where I can do those things."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Battlefront 2015 or Battlefront 2. Blew my mind in 2015, it'd blow my mind in 1996.

Later on magazines printed games that you needed to copy letter by letter into your computer and then save the file on a casette tape (provided you had not made a single typo in copying).  
  
School Physics teacher asked the school board for computers for us kids to learn on and was turned down as they were not important, undaunted he wrote to all the parents asking for scrap metal, car batteries, copper pipes etc to be donated , he sold the scrap and bought a couple of Sinclair Spectrums ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX\_Spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum) ) that we were allowed to tinker with under supervision in our evening free time. 

Honestly, pretty much all modern games still blow my mind. Persistant worlds, massive multiplayer, let alone all the graphics and rendering. 

The creativity is amazing, I still play regularly (if a little slower than the teenagers)."

1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Probably Grand Theft Auto 5, those games have always been the most technically impressive from a ‚Äúwhole world‚Äù perspective for me‚Ä¶ contemporary setting with semi-familiar locations, tons of activities, any vehicle you want, freedom to do whatever you want with your character‚Ä¶

A lot of other answers are looking specifically at graphics. I love pokemon and have since I was a child.

I'm old. I grew up on Sega Genesis and Sonic. Was in love with Star Trek: TNG and Babylon 5. Experiencing history's finest sci-fi epic in a beautiful 3D game would've completely shattered my brain.

Helldivers 2, Halo Infinite, Titanfall 2 and, I know it isn't exactly new, Red Dead Redemption 2.

Halo Infinite because I was Halo obsessed and, even though Infinite didn't pan out as it should have, the graphics, armor cores, and gameplay would have blown me away.¬†


Titanfall 2. No more needs to be said.


Red Dead Redemption 2 because to this day that game still makes me go ""wow."" I feel like that would have been a true showcase of how expansive and content rich RPGs can be. I'd say it still feels ""next gen"" compared to many newer RPGs.¬†"

1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"I wish I had Minecraft when I was younger‚Ä¶yes I know, showing my age, but it would have blown my mind."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Right now sparking zero. Massive DB fan and this game is great.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,I would still pick Elder scrolls Morrowind.  That game still seems impossible to run on The original Xbox.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,I would show myself the Matrix Unreal tech demo right after watching The Matrix for the first time.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"None.. I actually think vanilla wow that first time experience would blow everyone‚Äôs mind. Games are not harder today nor more complex.. quite the contrary many of the older ones were arguably more complex, and they were so difficult to make. If I had to pick one, it would be Skyrim, because I was a teenager when that came out. 

It‚Äôs kinda like‚Ä¶ why were old cartoons filled with so much quality and care in the past? Because some bloke had to paint every movement. It was literally brimming with attention to detail. Now everything is on a conveyor belt. Even though you‚Äôve more possibility than before, both the animation and video games are just seen as a means.. not something you‚Äôre truly passionate about."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"i'd show little 7 year old me rdr2, skyrim graphics blew my mind like 3 years later so i think rdr2 would definitely blow my mind."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Shit, 8 yo old me had his mind blown by the water in Pikmin on GameCube. 

I think Cyberpunk, Ragnarok, or Horizon Forbidden West would make him pee his pants."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,RE2 Remake
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Monster hunter world would have been mad to see when I was a kid playing freedom on the PSP
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,11 year old me would be blown away by the fact 23 year old me still plays Skyrim
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Elden Ring, no doubt."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Probably any of the boss fights from FF16, the spectacle would have blown my little dumbass mind."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Since I played Spider-Man 2 on the OG Xbox I probably would give my younger self Spider-Man and/or Miles Morales. Seeing such a detailed version of New York (or winter NYC) would've broke my mind
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Honestly any game from the last 5-10 years. We‚Äôve come a long way since Super Mario Bros.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,I would LOVE the chance to show my younger self No Man's Sky back in like the mid-90's (I'm about to turn 39 now). It's the game I always dreamt of and to know something close to my perfect game actually exists in the future would send me over the moon. Literally!
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Gta 5
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,RE4 Remake. I'm still amazed at how good games now a days
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Well considering it was the early 80's when I was a kid, all we really had was the 2600, basically anything really lol"
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,I remember talking with friends as a kid that it would be amazing to play ff7 with the same graphics as the cutscenes. Graphics now are way better than the cutscenes
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,I'd show him the Gameboy emulator on my phone. Every Gameboy game ever with like 10 clicks on a phone would have blown his mind
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"ghosts of Tsushima, tell myself to stop being a bitch and play new games and not just FPS games. (I won‚Äôt end up listening to myself)"
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Cyberpunk 2077 in its current form. 

I don't think Ultima 4 playing me could comprehend graphics like that."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,KingdomHearts 3. Younger me would have KILLED for the pirates world.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"I was the first kid in my school to beat the first Mario and Zelda games. I think Astro Bot, Returnal, TOTK, and any of Witcher 3, Horizon, GOW Ragnarok, Control, any of the Spiderman games, Fromsoft, Cyberpunk 2077, Star Wars Jedi, or AC Origins would blow my mind."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,life is strange!
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"I don‚Äôt think childhood me would give a shit about anything except a real sequel to Mario 64‚Ä¶ and he‚Äôd be pissed as hell that we had to wait so long for Galaxy and Oddysey, because Sunshine (as good as it is) was not that game."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,The latest and greatest Gran Turismo would have blown my mind with the wheels and pedals to go with it.     I was big on racing games in the 90's.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Either smash bros ultimate or ff7 rebirth for sure.¬†
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,I'd interrupt myself playing Sega Genesis Shadowrun and give him Cyberpunk 2077 with Phantom Liberty. It's everything I wanted man I would LOVE a Shadowrun game made like it.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,CyberPunk 2077 or Red Dead Redemption 2.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"I grew up with MAG, the bar is extremely high."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,FF4 on android. I was limited while growing up to only playing at my uncles house. He had ff4 for snes and I just waited for the moments in between visits to end so I could progess. Being able to have it in my pocket on something as common as an android phone would have melted my brain.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,I think red dead redemption 2 would‚Äôve blown me away
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,I would actually make sure my younger self never discovered RuneScape so I could get 15 years of my life back.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"As I'm a 1990 dude, I'd show myself probably RDR2. Hell, Forza Horizon 5 could do the trick."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Gran turismo 7 in VR. When I first went from the menu into my first race and got dropped into the cockpit I lost my shirt. I wrecked in my 3rd race because I was still just turning and staring into the backseat mid race lol
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"FF7 Remake/Rebirth. In terms of graphics and overall quality there are many games like GOW Ragnarok, Cyberpunk 2077 etc. but nothing matches the new FF7 games for me in terms of the overall atmosphere, characters, story, etc.

I finished Remake around 3 years ago and I already feel nostalgic about the game, unlike most titles nowadays remake and rebirth just have a lot of soul and passion put into them.

Another game series I would show my younger self is persona. Persona 5 royal and persona 3 reload are also in my all time top 5 alongside the ff7 titles."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"I *wish* my answer could be a modern Pokemon game. 
‚Ä¶probably Palworld"
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Rdr2
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"The Apple Vision headset. Yes it looks goofy, but after a demo it felt like I had gone to the future. It's too expensive and there aren't enough games for it, but it's a marvel of innovation. The Oculus/Quest would be a close second"
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,VTOL VR
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Alyx
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Everybody is going with cinematic masterpieces and huge open worlds. I'd go with mechanics. Boot up Superliminal or Viewfinder and watch a brain violently short-circuit.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Uncharted or the newer Tomb Raider games
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"I feel like Red dead redemption 2 would be the main one my childhood self would just go wtf this is real? Games like Arkham Knight and the new Spiderman games would probably be what 7 year old me would really flip shit over but you can just do so much in rdr2. Any of those I'd just be like "" What? I can play this?"" Especially if it was NES loving pre SNES me. That said God of war 2018, Cyberpunk 2077, Ghost of Tsushima, Horizon forbidden West, Uncharted 4, last of us would all just blow my flipping mind."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Elden Ring would have blown my mind as a kid. Everything I ever wanted in a game.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Minecraft today. When I first started playing as a kid Minecraft just added Lapis. My younger self would lose it just at horses
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Elder scrolls online, grew up watching my brother play morrowind wishing we could journey around together.

And then ESO happened and he's been too drunk to play games for years."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Ghosts of Tsushima. In my eyes almost perfect.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,God of war Ragnarok.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,i dont think i would be able to convince myself final fantasy xvi really happened
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Call of duty world at war zombies
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Probably if no man's sky was out during my childhood I would have faked a fiver probably double the times I did ahahaha
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Honestly, something like fortnite or League to my child, young teen self. 

I missed out on all the subscription based games in the late 90s, early 2000s, and something like fortnites content model would blow my mind being able to access all content for free."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Sex with Hitler 2
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Tomb Raider Anniversary. The original was the first game to ever get a genuine jump-scare out of me, and it had my complete attention for weeks after I started playing it. It remains one of only a few games that I've played through to completion to this day. When the remastered version came out for the 360, it was like reliving those moments all over again for the first time. 

Growing up on PONG and Atari 2600, this would have absolutely blown my mind. I just turned 50 yesterday and I still love that game."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Cyberpunk 2077 would have destroyed my teen self. Hell, it destroys me now."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Any large open world game as my younger self I didnt believe that it was technologically possible to have a huge open map with good graphics
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,God of war (Norse) was the first thing that popped in my mind but also maybe Helldivers 2. It's the most fun I've had playing a game since I don't know when.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Cyberpunk. On my current 4090 based pc using a 65‚Äù 120hz 4k oled.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"MSFS 2020 to my teenage self, I would've shit my pants knowing where graphics were going."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Warhammer Total War. I remember being 11 or 12 and playing the first Rome Total War and all I could think about was how amazing it would be if they collaborated with Warhammer. Dreams do come true.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Microsoft flight simulator
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Baldurs gate 3 probably
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Diablo 3 and four so I‚Äôd save myself a few dollars knowing how crap it turned out to be.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Child me has his mind blown by Wolfenstein 3-D. 
It wouldn‚Äôt take much."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,diablo 2 remake
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Star Wars Squadrons in VR mode, just free flight.

Little kid me in the cockpit of an X-Wing would think he‚Äôd died and gone to heaven.

The X-Wing and Tie Figher, and then Rogue Squadron were some of my absolute favorite games.

X-Wing in VR‚Ä¶

Shoot, I‚Äôm gonna go boot it up and play for a bit now."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Arkham Horror LCG. I‚Äôve been into MTG since 5th grade, almost 30 years ago. Magic is what drove my interest in game design and the more of it I saw, the more I felt that its system was capable of doing anything one could want in a strategy card game. This was long before Pandemic caused the surge of cooperative games. The notion that a card game like AHLCG could be cooperative and also provide an immersive engaging narrative and emergent narrative was mind blowing for me when I first discovered it 5 years ago. That reaction would have been so much stronger back then. Perfect sleepover game."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,I don‚Äôt think I would show my past self any modern games. It would ruin everything out at the time and between then and now.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,GTA VI
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Contractors VR, mods for halo, cod zombies, and Star wars battlefront in VR would blow my little friggin mind"
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Eve online (maybe) I found the game around high school so maybe it dont count. I had some real good friends on Xbox live at the time but the ties I made in Eve Online were strong. I miss old corp mates like real lost friends. I found the game a bit after my mom died and finding a game where community was more than shooting the same boss but sharing recipes, vacation photos, or spilling into any other game giving you instant co-op was just an amazing world. Also space ships."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"I spent a lot of time playing Rad Racer and TV Pro Am on the original NES as a child. Fell in love with racing games then and there. Been a Motorsports fan since I can remember. I would probably show that version of me the most recent Forza Motorsports game, and let him know good things were coming .

Either that or No Man's Sky, as I have also always been a space nerd, so now being able to just chill in NMS is such a great thing"
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Arkham Knight ü¶á
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"I would show off to my younger self ""Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes."" It would not only blow my mind but everything else with it. xD"
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"having just finished TLOU Part 2...I'd probably show him some gameplay snippets of that. Like, while not photorealistic to us, the lighting is so effin' amazing that someone from 20+ years ago would assume it was real in certain situations. Say what you will about the plot (and arguably even the gameplay), but the game looks absolutely amazing"
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Hogwarts Legacy! I played a ton of the Harry Potter games as a kid, especially chamber of secrets on the PlayStation. I think my younger self would be amazed by hogwarts."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Red Dead Red 2. Masterpiece. 10 year old me would be overwhelmed with wonder at it.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Probably GTA V or RDR2. They're big and I was playing a lot of similar when I was younger.

I don't think my younger self would appreciate Elden Ring. They'd get smacked around, haha"
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"I'm struggling so much to narrow this down, but I think I'll go for The Last of Us. IMO it completely redefined what a game could be. Storytelling, world building, graphics. For me TLoU is a seriously revolutionary game."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,BeamNG
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Probably Uncharted 4.

1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Horizon: Forbidden West or Control. They are just such beautiful and rich games.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Star Wars battlefront (the newer ones) would‚Äôve absolutely blown my mind as a kid.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Heavily Modded Minecraft. Shaders and a bunch of content mods. So I could show myself how minecraft would really be in the future; exactly as we wanted it.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Spider-Man PS4 or Days Gone.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Titanfall 2
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"BG3 to a young kid who was into D&D in the early '90's.

1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,I'd show them marvel spiderman. I absolutely LOVED spiderman 2 on the gamecube so my little mind would have been BLOWN

1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"I always loved outer space games as a kid, so I would probably show my younger self No Man‚Äôs Sky. The sense of exploration in this game would blow my younger mind!!"

We can now just do things that tech didn't allow yet, and while novel or interesting, it isn't nessessarily more fun. 

For example. Good strategy games haven't improved since the Red alert 2 era. Shooters and adventure games are almost exactly the same but with ability timers and class systems.

1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,"I'd show younger me (pre-N64) one of the modern Spider-Man games. Mario 64 was already mind blowing enough when it came out, but the ability to web sling around the map so freely and fluidly in Spider-Man games would have made my head explode as a kid."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,"Contractors vr with the der riese map.

1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart. From the graphics to the instant loading. And it‚Äôs a direct comparison to the 3D platformers that were prevalent at the time.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,As a kid I was a huge star wars nerd so probably either Squadrons or Jedi Knight Fallen Order.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,"In a negative way, aaa titles. In a positive way, it takes two. Because I essentially played alone until my 14.

1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,Easy. Any AAA title in VR. It‚Äôs a generational leap akin to moving from 2D to 3D and people love to ignore it.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,Monster hunter world. I spent so many years googling rumours or news of it coming back to playstation.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,"Elden Ring and its success. Demon's Souls was pretty much immediately my favorite game of all time, but I never thought we'd get another. It was just so unlike everything that made money at the time. I'd show me everything Miyazaki has done since."

I would rather just give stock tips and tell my younger self to hoard bitcoins when they come out."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,"NCAA 25, Persona 5, Halo Infinite, Pokemon Scarlet/Violet are probably the top ones of how far we've come along in different ways.

Younger me played EVERY star wars flying game since the original rebel assault (and yes realising that made me realise how old I am now). Showing them a full vr HOTAS setup of flying any of the ships would actually blow their little mind."

1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,I remember playing Frontier Elite II on my Atari STE on a 14‚Äù TV and controlling it with a mouse. If 14 year old me saw Elite Dangerous in VR with a full HOTAS after that I think I would have freaked out.

1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,"Hades, because this game blew my mind with polish and quality of every aspect i never expected from such a ""cheap"" game. For some reason i was that guy who ignored indie games almost 100% of the time, but this one broke this.
I wish i knew this sooner, that budget and price doesn't equal quality and fun"
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,"Honestly,I'd probably show my Profile. All the hours and trophies. Tell me my favorite multiplayer moments.

1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,Either a really good game like Skyrim or one with increadible graphics like rdr 2 . The problem would be choosing a game that won't be too complicated or difficult for a child so perhaps something simple like ck 3.

1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,Emulators. Imagine telling a 90s kid that you have literally every game ever made (for them) running on your cell phone.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,"Many replies here seem to think in terms of graphics or advanced gameplay mechanics, unique storytelling etc. And while that would probably blow my mind, I don't think it is unfathomable as something like Minecraft would be. Simply the concept of ""LEGO, but a video game"" and a seemingly endless world would make my jaw drop and entertain me for hours on end (like it did when I first encountered it as an adult)."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,"Skyrim VR.
It's wildly immersive."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,"Throne and liberty, server meshing technology allowing all the players on the same server to play in real time without any instances seamlessly would make my younger self jaw drop"
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,"The first game I ever played was Mazogs on my brother's ZX81, it just had numbers for graphics. Anything now, even a simple mobile game would blow my ten year old mind then."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,"I'm 51yo and know my 10-11yo self would have been blown the fuck away by the latest GTA.  The concept of an open world version of Cali would have made me seizure.  Sadly, knowing my younger self, I would have been happy with the graphics involved in banging the hookers."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,"Might be a bit ""casual"", but I think GTA 5 or Cyberpunk 2077. Only because I know that, as a kid, I was daydreaming about such open world and interactive games like that.."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-14,Ratchet and Clank Tools of Destruction was a massive leap in graphics from ps2 to ps3. So I'd say show myself Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart in 2006 and I'd be awestruck.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-14,Cyberpunk 2077. It's nearly four years old and it still blows my mind with how fun the game is and the ray tracing affects.

1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-14,"Chivalry 2.

It is the absolute pinnacle of large battlefield (64 player) gaming.

When me and the boys discovered it, it blew our minds and it‚Äôs been our main game since"
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-14,"As a 8 year old back in 2009 checking my uncle's new PS2 and this game called GTA San Andreas, It set the record for what PS2 games were about.

Anything would make me impressed, really, but I surely would play GTA 5 back to back over and over again if I had this game available when I was 9-10 years old.

Like I played hundreds of hours of GTA San Andreas without ever completing a single mission.

I remember playing with sonic in GTA SA, Wich was mind blowing to fly around, run super fast and explode cars.

Truly a unique experience, that the original game didn't get to me."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-14,"Marvel spiderman. If there‚Äôs one thing I know little me woulda been stoked about is if I showed him spiderman, and the best part is, childhood gamer is still there deep down, and I know he thinks that shit is awesome."

1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-14,"with a later starting since in my childhood my family didnt get any console, i would probably show then Tales of the Abyss, as a game that made me pretty happy and fulfilled!"
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-14,"Half life Alyx, masterpiece of a game, and VR would be absolutely nuts."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-15,"I think Enter the Gungeon would do the trick. I found out about it 2-3 years ago, and I was *intensely* playing it. I can't imagine how my younger self would handle the massive amounts of serotonin and dopamine he'd get by playing it."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-15,FFVII Rebirth or Red Dead 2 I think.

1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Fortnite. I was an '80s kid, so the graphics of any modern game would blow my young mind. However, seeing one game have the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Transformers, Robocop, The Terminator, Xenomorphs, Spider-Man, etc. would have exploded my brain. Not to mention you can play with a hundred people at once"
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Resident evil 2 remake. Og re already gave me ptsd. This one would destroy me. LOL get fucked, idiot."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Helldivers 2 would both scare the shit out of and blow the mind of my 5th grade self
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"If I went back 10 years and showed myself Starfield I‚Äôd think it was just an incredibly ambitious Fallout 4 mod and not a game with a budget of $400,000,000."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Glad to see there‚Äôs more of us Q3 players around! 

What a game that was at prime. LAN parties, competitions, the steep learning curve for movement like strafe jumping and rocket jumping. First time nailing that strafe jump from the Q3DM6 bridge to the railgun!! 

I had no internet at the time, so I played countless hours against nightmare bots. While one of my friends but also rival when it came to Q3 skills played online.
Our styles developed into two incredibly different directions, but it was a constant hunt of outplaying each other in duels!"
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Ahh, that would've been quite something to me with my Atari 1040STFM!"
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,A buddy of mine gave me his Quest 2 when he moved. I haven't really played anything other than beatsaber; sadly I don't have a gaming PC anymore but I've been thinking of building one to try to get more out of this VR headset.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,"VR blows my mind NOW, and all I‚Äôve seen is what quest 2 can do. I bought it years ago and it just sits there gathering dust.  It‚Äôs just not as comfortable as sitting in front of my monitor with a controller. Plus at that time, I had a toddler. They have no concept of staying out of the way while you‚Äôre moving your hands around . Anyways, I think a majority of people have never actually even tried VR. They‚Äôre probably imagining it being like having a smartphone strapped to your head. If they just had a chance to try it they‚Äôd have no choice to admit it it‚Äôs the coolest thing they‚Äôve ever seen. For now though it‚Äôs kinda uncomfortable on my head. I can‚Äôt wait to play augmented reality games though. I‚Äôm just cautious in buying a quest 3 because I‚Äôm worried it‚Äôs gonna sit there gathering dust."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"My answer would be VTOLvr. The graphics would still be mind blowing to my little kid self, but a flight sim where you can actually push buttons and interact with the cockpit, as well as full 360 free look‚Ä¶ That would be absolutely insane.

Edit: Star Wars Squadrons in VR mode. Little kid me would think he‚Äôd died and gone to heaven."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,Which you running?
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,I really wish I could get over the motion sickness. I have a quest 2 my friend gave me but anything that actually requires me to move around is too much and I end up getting way too sick. I do like the idea of lightweight AR glasses once that's refined more but I fear VR will never be for me as long as the motion sickness still is a problem.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,"I wasn't even thinking of VR for some reason but yeah, being able to sit on my couch across the house from my PC and play Alyx via Virtual Desktop is probably the right answer here."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,Has anything come out that compares to Half Life Alyx in terms of overall quality? I haven‚Äôt really used my Index in like 2 years
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"If I was in the middle of one of my week-long GTA San Andreas binges in high school, and someone popped in from the future and let me play Red Dead Redemption 2, I would have shit everywhere"
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,"It's six years old, yet it's still the best looking game that I've ever played"
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"I would have waited for that period when I became obsessed with western games. I would have let myself finish Red Dead Revolver, and then GUN, which I probably played through atleast 3 times. 

When Rockstar announced Red Dead Redemption I flipped. Must have read that Game Informer article over a dozen times."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,My answer exactly. This game is so freaking real. I would have been speechless for a day or two if I‚Äôd seen RDR2 as a kid.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,I bet it's would be like my 11 year old self thought FF8 would be like as my first Final Fantasy game when it came out based solely on cut scene graphics I saw in the commercial
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,I was obsessed with crisis core on psp. I would do the same with the remake haha
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Came in to say this.

I remember saving my allowance to buy FF7. I probably skipped a few launches."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,I remember showing my dad the footprints in the snow and how realistic it was
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,That's the first game that got me into RPGs.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,It‚Äôs funny because the new FF7 is how I saw the original when I played it as a kid.  My head would probably explode if I saw this back then.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,This. I member buying the og on day 1 from toys r us
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Great answer
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,Specifically the Gongaga chapter.¬†
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,Yep. OG FF7 is my favorite game of all time. I would've been floored and gone full Jackie Chan head explosion meme.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,As some one who didn't really like the remake I do wonder if my high school self would have enjoyed the game more. Considering Final Fantasy hadn't lost its identity yet I wonder if the changes in story and game play would have been more acceptable since traditional Final Fantasy games were still coming out.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,The loss of gaming kiosks was the biggest loss to gaming stores
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"That's exactly what I came to post down to the Toys R Us!!!


Are you me?"
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Oh shit, Breath of the Wild / Tears of the Kingdom would have made my head explode"
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,I was gonna make a joke but I feel like you did it on purpose
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,HANK! HANK!! DON'T ABRIVIATE CYBERPUNK
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Please‚Ä¶. Please don‚Äôt abbreviate CyberPunk.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"HAAAANK!

HANK, DON'T ABBREVIATE CYBERPUNK.

HAAAANK!"
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,This was my answer. If 10 year old me saw cyberpunk in 1993 it would literally make my brain explode.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Came to say the same thing! I grew up playing Atari and Colecovision. Cyberpunk would definitely be jaw-dropping to 8 year old me.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"What a road CDPR did! Game is great, still playing it from time to time.

Yo CD, W3 was great storywise, can you make combat suck less please? Could be that I beat it on Death March but the combat doesn't match the rest of the game."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,this is my answer as well. post-PL cyberpunk is damn near the exact game i used to wish was real so badly as a kid.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"I thought similarly. The Neversoft Spider-Man, though a great game that holds up imo, has the most simple web swinging and fairly basic combat. Going from that to flying through the air at Mach 5 and decimating teams of symbiotes would be astounding"
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"You know, I was trying to think of some super duper graphics show-off game, and yet, the first thing that came to me for some reason was also Journey."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Oooh that's a good one
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Journey will always have a special place in my heart. The color design in that game is gorgeous.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,"Came here to say MHW.

I remember being absolutely blown away by how you could climb the very tall tree in the Ancient Forest and then destroy a dam on top to send the monster falling down several hundred meters with ZERO loading screen.

That game still feels next gen to this day."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,"I played cod 2 on gamecube when i was maybe 13. If i had played titanfall 2 right after that, it would have rocked my world. Titanfall 2 blew me away when i first played it."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Original Elite was for me, same comparison would work though"
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,Especially in VR.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,Hands down the exact game I would take back!!
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,"""okay little dude, this game I'm about to show you is one of the most popular games on the planet. People have spent countless hours playing it. I just started my 10th playthrough of it in 2024. Personally, it's one of our favorites."" 

*Stardew valley opens*

Little me: ""WTF dude... You serious?"""
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,That or Shovel Knight
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,Young me would've called it a Harvest Moon knockoff.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Yea, my pre-teen self would have a hard time processing hentai dating sims."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"My younger self would be appalled that I'm not playing Diablo 4, but instead addicted to building a factory in satisfactory.

ETA: my answer would be D2R. Younger me would be so hyped I still occasionally play the same game as I did back then."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"NES and SNES was peak gaming.

Fact."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"I can appreciate early Warzone, not my choice but I get it.

Big map, massive lobby, MW2019 gunplay and movement."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Nintendo game working good on Nintendo device is not that big. The fact that Switch can run Witcher 3 so good is nothing, but miracle for me."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Solid reply. 

BotW isn't a powerhouse game, but to show it off as a ***Gameboy*** game?"
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,If you took this game back to the 90s or before there would be immediate congressional hearings
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"I would definitely choose Elden Ring, partly for ""wow it looks so amazing"" but also to flex on my younger self who I don't think could handle the difficulty."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"This is what I was thinking. Helldivers on 7+ with the orbital laser, 500kg, napalm barrage, etc. just wasting hordes of bugs on a cool alien world... I'd lose my mind as a kid"
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"""If you like Elden Ring, you'll LOVE DS3.""

I don't care about making money, I just loooove to sell carpet."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,"RE2R would've made my younger self be impressed and terrified by seeing how hyper realistic and high resolution the game is when compared to the Resident Evil titles I started with at the time: 3, 4, Code Veronica X and Outbreak. Might get super scared at the zombies suddenly grabbing you and being unable to shake them off unlike the older games as they bite you; or being hunted down by the lickers or Mr. X.


Elden Ring would've taken me like 3 to 5 hours to figure out the epicness of it... and then pull a non stop 48 hours gaming session until my head and eyes would hurt lmao. But would also be super scared of facing those enemies that teleport towards you and have multiple limbs and launch themselves at you or vomit on you as well due to how creepy they look."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Same. Even though I think the newer Pok√©mon games are easy, repetitive, cash-grabs now, my younger self would have been totally blown away. Especially with the open-world stuff."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,"Seconded.


And also, PORTAL."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,"Honestly any of Bethesda's games would have been my choice. Especially Starfield today, but 14 year old me in the 90s would have wanted Skyrim"
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"As a bonus, you could tell your younger self that in the last 18 years, game graphics have only gotten ""marginally better"" than this game, which is why you chose it."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,I would go with GTA 5 as well. As a kid I remember playing GTA 3 and Vice City. They were awesome.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Actually, that's a point, just VR in general. My younger self would have been blown away by the tech. Hell, even the Wii amazed me when it came out."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,You gonna terrify the poor kid they'll piss themselves n then spend all night crying whilst sitting in their wet pants!
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,"Was my first thought too, didn‚Äôt see it so I searched the chat. I would have lost my damn mind knowing I could take a mobile device around town and find Pok√©mon using gps. I mean smart phones weren‚Äôt even a thing either. Still a big Pok√©mon fan, I started in the red and blue days and was super into as a kid."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,I played ultimate Spider-Man so many times!!
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,Good answer!
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,I'm sorry they are both fun/addictive games.... but you would use Farmville as a mind blowing example of modern gaming?
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"This is actually a really interesting answer. 

Instead of showing some modern AAA blockbuster running on a modem machine, show off Doom being played on a refrigerator, or the entire NES, SNES, Genesis, and N64  libraries being held on a plastic wafer the size of a quarter."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"You should, and the straight away play Half Life Alyx"
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,"Quest 3 currently, connected wirelessly to a PC. Pretty happy with it, honestly. The pancake lenses are pretty nice compared to Fresnels that are still on most other headsets. The price is decent."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,"Most people can train past it. Took me several months for it to get usable. But I went from being sick as a dog after 20 mins to being able to play 4 hrs in one sitting.

Thing is, it's the same with most tech. I'm old enough to remember the old flickering CRT monochrome amber monitors and the first mechanical computer mice being introduced. Those were a pain too. My eyes were red like coals from the monitor's raster. And I had hand cramps from the mouse. It was huge and heavy, with a rubber-coated steel ball on the bottom, that you had to roll across the mousepad, and it mechanically rubbed against two rods with flywheels on them, and those flickering in front of sensors is what gave you the X and Y deltas. Had to open it up and scrape the cat hair and gunk off the rods all the time. It was brutal. And that's basically where VR is these days, relatively speaking. So it'll only get better. It's already moving scary fast. We went from no Quest line at all to Quest 3, 3 generations of a headset, in just 4 years.

Also most people start very young these days. Kids have screens, keyboards mice, etc., in their hands by like age 3-4. I saw a little kid on the subway just doomscrolling on a smartphone and she was maybe 4, at most. And if you start young, you just don't remember the eye strain and hand cramps when you grow up. It's the same in VR. VR spaces are full of kids right now (actually a pretty big problem, too many games have just screeching kids). But because they started young, they don't really get as much VR nausea. Once VR expands, and kids start using at an even younger age, it just won't be an issue at all. It's us old dinosaurs adapting to completely new tech that hurts, but kids are very adaptable. 

Also, hopefully, passthrough will take off. It's definitely handy and they're pushing it hard because once the units are scaled down to be light enough to be an everyday wearable, it's what's going to replace smartphones (or at least move them permanently into your pocket). It's much less nausea inducing. The apps that use it currently are still mostly rudimentary, but the potential is definitely there. Drop Dead: The Cabin has a passthrough invasion mode where you set some virtual doors and windows in your otherwise real home, and then defend it as monsters try to break through. So you see your regular home environment, in color (black & white on Quest 2, and very grainy, but it's smooth and in color on Quest 3 and 3S).

Oh, and did you know your Quest 2 is night vision goggles? If you get an infra-red light source, and put the Quest 2 on in passthrough, you can see in the dark. IR isn't visible to naked eye, but Quest 2 sees it fine. Doesn't work on Quest 3, because it's in color the passthrough only shows visible light. Can still use it in the dark with IR light, it's fine for tracking, but you just won't be able to see anything real, because it only shows what human eye sees. So Quest 2 in some ways was very neat. Like finding my cat in the back yard late in the evening when he refuses to come back inside. Put the headset on, turn on IR floodlight. Don't wake the neighbors but find the cat just fine."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,"For PC VR, not really, at least I don't think so.

Valve basically threw in the towel and gave up on VR. They still make headsets, but not software. Alyx was 4+ years ago, and they did jack shit since. They just announced a $1,000 headset with Fresnel lenses, and I have no idea who for or how they expect to sell it, when Quest 3 has crystal clear pancake lenses at literally half the price. And Oculus and Sony are pulling in different directions with their exclusivity bullshit.

So on Playstation we got PSVR2 and a bunch of nice stuff like Resident Evil VR ports. And on Oculus Quest we got a bunch of Android mobile-looking stuff like Asgard's Wrath 2, Assassin's Creed Nexus, etc. Which aren't bad per se, at least Wrath 2 was pretty good, but it looks like shit compared to 2019 PC VR original. Because it runs standalone on what is basically a smartphone strapped to your face.

There's been some nice games. Arizona Sunshine 2 was pretty great, and they're releasing a full remake of the original next week (you can just buy an upgrade if you own the original). Lone Echo 2 came out, for PC VR, and for that grievous sin Meta shut down that studio completely, because they wouldn't play ball and go full Android mobile like Meta wants. Moss 2 came out, also really good.

Lots of ports too. I've been playing Deep Rock Galactic in VR and it's fantastic, there's even gesture controls, body holsters, the works. Also the Flat2VR guys that do ports actually started their own studio, so far they ported some Trombone game and are currently working on RoboQuest port which looks pretty promising.

Next few months also look somewhat promising. This month is Batman Arkham Shadows (Oculus exclusive, I think), but next month there's Metro: Awakening, that one is multiplatform. Basically Metro 2033 in VR, and might be the closest thing to Alyx competitor. In December is Behemoth (from the guys who did Saints and Sinners), which is vaguely reminiscent of Shadows of Colossus, but not really. And Alien: Rogue Incursion, but it's from a studio that did Battlewake and Walking Dead: Onslaught, so not exactly known for quality.

Indie side of it is also doing fairly decent. Still mostly low-effort roguelites, but some were quite decent, like The Light Brigade. Quality is spotty, of course, but there's some interesting stuff happening. Like sequel for Into the Radius, with co-op this time. It is still very much early access, but looks promising. Blade & Sorcery finally released its version 1.0 with progression and campaign. Still doesn't feel like a proper game, but it's not a tech demo any more.

I wouldn't say things didn't get better since Alyx, it's just the exclusivity bullshit that's hurting us now. Sony has some nice stuff, and Oculus has some nice stuff, but they're all exclusive to those platforms. Asgard's Wrath 2 is an honest 30-40 hr platformer/puzzler game with some combat and very basic (nonsensical) story. But it's exclusive to Oculus Quest series. If you don't got one, you're just shit out of luck. Same with Sony. Luckily upcoming Metro, Behemoth and some others are all multiplatform.

Also if you liked Alyx, check out the Steam Workshop for it. There's some STUNNING mods for that one, including basically a whole new campaign that's almost as good as the original. And some mods were so good that they're being made into standalone games, like Gunman Contracts. And Half Life 2 was also fully ported to VR and free on Steam (fan-made though, not Valve's work, the Flat2VR guys I mentioned earlier helped publish it)."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"That's probably the only coherent reaction at the time bro. But go back a bit, instead of San Andreas, make it Vice City."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,Just like red dead 1

1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Yeah, the remake fell flat for me too. I don't care if this makes me seem like an old stick in the mud but I wish it was actually just a remake. Not a reimagining. UI and quality of life improvements... that's it. It was FF7 I fell in love with, not Kingdom Hearts busting through the door and dumping on your past.

(Edit: If the Reddit community could just indulge me here and keep the upvotes at 7, that would be swell)"
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,"I wonder the same thing too. My younger self might adored what he saw. I wasn't totally into FF then and it's gameplay and style wasn't a thing I took as much notice of as it was the first of it's ilk I'd ever played (FF7 being the first FF game released in the UK). Only thing I might have wondered is ""Why is it multiple games?"" when the first was just one game on multiple discs."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,They still have them at both the GameStop's near me

1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,Journey was such a remarkable memorable game. Loved it.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,Still Is.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"I can remember when ELITE released. it was like a whole new level... no more side scrolling/platform  ""3D"" computer games.  :)"
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,What went wrong later
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,"Wait, you didn't play those browser games as a child?"
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,Maybe he means handheld game. Back then us game boy players were mesmerized simply by the game gear‚Äôs color tv screen.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,They'd skip the hearings and go straight to sentencing
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,People freaked out when the original game released so I think they would just explode immediately
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,Idk all of my childhood games looked amazing at their time
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Exactly, the amount of sheer spectacle that just casually happens all the time amazes me even now. My brain would have detonated if I saw that back when the most exciting thing I ever played was Jak 2."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"It's funny, the 3D modeled Pokemon games we get now are the kind of thing I dreamed of as a kid playing Pokemon Yellow, but because they happened gradually over time, there was never a point where it really felt like a big deal."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,It‚Äôs crazy how ahead of its time Crysis was.
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,"Exactly - I think every kid from the 90s/00s thought of the general concept of Pokemon Go at some point. I mean even look at how popular it was when it first came out, and it still is 8 years later. As cool as some of the other games posted are, they mainly are because of their graphics, story, audio, etc. Pokemon Go would have been insane because of the concept. I still think it‚Äôs crazy!!"
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Well ya, if I could show my current farm to demonstrate what‚Äôs possible it would seriously ‚Äúwow‚Äù my younger self"

Are you talking about red dead revolver? That was the 1st red dead.....    
Or are you referring to the first red dead redemption?"
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-12,"Perfectly said.


They've stretched the game so much to make it into 3 games... then instead of using any of that time to let the story breathe they turn every scene into a 2 hour chapter of the game complete with its own wacky cast, over the top caricatures of the OG characters, and a boss fight. 2 screen mine from ff7? 2 hour dungeon crawl in rebirth. That's the best example of stretching.¬†


The worst is the Shinra ship being turned from a tense undercover mission with a decent horror moment to a goddamn cruise ship with a card tournament.¬†"

1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,"I wasnt being a ""well akshually"".     
I was literally just asking what red dead you're talking about. There are a bunch of people that love red dead but have no idea that red dead revolver was even a thing...    you can't be that dense can you???

Edit: Im sorry. Saying red dead 1 means absolutely nothing to me unless made specific. Again, there are people that think the first red dead is the first redemption. Sorry you're just a dense individual that can't differentiate a statement from a question.


Edit edit: Grammer"
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,"Back when revolver came out, I was the only kid in school that played it. I honestly loved revolver. It was a pretty great game. Red dead 1 was better. Red dead 2 is just simply one of those games that never gets old even with time. I'm on my 6th play thru of rd2."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,"When people are talking about RDR2 and someone mentions Red Dead 1, hopefully you can use context clues. Revolver is such a different game that you need to specify it if that‚Äôs the one you‚Äôre talking about. They‚Äôre basically the same franchise in name."
1g22i0z,2024-10-12,2024-10-13,I get the context. I will always know RDR to be the first Red Dead. RDR-RD2 all made by rockstar. I consider them the same franchise.
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-02-28,The story will emotionally dick punch you
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-02-28,"I really enjoyed it, although it was tough to ignore the fact that you spent the whole game going 'omg the rats followed us and hurt innocent people.. let's go to another place with innocent people'"
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-02-28,"It's an A-tier game from a visual and narrative perspective, which will be enough for some. Personally I think the moment to moment gameplay isn't on the same level as the others you're comparing it with, but maybe that's because I'm not a big stealth game guy. Still, I completed it in its entirety and am glad I did! I'd give it an 8.5/10 myself."
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-02-28,"It is a great game, the environmental graphics are top tier."
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-02-28,"Amazing game, ending made me cry"
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-02-28,It was my Game of the year easily.
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-02-28,Wasn‚Äôt expecting to fall in love with he first game. I was so close to kinda just turning it off and on first impression (first 5 mins) I kinda was meh but after the first 30 I was hooked. They really made so much of this game better in the sequel! Can‚Äôt wait for what‚Äôs next for Amicia and Hugo! I kinda wanna see a new plague‚Ä¶. Birds?
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-02-28,Agreed. Amazing game
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-02-28,"Good game, but bad PC performance pissed a lot of people off. Have they fixed it yet ?"
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-02-28,I got bored after 3 hours. Hopefully I'll get back to it one day.
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-03-01,Underrated forsure. Amiciaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-02-28,"I honestly found the sequel to be annoying. Like they were trying to force you to be depressed by rehashing the same points of contention over and over again. You think there's been some catharsis/development in the characters, but then they're right back to square one. I knew how it was going to end about an hour into it."
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-03-01,"Part of me wants to play the first game, but at the same time, I am just never convinced enough. So much praise though."
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-03-01,"I think the first Plague Tale was better from a gameplay perspective. You were doing a lot more in that game, this game has a lot more slow walk-around sections than the first. Although I love the addition of the crossbow in Requiem. I think the story is pretty good in both games but I‚Äôd still give the edge to the first one in that regard. Requiem has better graphics obviously."
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-03-01,"I played innocence a couple of months ago. Immediately bought requiem but was a bit fatigued of the gameplay. But this is a good reminder to go back and play that game again, the first one was amazing!"
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-02-28,Neither Elder ring nor god of war I liked. And this one however is a jewel for me. this saga is in my top of sagas.
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-02-28,It was a pretty great game.....that ending was rough
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-02-28,Very underrated series
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-02-28,"Its just looked at differently because its not as famous as those other games you mentioned. But the game deserves its spot next to those games, as their equal. Most beautiful story I‚Äôve experienced."
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-03-01,"It's ok but the gameplay still feels a bit shallow to me. Very beautiful graphics and good voice performances. But just like the first one, it couldn't hold my attention to the end because the gameplay wasn't interesting enough even though the story was good. I think I stopped 10 hours in."
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-02-28,Thanks for posting this. I really enjoyed Innocense and I'm really looking forward to this.
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-02-28,I see this all the time‚Ä¶what do people use to determine what is appreciated vs under appreciated?
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-03-01,Nope. Not for me.
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-02-28,"I'm 130 hours into the Witcher 3 next gen update and about ready to move onto something else. I want to play this, but stepping down from 60 to 30 fps on PS5 is going to be brutal on me eyes!"
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-02-28,I will definitely check it out then
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-03-01,"I just finished it. At certain times, it is a beautiful looking game. But usually (like the screenshot pictured) you are just walking, so you have no choice but to take in the beauty. I was kinda mixed on everything. Good things and annoying things. I would still recommend it."
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-03-01,The graphic set up is gorgeous in my opinion. I have been eyeing this game for some time.
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-03-01,"Eh I‚Äôm a fromsimp and gow was overrated, haven‚Äôt checked this out but only heard good things"
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-03-01,what da rat doin
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-03-01,It's a shame they couldn't get some facial capture technology for the facial animations in the game. They looked especially rough in the first one. It kinda held back the performances of the cast from both which were really great. I was actually rooting for Amicia's actress to win best performance in the Game Awards but that's because I haven't played GOW: Ragnarok yet.
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-03-01,"I was playing the first on on game pass, and it left game pass before I could finish it. So now I have to buy the first one to finish it, but from what I've heard, it's an amazing play, and I've managed to avoid spoilers for the sequel so far, so maybe soon. I did love what I saw of the first one though, such a beautiful game."
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-03-01,"good game, gameplay got very stale tough"
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-03-01,"Nah its not under appreciated, it just couldnt compete with all those other titles at the same time. Not saying i hate it, i thought it was at least an enjoyable experience, but failed to make me think about it when all those other games were options too.

Games of comparable but varying quality get released all the time. Newer games only usually get good rep if they A. Fill a gap in a release window somewhere in the year or B. Release alongside a triple A game that is shit and so it gets everyone's focused and energy turned towards itself.

Take heart knowing people keep talking about the game so frequently, that its annoying when there are post claiming it wasnt appreciated when it clearly was/is."
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-03-01,"Great game, finished it yesterday. Weird that no youtuber that I watch talks about it."
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-03-01,"I don't think it was underrated- the story, graphics and voice acting were given heaps of praise. Deservedly.

It's just inherently silly to compare it to these huge budget epic games.

Elden Ring is this massive combat-heavy brutal RPG thing and has absolutely nothing in common with Plague Tale other than that they are both video games.

What Ragnarok has in common is the narrative-heavy aspect and the fact that you're playing as leader driven to protect a younger. So like Last of Us as well. But in terms of actual gameplay it's just nothing alike.

Horizon was never a serious contender for best of anything, I actually think that one got a little crapped on but that's a whole other story.

I guess they're all 3rd person games, that's what they have in common? But so are like a third of all games so \*shrug\*"
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-03-02,It would have been best if it supported 60FPS..
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-03-01,"I always say this game spent the first half seeing how much emotional and psychological trauma it could inflict on the player, and the second half was seeing how much it could inflict on amicia as well"
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-03-01,I'm playing it right now and can't help thinking I'm playing the bad guy!
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-05-07,"I may be a psychopath, but I didn't feel anything about people dying, if anything I was glad that so many people died, most of the people on this game were evil garbage (except for some people like the florist on the first town, the priest that helps you to run from the count's men during the procession), I felt more empathy for NPCs on Cyberpunk 2077 (and they are all almost scum)."
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-03-01,"I haven't played either game, but I notice so much more emphasis on story by players than anybody talking about gameplay outside of PVP games. Wanna talk RPGs? Never anybody talking about gameplay."
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-03-01,I use a 3060 ti at 3440x1440 and I got a very consistent 60+ fps on high settings on day 1. What were the issues?
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-03-01,I have a 1080 with a Ryzen 7 5800x and it ran really well for me and looked great at 1440p. I believe they have a resolution scaler built into the game that I was using as well.
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-03-01,"I tried it with a 1060 and 12 GB RAM and it played like shit.  I still have the 1060 but now have 32 GB RAM and get 50-70 fps on maybe medium-high settings (motion blur, bloom, etc. off)"
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-03-01,"I agree with you on this. It did look great, but they really tried to ram sentimentality down your throat to create an emotional ending, instead it just really annoyed me. I couldn't stand that high pitched whiner Hugo from pretty early on."
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-03-01,Just try it. Its a unique experience. I was getting bored of most AAA games feeling all the same. These two games were breath of fresh air.
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-03-01,"I was like you and skeptical as well. I only picked up the first game when it got a physical release on PS5 after the 2nd game was out. 

Took me 3 or 4 days maybe and I gotta say I very much enjoyed my time with it. Nothing groundbreaking but it's a good story, the stealth felt good if a tad repetitive, but yeah it was a good time. Now I'm waiting for a discount to scoop up the 2nd one. Give it a shot!

Oh also, I put the language in French because it's a french game. And the english voices annoyed me 3 minutes into it."

11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-02-28,"If you do, play the first game first: A Plague Tale Innocence."
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-03-01,">I always say this game spent the first half seeing how much emotional and psychological trauma it could inflict on the player

I gave up on the endless ""hide and seek"" right at the start. No clear way forward, I lost interest."
11edyb3,2023-02-28,2023-03-01,"Yeah, I'd say that the gameplay is ""fine"" but it heavily centers on puzzle-solving and stealth for the most part, which are not my cup of tea. So your mileage may vary. It's a very linear experience minus a few sections in the second game. 

I will say that there are some pretty unique elements to the gameplay that make it stand out - namely using the rats and the lighting system that makes for some interesting stealth. Haven't played a game quite like it before.

That said, while the games do build on their gameplay elements as they progress (particularly the second one), it does start to feel like a bit of a same-y grind in the final few hours. But the story is good enough that you'll likely want to play until the end, which is great!

All in all, I'd recommend it to most gamers that like a good narrative experience. It's an experience I won't soon forget, even if I very likely wouldn't play it again."

17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,It's so sad to me that Ratchet & Clank don't have the relevance they used to have.
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Never seen it referred to as the Playstation Four

17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,So the the 4 most generic popular games
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,Bloodborne tops them all.

2) The Last of Us Part 2

3) Uncharted 4

4) Horizon Zero Dawn

5) Bloodborne

6) Spider-Man

17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Ghost of Tsushima is the best PS4 game to ever come out.  It's the only game I've platinumed twice (expansion added achievements).
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Ghost of Tsushima was the perfect last game on PS4 for me. Perfect game - period.
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,I bought a PS4 for Bloodborne lol
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Where blood Borne or dark souls 3?
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,PS4 is the Bloodborne machine

17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,how the fuck is bloodborne not on this list. it's the biggest reason to buy a ps4. go to your room and think about what you've done.
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Downvote all you want but Ragnar√∂k was pinnacle mediocre storytelling. 

My biggest disappointment in gaming."

17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Nothing for Nier Automata?
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Death Stranding and Detroit: Become Human are two of my favorites to add to this.. Though they did come to PC.

17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Horizon Zero Dawn defines the PS4 era for me. One of my top favorite games of all time.
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,I got a PS4 when Ghost of Tsushima came out. Knowing it was going to be the last Ps4 exclusive I felt it was appropriate to finally get a PS4 and start collecting that generation of games I missed out on.
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,GHOST OF TSUSHIMA!!!!!

17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Is it odd that I just realized I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen someone spell out the word ‚Äúfour‚Äù when talking about the PS4? Lol
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Wow, such a miserable display"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Omg yes rdr2
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Ragnarok and RD2 don't belong on this list.
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,One game that defined ps for me bloodbourne. It‚Äôs not trying to be a cinematic movie. It‚Äôs a game and it‚Äôs fun to play.
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"lol i thought these were all on PS3 as well. PS4 defined literally zero for me. I will always refer to the PS4, as the 'dark ages or the 'lost era'"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Are you referring to the Bloodborne Box? Everything else was kind of just okay. No offense, but you have the 'basic' taste on par with a white girl ordering a pumpkin spice latte

 I guess Red Dead 2 and Persona 5 we're kind of neat, but nothing that blew my socks off on PS4 besides BB. Honestly, Crash Team Racing is a better game than most of what you listed

It feels like for every mediocre game I played on my PS4, there was a handful of great PC releases. I'm probably not going to be buying any consoles going forward since my Switch is already good for house party games"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"My comparatively recent journey with my PS4 gave me those four games I've played the most on it:

\- Uncharted 4 (2020)

\- Persona 5 Royal (2023)

\- Persona 5 Strikers (2023)

My favorite game from that era is Horizon: Zero Dawn, but I've played it on PC."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,I think RDR2 is what defined any console gamer
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,I like your post.

17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,RDR2 was cross platform. Replace that with Horizon Zero Dawn and this is fine.
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"I wouldn‚Äôt say RDR2 since it‚Äôs multiplat, I played it on an Xbox. Mine would be Bloodborne ofc and TLOU 1, GOW 2018 and Spider-Man 2018 I‚Äôd say were much more impactful and defining than their sequels."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Mine are

Spider-Man

Ghost of Tsushima

Uncharted 4

GTA 5"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"For me it‚Äôs these four.

RDR2- literally just a masterpiece of a game. Great story, characters, setting, and everything

Bloodborne- My first soulsborne game, the first one I actually completed too. The setting and atmosphere still gets me to this day.

GOW 2018- Great game, the story was great, gameplay was fun. Father son bonding was great. 

Marvel‚Äôs Spider-Man- Probably some of the best, most fun, smooth, and fluid movement I‚Äôve ever seen in a video game. Plus it‚Äôs just the most definitive Spider-Man experience anyone could have at the time. Still is tbh."

17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"In my case was God of War, Spiderman, Mortal Kombat 11 and Fortnite"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Bloodborne is the only game I own for my ps4, and I will never ever buy another console. Bloodborne is the pure reason to own this console"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"I bought a ps4 in covid just to experience some of the games i've  missed out. GoW, spiderman, ghost of tsushima were just incredible. the feels and just pure quality was breath taking, and got me through some tough times

Uncharted however is overrated ass though in my opinion. puzzles? nah just fight waves of enemies on repeat"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,God of War Ragnarok defined what it's like to be treated like a severe moron by a game for the first time in my life.
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Ghost of Tsushima, Bloodborne and Helldivers
Those are the real banger exclusives."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Why would rdr define PlayStation? It was on other platforms
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Bloodborne, ghost of tsushima, dark souls 3, and rdr2"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Ghost of Tsushima was the final send-off for PS4. That‚Äôs definitely gotta be up there. For me it probably replaces U4 because I‚Äôve never played those games
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Ghost of Tsushima, God of War, Spiderman1, Bloodborne"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"OP: Do you know what games are good? The most well known and highly rated games. Give me upvotes

Edit: Excellent photo captures"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Bloodborne.
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Horizon, Ghost of Tsushima, Rdr2, and Spider-Man for me"

17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Ghost of Tsushima, Horizon zero dawn, bloodborne, and god of war for me"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,god of war and spiderman are the reason i didnt buy a playstation this gen. incredibly disappointing exclusives for me sadly
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Last of us series, Ghost of T, Gow series,Anything Quantic Dream."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,I get goosebumps thinking about my first ever experience with RDR 2
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"ghost of tsushima, spooderman, gow, rdr2"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,GHOST OF TSUSHIMA Is a goddamn masterpiece
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"God of War Ragnarok PS4?

I think you might be a little late for that, just because it released on PS4 it doesn‚Äôt mean it was a PS4 era game"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,My aging ps4 now only exists as a Bloodborne machine
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Replace Red Dead 2 with Bloodborne and I'd agree.
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,W
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,I miss the OG. Infamous Second Son my beloved
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,The last of us should be there as well
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"For ps4? Probably Spider-Man, God of War (2018), Ghost of Tsushima and Infamous Second Son(my first PS4 game and first ever platinum)."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Are we going with PS exclusives? 

If so - Bloodborne, Spider-Man, God of War, Ghost of Tsushima."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,What makes you think anyone cares?
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,but rdr2 isn't a ps exclusive ?
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,I‚Äôd change god of war for bloodborne personally and change uncharted for ghost of Tsushima or death stranding
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"For me it was Spider-Man Miles Morales, the Last of us II, RDR2, and Fallout 4 (with the last being definitive in a bad way, in that it showed off the limitations of playstation as compared to Xbox and pc)"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"I'd replace uncharted and rdr with bloodborne and ghost of tsushima personally, I never really cared for uncharted and I played both rdr games on xbox."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Would it be more PlayStation if it‚Äôs only PlayStation exclusive though?
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,How old are you pony's? I was thinking people would like at least link games from the original PlayStation or even even PS2 cuz that's when the games really Define the console what would come in the future. For PlayStation growing up it was a metal gear solid siphon filter Tony Hawk Pro Skater and Final Fantasy. Linking these New Age games that everyone has. PSA I haven't bought a console in two decades pcmr
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,I literally purchased my PS4 just to play uncharted 4. Got bored with many of the other games midway and it's lying in a corner now collecting dust.
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,I wanted to enjoy spider man games so bad.  Truth be told though they are no where near as good as the arkham games.  Second truth be told both are button mashers. Lol but yeah Spiderman games are really boring imo.
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Last of us? ‚òπÔ∏è
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,i literally have the same uncharted screenshot but in blue
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Didn't know that rdr2 was a ps exclusive
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Ghost of tsushima and horizon zero dawn were also fantastic.
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,I just decided to play H:ZD because of my PS Plus Extra
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Why RDR2? It's not ps exclusiv.
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,I don‚Äôt recall the level where Nathan plunges to hell
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,No the last of us :0
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,No Bloodborne üò†
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,The Witcher 3. I was never the same after this.
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,No Bloodborne
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,For me bloodborne was massive in getting me into playstation and it's exclusive as well as from software game
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Where the fuck is tlou part 2? That thing pushed the absolute limits of the last generation. Regardless of personal opinion, it is a technical masterpiece."

17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,PS4's whole thing was Bloodborne for a good 4 years or something like that until SpiderMan came out.
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Mine would Haze, Uncharted Ratchet and Clank and Resistance"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,RDR2.   Spider-Man.   Ghost of Tsushima.  Days Gone.
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"FF7 remake defined PS4 for me. I admit i was sceptical about the remake but I never thought I would love it that much.

Spiderman is a honorable mention."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Okay, but who in the seven hells writes ‚ÄúPlayStation Four‚Äù?? Psychos living among with people who eat KitKats without breaking them up that‚Äôs who."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Mortal Kombat, Pro Evolution Soccer, Fifa games and NBA games... And that is in the 90's... :)"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Ghost of Tsushima should really be a part of this conversation.
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Why red dead up there?
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Like:

1. God of war
2. Spider Man
3. Ghost of Tsushima"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Nahh , put some respect on Little Big Planet!!"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"For me (based on overall memorable experience):

- Red Dead Redemption 2
- The Last of Us & Part 2
- Bloodborne

- God of War & Ragnar√∂k
- Elden Ring
- RE7
- Until Dawn"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Days Gone would be one for me
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Without Ghost this is wack. 

I LOVE RDR2 but...it's not PS4 exclusive."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,one of these ain't even exclusive üò≠
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Where Death Stranding?
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"For me it was:

‚Ä¢ Prey (2017)

‚Ä¢ DOOM (2016)

‚Ä¢ Fallout 4 (2015)

‚Ä¢ Wolfenstein: The New Order (2014)

Not exactly sure why. Just when I think of the eighth generation of consoles, those titles stick with me more than anything else. Great picks though, OP."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"I've only played the left 2, but they're a couple of my all time favorites."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"TLOU2 is the only game in my life I finished back to back twice. The story might not be as strong as the first one, the relationships may be a bit more ""plasticy"".... but damn it its beautiful as all hell. 
And the gunplay and enemies is unlike anything I've seen. Really made me feel like im in the shit with those two. 
It will forever stay in my heart as a wonderful experience."

Not saying its a bad game, but it hardly ran good on the PS4, especially considering the fact that it caused the PS4 to go into fuckin overdrive and overheat it to the point where you could pour water over the top of the console and it would vaporise immediately"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,100% agreed but there's are dozens of better shots from Uncharted4 to use.
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"bloodborne, horizon, gow 2018, ghost of Tsushima, TLOU 2"

17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"For me it‚Äôs God of war, RDR2, Spider-Man 1 and Ghost Of Tsushima"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,Red dead is not a ps exclusive.
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-15,Gran Turismo is pretty iconic also
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-15,"FIFA  
Football (Soccer) is the biggest sport in the world and EA made everlasting cash flow for generations. I wonder how much it contributes to the console alone or gaming in general."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Bloodborne deserves so much praise, such a masterpiece... But almost made me throw my controller out of the window, and I hate it so much. But I love it."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Same bro, I bought a PS4 in 2016 specifically to play Bloodborne, for one year it was my one and only game and to this day it has never been uninstalled"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Bloodborne is the only game I kept my PS4 for, back then.

Such a masterpiece."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Last game I played on ps4 was Batman Arkham Knight in 2016 I think
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"The only reason I got a PS4 was to play Bloodborne. 

Hell, I think there was still a video store renting consoles at the time and I rented a PS4 and had bought Boodborne because I had to wait till the end of the month to afford my own PS4"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"It was Horizon zero dawn for me, made me buy a ps4. Than my wife saw me playing, had to buy another ps4 lol."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Man I wish I could get into that game.
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,I can‚Äôt count the amount of times I finished ng in Bloodborne. Truly mesmerising game
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Any good??
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Same. I bought the PS4 to play Bloodborne. I‚Äôve since played RDR2, TLOU, GTAV and some other games, but it would have been worth it only for Bloodborne. What a masterpiece that is."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,I thought Ragnarok was just okay. 2018 was so much better. Revisiting the same world with a rushed story and poor pacing didn‚Äôt do it for me.
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"How is it ‚Äúmore of a ps5 game‚Äù. It‚Äôs a ps4 and ps5 game equally. 

I mean ps5 ‚Äúupgrades‚Äù are the equivalent of the remasters that we got during Gen 7 to Gen 8. Nothing makes it exclusively more of a ps4 game or more of a ps5 game. It‚Äôs a cross gen game."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"In my opinion, Ragnarok completed what 2018 started. And also I believe that it is a PS4 game that runs beautifully on PS5 at 120fps"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,OP took the screenshot in Mexico.
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,It‚Äôs in the Chapter ‚ÄúMarooned‚Äù and takes place when Nate gets shipwrecked onto Turtle Island

17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"No, that's obviously the King Kong game."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Yep, I love spiderman alot but no way is it better than ghost of tsushima when looking at PS coverstars."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Under the rug where sony keeps sweeping it for some reason. Why ignore such an obvious money printer? Just bump it up to 60 on ps5 or make a sequel, it would sell so fucking fast"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,OP might just not have played it or it wasn‚Äôt their favorite. It is a possibility
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Thank you.
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,where it belongs
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Not there, because it doesn‚Äôt belong there."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,All of these games except for GOW ragnarok are out on pc. GOW ragnarok will likely follow soon too since the original GOW also got a pc release
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"r/IndianGaming, that's how. No matter the question, RDR2 is the answer for those folks."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"I think the OP is talking about their experience, not defining the platform based just on exclusive titles.  When they think back in 10 years on the PS4, these are the games they played and stood out the most."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Maybe because he played in PS4M the point of the post is to show what games Made him love the PS4(?)
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,But that logic anything Xbox is not definable

17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Rift Apart is one of my fav PS5 games. The remake from 2016 was just fine imo. I had never played the old ones but Rift Apart definitely makes it easy me to become a new fan. I just don‚Äôt think a game like that has ‚Äústaying power‚Äù when compared to some of the other franchises. Still an incredible game and historic PlayStation franchise that deserves the respect
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"I agree, but I‚Äôm also glad that Insomniac themselves haven‚Äôt become any less relevant.  I miss the ps2 era R&C games but it‚Äôs hard to complain when we also have Spider-Man now"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,TLOU 2 to me was the perfect send off for my ps4 right before the ps5 came out.
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-15,Now yes but not at the time
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-15,what would you put?
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Fair, if OP played it only on PS imo. It was an impressive game on that hardware."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,It also was released on ps4
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-15,">what would you put on your list since youre so ""different"""
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Uncharted 4
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,I think they only wanted to put good games on there
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Exactly what I was thinking, but that's what makes it awesome!"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"You should! RDR 2 is a masterpiece, and it's on PC too. There is no reason(Other than low end PC) for you to not play it"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Underrated game. It doesnt get enough love.
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Overrated game. It doesn‚Äôt get enough hate.
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Uhh no? All of these games can be played on ps4
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Yeah how dare people have fun right? Just fuck everyone tbh
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,Uncharted and TLOU are pretty great experiences.
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Do you seriously think these are the only 4 games OP has played? Lmao
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13, Dude stop making assumptions he prob played more
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Rdr2, uncharted 4, and Spider-Man 1 are on pc yes"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,Cuz RDR2 is amazing.
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"That was mostly a PS3 series. The only purely PS4 game, LBP3, did worse than its predecessors. Those were good times, tho."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Still building bridges to get here
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"Uncharted 4 apparently. OP must have used a filter in photo mode, because I don't recall visiting Hell."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Bloodborne is the only soulslike game I've managed to actually finish. You didn't had to get good,just level up enough to get further in the gameüòä
Still don't know why there's no next gen upgrade."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,FUCK THOSE SHARK OGRES I HATE THEM THEY DISH OUT SO MUCH DAMAGE AND HAVE SO MUCH HEALTH THERE LIKE BOSSES
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"Ive kind of lost patience in trying to ""get gud"" with FS games. Now I just try and find the easiest way to overlevel with an OP build. Thankfully, I found such an exploit with BB. someone has a chalice dungeon where I could get 80xp per visit."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Same, played the living shit out of bloodborne and then sold my PS4 :p"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Try FromSoft's other games.

As the other commenter pointed out, you need to find your entry game. Then you adapt to like other things. For me, it was Elden Ring."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"I bought it cuz I was sure I would like it but bounced off it super hard, even resold it to GameStop. I just couldn‚Äôt get it out of my mind, though, so I watched a letsplay just to see what I was missing. It was like something clicked. I re-bought the game and just tore through it ‚Äî it was exciting but horrifying, empowering but so challenging. I just needed a little basic example (how to start leveling up, how to parry, etc) to really get hooked. If you‚Äôve seen a few installments of a letsplay and it still does nothing for you, that‚Äôs fine. But maybe look up a video. After all, it went from a game I returned to my first platinum"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"It didn't click for me until this year when I played armored core 6, cause I was always trying to play bloodborne like dark souls or demons souls, which is nearly the opposite of the intended playstyle. Ended up going back and beating it after ac6"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Done. Your wish has been granted. No tricks, no loopholes, no monkey paws. Go play Bloodborne now."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Same, played and completed it earlier this year and just found it meh. Did another run through of Elden Ring and fully enjoyed that. Sad Bloodborne didn‚Äôt click after hearing so much about it but it is what it is"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Respect the opinion but I think I have to disagree. The map completely changed, added more areas, gave us like 5 new worlds to explore and added more boss fights. Story seemed to fit the ending they were going for but yeah maybe a tad rushed and not as fulfilling as 2018 but still pretty epic. Not to mention The Brok storyline in Rag is one of the best ever told but you had to stick around until the end to get that. I will concede the pacing was definitely worse in Rag with Atreus, I cut my new game + in Jotenheim for this reason. So yes, 2018 definitely better, but not by as much as you think in my opinion"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Agreed, Rag was hot Garbo compared to 2018."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Is it really a PS4-defining game if it released during the PS5 era tho?
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Bros salty he couldn't play Spiderman 2.
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"It ran on PS4 at a solid 10fps. Yes, it‚Äôs on PS4 but it‚Äôs barely playable let alone enjoyed"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"True, if it came to PS4 it counts."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Well obviously, it‚Äôs the sequel lol

Nah, it‚Äôs a PS5 game that also released on PS4"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,By this logic it's a ps2 game lol
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"I don't know why you're getting shitted on like crazy. The post says ""4 games that define ps4 for ME"" but people wanna put their 2 cents in. Ragnarok was actually the final ps4 exclusive to be released if I remember correctly, which should be considered a ps4 milestone. But everyone has their own opinion on what 4 games make up their core ps4 games I guess"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"The directors of the game wanted it to always be a ps5 game but made it for ps4 as well because of the counsel shortage. 

They even said having to make it for ps4 limited them on what they wanted to do. 

So while yes, it was a ""ps4 game"" it was always meant to be made and played on a ps5."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Don't understand the downvotes, first of all this is your opinion and you marked it as such.

Secondly, as much as I love GoW:R, it really is a PS4 game that was enhanced (really well) for PS5, which probably will be more apparentl when we see an actual PS5 exclusive title from Santa Monica.

And for the record, personally I would also go for Gow2018 in my list of games that defined my PS4 experience, but I see nothing wrong with your take anyway"

17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"lmfao people really are arguing over this, 
I would say it's more of p5 game because it just got released during ps5 gen, but ofc it's not ""ps5"" game per se like burning shores dlc or spider male 2, but your opinion is also perfectly acceptable as it plays up to par on PS4"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,You are just missing out. Also it was the pony boy for the ps5 for a long time with bundles and commercials and shit. Most people are going to define it as a ps5 game despite its ps4 roots
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,It absolutely does not run at 120fps on a PS4 ü§°

17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"I think the only 2 fitting a spooderman and uncharted, because at least those were ps4 exclusive titles at launch

The other two? One launched on ps5 mainly, the other is multi-platform"

Cute I offended the PC idiots."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Uncharted was ps exclusive at launch, as was SM.

Rdr2 doesn‚Äôt belong here, but also that‚Äôs cause it‚Äôs an exceedingly mediocr game with spectacular graphics and a decent story."

17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Final Fantasy 16 and Spider-Man 2 certainly appealed to more people than Resident Evil 4, at least if you look at it purely in terms of the Playstation 5.  
Apart from that, Sony hasn't really offered much in the exclusives area this year. Hopefully that will change next year."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,You summed up Xbox in that edit tho?
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,not a single sony exclusive????
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Yeah I know that. The ps5 was out. It did not define the ps4 when it came out 9 years after the console lol
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Ah. Don't remember that bit
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"True, TLOU was really cool when it came out"

17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,It is But it doesn't define Playstation
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,You should really try dark souls 3 and elden ring
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Funny I‚Äôm the complete opposite. Finished every one except bloodborne
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Funny... I got your point, but I didn't feel like that. I felt like some enemies were so overpowered that I felt it was unfair at some points. It's my favorite in aesthetics and combat mechanics, but the game left me exhausted...More than Sekiro, which is way harder, but I managed to finish."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"Huh? Bloodborne was the first Souls game that you actually did have to get good for. They took out blocking, so everyone who learned Dark Souls the easy way (like me) had to learn how to parry. 

They also took out sniping with bows and magic so you couldn‚Äôt just stand far away and kill everything.

You should really try those games, dude. The only other actually hard one is Sekiro because it also doesn‚Äôt have shield blocking."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,RIGHT????
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"That's the thing, I don't like farming, and I don't like shortcuts to defeat a boss....So I try it again, and again, and again, and fail, fail and fail....I feel like if I were to get a shortcut, like watching an youtube video where the guy is like ""stand here, in this square, and just swing your sword"" I would be cheating, in some way.... Because it's the ""I DID IT!"" feeling, that makes it worth it. There are a lot of ways to play a FS game, and sadly, If it get's easy, I don't feel accomplishment...makes sense?"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,I played Elden Ring for 80 hours and got bored and never touched it again. I liked Sekiro but it was too hard.
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"I trick is I hated it. I paid full price, lost $10 then the guy I sold it to hated it and sold it."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Yeah the enemy variety really made me enjoy playing the game. I was so sick of fighting the same mini bosses and enemies constantly in GOW 2018. I think by the 3rd Troll I was already thinking ‚Äúokay they‚Äôve used this guy 3 times already, are they going to introduce some new mini bosses soon?‚Äù Then I found out the only other mini bosses were the trolls, ancients, and Valkyries. I‚Äôm not even sure how many different minibosses were in Ragnarok, but it was definitely a lot more than 3. I also felt like combat was a bit better in my opinion. My only complaint with the game was that I wish we could‚Äôve spent a bit more time experiencing Ragnarok instead of other sections like Ironwood. I personally enjoyed Ragnarok a lot more than GOW 2018, but I know it‚Äôs pretty divisive and that everyone‚Äôs opinions are valid."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Yea it‚Äôs still a ps4 defining game it‚Äôs literally released on the ps4. Hardware from 2013 still getting this game in 2021.Would you consider it a ps5 defining game? I don‚Äôt see why it matters if it came out in gen9 when it‚Äôs still running on gen 8 hardware.

 It‚Äôs a cross gen title if it‚Äôs running on the ps4 and still showing what the ps4 can accomplish 9 years after release then aren‚Äôt you arguing semantics it‚Äôs not black and white. It‚Äôs a transition period

I guess the question is do you consider this a game made for the ps5 then downported for the ps4 or a ps4 game upgraded for the ps5."

17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-performance-analysis#


‚ÄúThe PS4 story is simple ‚Äì a locked 30fps. I could only find a handful of stutters when moving between sector loading points or cutscene shifts. In action the game is all but locked at 30fps and thus it feels very consistent and smooth, with this version really being the baseline for the team's aims from the get go and the fps readout backs that up. A simply stunning display of performance meaning all PS4 owners can enjoy the game without worries of it looking or performing poorly.‚Äù"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"I played 95% of the game on PS4, upgraded to mess around with the remaining percent when I got my PS5. It ran fine the entire way through, almost no different from 2018. Not sure what issues you ran into but it was far from unplayable.

Edit: y‚Äôall some bitches if you think it‚Äôs unplayable just because the PS5 plays it at 60 lmao, actual braindead take. clean your fans and clear space, fucking idiots üòÇ"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"I played it on PS4, it was 30fps. It was very playable and enjoyable."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Nah. It‚Äôs def a ps4 game. Look at how it was built: all those squeezing through cracks, climbing, and other hidden load screens to keep it one shot were for ps4.

Ps5 doesn‚Äôt need that stuff with internal ssd."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Early development footage shows them using a dualshock 4 (in midgard mishaps that was released a while ago). It is more of a Miles Morales kind of cross gen title than a Spider Man 2.
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"Yea this is a lie 

https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-best-ps4-game-ps5-icing-on-the-cake/amp/

‚ÄúWhen it comes to Ragnar√∂k, from the very get-go, we knew this was going to be a PS4 game because we wanted to support the fanbase - we had so many people that had enjoyed the game on PS4. So from the very beginning, we knew, this is going to be a PS4 game. We're going to make this the best PS4 game we can make. Our goal was to surpass God of War 2018 in every way possible.

17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Respect your opinion but don‚Äôt agree with your take at all. It was a work of art from the visuals to the story. A true love letter to all of the old samurai movies while also having a fresh modern twist. 

Just having stealth and assassination mechanics does not make it an AC clone."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Boring side content, MJ being stupid in most of the story, alot of repetitiveness in combat and I played at launch so the game was very buggy and unpolished. I still absolutely love it though and have replayed it several times.

17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Not remotely the best PS exclusive. HZD, GoW, SM, TLoU 1&2, the list goes on of way better PS exclusives.

BB doesn't even have a fucking quest tab, what little story exists is nonsense, lore is scattered randomly to fill in the lack of narrative, but that's not a substitute. There's barely a moment of humor in the game, really any of the soulsbournes. The difficulty spikes about 30 minutes in and plummets the rest of the game except for specific endgame stuff.

Combat was solid, but also movement was clunky at times. It's a lot better with ps5 or a decent pc, but it was a ps4 exclusive and just didn't run that well, even on the pro.

Bosses all have the same issue with most soulsbourne bosses: high difficulty at initial encounter because of a variety of moves with awkward timing and deceptive telegraphing. But limited move variety and easy gimmicks to punish most enemies, bosses included, makes the game not that hard.

It's an 8/10, and the ability of fromsoft fanboys to ignore any and all flaws in the games continues to astound me."

I was not very ghost like. Spider-Man was great though, the combat was amazing and it really made you feeeeeel like Pete speederman"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Damn I can agree with the visuals part but GoT had some of the most bland and forgettable characters I have ever seen in a video game. I even forgot the main guy's name a week after finishing it
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Visually, I'll agree. It was stunning. One of the best looking ps4 games.

But the story was bland. Forgettable.

Mechanically, it was absolutely an AC clone. The combat was 100% AC. The stealth felt like AC. The whole game did nothing new mechanically (except I guess whatever the challenging an enemy to 1v1 was called, but that wasn't anything special enough for its own game).

The game did nothing new. It was not innovative in any way. It was just very, very polished."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"OK, MJ parts were a flaw.

But aside from that? I played at launch and it was very polished in my experience.

GoT was polished af, but it was dull. It was gorgeous, really one of the best looking ps4 games, but the gameplay was dull. The story was bland. Mechanically, the game did pretty much nothing new. It was just an AC clone in Japan."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Oh, please. What did GoT do new? One innovative thing about it? What did it do better than other games?

Cause SM was fucking awesome. It made traversing a map fun. The story was great. The boss fights were fantastic.  


GoT was pretty, but that's it."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"You're entitled to your opinion, but you're in the minority. And wrong.

You definitely just described GoT, though, which basically uses 15 year old AC combat."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"It certainly has similarities, but I'd consider it a lot better.

GoT absolutely is just a reskin of AC. It does nothing new."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Are you kidding me?

No. No it's not. The new ones are amazing (pun intended) and mechanically nothing like the ps2 spiderman games. They're vibrant and fun and unique.

GoT, though, is mechanically the same as AC games. It plays the same. It does nothing new or exciting. I honestly thought it was an Ubisoft game when I started playing, because it's so similar.

Just because people remember its existence doesn't make it not forgettable. Do you remember the story? At all? None of my friends do."
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"a PC port would be most ideal but I've given up on it. a ps5 remaster feels far more likely, even if it's quite inconvenient for a lot of people"
17u85z1,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"TLOU, HZD and Spiderman have worse combat overall, firstly. Bloodborne has one of the most rewarding combat systems ever (rally system and gun parries), much better enemy design, atmosphere and lore. Framerate is a technical issue, true but the combat is absurdly responsive. Bloodborne has GoW beat too in terms of moveset variety. It may not be as combo-heavy but Bloodborne leaves very little to be desired when it comes to build variety. Heck it's possible to run really damaging gun-only builds for PvE.

Bloodborne doesn't really need a quest tab, it's hardly an open-world game and it takes no time to replay for missed content. 

>But limited move variety and easy gimmicks to punish most enemies, bosses included, makes the game not that hard.

Bruh, most bosses in action games in general have limited movesets. Difference is that in Soulsborne games you're actually forced to learn their movesets, and most people opt to not cheese bosses because they actually like to play by the rules. Basically every boss ever in games are cheesable save for a number of bosses in hack n slash games, which are fundamentally different in terms of game design.

Finally, exploration. Soulsborne games are among the top-tiers when it comes to how exploration is handled. If you're the type to rely on guides for most of the exploration, sucks to be you.

There's also the fact that Bloodborne is brilliant as a Lovecraftian horror game. In terms of raw atmosphere it rivals the scarier horror games. On top of the disturbing lore and the disturbing conclusions you often reach. Combine all of that and Bloodborne is one of the most enthralling experiences in gaming, something which far surpasses its cousins as an experience. Old Hunters' DLC is the single best From DLC and one of the best gaming expansions ever.

Even with its technical problems, Bloodborne is an excellent case where it's greater than the sum of its parts because of how everything complements each other."

What new thing did Spider Man bring to the table? It had fucking QTEs for god's sake. Don't get me wrong I really enjoyed that game and took my time getting the platinum on it for a reason but it is simply not in the same tier as GoT.

The gameplay was fantastic as in the fighting and traversal felt super tight and didn't get in your way at any time.
The atmosphere is one of the best of all time. 
The graphics were great, the story was phenomenal and had perfect pacing the entire way through.

To think they're remotely similar in terms of repetitiveness is delusional."

Dude. You need to look up the definition of innovative.

>What was it about GoT that could possibly make SM shallow in comparison?

All the reasons I previously mentioned. The story, world and immersion. Spider Man isn't shallow by itself but put it beside GoT and it, aswell as most other games, is.

z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"Not criticizing, but just asking in general, what is with the whole ""TV over the fireplace"" motif??? I see that a lot, but I don't think I get it."

z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,I will never understand why people choose to put their TV over their fireplace...
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"Oh man, I always knew that the PS4 Pro gets really hot, but this is the first time I see it being literally on fire. GOW Ragnarok must be really pushing the thing to it's limits."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"As an electrician who does install TVs over a fireplace mantel. I'm pretty sure the fireplace should be of decorative type, not the main source of heat, not exceed 110‚Å∞ F and definitely not be in use while the TV is in a pulled down position.  

I wish you the best but I personally would not recommend your fireplace in use with your TV pulled down."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"There‚Äôs already plenty of comments on this. But still, it can‚Äôt really be overstated. 

This setup is a terrible, terrible idea and you should look into changing it."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"Not so sure about winter vibes, I get some dungeon vibes and that tv overheating or warping for the simple fact that lots of heat plus TV is a bad combo regardless of the ""nothing bad has happened yet"" statement."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,It's great having a bright light source flickering away in my peripheral vision while I sit too far away and too far below my TV.
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Everybody's roasting OP for putting his TV above his fireplace and I'm just upset that they didn't say *fimbulwinter gaming vibes*...
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,thats a bad tilt
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,The amount of heat an dust coming from the fireplace into the display must be staggering high.

z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"You better have a damn good flu for your chimney with perfect negative air pressure at the exhaust. Oh, also, make sure you start 100% of your fires perfectly, no smoke, all heat..."

z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Uhm does the tv not overheat?
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Heat rises your tv is getting cooked slowly.

z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,I used to own that ottoman.  I miss it.
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"Some people put marshmallows on the fire, you put the tv, to each their own.   


In my opinion you are just making both the fireplace and the gaming experience worse, but if you like it I hope you enjoy it."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"No, no, I get this vibe and I'm kind of jealous. Looks beautiful, I'm sure it's a blast playing it like this."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,How does the heat from the hearth not warp and damage the TV over time?

z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,why do so many people hang their TVs over their fireplace? heat is not good for the screens
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"Even aside from the height, and the potential danger of mounting a TV directly over fire‚Ä¶ how could it possibly be pleasant to game or watch TV while having a bright fire almost directly in your line of vision?"
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"My brother in allha, what made you think posting a TV above a fireplace was going to be safe on any form?"
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-28,I feel like that TV gets HOT!
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-28,It's a race! Can you defeat Odin before the TV explodes?

z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Have fun replacing that TV before it‚Äôs time.
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Is the ps5 lighting that fire?
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,TV on top of fireplace ü§Æ I know lot of people for some reason prefer this... those people are fucking wrong
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"A tv above a fire seems stupid. They are sensitive to heat, you know."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Yikes
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,That placement is just insane
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"That's a terrible setup tbh.

But enjoy the game OP."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"Glad OP is enjoying a fantastic game but‚Ä¶

This pains me every time I see someone post a picture of their tv over their fireplace.  People, **don‚Äôt do this**, especially like this one where it is *so close* to the fireplace.  Heat rises, and being *that close* to the heat will ruin your TV."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,That must be distracting as fuck.
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,That is a horrible location for a tv. The glare from the embers would fuck with my vision and just be a general distraction. Not to mention the heat destroying the tv in the short term.
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Are you not worried of melting your tv
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Sorry but this is just uncomfortable to watch
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Hot source under your electronics.

z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"Atleast I wouldn't see the fire due to my RP, this would be a good setup to me tbh. Be able to quickly check the fire while playing games"
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Looks neat but id swap for expensive electric fire place ü§£
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"Broken TV because of the heat in 3, 2, 1..."

z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,heating up your electronics is never a good idea
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,TV not even on top of the shelf but mounted to the shelf so it's 12 fucking inches above the fire holy shit get your house in order OP

I mean, scientific advances occur all the time, but I know heat is an issue with my computer, and I've got to consider airflow when I'm putting it all together.  I'm curious how being above a fire place, that generates heat in the whole room/house, doesn't damage the components?

Neat if it doesn't but..  I'd still be worried about it.

Flip side.. Some day I need to play that game. lol  Its been on the list of games I want to play for years. :)"

I only ended up doing it because the mantle lowered the temp in the area the tv was by a lot. I recommend getting a cover for the top of the fireplace, below the tv. If it can push air outwards even better. From the research I did the tv will start to peel, or can even explode depending on what tv you have."

z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,I like winter gaming vibes. Most memorable
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-28,Fuck that seems like a terrible place for a TV
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-28,"Gotta move the TV over the mantle. The mantle will reduce the heat getting to it. Get some tapcon masonry screws, they usually include the drill bit needed."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-28,Hot setup
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-28,"Well worth it for that shot, now you can put it back where it was."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-28,It amazes me how the storyline for this game has changed so much from its previous versions
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-30,OP is a melt.
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"For real, I'd highly recommend moving that TV OP, you have a MacBook and a candle situation here"
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"I only opened the comments to offer my condolences to the TV.

Also, r/tvtoohigh"
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"Looking at how grey those blacks are, that contrast, I wouldn't be that sad about that."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"Was just thinking this same thing. It's a wood fireplace, that isn't very deep, with no shelf over it to protect the TV. TV's going down."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-28,If I was rich I would literally buy a new TV every time just to complete that setup lol godamn
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,JuSt LiKe My TV
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,I somehow feel it is deliberately done - the post for karma
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Agreed. I‚Äôm on the no tv over the fireplace team.
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Imagine trying to focus on game with constant shimmering lights from the fire bellow.
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"Yeah, it‚Äôs dumb.  My friend hung a 65‚Äù over his fireplace and it‚Äôs like stargazing trying to watch anything.  

Oh, guess which TV he asked me to replace a bunch of caps in when it would no longer turn on‚Ä¶."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,It‚Äôs actually bad for the tv. I‚Äôve seen so many with heat damage from the fireplace.
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,I was going to say what a shocking place for the tv.
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,You have passed the test... r/TVtoohigh welcomes you
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"Before TV was a thing, generally the fireplace was the center focus of a living room. So it‚Äôs become the traditional way to design living rooms but now people also want the tv in that central position as well, instead of awkwardly offsetting the furniture to be focused on a tv in the corner and a fireplace. It‚Äôs just convenient. I personally hate high TVs but sometimes a room isn‚Äôt flexible"
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"It‚Äôs actually a home styling no-no to put a tv above a fireplace. Two reasons I know of are that the fireplace mantle is often too tall for a proper television viewing perspective. Also, you should be admiring the fire, not a screen."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Most older homes are designed with the fireplace to be the central focus point of a room. Some people have really no other option other than to mount over the fireplace.
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,I think it was customary to put paintings over a fireplace but that just evolved into T v's
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"My company installs tvs professionally and usually do our best to not install them over fireplaces.


The mantle is too high for proper viewing angles unless your 12-14 feet away


We generally only install over a fireplace if theres a nice chunky mantle made of stone or such to protect the tv, the one in ops post has the mantle but the tvs mounted below/in front of it‚Ä¶"
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,It's how you get the wife to be okay with regular TV upgrades. You put it above the fireplace so the heat will ruin it.
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"At least in my living room, the fireplace is on the only wall wide enough to support a TV so there's not much choice.

Even if you have another wall big enough, you're stuck deciding on whether to face seating towards the TV or fireplace so it can make for a weird layout to have them on separate walls."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,It's something that people who aren't tech savy do because they think it looks good. All I'm imagining is all that heat fucking with the TV. People forget that electronics need to breathe as well
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"Because I like toasty feetsies and the mantle is a perfect fit. 
Although mine is electric."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Most fireplaces in homes leave a large raised raised area where the chimney is in the wall sometimes covered by plaster sometimes not. I don't think it's a motif so much as you have a raised area in an accentuated forward facing area of usually a living room  where you have open wall space above. what're you gonna put their crossed swords? Or more reasonably for most in a living room a TV
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,The soot coming from the fire place wouldn't be for any electronic plus it'll get in the screen making it look worse.
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,It's niot really the heat that will cause the damage but the smoke will. Ask any smoker how long their TV sets live for üòÖ
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"Just the best placement for the room, really"
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,It does lower TV lifespans.
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"Lack of other places, in my opinion. A lot of people don‚Äôt have dedicated media rooms. Throw a couch and bookshelf in most rooms and what you have left is space above a fireplace."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"In many houses, above the fire place is the only place for a TV. For example, my living room is in a corner of the house, so between windows and radiators the options are either put the tv over the fire place or put the couch in front of the fire place. Not wanting to burn the house down, we chose the former."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"A lot of it is just like, due to the layout of the room. But it conveniently stacks features. You already have this mostly unusable wall you often want to look at (to feel cozy). Why not also make it the wall you stare at the most because the entertainment is there too?"
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Many houses are designed in a way where it's the only place that works
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,I think usually it's thst people want a fireplace and the best spot also happens to be the best spot to have a TV. So you kind of have to have the TV over the fireplace or shit just doesn't work. Personally I find it annoying because the TV ends up too high. What OP did here makes me feel like the TV is gonna overheat lol.
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"Probably has to do with space conservation and the decorator never having played a game on a tv screen in their lives.  

Cause if they had, they'd know better."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Its the perfect way to take attention away from your fire place while ruining your TV with heat damage. The perfect two birds with one stone play.
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,At least its only half way over the fireplace. However now heat on the display is something i would worry about.
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,I am suprised you do not ruin your TV by the excessive heat coming out of it
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,It‚Äôs the worst place for a TV.
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"My opinion here, but a lot of older houses before tvs were around were designed/laid out in such a way that there aren't any good walls/places to put a t.v. these homes were typically designed where the fireplace was the focal point. In these instances having a tv in front of/over the fireplace is the only option in these types of rooms. But what do I know, just a stranger on the internet!"
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,The heat and smoke makes the tv work better .
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,And a perfectly good fire
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,First time I've ever seen a tv that r/tvtoohigh would disagree with
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"I‚Äôm guessing because they hate the TV.  Heat rises, y‚Äôall.  That is a spectacular way to melt components of your TV and shorten its life."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Yep
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,It‚Äôs a terrible idea
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"I have mine a couple feet above a wide mantle - did some heat checks with a temp gun with fireplace on and fireplace off. No discernible difference in temp around or on TV with fireplace on versus any other point at the same height in the room. It‚Äôs a decent size room, though, and has good airflow, both of which I‚Äôm sure contribute to the heat diffusion.

Edit to answer why there: it‚Äôs the best available wall space given windows, lighting, and space for seating."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,They like to keep buying a new TV set every once in a while...
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,My tv is over my fireplace cuz It was really the best place to view the tv but I‚Äôm in AZ and we have never used the fire place once and never will lol
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"Exactly, the TV produces heat by itself, and yet people have a roaring fire and place the TV above fireplaces(!) and you know that heat is going to hit that TV screen at a high temperature, it's sitting in the perfect spot for melting."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"tv too high, too big for the size of the room, covering a mantle? Need, a bigger room or a smaller tv in the corner instead."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"My guess is that since the fireplace is the center of attention in the living room, you wouldn‚Äôt want to put the tv on a different place that would ‚Äúcompete‚Äù with the fireplace. 

Imo the better question is ‚Äúwhy do people put a fireplace in a small living room?‚Äù There is not enough space for both a fireplace and a tv to fit in a way that makes sense."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-28,"In my case, my toddler was dangerously close to pushing it over all the time. The fire never gets turned on anyways in my house though so it's a win win situation."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Along with the fan for the fireplace (to heat the room) it sounds like a jet hanger in there
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Fireplace is usually closed with the fan on to pump the hot air straight out into the room. Max temp around the tv has never been higher than 85
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,[deleted]
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"/s

Only correct comment. Bright lightsource basically trashes the quality of the tv based on how eyes will adjust and perceive detail and contrast. Literally the worst place for tv."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Aw fuck what a missed opportunity
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"Trust me it isn't. Chimney's (surprisingly enough) are built to handle a lot of heat so the wall won't even be warm, let alone hot enough to damage a TV"
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,I came looking for this
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"When the fires really rolling, I close the doors on it and turn the fan on (to heat the room). I open it back up once the fires died down a little and it‚Äôs not so distracting"
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,OP and a community of other people would beg to differ
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"Nope, never had any problems with it"
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Never had a problem with it
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Every time
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,It does not
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,It‚Äôs fantastic. I‚Äôll be there for hours and not notice
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,It just doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a cast iron furnace and the heat is pretty well insulated and gets dispersed through the room by an internal fan so the heat doesn‚Äôt just go straight up
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,It‚Äôs held into that mantle by six 9‚Äù screws in place of the 3‚Äù ones they give you with the mount. It‚Äôs not going ANYWHERE
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-28,Duuuuuuude I haven‚Äôt finished yettttt
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"Hah, most underrated comment so far"
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,If another one of my posts gets stolen and posted to Facebook..
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Probably shouldn‚Äôt have posted it on the internet if he wasn‚Äôt looking for a lecture. Especially Reddit.
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"It‚Äôs bearable on PS4. If you‚Äôve never played PS5 or watched any gameplay videos (like me), you‚Äôd hardly regret not playing it on ps5"
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,tv above fireplace is far worse imo
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Fortnite is GOTY if it was released in 2022 tbh.
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Who asked?
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-28,What?
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Not pictured: the whole right side where my puppy destroyed it yesterday lol
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,So it is fitting or it‚Äôs not fitting?
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"It‚Äôs an ottoman with 4 storage compartments and the tops are cushioned on the reverse side. Thanks to the puppy, they‚Äôre all table space at this point"
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,It‚Äôs been there for two years and still works like the day I got it. I think it was warmer in this room in July than it ever will be with the fireplace rolling.
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,*grunts* hmmm
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-28,Bring some coors light and we goooooood
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Move the fireplace if moving the TV is too much hussle
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,idk i feel like the tv is actually at a good eye level
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,r/tvjustright
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"chances are they set the brightness higher than normal. I know people who when the set up screen comes on they jack that shit all the way to the right and the side that the logo is supposed to be barely visible in is clear as day. they do this because they ""hate how games hide things in shadows and I want to 100% the game on my first play through and dont want to miss something"""
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,You're a good sport

z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Nice and toasty.
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-28,"You‚Äôre probably just trying to max the specs the GPU by melting it, Nvidia factory style?"
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"Agreed, i don't have a fireplace"
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,I'd really rather not have a TV in living room at all to be honest. But I've always been lucky to have a room to use as the TV room.
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,[deleted]
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Not to mention the effect it has on the TV itself
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,How‚Äôs that different than all the RGB people use these days?
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"I could never. My eyes have gotten a little worse over time, I used to have all these rainbow lights all over my room and in my PC but now it's just way too distracting lol I use a desk lamp with all RGB off now"
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Why do you let your friend have a TV over his fireplace?
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"Depends on the setup. Idk about wood, but I sold gas fireplaces for a while. You could get a passive vent system that draws heat away from the wall but still pushes it into the room. Our largest fireplace in store was on full blast 8 hours a day everyday for years, TV was totally fine."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Especially since it is such a large tv. It just completely dominates that space.
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Well you don't want him to put it any lower...
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"Let me add a few more for you, heat is generally not a good thing for electronics and wiring.

Heat rises

It is difficult to run additional wiring as you probably don‚Äôt want to drill through the brick. Wires also require being much longer as it is harder to place cable boxes and receivers. Good luck keeping those shitty components cooled as well."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Having both going at the same time is the weirdest part.
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,This is my issue. Our house has no other options to put the TV in our living room except above the fireplace. We‚Äôre probably going to do something similar to OP and put up one of those pull down mounts. Honestly the only option for us unfortunately
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"If a home is big enough to have a living space that big that a large tv will fit over a fireplace, there is likely another room in the house that is big enough to be a social television space."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-28,"Nope. You can mount flat TVs anywhere. Like a picture. If you have walls, you have a place to mount."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"you know those beds you see in crappy comedys that are like a circle, and they rotate? you think they make a couch like that? because that would fix your problem on how to face the seating...."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"It looked kinda cool on MTV Cribs 20 years ago, so somehow some people still do it without really thinking about it."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Best placement for killing your TV yes üòÜ
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Best place to melt the components of your tv and shorten it‚Äôs life
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"There's also oils in the ash that will discolor and destroy the TV if you ever use the fireplace. Smoke damage is a thing, and you have to let smoke into the room every time you load wood into it.

Dumb AF to put a TV there."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-28,"Please.

The newest Nvidia graphics cards have melting as a feature. OP is a performance wizard."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"I mean that is the ‚Äúsafest‚Äù way to do it - except for your neck.  I hate looking up at my TV, but if it‚Äôs the only place to put it, it‚Äôs a hard problem to solve‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs funny how many people here are saying ‚Äúwhy put the TV there!‚Äù  There is no other place to put mine either, it‚Äôs an open floor plan the fireplace wall is the only one without a window or doorway, basically designed so the furniture naturally faces that way too.

I don‚Äôt even use my fireplace right now since it‚Äôs fugly (and I‚Äôm pretty sure lined with asbestos) so the TV is sitting in front of it.  I‚Äôm looking at converting it to a gas and remodeling it in general, but I don‚Äôt like any options for the TV.  Someone here just suggested a pull down mount, maybe that‚Äôs an option‚Ä¶"
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Smoke damage
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,I've visited Arizona. It's crazy someone would build a house with a fireplace when you can just step outside.
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"Smaller tv you crazy

That‚Äôs joke but still that tv is perfect size for that room"
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"Sure but my guess is most people don‚Äôt ‚Äúput it there‚Äù, they buy a house that just had it there.  

When my house was built TV was a new invention, so the fireplace was the center of the family room‚Ä¶"

z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Bro I think we might even have the same rug and we have light hardwood floors too @.@
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"Yes, that's why they want it back. But I say, you can keep it."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"Cool :)  er.. yeah.  lol

Pun.. er.. sorta not intended till I noticed it? ;-)"
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-28,This is likely easier
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"You know after I wrote that I looked at it again and it IS lower than I remember seeing.
Which JUST makes the fire SO much closer"
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,It is super low for a tv mounted above a fireplace.  Ive legit never seen someone mount the tv where it hangs a foot+ below the mantle
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"So, I don‚Äôt crank it insanely high, but I play a lot of horror games and I will say I set it a little higher on some modern ones.

Why? Because developers seem to be obsessed with this idea that dark = scary.

It‚Äôs not scary, I just can‚Äôt fucking see"
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"I used to do that before I got intio QLED/OLED TV's and monitors, if the blacks are gonna look like shit I might as well see everything.

Downside of OLED is you can't go back to LCD."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"I'll say in his defense, dunno about Ragnarok but God of War 2018 was dark as shit for me on my LG C8. I had a hard time tweaking settings in a way that let me see in dark caves without blowing out the light scenes. Upgrading to a C2 (which is brighter) fixed that though. Not sure if that's a problem on LCDs like this."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-12-03,"Yeah, I figure overclocking the tv might improve the aspect ratio?"
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Any place can be a fireplace! I believe in you!
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,I lived in a place that had a fake fire place. I still didnt put the tv above it.
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,I was thinking the same thing. Surely thay will fry the tv over time. I guess that's not a concern of his. Based on ambiance.
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"At that point, image on TV might start shimmering too."

z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"Yep it's not, my dad did this same thing with his 75"" samsung LED backlit and most of the bottom middle of the TV color shifts to pink and has crazy light bleed on that same spot right where most of the heat hits after half a year."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,I‚Äôm no television expert but I think the heat can start to delaminate the screen. Giving it that bubble look
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,I had an incense burner under my TV and the heat melted the plastic over time and destroyed the front button pcb. I can imagine what a fireplace would do.
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,they've also ruined a pretty nice looking fireplace
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Not even a mantle to block some of the heat.
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,I've yet to see RBG screens tbf
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,It‚Äôs not on fire
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Because he‚Äôs an adult capable of ignoring me.

*the big 6 hate this 1 trick*"
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Yeah who wants the room to be a comfortable temperature when the TV is on?
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"Pull down mount is solid! Out of the way when you don't need it, but in the right position when it's time to watch something. They are a bit of an ordeal to install but I did one and thought it was completely worth it"
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"That‚Äôs not a bad idea.  Who wants a fire and TV at the same time?

I wonder if there are automated (motorized) pull down mounts.  My current old fireplace is an ugly POS so we just have the TV in front of it.  I was looking at replacing it with something that would not generate more than 100F above the mantle, but maybe lowering the TV into position would be even better.  I hate looking up at a TV‚Ä¶"
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"I‚Äôve been looking at houses for two years. A lot of the older homes I‚Äôve seen don‚Äôt have the space you‚Äôre assuming they have. Living room layouts are weird in some of these older homes. 

The house we finally bought has little to no space for a living room set. To get a decent amount of seats we‚Äôd have to mount once the fire place"
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-28,Sure. You can mount anywhere. But it can reduce the amount of good viewing angles you got by doing that.
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"I am what they call an idea man. they dont say if those ideas are good or bad, but they ARE ideas."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"Depends on the setup. I don't know about wood fireplaces, but I used to work for a store that did a whole lot of gas fireplaces. It's true that the largest ones would often heat up the wall a fair bit, but you could add a special vent kit that would draw the heat back from the wall, then vent it elsewhere (above the TV so it could still disperse in the room, out the sides, or out back into a different room entirely if you want). 

To prove that it works, we'd keep our largest fireplace on 8 hours a day everyday for years, with a TV right above it. TV was always perfectly cool and worked fine. You could still feel plenty of warmth standing in front of the fireplace, too."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-28,Doesn't a fireplace stop ash and oil from rising out of the fireplace and into your home? I thought that was the whole point of a chimney and all that
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"Mine‚Äôs a gas fireplace, so if any smoke were coming back into the house, I‚Äôd have a serious safety issue. You shouldn‚Äôt have smoke coming in regardless of type, though, unless you forget to open the flue or something, since that could indicate ventilation issues with your chimney."

z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,And? It's not radiating straight upwards and solely onto the TV. 80% of the heat from an open fire goes to waste up the chimney. It's fine.
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"I‚Äôm surprised you think there isn‚Äôt lol, stupid people love to get together and justify their stupidity"
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"Yeah I‚Äôve heard that before, but it‚Äôs never been an issue"

z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,How wrong I was. It‚Äôs obviously Pokemon Scarlet/Violet on the Switchü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Gameplay 10/10
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Ask yourself maybe.
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,DID WE JUST BECOME BEST FRIENDS??
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,OP was obviously considering this dilemma when installing the tv. To be roasted on r/tvtoohigh is a punishment worse than death itself. OP decided to roast his tv instead.
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,yea lol either way it‚Äôs questionable placement
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Right looks like he mounted it directly to the mantle . It should really be above so it deflects the heat .
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,If the game relies on jump scares dark can help. But yeah dark doesn't = scary by default
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,The snowy landscape and dark caves means you'll either be blinded or in total darkness. The game is amazing but I am not a fan of my flashlight on my character's hip.
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,You're right. I'm going to punch a hole in my microwave and cook a log on high for 5 hrs. Then I can set my TV on the stove
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,There is definitely a distance you are supposed to follow. Also should have a mantle to put a blocker between the hot air and the TV
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Smoke too
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Haha classic dad
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Bro I need the rest of that story
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"I work at a internet / cable provider and your dad is one of the people who call me and tell me it can‚Äôt be the tv! It‚Äôs only a year old !

People are great üòÇ"
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"television expert can't answer it, you need an expert on the heat in that room. OP \[and fam\] is the only one of those."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-28,Excellent point. That‚Äôs what the RTX4090 is for.
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-28,"Yeah because tiny wood burning fireplaces are usually the main and only source of heat in modern homes üôÑ

If that fireplace is significantly heating the whole room that TV is toast in days, not years."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-28,"No, it doesn't. That's why there's a discolored spot above every functional wood fireplace in the world.

When you *open the door to load wood*  smoke comes out."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"There are pressure changes that sometimes cause smoke to rarely come in and a lot of times it‚Äôs low and you can‚Äôt see it, gas much lower propensity but I‚Äôd still mess up my neck it being up that high regardless"
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,(negative) Internet points it seems
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"Fuck em, you enjoy it how you like it. I personally think k it looks cozy af, might damage the electrical components of the TV, but life is short and new tech comes out fast so who cares ( reddit aparently)."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"Riiiight, i assume you speak from professional experience."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"Just keep an eye on it, i had a tv screen warp and crack after having it above a fireplace. The switch from hot to cold many times over time did damage that i didnt notice til it went"
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,You‚Äôll slowly melt any solder joints in the TV over time. You‚Äôll be wondering why your TV only last 5 years vs other peoples that would last 10-15. It looks great placement wise but you will pay the price for having it in that location. That‚Äôs why if most people put the TV above the fire place it goes above the mantle piece. They don‚Äôt hang the TV from the mantle piece which is a first for me.
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,How kid felt after commenting these two comments: üê∂üê∂üê∂
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,I think the other redditor is your puppy
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Yeah for sure
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"It's likely a mount that comes out and down so the TV hangs over/in front of the mantle when in use, and above when not in use."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Some games do it right and other games have me constantly colliding with random shit in the environment I couldn‚Äôt see lol
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"I think if there is a hole in your microwave, you'll definitely be cooking more than a log."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"just put some metal in there with something flamable, no need to punch a hole in it just let it melt a hole for you."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"He has a mantle, look closer... He's mounted the TV to it"
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-28,"I was home during the holidays last year and he started up a fire. They have their TV on a mantle way higher up and the sound bar (they had received as a present that same Christmas) mounted ~6 inches above the fireplace and he started up a fire, I had noticed a slight sag in the sound bar but didn‚Äôt think much of it because it wasn‚Äôt too noticeable at that point. But then like 15 minutes later the sound start getting spotty/crackly and couldn‚Äôt tell why but look a little closer and the thing was about to come apart at the right bracket lol. Surprisingly it works just the same now, it just needed to cool off for awhile. 

So no more fires inside lmao"
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"Had a 51 plasma sitting over the fireplace in my mum's house for like 10 years, never hurt it. It's the most central point of the room slap bang in front of the sofa. People just get on the hate train over stupid stuff nowadays.

As for the heat, if you felt the brickwork on the chimney it wasn't even warm, so there was no way it was doing the TV any harm."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"I speak from experience of living in a home with an open fireplace for 26 years, 10 of which had a plasma tv mounted directly onto the chimney with absolutely 0 negative effect..."
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,"Will do, thanks!"
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Probably mantlemount. It‚Äôs designed to be able to pull down the tv below the mantle. I was looking on getting one myself. But I don‚Äôt have the room
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,You're right. Those glass shards could pose some sort of danger
z5ou3u,2022-11-27,2022-11-27,Lol yes I know. But should have a mantle between the fireplace and the Tv ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-13,"Dude, I feel this. I just picked up GoW 2018 (my first game in this franchise) a few weeks ago and I'm floored at what I was leaving on the table"
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-13,"GoW 2018 has some issues with the early difficulty curve, in my opinion. I also played on the hardest difficulty, and some of those early fights were brutal and frustrating since you don't have all your abilities yet. I found that the game got easier as I went (valkyries and niflheim as an exception).

I found that Ragnarok did a much better job of easing into the difficulty as you unlock abilities and keeping up the challenge as you go, so I enjoyed that curve better. It still has a lot of difficult endgame bosses, though, so good luck!"
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-13,"Yeah I honestly wouldn't recommend the hardest difficulty, enemies just have too much health."
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-13,"Yeah, that last Valkyrie took me until 5am to beat. I was so determined and yet so tired hahaha."
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-13,"yea lol, sigrun in first trying give me god of war needs your skill, you cannot beat hear without learning all her moves step by step, that's how it is, that's how you feel THE GOD OF WAR :), after beating her in gmgow."
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-14,"Don't feel bad, probably took me 6 hours to beat the last Valk on GMGOW+ the first time, maybe 3 or 4 hours on my first play through on the difficulty just below that on a new game. It's just so many moves to remember and react *correctly* to. It does feel frustrating where you're like ""I knew what that move was, why did I dodge right instead of left!?"""
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-14,"Currently replaying the game on steam and I hate Niflheim so much that I started my NG+ file without finishing the Valkyries on the original file. Niflheim just fucking sucks and I refuse to do it. I did all of the Valkyries except the Niflheim one and by extension, the last one."
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-15,I didint play it i have it on ps5 is it worth it?
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-13,Why would you not have a ‚Äúfull‚Äù controller
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-13,At least you got to fight a Valkyrie. I grinded to get the crafting materials I needed for upgrades to be able to withstand the challenge but the game never gave me what I needed. How hard was the first Valkyrie compared to the last?
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-13,"Ragnar√∂k fixes every problem max difficulty had in 2018. Enemies are less spongy, encounters are more thought out with tools to deal with adds if there are too many, better telegraphing of attacks, better level scaling... it's insane. I honestly think 2018 is better when right below GMGOW, but Ragnar√∂k nails it.¬†"
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-13,"Omg, the last Valkyrie destroyed me sooo many times!  First time, I barely scratched her!"
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-13,I am interested in trying out God of War when  get a PS5 in the future. I defiently will play on normal dificulty on my first playthrough. Or what ever its called in this game.
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-14,Don‚Äôt forget the free DLC for Ragnarok. It puts a perfect little bow tie to the game and Kratos‚Äô character.
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-13,"The first trilogy and other 4-5 games were fine on God/hardest mode.

But Give Me God of War‚Ä¶ oh no.
Multiple gameovers per encounter.

You end up standing there tossing the Leviathan Axe for a solid 20 minutes. Running away, do it again‚Ä¶
Felt that it scaled too high at the start then finally leveled out but stayed difficult."
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-13,"For me Ragnarok was more complicated to understand. GoW 2018 was more about being good a parrying and landing combos without much focus on builds. 

Ragnarok can have insane builds were you obliterate everybody"
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-13,"Shame, by far the worst way to make a game more ""difficult"" bulletsponge.. in the case sword sponge enemies can fuck right off. What a lame generic ass mechanic."
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-13,"The combat system has a lot of bugs and inconsistencies, which are masked in the lower difficulty setting,  but on hard, you will die in 1 hit, and the bugs are super obvious.

This video goes into it. The worst one is if an enemy ""queues"" up multiple attacks, you can't stun them out of the first one. There's no cue for this, it's just luck.

https://youtu.be/pJPOvLvdugw?si=kq6EnxKU78jlXvwm&t=8498"
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-13,"Give me god of war is the only criticism I have about GoW4. 
I try to beat every game I love on the hardest difficulty to 100% but I just couldn‚Äôt stomach GoW4. 
A shake really because the older game‚Äôs difficulties were no where near as hard(IMO)"
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-13,"I'd argue the enemies don't have too much health, but if you let them level up you're gonna be in for a bad time."
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-13,"Not if you learn what gear is the best for what build you're going for and master the combos. Usually when people say GoW enemies have too much health it's because they rely on basic attacks and play it like a Soulslike, getting a hit or two in-between enemy attacks and playing it relatively safe. God of War heavily rewards an aggressive playstyle and chaining combos/runics, stacking tons of damage quickly, and utilizing the elemental damage from your weapons. If you try to rely solely on countering with basic combos, it's going to feel like they have too much health, but if you play aggressive and learn combos you can delete enemy health pretty quickly."
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-13,"Haha! Yes. It took me like 5 hours, but I was so happy in the end. Good times, it was my favorite part of the game. Dumb shit was I came close to killing her many times, only to die at the last moment. Choked hard several times when she was 1 hit away. Which is funny, because you have to chain a fury of combos on her just to damage her 1 tick of health, and she has like 10 ticks in totals. When I was at her final tick, that moment felt so lengthy. I would freeze up, and forget who I was fighting. 

In 1 of them, it was a draw, but she gets the win, because you still need to grapple her to finish her. The boy got the last shot. I was so furious!



https://youtu.be/4sMpH5HyliA?si=fGogUaGjVgTSsXHP"
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-15,Absolutely. I slept on it for 5 years. It brought that old school game feeling I missed so much.
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-13,Im pretty sure they mean the battery...
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-13,It was when I started the fight‚Ä¶
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-13,It won't. The fight is just hard. I mean she is one of the hardest bosses of all games (that's including Souls-like).¬†
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-13,"The first Valkyrie is like nothing. The vibe, and setting of the stage gives you chills walking in, because they're suppose to be imprisoned, and you're just wondering in. Fighting your 1st Valkyrie will give you confidence beating it. 


You quickly learn that there's 8 of em or so, and that not all of them are at the same difficulty. The realization that the first one is suppose to be the easiest, or at least depending on what order you beat them in. 


The final one Sigrun, basically takes all the moves of all the ones before it, and she just feels faster. She hits you with many combinations, and she tries to fake you out (bait). Also her health Pool is huge! It's easy to get her health down to 1 tick, just for her to kill you in the end. For a while she was called one of the hardest boss in games. I think she can still be a contender, but yeah there's far worse bosses. If you're new to combat games like this, she'll be an unbeatable wall. Took me 5 hours on GMGOW. I've heard some people even complain on the easier difficulties lol üòÇ.



https://youtu.be/4sMpH5HyliA?si=fGogUaGjVgTSsXHP"
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-13,Are you sure. It's been awhile admittedly but I recall Ares from the og game being really difficult.
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-13,"Tbh I hated Ragnaroks combat overhauls. In the first game, any playstyle is valid. Ragnarok is way more focused on how you should approach each fight vs the 2018 game.¬†


I'm replaying the 2018 game again and it's so noticeable. The hand to hand and shield combat alone make the game imo. Along with moves like the Executioner Cleave and much more varied finishers. The ""Simon Says"" combat of Ragnarok never clicked with me as much. Felt was less varied and way more linear.¬†"
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-13,"I personally liked the big variety of options you have in Ragnarok, but I did feel a bit overwhelmed at times with all the potential decisions to make with gear and stuff."
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-13,"It's literally in the game just for people who like harder difficulties. Theres no trophy for it, you only get a shield skin, so unless you want the hardest difficulty, theres literally no point in doing it on the hardest"
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-13,"Man WTF ü§Ø. Thanks for this revelation.


I had fun with GMGOW, but I do remember having a lot of BS moments, and getting frustrated. Sometimes I felt like I was doing well, but then suddenly lost it out of nowhere. Like the video says, ""the staggers just don't register or drop"". 

So much so I do remember having many options with runic attacks, but I always chose specific ones that would be quick, because it did feel like a gamble using them, and would leave you wide open if for some reason the enemy just bursted out of the stagger. So there was only so few to choose from.


More so the frustration was with how fragile you are in that difficulty, but when the enemy starts to cheat, that's so off putting. I remember my frustration with the game, and it kind of just made me feel bad. As if I was being punished for playing good. Plenty of times I felt like I was doing well just to die out of nowhere. Ugh. Thanks for this. I always had mixed feelings about this game, but this kind of reinforces it. I think I did realize these things back then, but I never really made the conclusion. Watching the video shows it very clearly that I wasn't just imagining it. 


How do you feel about the game? Surprisingly this is the first time I've heard about this, and that game almost always gets brought up. -___- me. Does the fandom just masks these Issues??? It's never talked about... Pretty much I bet!"
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-13,"I did, the enemies are still extremely tanky. Ragnarok wasn't as bad though."
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-13,"They're still too tanky. Sometimes it feels like you've done every single Ultimate combo on them, and they're still not dead."
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-14,"The devs said they did that on purpose to give us a sense of ""just mash this one combo and you got it"" only for Sigrun to smash us into the dirt"
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-13,"I can accept when I‚Äôm being thick as shit. I skim read it. Sorry, OP!"
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-14,"I played it on GMGoW as well. But like I said, the game never gave me the crafting materials I needed for upgrades. I grinded in Niflheim for a long time and gave up. Where I was at, I knew there was no way I could fight a Valkyrie the way I wanted to. I don't recall which items I needed, it was probably just two items, but they would've made all of my stats significantly better. Enough so that I felt a Valkyrie wouldn't have been any sort of problem initially. The chests never spawned anything I needed. Just more of what I already had.

I have GoW Ragnarok in my backlog now. If you played it, did they improve crafting and resource availability?"
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-13,"Ares took 30+ tries easily for both my friend & I‚Ä¶ such an insane final fight haha can‚Äôt remember if it was more a gimmick fight, or timing, or what. 

Basically every combat encounter, even small mobs were incredibly difficult in GOW 2018.

Was more of a hack n slash breeze save for some mini bosses and Gods etc in the older games."
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-14,"Dude, yes. It was very obvious to me since I replayed 2018 right before I did Ragnarok. The combat felt so different, and I really preferred the more straightforward and powerful feeling combat from 2018. 

The combat in Ragnarok felt underpowered and tedious to me personally."
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-13,Never had that issue. Perhaps just bad gear? Not playing to the strengths of your build? Can't say for your experience but in my experience they give you a sufficient amount of resources and abilities to defeat enemies in a reasonable amount of time.
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-14,"I haven't played GoWr.


It's been a long time since I played Gow 2018 to know what you're talking about (missing pieces)."
195qhap,2024-01-13,2024-01-13,"It was probably more so early game then anything. Mid to endgame it's not so much of a problem. If you played it for a long time, you probably may as well have forgotten the early journey. 


The game early on is so damn hard, sometimes it feels cruel, and unfair because you just did the impossible with multiple enemies, only for the game to double the enemies you just killed. Specifically one section of early game where they get ambushed by a ton of enemies, and you're just whipping out combo after combo while also not having the full arsenal of Kratos, because it's too early. Hell even the 1st enemies when you first start the game take forever to kill, and it's just 5 of them."
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,"God of War, by a mile. Specially since you don't care about post game."
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,God Of War: Ragnarok. It's even more epic and even the story of the side characters are great. Freya gets a great story.
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,I was so stoked on Diablo 4 and it was my second most played game in 2023. It sucks. It‚Äôs a huge disappointment. Get god of war. If you want an unsolicited suggestion then get Elden ring.
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,"Bro, Ragnorok literally just came out with some awesome DLC like a week ago completely free. 

  
The story is amazing, t he game play is amazing. Everything about God of War is perfect."
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,"For me personally, I would play God of War Ragnorok especially since you like 2018, God of War 2018 & Ragnorok are one story split into two games imo."
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,Definitely GoW. No question.
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,I vote God of War. I couldn't get into Diablo even playing with friends
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,[deleted]
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,How is this even a question? GoW.
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,God of war ragnarok. The Valhalla DLC is free which is respectable and its a great roguelite especially for fans of the series.
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,Diablo should be free to play. Theres a game called path of exile 2 that‚Äôs coming out and it‚Äôs like  Diablo and maybe better but it will be free to play. So I would keep an eye on that and go for god of war.
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,Story on Diablo is mid. Haven‚Äôt played a god of war game since 3 but they look great with a lot of cinematic story scenes. If you‚Äôre not planning to do the late game post story content and don‚Äôt have friends to do it with then Diablo isn‚Äôt fun in my opinion so I‚Äôd go with Ragnorok
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,"I haven't played GoW, but if you liked Diablo 3, you're gonna hate Diablo 4. It's a huge step backwards in terms of gameplay and character building (imagine having to put skill points into the same skill just to increase your damage output), the world is big and empty and the story is boring."
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,GoW. D4 is worth $20 at best.
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,"Hard choice! If you're into story and epic moments, God of War: Ragnarok might be the way to go. It's got that narrative depth. Diablo 4 is cool, but since late-game isn't your thing, Ragnarok could be more up your alley. Haven't played either yet, but heard good things about both."
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,"Diablo 4 got boring halfway the campaign, never mind the post-game. Haven‚Äôt played Ragnarok yet but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs much better."
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,Ragnarok is fantastic and d4 is pretty mid. Like mindless turn off my brain fun vs engaging story I wanted to consume from start to finish.
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,"If you want story, GoW for sure.

If you want something to come back to once a year and find something new to do, D4"
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,GOW by a mile
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,"I played Diablo 4 for 140 hours already and 0 hours of God of War Ragnorak yet.

I still vote God of War"
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,"I loved the first god of war reboot, hated the second. I‚Äôd go with Diablo"
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,"If you're are looking for a compelling narrative, God of War: Ragnarok. It is a contained story, and it is fairly easy to Platinum. 

Diablo 4 is a live service ARPG, and your money will go farther. Season 2 has been amazing, and the devs are actively making adjustments to the game. If you are looking for stories and side quests, do not pick this up. The point of D4 is the end-game grind and loot chase."
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,Hahaha its not even close to being tje same type of game. Do u want a story game or action RPG?? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,Diablo 4 pay to win garbage bull shit? Or a truly epic tale that just recently released a free dlc to keep playing after the new game plus plus plus plus? No contest
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,"If you want to play with mates, then Diablo IV. It plays x-platform and works well. 

If not, then GoW. Just an around better and more entertaining game IMO."
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,God of War is likely better.  Unless you want a time sink game but even then their are better option that D4
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,This is a quantity vs quality question. Gow has a better story and game play. D4 you know what you're getting. Looting and grinding. I played both and preferred gow.
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,">I do not care about late game Diablo 4 gameplay

Then, God of War Ragnarok, it received a rogue-like DLC too for free this month :). 

Diablo 4 it's a game with seasons, a game you will come back for new contents each X months and a game that will receive extensions too. If, once you finished it, you don't really care about post-game, it's really not what you want imho

And you enjoyed GoW 2018, it's natural to finish the story arc !"
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,"Bro man, god of war much better quality but it is single player. D4 less epic but you could technically play it for much longer"
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,"For pure story and questing, GoW is your best bet. It lacks substantially compared to 2018, but still a good 40-45 hrs of stuff for 100% completion."
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,"For story, definitely GoW.

Though I‚Äôve sunk more hours into Diablo 4 for the repetitive end game loop."
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,It‚Äôs GoW:R by a landslide.
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-29,"Had more fun with God of war, but getting a lot more hours out of diablo."
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-29,I haven't even played God of War and I know it's better than d4. Diablo might be worth owning in a year but right now it's lagging behind other arpgs by a lot.
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-29,I haven't even played God of War and I know it's better than d4. Diablo might be worth owning in a year but right now it's lagging behind other arpgs by a lot.
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-29,"GoW:R, but it is probably going to be on PS+ in 3-6 months‚Ä¶

But still GoW:R. 

They are both just an extension of the previous one, but D4 forces you online for no good reason and (as of a month ago) still has server issues making Hardcore ungood"
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-29,"Gow has more replayability 
Has better gameplay 
Doesn't need an online to stay alive 
Got the best dlc since bloodborne old hunters"
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-29,"I dislike GOW's gameplay and never could get into it and I bought D4 on release and beat it.

Anyway get God Of War Ragnar√∂k it's better"
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-29,"If you want a story & puzzles with your combat then god of war

& Diablo IV if you just want to turn your brain off and grind with some TV on in the background"
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-29,I got D4 of the two and would heavily suggest you go with GoW.
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-29,GOD OF WAR!!!!
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-29,Anything but Diablo4.  Worse game ever.
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-29,God of War has an amazing story and awesome combat. You definitely won't be disappointed.
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-29,"God of War: Ragnarok, for sure. This game is great"
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-29,God of war of course
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-29,God of War: Ragnarok.
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-29,D4 was fairly short in my experience. Unless it's very cheap i'll pick Ragnarok.
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-29,"I loved Diablo 3, my wife and I really enjoyed playing co-op so of course we got Diablo 4 when it came out. Massive disappointment in my opinion. It just felt really boring compared to Diablo 3, and none of the classes felt nearly as fun (and all felt quite weak), they added in loads of MMO-like elements to the game which make it feel like more of a slog. The storyline was moderately interesting but nowhere near engaging enough to continue playing, so we just decided to shelf the game for now in the hopes that after a year or so there will be enough new stuff to make it fun.

From what I understand, patches so far have only made it worse. 

Also, slight side note and I'm sure this doesn't affect everyone, but there is just *something* about the game that made me feel really sleepy whilst playing it, and I don't mean in a sense that I was bored, I mean literally something about the camera angle/UI/size of things, I really don't know, but it literally made me feel like I was falling asleep whilst playing.

God of War on the other hand is brilliant."
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-29,Make sure you snag the free Valhalla DLC for GOW
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-29,"Played both.. regretted buying Diablo 4. Strictly looking at storytelling, I found myself watching all the cutscenes on God of War. I was trying to actively skip any story element in Diablo 4."
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-31,Don‚Äôt touch D4 with a 39.5 foot pole!
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-31,Ragnarok. No question about it.
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-29,And now there's a free rogue lite mode which is also insanely good. God of War is my answer everytime.
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,How does elden ring compare to dark souls 3? It's it just open world dark souls?
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-29,I thought Diablo 4 had an awesome campaign/story and had fun with the different characters.
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,What if that list includes Gollum and Kong?
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,This is what Im thinking. PoE2 is amazing me with each new video released. Maybe I'll go for God of War and then PoE2 for free
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,No one plays action rpgs for the story. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,"Decidedly deceptive. OP, pop over to the Diablo4 subreddit. The game is awesome, and is different from D3. And it is better for it."
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-29,"You are confusing Diablo IV with Immortal, that one is pay to win."
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,"It does take a lot from Dark Souls, but the open world begs to be explored (unlike my experience with BotW/TotK).

Each dungeon that you come across has a unique boss and makes the exploration worth it."
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,Gollum don‚Äôt look too bad üòÇ
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,Except OP who is specifically asking about story qualities‚Ä¶
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,"I know some people like it, but let's be fair: it uses the same  mechanics from Diablo 2 (but somehow making them worse), a game which is 23 years old. You can't easily change builds because you have to pay for respec. The world is empty and you frequently travel vast distances without encountering any mobs. From the technical point of view the graphics are ok-ish, but the art direction is really bad and uninspired. There's probably some music, but I can't remember any themes.
The cinematics are really good tho, so there's that."
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-29,Neutral my ass
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-29,Maybe. Still ruined their reputation with me either way
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahajajajajhahahahahahahahahahhaha
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-28,"OP - just talk to people that actually play the game. This guy is so off-base and speaking from a place of inexperience. I mean, saying the graphics are ""OK-ish"" is crazy to me. Diablo 4 looks like a goth horror wet dream. It is gorgeous. 

But, all in all, based on OP's wants he should choose GoW:R"
18t28dt,2023-12-28,2023-12-29,ha!
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-10,"Honestly I think they were cool because we got to ride the kelpy, and also because they sorta bash it over your head that fate can be changed. If I hadn‚Äôt known that previously, I probably would‚Äôve called the ending a cop out."
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-10,"I thought they were one of the neatest parts of the story. And for people saying ""what was the point?"" weren't they there to show fate wasn't magical or concrete, that it was just educated guessing based upon previous character actions? That you weren't bound by fate, but unless you change your actions those best guesses are likely to happen?"
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-10,"Honestly my only complaint about that scene in the game was it took this picture for me to even get a good look at them XD I felt like the whole scene was designed so you could barely see them at all--did anyone else feel like this? I'm not sure what it was... all the darting around and attempts to be cryptic kind of cheated us out of getting a full visual. At least that was how it was for me, maybe I'm nuts."
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-10,They want that dark crystal.
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-10,I missed Greek kratos during this part again. Have you predicted this?? Just starts killing them lol
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-10,"Source: [https://www.artstation.com/artwork/lR3D8e](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/lR3D8e)

Norns (God of War Ragnarok)

>This was so much fun to work on, had the chance to collaborate with Dela Longfish and Bjorn Hurri on the design of the Norns for the game. We did a lot of explorations and pitches for how the scene would play out, playing with scale and the style. The idea being that they are share elements of the past, present and future of the same character and how that gets reflected on their design. This was their final design for the game."
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-10,They had only one scene and they were wrong in their predictions
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-10,My personal favorite scene in the game.
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-10,These dudes were so shoehorned into the game's story. If you cut them nothing of value would be lost.
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-10,"The most worthless part of the story. Basically just show up, get taunted by these hags, then change absolutely nothing.

Why was this a thing?"
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-10,Overrated game. Elden Ring is on another lvl compared to this game.
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-10,'I murdered the hell out of your Greek counterparts and one of them was goddamn gigantic.'
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-10,Reminds me a bit of The dark crystal film.
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-11,"last time kratos had  a run in with ladies that controlled fates, it didn't end well for the ladies."
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-11,So... urRu?
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-10,"Precisely.

Also liked that they kept things mysterious without explaining everything about them. Norns and the lady in the lake."
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-10,Yeah I loved that interpretation of the Norns and the the simultaneous turmoil and peace it caused the characters. It fit right into the theme.
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-10,They were moving around a lot but I didn‚Äôt have any problem seeing them. Was your brightness super low or something?
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-11,"No, they were right until Kratos actually resolved to change his ways. They didn‚Äôt believe he would."
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-11,"They themselves say that prophecies aren't some grand fate, they just make predictions based on patterns of behavior. There was no grand destiny that said X had to happen, it's just that people do not change.

Kratos is the exception because he *did* change."
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-10,"The younger one was my favorite. I chuckled every time she chimed in. Also ‚ÄúKratos attempts to not grunt, he fails.‚Äù"
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-10,"They confirm that fate isn't fixed, that's a pretty important part of the story. Especially since the Greek Fates were in control of how things happened."
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-10,"huh? it was like... one of the most crucial storytelling parts. it set up the whole later half of the game, thinking Kratos was doomed to repeat his actions, and then showing that it wasn't...that fate isn't real and you determine your reality...  


did i play a different game? i felt like it paved the entirety for that discussion."
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-10,"Well I think it's the theme of you chose your own fate by breaking your own cycles, but did feel very shoe horned in. Didn't really as much value to that point as the characters kind of all rejected the notion."
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-10,Lmfao
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-11,Lol

10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-10,Nope! Honestly I might just have been disoriented from all the motion because ADHD brain so it could 100% just be me XD
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-11,"Yes, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying, but there was a grand fate in Greek mythology, I mean we saw a mural of a mortal warrior battling Zeus (in GOW1).
Santa Monica was putting a lot of references to the ideas they might have went with, they made a Jesus reference too, they put the Star leading to the place of Jesus‚Äôs birth, and they said that they did want to bring Jesus, but thought it‚Äôd be too controversial."
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-11,The younger one trolling Feya was so good
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-10,"They confirmed what Kratos already knew because he had previously overcome fate? Sorry if I still think that it's a worthless detour in that case, because that's really what it all added up to."
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-10,"I get that, but still it amounts to nothing. ""We know exactly what you're going to do because you're so predictable.""

Then he goes and does what he was going to do anyway, so they were right... and he didn't change anything. How was going to see them necessary at all?"
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-11,"The whole game is shoe horned in. The Greek saga was six games long. I can only hope that they flush it out in the TV series. I wanted to fight god after god, Beowulf, sea serpents. We got, like, fucking Heimdall, Thor, and Odin. Add in Magni, Modi, and Baldur that's 6 gods he took on. And they weren't even that strong! When Zeus and Poisiden died the effects were catastrophic for Greece. What did these gods even do besides drink and fight? They needed to bring the lore to life in a meaningful way. They had 9 realms to dig into and they barely scratched the surface."
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-10,Lol
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-11,"In *Greece*, yes, but they were in the Nine Realms. Much smaller power level as you can see when Mimir and Freya are appalled at the idea of someone having the Fates' power over time."
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-10,"Except Kratos didn't know that. The Greek Fates controlled time, they didn't take Kratos seriously and died for their arrogance. Kratos then turned that power on the gods by saving the titans. Kratos assumed the Norns had that power but they don't. They can only make assumptions based on behaviour."
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-10,"They informed him that Atreus was in danger and where. Kratos *was* fighting the prophecy until he realized they only told him that so he could go be the god-killer he was always meant to be to protect his son. At that point, he didn't give a shit anymore."
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-10,"Well again I kind of agree.. but I think it tried to say even if you do the ""fated"" thing but for the right reasons it's different? I dno it was a bit of the game I kind of struggled with to. Spent time trying to get it but that's about as close as I got. Although there is a moment with Loki in the ending sequence where it kinda plays out but kinda poorly."
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-10,"Regardless, in Ragnorok Kratos says over and over how much he doesn't believe in ""fate"" or the Fates.

They're entire purpose is to pad-out the game by making you go to 3 separate caves and fight more generic enemies. Just to tell you ""you should kill Heimdall""....which Kratos was already thinking about doing, anyways.

They're cool, but holy-smokes, GoWR had a lot of bloat.

In retrospect, GoW2018 is a much better game because it's so much leaner and focusses on the gameplay and story in a better way.

Ragnorok focusses WAAAAAY too much time on story. Like 30% of the game is walking-and-talking."
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-10,"Sorry, I haven't played it since it came out, but did they inform them where Atreus was? Because as far as I remember, they already knew >!Atreus was in Asguard. This wasn't why they went to them, they were looking for a way to subvert the fate of starting the war. !< 

And if you're saying Kratos had to go to them to get the ""fuck you"" energy to say ""hell with fate"" then that's also a waste of time, because Kratos has always had that attitude."
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-11,"That's because he's seen how fate can be changed. As powerful as the Greek Fates were he managed to win. He used their power to change fate.

The weird thing with your complaint is usually I hear people say the opposite. They think Ragnarok was too rushed and should have been stretched into 2 games."
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-10,"Yeah, I was wrong about the info part (just rewatched). But I got the idea he still went there for general information about Atreus. Then the Norn says ""You will learn that Heimdall intends to kill your son in Asgard,"" Which is what's happening in the moment. And then, ""You will do what you do best.""

&#x200B;

Kratos knows from experience that fortune tellers like these are always right. Avoiding the prophecy to keep himself alive isn't a priority anymore. He's not saying fuck it, he's embracing it; which leads to him being the >!fucking multi-verse spanning !<God of War."
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-11,"Maybe the ending was rushed. I mean the actual Ragnarok event was a big-wet-fart.

>!It's suppose to be the battle between all the realms, and all I ever saw was a couple of dark elves and the same companions we've been with all game.!<

>!And then Kratos instantly has a change-of-heart the moment the fight begins and goes ""Uh, you know that Ragnorok we spent all game trying to get? Yeah, uh, tell him to go home. We don't want him anymore.""!<

I don't think it should have been made into two games. But it could have, for how much it dragged on and on and on."
10yso1b,2023-02-10,2023-02-11,"There were more than that but it gets mentioned why before. Basically there aren't many left by that point.

It's not the moment it starts, it's when he sees Atreus react to something and remembers Faye."
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-07,"Some of you are not giving credit where it's due. Even if you didn't like Elden Ring, that game blocked out the sun when it was release. I haven't seen such an impactful release like that in quite awhile. It reminded me of launches like Ocarina of Time or Resident Evil 4. It was literally all anybody talked about for months. The gaming community was obsessed. I thought souls had already broken into the mainstream with Dark Souls 3, but no, NOW it has officially broken into the mainstream."
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-10-07,"Lot of Elden Ring fanboys here, I would not say Elden Ring will get Goty. God Of War may be end up getting it though they're different Gen games."
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-05,Ragnarok without a single doubt
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-08,"Elden Ring, hands down"
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-06-07,Elden Ring hands down. It fuckin delivered
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-06-07,Elden Ring is a masterpiece. I *highly* doubt ragnarok will beat it.
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-06-07,"Depends on what Ragnarok delivers since it still has not been released 

Elden Ring had a great open world probably the only real contender for Breath of the Wild in that particular regard 

but everything else about the game felt like the usual From Software game but with new issues 

mainly bad balancing with both weapons and normal enemies in the endgame having more damage than bosses and repeated bosses over 140 and of those just 9 were totally unique (in the meaning that they were never re-utilized in any way) 

and about 32% percent of all bosses is the correct number of bosses of the game if you don't count repeated encounters wich is an obscene number of copy paste (the rest of the enemies where only there to fill out the open world)

meanwhile God of War 2018 had a similar issue 8 Valkiries that where basically inferior versions of Valkirie Queen Sigrun and 18 troll enemies that although weren't intended as bosses by the studio many players regarded it as such because of their health bars (that where only there because of the size of the trolls and the no-cut camera not being able to zoom out over their heads to show their health bars)

Ragnarok has been stated by the director Eric Williams as a game that will surprise the players in the amount of enemies and cast of characters it will bring 

the world of God of War will also be at least twice as big as the older game making it feel less linear Elden Ring will likely still have a bigger and better open world but it also doesn't come close to God of War story-wise

if what Eric Williams declared turns to be done correctly that should fix my biggest gripes with GoW 2018 wich was already amongst the best games of all times and even won first place in the fan voted IGN 26 million users bracket to vote the best game of all times where it compeated with the best games in the history of gaming so as long as they properly build upon that Ragnarok could easily crush any game"
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-06,God of war ragnarok for my goty i liked elden ring itis best fromsotware soul game but god of war is more better masterpiece granphic better gona be combat better story better and more memorial i for god of war best games ever made
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-06-07,Elden Ring
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-10-02,"Both games deserve the title.  However Cory Barlog mentioned in an interview that God of War 2018 worked because they mapped out entire worlds and story for future God of War games, even before starting development on the 2018 game. 

If that is the case that means the story and world of GOWR is going to be next level and all the story loose ends from the previous game is going to be closed off in this sequel.

We will just have to wait and see how GOWR improves on the gameplay...."
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-09,Elden Ring cause its a game the trash industry has needed since the PS4 hit stores in 2014 and gaming went to shit. ER reminds me of old Xbox 360 games modernized because of its beautiful simplicity.
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-07,gow will be a good game but it's just a safe copy of the 2018 nothing to new or revolutionary it's just a safe game Nothing really changed but everyone is on the hype train and saying its better and hasn't even played it elden ring deserves GOTY
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-07,"I feel like Elden Ring has to take the cake here.

I'm sure GOW Ragnarok will be incredible and a game absolutely worth playing. However, Elden Ring is Fromsoft's best game yet in many people's opinion and had an incredibly impactful release, with very few criticisms. Ragnarok might be a similar case when it releases, but it can't be more than a sequel. I'm not saying it will be worse than GOW 2018 -- it could certainly be better -- but it will lack the innovation and uniqueness required for a GOTY. 

Basically, Ragnarok won't win GOTY because it's just a sequel while Elden Ring is a brand new experience with a whole new world.."
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-17,"Ragnarok might get best narrative, but Elden Ring is a once in a generation game."
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-22,"If game of the year was strictly based upon gameplay, then I would have no doubt that elden ring would win.

&#x200B;

However, games are more than just gameplay these days. There are tons of factors like graphics, story, characters, etc. 

&#x200B;

Where elden ring excels in gameplay and musical score, ragnarok comes in with a much better story, better graphics, better visuals, etc. 

&#x200B;

It comes down to the fact that Ragnarok has well-balanced gameplay to match its incredible story and visuals, whereas Elden Ring's story is kind of lacking. (this is just my opinion)"
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-12-01,I was 100 percent in Elden rings camp. But having finished God Of War Ragnarok last night I think it deserves it. Almost never in gaming has a game delievered in every second and been so emotional and deep. Its true art. Still would be happy ither way.
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-06-07,"Elden Ring came from nowhere and absolutely delivered.

Think I‚Äôll return to it soon and finish it up."
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-06-07,Elden ring unless they make god of war back into an actual god of war game then maybe it has a chance.
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-06-07,Elden Ring
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-06-07,Is Ragnarok even coming out this year?
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-12-02,"Elden Ring is a great game, GoW Ragnarok is a great movie. I think ER deserves it more, but at this point I fully expect a movie to win GOTY (again).

Also to whoever put ER in the best narrative category, I want some of whatever you're smoking."
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-05,Who even cares? Must we constantly put these games up against eachother?
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-21,"As a person who was played both i prefer ragnarok due to the story telling and the pure enjoyment not only to the story missions but also to side quest being jaw dropping or just plainly interesting. Don't get me wrong ER is an amazing game, but in my opinion in terms of pure enjoyment id choose GOW ragnarok. i think its also important to note the games gives different types of enjoyment. even thought they are similar the experience could not be more different. 

its more a matter of preference than quality."
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-09,MW2 as well.
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-14,"Same gen, they're both on ps4"
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-22," Got to also wonder how their respective release dates might affect it too. Elden Ring came out in February earlier this year and Ragnarok only came out a month before the Game Awards.

 I wonder if Elden Ring will win since more people  have had a chance to play it since the game has been out for so long, or if it'll have the opposite effect and more people will vote for Ragnarok because of the recent hype..."
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-17,The visual on ragnarok so the same goes for get my vote üíØ
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-21,its not tho
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-15,"be surprised, somehow gow 2018 (which is even more overated) beat RDR2 for goty."
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-07-07,What do you mean only real contender for breath of the wild in that regard? Neither elden ring nor breath of the wild had the best open world. Good games but they are for sure not being carried by their open world.
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-07, it's not a masterpiece it's a good game also check your grammar and spelling.
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-06-07,I definitely agree due to the fact of it's popularity I think that god of war Ragnarok will surely do great but not as great since Elden Ring sold 14 million copies in the 2nd week of it's release which is crazy!
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-11,Lol fanboy hater
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-14,You have no idea what you're talking about. Ragnarok is transformed and just completely piledrives gow 2018 maybe try playing games before judging them?
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-07,"I mean ER was good and the difficulty level was good to keep you gripped. That being said, the story was terrible and you cant even argue that you cared about the ER storyline. GOTY will go to either one which is good; however, I imagine it will go to Ragnarok because it has characters and development you can get invested in."
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-07,Sekiro is way better
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-14,"Not a brand new experience. It's open world souls. If you took out the souls mechanics established in demon souls on ps3 the game would be nothing. Its just the most popular souls game, not even the best IMHO."
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-18,"Its literally Dark souls 3 with an open world mod installed. GoWR is phenomenal graphically, has an in-depth story to back it up, superb soundtrack to finish off. GOTY is about a game that hits everything, Elden ring was good, GoWR was amazing."
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-27,If you base graphics off makes a great game you are a nut. Smh the gaming community nowadays.
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-10-07,Are you kidding? It's just another Bloodborne Darks Souls Game.
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-06-07,Someone who feels how I do about modern god of war. They stripped away a lot of what made the older games so great and I just can‚Äôt get over that at all.
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-04,Yes
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-22,"Not really since the game launched in a pretty poor state. Also didn't see that much hype for the multiplayer itself although I did see some for the campaign and Warzone 2.0.

Edit: Im an idiot and forgot that MW2 (2009) existed. smh."
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-15,"I meant, they're different type of games."
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-21,okay
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-20,[deleted]
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-03,Elden Ring and Breath of The Wild had fantastic open worlds and are miles better than the open world games we have now.
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-07,"if GoW 2018 can beat RDR2, Ragnarok will win. ER was very good but GOTY goes (usually) to better story games. ER story was abysmal."
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-08,So gow isn't a masterpiece but elden ring is?I believe it's the other way around.
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-24,"Nah they're both, without a doubt, masterpieces. Thinking that one or the other isn't a masterpiece is just an incorrect opinion, from an impartial standpoint."
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-10-07,Dude elden ring is a Multi platform game so it's normal to sell a lot more than a exclusive.
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-06,Dude elden ring multiplatformü§° god of war only playstation and god of war older 2018 sold 25m more then your elden ring on all platforms
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-11,Atleast im not a sony dog
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-17,i have played it and if you have you'll now know its  a safe copy no big jumps or changes nothing revolutionary like what elden ring attempted and succeded ragnarok took the safe way the puzzles were the same if you found something you didn't go omg I wonder if anyone else found this unlike when you discover something in elden ring sony took the safe route which is fine their formula produces mostly 9 plus stars they didn't need to change which is why elden ring deserves goty fromsoft took the extra leap and did it perfectly
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-09,Lmao you‚Äôre high
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-11,I disagree the story is very interesting and ingrained in the game
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-09,What? I loved ERs story same with like 90% of the ER fanbase lmao.
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-09,This is about 2022 chief.
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-15,sekiro has no replayability.
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-21,agree people dont even copair sekiro to er. I had so mutch more fun with sekiro than elden ring.
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-21,yeah people say like its somthing so new lol. The combat is preety mutch the same i would argue its even worse soemtimes. When u fight some bosses as melle you get one hit in then you need to wait for the boss to do a combo witch might or might not have a follow up and then u can put two more hits in. Idk sekiro and even ds3 the boss fights felt more like actualy fights like i was in a dance in elden ring i just feel like i need to wait for them to do a move and then repeat.
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-18,"Well, then you may just as easily say that Ragnarok is GoW (2018) with... what exactly? More characters (and some recurring), some new areas (some recurring), different musical themes (some recurring), and some - slightly - different combat options."
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-27,The ost is trash and thats not even opinionized. GOW was ruined when the first next gen one released and was turned into some corny father/apprentice storyline like every other boring ps4 era game. Its a movie not a game. A boring walking simulator. Elden Ring is just like classic xbox 360 games. Its a game the industry has needed since that garbage ps4 console hit stores in 2014.
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-29,"He's not saying graphics alone make GoTY, its a combination of everything that makes a game visually pleasing. Graphics have a role in that, including 2D, 3D, pixelated etc.

&#x200B;

Smh the part of the gaming community that can't think about game design objectively for more then 3 seconds."
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-07,And gow is just another gow same as the game before. I can‚Äôt tell the difference between the two games. Maybe graphically a bit better however it is the same engine and the same gameplay same movesets.
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-06-07,"Yeah, you two can be bitter about it while everyone else has an incredibly good time with the new god of war. Now it has actual characters to give a fuck about an not just quick time events and mediocore fighting."
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-22,Yeah man MW2 2009 not MW22 lol..
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-15,"Oh, genre gotcha"
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-21,I mean i had a lot of problens with it and i played all ds games and sekiro
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-20,"I didnt really like RDR2,but i think GOW is far from being a masterpiece. Maybe the first 5 hours of it was. The game is basically 4 hours of real content repeated over and over to pad out game time. There are like what 3 types of enemies? Even bosses are mostly cloned with different colors. Not to mention the forced RPG progression system that plaques the modern western game.

Imo GOW could have been a masterpiece if it was like 8-9 our long."
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-04,"Lol Elden Ring world is empty as fuck and the only activity his farming mob to get some random tressure, BOTW is a better but neither or great opens worlds."

rdr2 enters the chat"
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-07,"Maybe because you did not research it or got into the lore. Fromsoft games story is told differently. I like it because of the fact that a lot of things can be interpreted differently. So yeah imo gow story is worse, due to the fact that it is a butchered Norse mithology."
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-11,You do have to dig for the lore it‚Äôs not on plate like gow
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-11,Er has changed the gaming scene it‚Äôs already a masterpiece only uneducated people think otherwise once gow comes out then it can be decided if it is a masterpiece or if everyone was riding the hype
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-04,Another thing that is better about Elden ring
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-07,and still wont win GOTY or be as good  and its also been out 4 years and elden ring will surpass it in sales by the end of the year

v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-21,"ur stupid ""copy"" what about the copy paste of bosses everywhere in elden ring 9 unique bosses i think ds3 base had like 19? lol.  Nothing new combat wise to. I need to scroll to use fucking spells in 2022 yes perfect game"
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-14,It's also minimal and excessively vague. Ragnarok actually tells you a story.
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-17,"Not everyone wants to read every scroll and tidbit of lore. Most casual gamers want to enjoy the story with the presentation and narration. That's why most people say ER has no story. If they narrated the story like Horizon or GOW, it wouldn't even be a competition."

v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-18,"You can use that exact comment but used Elden Ring and Dark Souls 3, at least Ragnar√∂k brought the conclusion of a fantastic story. GoW has this in the bag, Elden Ring fan boys be damned."
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-21,yes mate yes good point ragnarok combat has new stuff in it tell me what feels difrent from ds3 to elden ring? cause i have 400h in ds3 and the combat animations are the same.
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-18,"And what... because a game takes the time to flesh out an entire world with staple characters, staple locations and themes... that makes it bad? That would equate to Breath of the Wild, GoW and The last of us being deemed unqualified for GoTY, and they all got it."

Elden Ring delivers not only a wide range of enemies with distinct animations and patterns but exploration is fantastic for an open world game. They've managed all of this with great combat and graphics. People just love tearing things down instead of giving credit. You don't have to like the game but you should acknowledge Elden Ring as an achievement, especially in today's gaming climate. Please tell us all which games have better open worlds."

v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-23,"I prefer God of War over Elden Ring and take this from someone who's done playthroughs on Elden Ring. Elden Ring only gets relatively fair when you new game + and is so grindy you back then especially needed to grind for practically everything needing runes and tons of other things especially with us having summons (which is a plus I will say) that we need to upgrade. Compared to God of War the story falls off due to the fact that it's very vague and all lore after lore. Sure it leaves it up to interpretation but also can be a poor excuse for lazy writing. God of War Ragnarok has its fair share moments as well but you calling someone a goe fanboy but then reply to every single person with an opinion because you're a die hard ""git gud"" guy shows how low the bar is for people like that. All jokes aside I can see either game winning this as they both have their moments and flaws but I do see Ragnarok having the edge as previously God of War (2018) bested Red Dead Redemption 2 which was a phenomenal game."
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-15,"But ragnarok also has gameplay and is gameplay driven. Rag isn't a walking sim. They're both fully fledged games, it's just one has a fully fledged story that doesn't require research sessions to fully appreciate."

v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-21,ok sure but base combat i mean mechanically it dosnt feel all that good. jump attack are nice i guess crouch attack eh. i just wanted a bit more style combos for example not just swing swing stab stab and weapon art.
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-19,">You said ER is ""literally Dark souls 3 with an open world mod installed"", but when it comes to GoW its apparently a good thing be similar to its predecessor

Similar in ways yes, but there's key differences. Elden Ring is similar to every other souls game through its combat, world building methods etc. GoWR is similar to GoW (2018) in the fact that it takes place in the same location, 3 years in the future. GoWR is telling a cinematic journey, that's its biggest strength.

&#x200B;

The difference is Elden Ring feels like someone took any other souls game, downloaded a few mods, slapped a new title on it, and called it a day. Yes, GoW is in the same universe, but the game is a continuation, the story is advancing, the world is changed. Its not trying to be something different and failing, it knows exactly what it is. Elden Ring is being called a ""gaming revolution"" which is entirely up for debate, rather GoWR carries one of the best journeys experienceable within gaming.

&#x200B;

In the end, this type of argument is entirely subjective, and comes down to opinion and experience. I've been waiting four years for GoWR and was incredibly excited for its conclusion. However, I only got into the Souls series in 2020, so my enjoyment of the series is quite fresh and undeveloped. In the end of the day, us gamers dictate 10% of the votes vis-√†-vis the awards. A panel of judges dictate the remaining 90%. It comes down to which ever one they pick, but either way we all have our own 'Game of the Year""."

v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-24,We definitely are not
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-23,>It's a different form of narration die-hard no he called me stupid so I said git gud i don't think that's die hard git gud guy but each to their own im surprised by your opinion since I'm assuming you've played it and know that it doesn't deepen or expand the action-adventure genre in any way everything is predictable especially if you've played similar games horizon assassins creed or previous god of war games you know exactly what your in for gowr is focused on story and narrative the story is more engaging than er but that doesn't make up for the issues gow has with combat exploration and itemization unlike er players are not rewarded the same way for exploring and you often know the exact puzzles you find as well as the loot there are no surprises and you never wonder if any other player has found it since it's not unique or original whatever you found the combat largely follows the same formula of enemies popping out of every place you would expect then you have to burst through your cooldowns to eliminate and then r1 or r2 everything to death before repeating never feeling like your getting any stronger and the loot system never makes you feel stronger and doesn't change the way you play the game gow is like a marvel movie everyone will go watch it have a blast and people will keep coming back for new ones but they will never push for more they wont go that step further they have there formula and stay to it fromsoft took a much bigger risk with er and is continuing to innovate on the genre and gameplay so your opinion surprises me but whatever you had more fun with is predominantly what you will want for goty even if the other game has done all these things better however after completing gowr i had a blast i don't feel at all driven to play it again but er there are countless builds that make me what to go play the game in a different way even now but i disagree on seeing Ragnar√∂k having a chance at edging er out of goty just in my perspective each to there own tho :)
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-23,also no need to try and insult me :)
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-23,"Well you don‚Äôt play FIFA with keyboard either or assassins creed with keyboard but yes it is your choice (a controller is not 60 bucks, you can buy some for 20)."
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-25,"What?????? Late game Elden Ring might be the best gaming experience ever created! The areas are fucking gorgeous, especially the one with Maliketh. The bosses are incredible with a ton of unique abilities, and I loved the difficulty spike towards the end. Anybody who is decent at souls games and doesn‚Äôt use those stupid summons in ER would agree that it‚Äôs the best game ever created. Ragnarok takes the story writing for sure, but no game ever has set a vibe within the boss arenas like ER did. Absolutely outstanding game, blows my mind still to this day."
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-28,Just shut up fanboy. Elden ring was a big all platform game they should have done better for pc locked on 60 fps in 2022 lol
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-05,"I cannot remember a single thing about odyssey even if I played that more recently when it was added to gamepass. And for some reason I can still remember every single location, side quest, map, mini boss, story (even if it was vague af) of elden ring. And im pretty sure my playtime was similar in both games. Odyssey was just a very forgettable experience lol"
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-21,To be fair i hate how quests were done in elden ring. I played every souls game and i think elden ring being an open world should have at least a jurnal telling you what the fucking npcs saied so ik what to fucking do. Cause i googled most of them.
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-21,There is story if you paid some attention to it then you would see that it is told from the start. Why should every game have a story like movies? I mean I could watch god of war on YouTube and have the same story as playing it myself. It‚Äôs replay-ability is also restricted to the fact that it is a linear story. So yes i think Elden ring has a better story and not only that but also a much deeper story and lore. The npc-s you meet in Elden ring all have their own stories which can be continued some even tie into each others.
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-23,The thing is its not the same fifa sure with keybord would be stupid but i like elden ring on pc i played all souls and sekiro and im good at these games with keyboard and mouse. It wouldnt be even so dificult to add an option to idk use spells with 1 2 3 4 5 right? Or idk spriting on same buton as dodge
v6kawl,2022-06-07,2022-11-25,I just dont agree maybe i need to play once more finished ds3 7+ new game and i played pvp a lot i have 400 hours finished ds 2 and sekiro to didnt finish 1 yet cause i dont have time right now. But elden ring late game i thought the balance was bad and fights feelt off not all offcurse the lion guy that hrabs you was a really good fight one of the best. But mellania is one of the most lane bose designs i fought btw the game is verry beutifle that i agree

y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,"Truth is Santa Monica studios does amazing work GoW 2018 had an expansive move set and the ability to customize through armor sets, talismans, and enchantments if Ragnarok is anything close to similar than it stands a chance. Open world games are nice but can become exhausting, a clear linear story focused game can pull off things open world games can't, look at dark souls when compared to elden ring.  If you reply to this you'll say it's weak or a cop out but in truth I just don't see you as the type to enjoy the kind of game Ragnarok will be and that's fine but don't count it out because it's not your cup of tea"
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,"God of War is far more cinematic than Elden Ring.

Really you can't even compare the two, they come from completely different design philosophies."
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,"If GoW: Ragnarok is anything like its predecessor it will feature a more engaging story, better characters, and more dynamic and balanced combat. All its really going to lose in the trade for a higher overall level of quality is those gorgeous sweeping vistas. 

Open worlds give more choices but many options end up unfeasible for most players to take any ways. The end result is often the illusion of more choices at the cost of quality in other areas, and Elden Ring is no different in that regard."
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,"Well, since I'm seeing there's a clear bias here, I'm going to follow up my last post (In a somewhat admittedly vindictive way):

GoW developers are *significantly* better at optimization.  Elden Ring's optimization was and continues to be a shitshow."
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,"The story. GoW 2018's heart is really the father/son relation between Kratos and Atreus. They just need to focus on that and tell a good story, and hopefully evade the obvious clich√© of Atreus killing Kratos at the end."
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,"I have an opinion,  but OP is so fucking biased there's no point stating it."

It won't for me, but it definitely has a chance with the gaming public."
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,Fromsoft games are accessible to people who like fromsoft games. I always get lost and have no idea what I'm doing. But everyone can play a linear character based game and get sucked in emotionally. If it's as fun as the first one it'll probably knock out elden ring.

More accessible story.

Less bullshit side quests

Tighter controls

Better camera

More spectacular and mechanically engaging boss fights

Not bogged down with crafting trash

It's because they gave us a horse?"
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,OP is just a fromsoft fanboy that won't hear any critiques about his precious Elden Ring. He's not even trying to hide it and it comes off as quite pathetic.
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,"Elden ring was just another soul's game. It never understood the appeal of it and I own it.

God of War is gonna be a masterful art of storytelling with a with a reverence for real World mythology, not to mention the larger than life but very grounded characters"
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-11-04,"By appealing more to the general consumer base. God of War comes from the modern Sony school of homogenization in game design, wherein old genres gradually absorb more and more DNA from their more popular contemporaries until they become more palatable to a wider range of people. It's why Sony's games tend to be so similar. They're trying to cast as wide a net as they can to hook people in with one game, and then keep them buying Sony games by virtue of them all being similar enough to entice the playerbase of another franchise. If you liked Uncharted, you'll like The Last of Us and God of War. If you liked Horizon, you'll like Spider-Man and Ghosts. God of War used to be a character-action game, but was diluted into being more of a cinematic adventure game with character-action elements mixed in with RPG-lite mechanics. As a pure action game it pales in comparison to Devil May Cry, Ninja Gaiden, Bayonetta, Metal Gear Rising, etc. but evaluating it on those merits misses the point. They didn't want to make a more complex action game, because then that would alienate some of the casual player base that's intimidated by that genre. To sucker in the kind of audience that played The Last of Us, Uncharted 4 and the rest, Sony dumbed those mechanics down to make it more accessible, keeping just enough depth to make the player feel like they're being a total badass, even if the gameplay really isn't all that deep."
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,"I haven't played Elden ring yet but I played all souls like (except demon's) and god of war and this question sounds pretty dumb to me, I don't think you can objectively compare two games that are likely to be very different, it's like asking ""how could Crash bandicoot beat Hollow knight?"""
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,It already has surpassed Elden Ring for me because i don't care about soulslikes. Different strokes for different folks.
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,"It‚Äôs most likely going to Elden Ring. But Elden ring did have what I believe to be a smaller fan base than your standard action adventure game like God of War. 

I don‚Äôt think GOW is going to do anything ground breaking, but it is going to be extra popular because the AAA titles are a little thin right now."
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,It has a bigger audience who enjoy gaming and story  vs people who want a challenging boss fight and find the story themselves
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,"Also, no I'm going to ask. What on Earth that I can do different.

It basically took the combat of the last 5 games in that series and mixed it with a breath of a wild open world design."
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17," GoW can have better narrative, be more consistent since elden ring gets kinda bad towards the end, have better optimization, more immersive combat, etc.

I honestly think you're incredibly biased towards elden ring. I played the whole game and the only difference between other souls games is the open world, even then it's not perfect since there is a clear issue with constantly repeating bosses and dungeon layouts. Imo it hasn't ""defined"" anything in gaming, just polished the open world thematic a bit and incorporated it to souls classic gameplay, which is good don't get me wrong, but let's not exaggerate please"

I imagine its gameplay is going to be more of the same (which I‚Äôm fine with), whereas Elden Ring was quite innovative within its genre. ER was all anybody talked about for over a month, and it has the advantage of being on Xbox, PC, and PS. The lack of any straightforward story in ER was a huge turnoff for me, but it seems that I‚Äôm in the minority. I did appreciate ER for what it was, though.

y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-18,"In sales by end of year? No.

I doubt it will track 12 month sales either.

I would be willing to put it at 8 million after 12 months.

They pushed it out too far for TGA GOTY contention this year.

Will it be the fastest and best selling PS5 title so far? Yes.

Will it be the fastest and best selling GoW so far?
Yes.

Do the PlayStation loyal deserve this win?
Absolutely."
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-18,"Could? A similar defining advancement in action combat, interactive narrative or dynamic campaign structure.

Alternatively it could win for being the best game judged solely on polish and acting. There's no shortage of people like that out there."
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-21,"God of war 2018 was a great game that the general public loved, if ragnarok fixes gow 2018 issues with enemy variety, combat variety and pacing it could(depending on how well it is done) beat elden ring. Elden ring is amazing, i am still playing, just need to beat malenia and the final boss(idk who it is), but the ending is worse than the rest of the game unfortunately, the snow area is not that fun to explore like other regions were.

So basically, if it has better gameplay than 2018 and good narrative pacing it could beat elden ring."
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,What gives you the confidence that Ragnarok will pull through?
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,I actually agree with you.
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-18,[deleted]
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,I'm sorry but saying they're two completely different games is a cop-out for figuring out what's the better game.
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,Do you agree that the combat in Ragnarok need to be higher in variations?
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,"I agree, From Software is messy with it's optimization. You're definitely not wrong there."
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,No amount of optimization is going to make the difference between God of War and Elden Ring. That's just silly.
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,It'll definitely win in the story department.
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,That's unfortunate
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,What about gameplay?
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,That's a cop-out to the question.
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,Why not for you?
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-18,[deleted]
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,Even if the combat has the same amount of variation?
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-12-13,[deleted]
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,Those are some interesting ambitions
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,A weak response but I don't disagree.
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,I have plenty of problems with Elden Ring. I don't believe in the perfect video game. If you state your problems with Elden Ring I might even agree with you.
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,"Well let's look at that actually. 

Aesthetically what do you prefer, Crash Bandicoot or Hollow Knight?"
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,Well there you go.
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,Good point.
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,That's actually a good point however it's also a Playstation exclusive until a PC release.
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,Thank you for that honest response.
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,Exactly
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,Red Dead Redemption 2 wasn't really anything groundbreaking in my opinion.
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,And that was dumb
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-18,I agree.
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,Thats a cop out answer. What gives you the confidence it won't.
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,"I never said it would, you just asked about how it could.

I either case Elden Ring isn't my GotY anyway and I I doubt Ragnarok will either."
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,The last game was stellar and the trailers are also stellar
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-18,Beaten the game.  Several times.
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,"I mean, about the only thing they have in common is that they're in a fantasy-esque setting.  God of War focuses a *lot* more on cinematic story-telling, while all soulsbourne games focus far more on indirect environmental story-telling.  Both tell compelling stories, just in much different ways.

Gameplay wise they're both satisfying, but God of War isn't aiming for the punishing difficulty the soulsbourne boasts about.  Really the only way they're similar is that they do have a dodge/parry centric battle system."
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,"Not quite sure what you mean by variation but in any case I'd probably disagree.

Some games are best experienced in the first playthrough and don't need to offer more than enough to keep its gameplay fresh for that much time."
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,"Well god of war you actually have an expansive move set you can use to combo or juggle your enemies, etc. Many people will find that more fun than spamming R1 or trying to do an ash of war and realizing the boss doesn‚Äôt even have an opening large enough for you to get it off without getting hit."
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,"It's 2022 mate. People don't care about gameplay anymore.

People would give a movie GOTY at this point."
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,Just not into God of War. And I'm really into Soulsborne.
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-18,The two trolls at the start of bloodborne have been yelling that at me for two years lol
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-31,Did you actually play it?
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-12-13,Lol ok
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,"Elden Ring is an excellent game, but it's also got some serious jank and underbaked elements"
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-18,"It‚Äôs too big. It‚Äôs so big that half of it means nothing. They created a vastly open (but abhorrent empty) open word with one of the most weak storytelling narrative designs in all of modern gaming. Half the story is barely fleshed out in any meaningful way. 

The replayability of elden ring actual isn‚Äôt very high literally because the game is so big. Anyone aside from FromSoft Stans that somehow have 1000 hours a month to play will finish one play through and deem a second too long to commit to. 

The characters are pretty basic, none of them can really be connected with. 

What Elden Ring has going for it is versatility of combat and a push to discover the world (a world, not necessarily a well-designed world). 

Questing is disguised behind lack of markers. People think oh the quests are so dynamic, but they‚Äôre all literally fetch quests. Find a person. Talk to person. Move on. That‚Äôs it. 

FromSoft fans love it because they love FromSoft games and they love the challenge of the combat. 

But games are primarily an interactive story and if you can‚Äôt connect well to the characters and the story you‚Äôve missed a really important part of gaming.

Plenty of categories aside from ‚Äúopen world and hard combat‚Äù"
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,"I totally prefer Hollow knight but this is just a matter of personal taste, I believe it's pointless to compare two games that are so vastly different"
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,I just want them to remake blood borne lol
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-18,"i know that everyone has its own opinion and stuff. but you can't deny that it was indeed groundbreaking in A LOT of things. 

Like: graphics, open world design, physics, realism, attention to detail, enviromental storytelling, ...

and even 4 years after release it still let look new AAA games look like trash."
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-18,I just realized that it will do audio a lot better. Full surround with 3D audio. If Santa Monica is playing to the strengths of the system they should have leaned hard on the adaptive triggers and 3D audio.
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,"Just the amount Elden Ring achieves as a finished game. 

God of War 2018 was also a very finished game but suffers in variety for replay value depending on your ambitions with it due to the lack of combat choices and outcomes."
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,Then what will? If you say Stray then I'm out lol.
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,Let's hope that alone is enough.
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-18,[deleted]
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,You sort scratched the surface of technical comparison but you contradicted yourself.
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,How do you measure replay value in video games generally?
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,"Does complex gameplay win over bland level design?,"
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,I hope this is satire.
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,It's definitely hard to beat the quality of the From Software games.
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-31,Play what?
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,I agree.
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,"Okay so Hollow Knight gets one point. 

1/0

Which game has the best gameplay?"
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,A remaster would be nice.
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,"But cats.

Seriously though, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 or Horizon Forbidden West so far. Tunic right behind those. Elden Ring is probably right after those three."
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-21,"Elden ring is beautiful yes(with an artistic pov in mind), but not more cinematic sorry"
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,Feel free to point out the contradiction.  There's more that sets them apart than makes them similar.
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,If it has a strong narrative or first playthrough experience it doesn't need to be replayable at all. The weaker the story or first experience the more replayability it should have to compensate.
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,[deleted]
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,"It really isn't.

Elden Ring was absolutely amazing. 

But stuff like God of War is going to be praised over and over for its story, even if the gameplay is absolute garbage.

It happened for RDR2, it happened for Witcher 3. It's going to happen again."

y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,"Hollow Knight is a terrible 3D platformer, and Crash sucks at being a metroidvania, so they both suck. Elden Ring is the worst point and click adventure I've ever played."
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,I haven't played any of those. Not really my style personally.
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-21,[deleted]
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,I would but I need to move on. I'm getting a lot of responses for this topic.
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,So gameplay doesn't matter to you?
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,So if it's just for the story then you would have no problem watching a playthrough on YouTube?
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,I'm afraid you're right. It does appear to be heading into that direction.
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,Okay
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,"Agreed, they're both entirely different experiences. 

No reason to compare therm."
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,"Okay, have a great day then."
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,LOL
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-21,"I believe ""camera"" work and how things on screen are presented(not how pretty they are), i do believe elden ring's world and bosses have better design tho

But souls games do not have a great cinematic presentation but they excel with world and enemy design."
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,Nice cop out.
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,"Of course it does? How is that related to replayability? 

Sekiro has amazing gameplay, but its action focus gives me little reason to play it more than once.

Bloodborne's lovecraftian midgame twist is best experienced on the first playthrough and its gameplay is smooth and very refined so it really only needed the handful of weapon options it gave us for replayability."
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,[deleted]
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,IKR?
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,Gameplay is the most important aspect of replay value. I can watch a playthrough on YouTube if I want to watch the story but gameplay wise I can alternate my experience through it's depth.
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,"That's an interesting attempt for a comparison but we're asking about entertainment. 

That chocolate comparison would work better if you were referring to typing something versus handwriting something. I commend your effort though."
y6ejv3,2022-10-17,2022-10-17,"Gameplay can be good and offer limited replay value. 
Gameplay can be bad but offer a lot of options. 

Your definition sucks."

1gmka4n,2024-11-08,2024-11-08, I mean reddit is a very big public place. Even people who aren't joined in groups can still downvote you. And honestly? I don't really care that's just my honest thoughts about this woman in God Of War.
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-08,"I hate people who just accept this just like micro transactions. At least make the digital versions cheaper! Come on! You can‚Äôt tell me it cost so much to sell those. I bet there will actually be more people with less money buying it for cheap so in the end it‚Äôll actually probably make them more profit. Like how how McDonald‚Äôs makes billions off selling for less but to more people because of low costs. 

It‚Äôs funny because I heard Sony actually got sued recently for their prices. Also $10 more for Ps5 version is messed up. It‚Äôs just slight improvements and before it used to be free. The problem is us accepting stuff like this which lets them slowly increase prices!"

yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-08,Like bruh 70quid for a STORY GAME most new games are 50-60 no reason to be 70 as the standard  edition. This game already has so much hype there's no need for it to be that much
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-03,"$70 is $10 more than new AAA games have been for decades.

yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-03,Years of ridiculously high quality effort is why. If you put in years of ridiculously high quality effort I would wager you could afford the game.

yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-03,"Why are games expensive, particularly AAA games? Because they take an incredible amount of work from large, complex organizations. They're also a huge amount of content (most of the time). Based on a quick Google, the God of War campaign was around 20 hours if you just hammered straight through, and up to 50 if you really got the most out of it. 

That's between 10 and 25 movies worth of work - animations, dialogue, sound design, music, level design, art design, lighting, game mechanics and on and on. Imagine producing 25 interactive movies. 

Red Dead Redemption 2 was between 50 and 80 hours, with some much detail in it's world that it's hard to wrap your head around sometimes. That game was $59.99 when it came out.

$70 is a lot of money to spend on a game, I get that. But for the right game it's incredible value for money. This is why it's so frustrating when AAA games release that are broken, unrealized messes - because there is so *much* potential there."
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-03,Well from what the reviews say you should wait till it goes on sale
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-03,Get a friend you trust  and share accounts or the disk.
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-04,"If anything, games have gotten cheaper. I'm pretty sure I spent 90-100 bucks on Starfox 64 and that was in the 90s. We just got used to the 60 bucks price tag for so long and steam sales. A new AAA game is gonna push whatever the market rate should be (more so with collector editions) on the flip side, Vampire Survivors is only a few dollars and gave me over 100 hours of enjoyment."
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-04,"I feel you man, I have to wait until games go on sale to play them, usually already spoiled to hell, I bought GoW 2018 in lime 2020 at $30, couldn't wait any longer to play it"
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-04,"Why are games so expensive? Because increasingly few people work because they like what they do, and almost everyone wants to be richer and get more money out of others. And they don't give a shit if you particularly can't pay enough. That's why."
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-04,I'm 44. Gaming is cheaper than it's ever been. I was paying 40-50 for games in the 90s. I think you should just buy games on sale. There's really no need to buy games when they first come out nowadays. You can find half price sales on them after a couple months nowadays. We never had that in the 90s. We also didn't have a full library of free games to play.
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-09,its $125 on the ps5 store. wtf
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-09,"Happened to me a few minutes ago. Read an article how well GoW:R runs on PS4, was about to purchase it, despise my PS4 retired and all durt covered but then i did not. 

It was 69,99 + 5 Euro cuz \*special delivery for adult games with age verification\*, i directly lost interest. I will not buy a game for that price. First time that happened with me. My Line is reached here."
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-10,Idk man it sucks I hope you get it :)
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-12-25,I hate how they don't offer refunds just cause you installed that game. Very illegal in australia but they get away with it
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-04,"This

Most games are definitely not worth 70 bucks and you see it clear as day in how quickly they go on sale in just a few months"
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-03,In the 90s some games cost $100 in *those* dollars.
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-03,"I understand but why do we not compare it with Movies? A blu ray on day one will cost you 20 Euros. If you add the Ticket Price to it it is going to be max 35-40 Euros. 

It is understandable that a big team works for years on a game. But so do people in hollywood producing movies."
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-04,Why would it matter how much games cost back in the day? The issue is now! No one gives a toss of how much it cost to you back in the 80s.
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-04,Chrono Trigger came out in the 90s and that game was over $70 at launch. Same with some N64 games when they came out in the 90s too. People are getting a bargain now compared to what they paid 15-20 years ago.
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-10,Average redditer
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-03,"Keep in mind inflation, too.

Zelda 1 was $49.99 in 1986 dollars. That's $135.38 by today's money."
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-04,This person gets it. Some other NES games that came out in the late 80s were around $49.99 and you could beat them in 2 to 4 hours. Imagine paying $135 for a game you could beat in just a few hours. You get a whole lot more for your money today.
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-18,The cost of living is a joke to you huh?
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-08,"Yea sure and it‚Äôs the consumers fault, not the CEO‚Äôs who take millions and don‚Äôt pay their overworked employees üôÑ. At least charge $50 for digital versions new. It probably cost very little to resupply"
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-04,"Yeah, Sony really seems to be hurting... Poor Sony!"
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-03,"In the US, the average price of a TV is (roughly) $400 (roughly 2000 stones)(412 euros)(360 pounds). Not everyone has that money"
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-03,"Yep.

The original Zelda on NES retailed for $49.99+tax. Most games back in the day would be the equivalent of about $110-$130 in today's money.

TVs are dirt-cheap now, too, you're right. An 55"" LG OLED55B7A was $2,300 just six years ago in 2017. I got a 65"", also an LG, for ~$550 February this year."
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-04,Sounds like it's none of your business.
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-04,"A standard film lasts around 2 hours. An average AAA game main story takes 20 to 30 hours or longer. Regardless of how you compare apples to oranges, companies will sell their games at a profitable price that most people are willing and able to pay. Otherwise, no one would be able to afford the game, no one would buy the game, and the company would lose out."
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-03,Video games are still relatively niche compared to blockbuster movies. The number of people that will see the next Marvel movie is many times greater than the number of people that will buy a typical AAA game. And games generally take longer to produce
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-23,"To be honest, back then making games were huge deal, the hardware was not top notch like today, anything related to computer was hard to operate to create these files, internet was barely a thing  and buying games was not easy cause you didn't had sites like steam or psn stores or any eCommerce websites. So price was huge back then because compared to today the access was not easy at all"
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-04,"You could always sod off. Nobody is interested in the ""back in my day"" stories..."

yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-04,Sony is the publisher I‚Äôm talking about the developers lol.
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-03,How big of a TV are you trying to get? I got my 50in Roku 4k smart tv for $250 at Walmart and it wasn't on sale
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-03,"That's a lot cheaper than HDTVs were in the past.

My previous TV was a 40-inch 1080p Toshiba I got for a very good deal at $329.99+tax in 2015 or so.

My current TV is a 60-inch 4K LG TV I got for $550+tax."
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-04,Sounds like I don't care.
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-03,That‚Äôs not entirely accurate. The gaming industry is significantly larger than the movie industry and has been for well over a decade now. Currently it‚Äôs bigger than Hollywood and the entire music industry combined.
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-09,Video games are actually the biggest form of entertainment rn so it‚Äôs the opposite of niche
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-23,True they definitely had a smaller audience to sell to. Gaming has grown enormously since the 90s. But back then a game like Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy were like AAA stuff of their time. Cost to make a Final Fantasy game on the SNES was way cheaper and less labor intensive than what goes into making a modern FF like FF15 or the FF7 Remake. Having more people to buy the games now though helps with the cost.
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-15,Aww looks like someones triggered lol
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-03,"How is it not a fair comparison?

We're talking about what consumers had to pay for games, not how much they made."
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-04,"Sony is a publisher. And games like God of War Ragnar√∂k are made by Sony studios, hence Sony."
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-04,"It's just an average. Could be cheaper, could be more expensive"
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-04,Enough to respond.
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-04,"Monetary wise, they also charge more than movies and have lots and lots of revenue streams built into the games and continue to support those game.

Because players can stay engaged more than an hour or too per purchase they get more value out of it.

More people still actually watch movies."
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-15,"I am. People talking gleefully about the past as a sort of rectal lubricant to ease getting fucked triggers me.

Any other deep insights?"
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-04,"Physical media was also bigger back then. It costs 0 dollars to produce millions of digital copies compared to physical discs with boxes, yet the price remains the same.

My advice to op is to never pay more than 20 bucks for a videogame."
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-03,[removed]
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-04,I don't care.
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-15,If something like this triggers you then change your name to Karen I have been buying game for nearly 30 years and Even I admit there more expensive but  more work does go into making them.but the way the worlds economic crisis at them moment most people who I know will wait for games to come down in price before buying them.
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-04,"The biggest cost to publishers for games media has always been the license fee they pay to console manufacturers. The actual cost of producing physical games media has been under $1/unit ever since consoles switched to CDs/DVDs/BluRays.

That's part of the reason game prices went down when the PS1 launched: Cartridges were expensive. That's why Chrono Trigger cost more at launch than any Final Fantasy on the PS1, despite the latter games being multiple discs."
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-04,"I used Zelda as an example, but focusing on Zelda specifically is irrelevant.

Consoles have not significantly increased their output in a manner which should dictate a massive unit-on-unit cost decrease, economically speaking. The Gameboy edition of Tetris moved 43 million units. Super Mario World, 26,662,500 units. Pokemon Red/Blue/Yellow eventually sold 47,520,000 units, despite being an OG Gameboy title, and not only remains king of all Pokemon titles in terms of sales, but also beats any single Call of Duty's sales records.

The number of games sold and consoles sold has not increased that dramatically. Eight out of the twenty best-selling consoles of all time launched prior to the year 2000."
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-04,So why you keep responding?
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-15,"I do what I feel like.

Games can be more expensive to make, but AAA doesn't seem to be in trouble financially. Besides there are all sorts of other shanenigans to get more money out of the consumer, like microtransactions, season passes, DLC, live service schemes, gatcha mechanics, NFTs which will still continue. So cry me a river.

Can I call you Kiki? If you want to be sucking corporate be my guest."
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-04,"There are other costs to physical media than just simple production. Logistics and exports being the primary, once again non-existent in the digital realm. On the topic of license fees though, why would PlayStation studios pay license fees when they own their publisher owns the platform?

Ultimately the worth of any product is decided by the individual consumer's evaluation of it, and I have to say I agree with op."

yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-15,At the moment there not in trouble but who knows what the future will bring in at least years ago you got a full game on release day and not 2 hours of updates and as for microtransactions need to be banned I'm my opinion I don't mind dlc passes so much you do get alot of stuff for your money and call me what you like lol I really can't be bothered someone difference of opinion it's been lovely having this wonderful intellectual conversation with you have a good night

yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-15,I'll tell you that games seem to be getting even more busted releases after the price increase...
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-10,You‚Äôre a real dick.
yld5y1,2022-11-03,2022-11-04,I don't care.

z3pl2m,2022-11-24,2023-01-03,"I agree. Ragnarok was worst one yet. Gameplay and story were classic and predictable, but it was good. However thing i hated was:
-game was rushed, there should have been at least one more game
-odin seems too modern and too human, i don't expect them to act like greek gods, but they act like some sicilian mafia with modern slangs. Thor and Heimdall were the only ones who felt like Gods. 
-it turned into comedy. There are too many jokes and happy moments, Kratos' development was too quick, it just felt like it happened over night. 
-Freya forgave Kratos too quickly, it also felt rushed
-boss fights were awful and boring, especially odin's fight. I understand that they want to be more realistic but the price is entertainment. I excpected Odin's fight to be like Poseidon's, with him revealing his true form and power, killing Freya or even Kratos. I expected them to fight on the tree going from realm to realm and everything going nuts. Instead, we got boring human fight with some magic effects and many many quirky jokes (""DoN't fOrGeT mE mOtHeRfUcKeR"") it felt very easy and comedic, not at all what GoW should be like. 
-not many deaths. Even tho it's sad and hard, i wanted more of characters to die, even disney movies were more emotional than Ragnarok.
-T√Ωr...


Game is not worst thing that happened, it was still quite enjoyable to watch, but it was very very dissapointing. Everything should have been more epic..."
z3pl2m,2022-11-24,2023-02-05,"I was just playing and a little over 20hrs in I put my controller down and thought to myself,  ""I'm not having fun"".

Games have become too bloated.  This should be a 12hr game with weapon and armor discovery not crafting. And why is Odin a wannabe gangster?!"
z3pl2m,2022-11-24,2022-11-24,What aspect of the game did you feel fell short of your expectations?
z3pl2m,2022-11-24,2022-11-24,Did you like any of the first three (?) of those older games?
z3pl2m,2022-11-24,2022-11-24,"I'm 36 hours in and semi-enjoying it. I love the story and the acting but the gameplay, designs and animations are all so similar to 2018 that it has felt quite stale.

Why have I committed 36 hours you ask? Because I do love the world they've built and the story and that's the hook that has me. Enough that I feel compelled to explore everything before progressing the story. The gameplay has been good enough for me to stick to it but not good enough that I find it super enjoyable.

My two questions for you are:
1. Why did you get this game if you felt a similar way about the prequel?
2. What are some games that you have enjoyed? (I know it's unrelated but I'm curious and always open to trying new games)"
z3pl2m,2022-11-24,2022-11-24,"The original games were about 12 hours long, and that was about right for this type of gameplay. The last God of War was about twice as long, and really overstayed it‚Äôs welcome with me. I‚Äôm putting Ragnarok on the back burner for this reason."
z3pl2m,2022-11-24,2022-11-24,What one thing didn't work for you?

z3pl2m,2022-11-24,2022-11-24,how dare you?
z3pl2m,2022-11-24,2022-11-24,Did you like the GOW:R prequel?
z3pl2m,2022-11-24,2022-11-24,Is the fighting in that game more in depth than in the Witcher 3? In that game I find it boring that all the melee weapons share the same moveset. And that you only have one for the sword.
z3pl2m,2022-11-24,2022-11-25,"It's funny you can't actually make a post of whatever you dislike, you can only reply to others when they bring up a point for you to contend it. You probably watched the trailer, saw other people were liking the game and your NPC brain went ""wELl mE nO LiKe"". Safe to assume you've not only never played the game, but don't even play games and you're some bot attempting to sway the hivemind of people blindly loving the game. NPC vs NPC."

z3pl2m,2022-11-24,2023-02-09,In a era of remakes how would you feel about God of war 1-3 remade using the 2018 god of war engine. Iv always wanted God of war 2 remade ever since God of war 3 came out. I don't know why but God of war 2 was always a 0.5 better then God of war 3 lol something about it felt more personal and epic.
z3pl2m,2022-11-24,2023-03-16,"I am feeling a bit the same about this game, so my question to you is, what's rigatoni?"
z3pl2m,2022-11-24,2023-05-15,I think the same the gameplay was boring for 80% of the time the pacing was too slow and it's missing the cool finishers and gory mechanics idk it was too generic for me i had to quit it the story was mostly good though but norse stuff just isn't that cool to me man
z3pl2m,2022-11-24,2023-01-31,"Little late, but for me the story was ok. I do agree that the Kratos development change was slightly rushed, but it turned out well. Also like you said, Odin fight should've been more epic, like they should have him rip his cloak off and teleporting Kratos, Atreus and Freya to another realm would've been epic as hell to see. I just hope the next game, they could at least add more content and new mechanics to make it feel different from the last two games."
z3pl2m,2022-11-24,2023-02-05,Precisely
z3pl2m,2022-11-24,2022-11-24,The lack of interesting gameplay challenges was kind of insulting.
z3pl2m,2022-11-24,2022-11-24,Oh yes. All of them.
z3pl2m,2022-11-24,2022-11-24,"1. Because the level design looked better along with the more traversal gameplay. 

2. This year alone for example have been Elden Ring, Frogun and Lego Bricktales."
z3pl2m,2022-11-24,2022-11-24,I agree.
z3pl2m,2022-11-24,2022-11-24,Mostly gameplay but the story was also really safe instead of something risky which is what I prefer.

z3pl2m,2022-11-24,2022-11-24,Yep.

z3pl2m,2022-11-24,2023-02-02,"Plot wasn't awful, but execution was. I had fun playing it, but i don't see it as some masterpiece that people call it. Humour was overused and character development was predictable and cliche... it's not bad game, but it's far from good game.

Are the old ones mostly hack 'n slash? Are they... linear or level based?   
What about puzzles and backtracking?    
I'm not sure what to expect I guess."
z3pl2m,2022-11-24,2022-11-24,"1. Fair point

z3pl2m,2022-11-24,2022-11-24,Everything is better in the older games in my opinion but it's all hack n slash.

z3pl2m,2022-11-24,2022-11-24,If that makes you feel better. I may try it again sometime but it's not what I'm currently looking for in a game plus I'm not the biggest fan of roguelike games.
z3pl2m,2022-11-24,2022-11-24,Mainly the default enemy encounters that's scattered a lot throughout the game with some combat aspects didn't compliment each other well at all and some were health sponges simply which made the gameplay stale for me. Just overall a bland experience for me.
z3pl2m,2022-11-24,2022-11-24,"I wish you would elaborate more, like what is wrong with the encounters? What aspects of the combat didn‚Äôt compliment each other. And when were enemies health sponges? I personally didn‚Äôt encounter any unless they were berserkers or mini bosses that are few levels higher than me."
z3pl2m,2022-11-24,2022-11-24,"Sorry, I'm getting a lot of responses. 

Mainly the level design wasn't complimenting the enemies or enemies didn't compliment each other."
z3pl2m,2022-11-24,2022-11-24,"The only time where I do agree that the enemies don‚Äôt compliment each other is when there is a mini boss mixed in with a big encounter otherwise the encounters were properly designed and the AI is smart enough to always overwhelm you, as for the level design(I‚Äôm going to assume you are talking about the combat arenas) they are actually a massive improvement over the last game and it allows you to use the environments to your advantage and you can mix it in with some aerial attack."
z3pl2m,2022-11-24,2022-11-25,"Perhaps I should have done the side missions to obtain more gear but I didn't want to get constantly road blocked by tool restrictions and health sponges. 

Anyway the gameplay is just a minor concern. What I'm truly disappointed about is the cinematics and how interrupting they are with some segments lasting almost an hour. I don't care about a QTE bar brawl or slowly riding a bull through the woods. I wish it could be skipped."

pl6c0h,2021-09-09,2021-09-09,Kind of sounded like Richard Brake to me.
pl6c0h,2021-09-09,2021-09-09,"times are changing, you can only get so much better after diminishing returns.  


in the coming years styalization is going to be the next big thing."
pl6c0h,2021-09-09,2021-09-09,60fps bruh. Makes a world of difference.
pl6c0h,2021-09-09,2021-09-09,I thought so too
pl6c0h,2021-09-09,2021-09-09,Thought it was just me and not being able to identify all the new fandangled ray tracing and shit. I'm still on last gen and haven't pulled the trigger for a PS5 yet because I can't tell the difference.
pl6c0h,2021-09-09,2021-09-09,"I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs supposed to be available on the PS4 as well, and the previous one was already stretching the limits of the PS4."
pl6c0h,2021-09-09,2021-09-10,It's on PS4 and PS5.
pl6c0h,2021-09-09,2021-09-10,Surely ps4? How many people were actually able to buy a ps5 at this point? Not a lot I‚Äôd guess.
pl6c0h,2021-09-09,2021-09-10,"If you ask me, I'm glad there's ""only"" gonna be a 4 year wait for the sequel, kinda tired of some franchises taking 6+ years off in order to reinvent themselves when the base premise was already great."
pl6c0h,2021-09-09,2021-09-10,"It's not a trilogy. In the showcase they confirmed this game will be the finale of the Norse saga. Weird decision imo, seems this game is gonna have to be long af lmao"
pl6c0h,2021-09-09,2021-09-10,"But this makes sense, because ragnarok Is the theme of the game"
pl6c0h,2021-09-09,2021-09-09,I mean God of War is awesome at blending the cinematics into actual gameplay so it kind of is
pl6c0h,2021-09-09,2021-09-09,"When Sony releases it as a trailer, live in their showcase? Yeah, ill word it however they did. Tale it up with them, not me if this leaves you unsatisfied lol"
pl6c0h,2021-09-09,2021-09-10,"Gameplay is gameplay, mate. More than what we got from the Wolverine or Spider-man 2 trailers."
pl6c0h,2021-09-09,2021-09-10,"Did not know this existed, pretty cool."
pl6c0h,2021-09-09,2021-09-10,It'll be on PS4 as well!
pl6c0h,2021-09-09,2021-09-10,Good luck. Literally impossible.
pl6c0h,2021-09-09,2021-09-10,Just saw this video and told my wife I needed a ps5 finally
pl6c0h,2021-09-09,2021-09-09,Yeah i got that and appreciate it but the editing just feels really off to me. It almost feels like a first draft that was supposed to get shined up later
pl6c0h,2021-09-09,2021-09-09,its probably an early game scene
pl6c0h,2021-09-09,2021-09-10,I also thought that the 2018 game was ahead of it's peers by a longshot. I'm glad they didn't change much because the graphics were already great.
pl6c0h,2021-09-09,2021-09-10,"I disagree. We said the same thing 10 years ago, and boi have we been proven wrong time and time again. Only reason you think that way is because at the time you just don't know better.

&#x200B;

Stylization at this point have become a budgetary concern more than anything."
pl6c0h,2021-09-09,2021-09-10,"the original one is 60 FPS on the PS5.   


though it looks like ragnarok has bit better lighting and reflections."
pl6c0h,2021-09-09,2021-09-10,"ray-tracing you'll notice mostly in stuff like spider-man. it shows realistic reflections, all of the windows in that on skyscrapers reflect what's going on, even bouncing reflections between windows if 2 skyscrapers are next to each other.   Also look at showcase of RTX minecraft, that really shows off how it works and stuff."
pl6c0h,2021-09-09,2021-09-10,"I‚Äôm not sure why you‚Äôre being downvoted, availability is terrible right now in my country"
pl6c0h,2021-09-09,2021-09-10,Halo Infinite...
pl6c0h,2021-09-09,2021-09-10,"I certainly think there's some things they can improve on.

Namely, combat. Zoom the camera back so I can see who's sniping me in the back all the time. That's what I'd like to see.

But I agree I suppose, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. They don't need to reinvent the wheel when they just did with the 2018 version."
pl6c0h,2021-09-09,2021-09-10,"Still bracing myself for that unsatisfying cliff-hanger ending.

I've been here, before. I'll believe it's the end when I see it. But I wont hold-out on promises.

Especially when Sony is terrified of doing anything new or different."

pl6c0h,2021-09-09,2021-09-10,Haha another cliff-hanger ending for him to end up in Egypt.
pl6c0h,2021-09-09,2021-09-10,It‚Äôs really not impossible. You have to use trackers and follow drops but it‚Äôs completely doable.
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-30,"THATS WHAT I BEEN SAYING. the puzzles also suck total ass both in their design (99% of puzzles are throw axe at a spot or carry this rock over there) and how they can teach gameplay mechanics. 

In old god of wars there were puzzles mixed in with platforming to master movement of your character and timing/spacing of the environment. There were ple ty of co.bat focused puzzles to teach you different skills or magic spells, get you acquainted with high damage combos to kill these enemies within the time limit.

interesting dynamic puzzle design that serves as a hidden tutorial ks what's missing from the new games along with their other faults."
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-30,I don't think this is controversial. Different folks different strokes.
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2023-01-05,I hate this franchise. Highly overrated.
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-29,"I also found it boring, couldn't finish it. Only reason I even got it was because the only PS4 at the time available in Gamestop came with a copy of the game. It's not a game where I can't understand why people enjoyed it but it definitely just wasn't for me"
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-29,I thought the same thing at first. Ended up picking the game back up a few weeks later and I loved it.
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-29,"I like the game, but felt it had more backtracking than I enjoyed."
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-29,I think you went into a beat ‚Äòem up game and was upset it was a beat ‚Äòem up
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-29,I liked it.
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-29,"TL;DR 

It is a slow paced, narrative heavy game and I understand that may not appeal to everyone but I think it's far from boring. 

Personally I found RDR2 much more daunting. Again, not bad or boring, just a lot to take in story-wise when I'd rather be shooting things."
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-30,You played on an easy difficulty if you can just spam R1 and win. Is it any surprise that when you play on rartcunt settings it allows even the most rarted cunt to win?
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2023-02-25,"For most of the game, you just fight boring NPCs. It's only worth checking for those god battles, but there are just not enough of them"
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2023-03-29,I'm playing it and I keep getting baffled why it's got such high marks and ratings. It's so boring in many ways. I'm just playing it until it's finally over. Thor is so lame and kratos is a little bitch. Atreus is annoying. Mimir too.
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2023-04-24,"I just uninstalled it today  for the same reasons. Many months ago I gave it a try, combat was way off from the very beginning, spongy enemies killed the game for me. I got to this whole magic bridge, jumping between different worlds, I was completly burned out. It was the first time i met new types of enemies, but it was way too late. Never bothered to finish this game, it's awful design"
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-29,Agreed very much so. I think ragnarok is the same. It also lacks the context for the looting and exploring in the game like last of us
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-29,"Play give me god of war and you‚Äôll see that mastering combos will help.

I love games that open a combo system up to me but don‚Äôt expect me to use all of it. Kind of like kingdom hearts in a way. 

They have extensive combat to fill any playstyle in any situation. They give the option to block or parry. Not good at blocking, hold it down. It will defend you but you‚Äôll need to wait for an opening. But good at it? Block right when he attacks and counter and now it‚Äôs your turn. 

Want to retreat and still attack? You can do that. Want to keep your distance but still put damage in? You can throw the axe.

My issue with this analysis is that you sound as though you have no desire to self improve. Yes you don‚Äôt need to use all these advanced combos but if you go into a situation and just mash the attack button with no variety, you will get bored very fast. If you go in and don‚Äôt try to take in the lore, the story will bore you.

Doing these combos finishes fights faster and let‚Äôs you know how far you‚Äôve come. That self improvement I mentioned earlier. 

You feel a sense of pride knowing that you can enter a room full of different enemies and clear the area in no time flat taking no damage because you‚Äôve learned the mechanics to that degree. I‚Äôve done it on the hardest difficulty and new game plus and it was so hard yet so rewarding. Especially since I wore the full Zeus armor where you get killed in 1-2 hits. It‚Äôs a glass cannon build. To say I‚Äôve done that to other people that know how hard that is, is just nice to see."
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-29,Welcome to modern game design.
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-29,"I hate war, if that counts


But the game is pretty cool."
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-29,"Agreed, I also think the story is hot ass. It's just you going up a mountain, realizing you need an artifact to get rid of black fog, go down mountain, get artifact, go back up mountain, realize you're on the wrong mountain, go back down, open up a portal to correct mountain, BREAK THE PORTAL FOR NO FUCKING REASON TO SAID MOUNTAIN! Then try to find another way to the mountain. Also you fight the sane stupid fucking troll boss like 80 times. The plot is so fucking lazy and lame that I really can't understand why everyone loves the story to the game so much. With all that said though, I thought Ragnarok was actually pretty great."
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-29,Ragnarok is even worse.
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-29,"\> you can just hit R1 the entire game

\> skill upgrades are not necessary

\> damage sponge enemies on higher difficulties

\> bland combat

Bro your points here are so self-contradicting. For some reason you believe that R1 spam the whole game is viable. The game indirectly tells you NO by making enemies harder to kill so player would try something different. But your response to that is to complain that the difficulty is shit, lower it down, and proceed to keep R1 spam. Seriously? For small reference, you can literally ONE SHOT basic enemy on GMGOW by launching it then heavy axe throwing it into wall or tree. AeStHeTiCAlLY improve the system???

Honestly you have no one to blame but yourself and your high horse ego (soulsbourne fans again, not surprised) for ruining the game for you. There are thousands of youtube videos out there destroying hardest difficulty in case you might want to open your mind for a bit but I'm not expecting much."
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-29,Try putting the difficulty up past average. Then the combos will be necessary lol. Try at the game. That will make you enjoy it.
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-29,Sounds like you should rather play asgards wrath
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-30,Yeah it can be repetitive.
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-29,I was tired of GoW by the time the 2nd one came out on PS2! I really dislike hardmodes like that too. I'd rather have more and smarter enemies instead of bullet sponges.
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-29,"Most of your complaints are fixed by playing on the hardest difficulty. The idea is that you are given less wiggle room to mess up fights and need to maximize your character's loadout better. 

I like how you say Sekiro is your favorite game but having played that myself it suffers from the exact same problems you say the hardest difficulty of this game suffers from.

It honestly just sounds like a contrarian point of view."
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-29,Then don't play it.  It's not a controversial take.  Not everyone likes every single fucking game ever made.  God dammit.  Give yer balls a tug.
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-29,Didn't read but imo first half was pretty good but then it started to get boring.
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-29,You‚Äôre boring
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-30,"idk how far you get into the game, but saying the game is a R1 spam and skill + upgrades didn't matter *(after trying GMGOW)* tells me you didn't too far, R1 spam is literally only viable on lower difficulty, and skill + gear matters in GMGOW.

bullet sponge difficulty does sucks and i hate it with passion, especially on early game when you got nothing, but it gets easier as you unlock more stuff, but not so much that you can just blaze through the encounter. and honestly i enjoy GMGOW difficulty a lot, especially after you defeat the more difficult end game bosses.

and there's nothing controversial about not enjoying a game, even objectively good games, me (and tbh a lot of people) don't enjoy competitive FPS game, are those game objectively bad? not really."
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2023-04-22,"The worst part is that they killed literally everything about the existing God of War series in order to make it.  Like... why?  If you're going to change literally every mechanic in the game AND completely change the personality of the main character then could you please just make a new series instead, so that there's a chance that you can go back to making the kinds of games that fans already liked?"
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2023-05-05,"Yeah I tried to like it but everything seems to be predictable and boring.

I played in the maximum difficulty when I started and I thought to myself that with skill I can finish the game but damn, the difficulty in this game is done horribly wrong.  
I guess I'm partly to blame since I came from playing Souls game wherein skills matter rather than upgrades on your character, specifically Sekiro and Elden Ring.  


The challenge in this game is not something you would enjoy, fortunately I didn't have to pay to play this game.  


The only thing that carries the game are the story and Kratos, other than that its just mundane exploring."
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2023-04-22,"I don't even remember there really BEING puzzles in GoW 2018.  The ""puzzle"" chests were all just ""I spy"" or being fast at throwing your axe at stuff.

Also, I haven't finished the new one yet, but holy fucking shit do they need to tone down the NPC chatter.  We come into an area and before I can even finish my first glance at what's there, the NPCs are talking about how to ""solve"" whatever the mechanics are.  Like, if you're not going to let me *solve* the puzzle then don't even put it in the game.  The actual solving is the fun part, going through the motions of completing the mechanics is just the chore."
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2023-01-24,You mean different strokes for different folks?
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-29,"To be fair, God of War is known for flashy and crunchy combat. I was also underwhelmed when I started. Being stuck with the axe is not what fans wanted."
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-29,"From day one I wasn't a fan of RDR2. I've always found the gameplay boring and repetitive. It's filled with incredible levels of detail that for me, added absolutely nothing to the enjoyment of the game.I saw someone post a video of how realistically the npcs ate food and my thought was they should have taken that effort and put it towards  more diverse story missions. You'd have to be blind and insane to call it a bad game but it does have some serious issues."
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-29,"I feel the same with RDR2. I have *tried* many times to get through it, but I just find myself running around and doing random stuff rather than the story. Might be a controversial take, but I can't stand the combat in RDR2."
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2023-04-22,">I'm playing it and I keep getting baffled why it's got such high marks and ratings.

It's hard to say if it's because people have convinced themselves that the emperor is wearing clothes, or if they're too afraid to say that he's not."
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2023-05-17,"I‚Äôve started it a week ago, I‚Äôve completed the first three mainquests and I‚Äôm bored out of my mind"
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-30,"Self improvement is only a random want of the player in new god of war when it was a requirement in previous games. A good combat system in a game doesn't dump a bunch of bullshit at your feet and says do whatever I don't care. 

Humans easily fall into the route of least resistance if it's super easy to obtain and there's 0 reason for the alternative. 

It's why most people only use super shotgun with gause canon in doom 2016. There's little reason to use anything else. Then comes doom eternal and gives you plenty of dynamic reasons to use your entire arsenal."
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2023-02-25,It doesn't
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-30,The pacing of Atreus is also hilarious. When he learns he's a god he suddenly acts super cringe and edgy then is told to stop and he does just as soon as it starts. Best part is when he almost dies.
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-29,[removed]
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-29,"Take a couple deep breaths. My issue with the higher difficulty is that it almost forces people to go the R1 spam method.  Obviously I‚Äôm exaggerating a bit here, throwing in heavies and axe tosses is expected.  But the real creative shit you see people doing is not the most effective. And I dont think higher difficulty encourages people to be creative, I think it discourages creativity.  You are allowed to have your opinion, and you‚Äôre allowed to disagree with me, but if you‚Äôre getting this defensive cause I don‚Äôt like your game then maybe the ego issue is elsewhere."
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-29,I‚Äôll check it out thanks
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2023-01-25,You gotta stroke different folks
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2023-01-24,"yeah because you‚Äôre stuck with the axe the whole game‚Ä¶ yep, totally"
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-29,"You are the spokesman of ""fans""? Lmao. Both games are massiv hits."
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-30,"It's the shooting. Pull the trigger, shoot. Pull the trigger, cock weapon? Pull the trigger, both?

I've been playing this game for a week and I still don't know how how the shooting mechanic works.

I also accidentally killed someone I shouldn't bc I went to punch them and stabbed them in the neck. I've never even equipped the knife."
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2023-04-22,That emperor is lame too
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2023-05-18,Yh I haven't played it in weeks.
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-29,Except The Last of Us one sounds way betterüò≠ also I didn't even really take out context lol that is quite literally what the entire story is. Only thing I left out really is that the reason they wanna go to the mountain is to spread Fayes ashes. The Baldur parts are the only cool parts of the game.
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2023-01-25,Ayo?
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2023-05-26,"It's been 4 months but I'm commenting anyways.  How revolvers work is:

1. Single action
This is the first thing you must do, this rotates the cylinder to the next round, after which - pulling the trigger releases the hammer which also contains a firing pin, the hammer hits the back of the round, and the round is fired.  Everytime you want to fire, you must first cock the hammer.

2. Double action
In a double-action revolver, pulling the trigger generates two actions: First, the hammer is pulled back to the cocked position while the cylinder is being rotated to the next round, followed by the second action where the hammer is released, striking the firing pin. This allows for uncocked carry and draw-and-fire using only the trigger.

RDR2 features both of these types.
In my playthrough, I simply never bothered to do anything fancy, if I needed to shoot, I just clicked a bunch.  Played thru the game 3x like this, lol.  One of my favorite games of all time, but having gotten my playtime through, I can see why many people struggled with it.  It's a long haul, but for some, quite worth it.

I had one of my friends buy it on Steam and he quit 6 hours in, however to my happy surprise, I saw thru steam friends that he had picked it back up and beaten it a month later."
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-29,It really isn't. Yes that's the goal of the story but that's just a plot device to push the characters into their journey and tell the real story which is about the relationship between Kratos and Atreus and Atreus discovering who and what he really is along with Kratos' past. Getting his mother's ashes to the top of the mountain is not the main focal point.
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-29,"What are you saying dude. The whole reason they go on the adventure is to spread the ashes, THAT MAKES IT THE MAIN POINT! Also even if u don't think it's the main point you're seriously telling me that it's a good plot device? Cause it isn't, it's awful. The way the main story progresses is dog ass that is just used to pad time. Also Kratos and Atreus relationship doesn't even change in this game, in Ragnarok it does."
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-29,"It's about the journey, not the destination, as many, many stories are. Just because a character has a particular goal or destination in mind does not mean that is the main thing the writer wishes you to focus on. 

It's a very simple concept used in many great works. 

If you can't understand that I don't know what to tell hoh. 

I personally found the story very enjoyable, as did millions of others. If you don't that's fine but you're coming off incredibly toxic in how you are expressing it and I have no interest in continuing such an unproductive conversation."
zye5tn,2022-12-29,2022-12-29,"Lol not even toxic, the journey to get there is unbelievably boring because it's just you backtracking every where, it's honestly a very valid criticism. Especially when the enemies you fight are just a bunch of re skins. These are all glaring issues people have with the game lol"
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,The game is mostly linear. It does open up somewhat with side content and there are some great optional fights and quests but it‚Äôs not a true open world game. The combat gets way better though once you get more abilities and gear so if that‚Äôs your focus you won‚Äôt be disappointed on that front.
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,Did you play/enjoy the first?
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,"It‚Äôs not for everyone. Yes it gets better, but there‚Äôs still too much walking/talking/puzzles compared to combat"
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,"The game does open up, but you have to look for it too. If you follow atreus the whole time, it's linear, but every time he says to go one way, there is usually something pretty sweet the other direction"
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,"Hot take but I would say no it doesn‚Äôt get better. The linear puzzles are constant and the semi open world felt like it was used as a device to just incorporate more of them. Many of the side quests boil down to just completing more puzzles. You get more weapons and arrows to.. you guessed it, complete different puzzles. 

Basically if you‚Äôre tired of them now the game will be a drag."
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,I had the same issue with the 2018 one but then really enjoyed it as I progressed
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,"I as going to ask this as well, beat me to it, lol!!!"
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,Play GoW 2018 and then ragnarok! GoW 2018 was my first GOW game and I was stunned! Amazing combat and glorious storytelling! Love it!
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,"Are you a Fromsoft stan? Because if you are, you won't enjoy it."
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,I played it for 2 hours which 1.5 was me walking around watching a movie game is trash.!
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,Yea I made it about 12 hrs before it just became repetitive garbage that I kept falling asleep playing
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,"I wasn't a huge fan of the game either, but I don't buy the ""puzzle simulator"" argument as most of the puzzles you encounter are solved for you by your companions before you have time to realize you're even in a puzzle section."
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,The first GoW in this play style for this story first came out on the PS4. Just FYI. And it does get better for sure.
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,All Sony games are interacrive movies
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,"I played a god of war a long time ago, I think it was on PS2 or 3, been so long."
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,"Yeah, I was hoping for some solid exploration and combat. I'll keep trying but not sure I can get through it."
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,They seem to be the only ones with criticisms though. Like it's ok to like both GOW and Elden Ring guys.
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,"I am. Loved all the fromsoft games, haven't played demon souls or bloodborne yet, but now that's a possibility owning my first playstation since PS3. 

It kind of amazes me the debate for GOTY between Ragnarok and Elden ring. They're both completely different games. But in my head the entire time I'm just thinking... how did people think ragnarok was gonna get GOTY."
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,For sure
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,Seems like we've upset the god of war fanboys lol
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,"No, I mean the ps4 god of war. It‚Äôs a new story and it‚Äôs pretty imperative to play before Ragnarok."
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,"I think he means God of War which came out on ps4 in 2018.

You‚Äôre playing the sequel to that."
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,"If you keep playing you get opened up to several mini open worlds with tons of exploration. Plus you get bombarded with new weapons and combos to unlock so the combat definitely improved

That said, like another commenter stated, you should really play the first one if you want to better understand the story. It‚Äôs aged very well for being a few years old"
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,The race for GOTY is often between two incomparable games. That's why very little weight is actually given to the title.
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,I've played both and loved both. GOWR is superior as a complete game. It's really not even close.
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,Naa just got boring.
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,"What a pathetic excuse for being a dense moron. We aren‚Äôt fanboys, we just use common sense. Everyone in here is stating the obvious. If you didn‚Äôt play the first game (god of war 2018), then why the fuck are you playing Ragnarok? GoW is less about the gameplay and more about the incredible story. You are absolutely ruining the story by playing it out of order. Judging by your replies to others, you should probably just return the game cause you will never get into it with an attitude like yours."
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,"I played the first one and enjoyed it, played Ragnarok but something just isn‚Äôt there for me. I can‚Äôt even put my finger on it exactly but I didn‚Äôt finish the game and honestly don‚Äôt plan to atm."
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,"It'd make sense to play the old one for story reasons, but wouldn't change anything for gameplay."
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,How isn't elden ring complete?
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-24,"""Incredible story"" 

I am kratos I am angry I murder everything."
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,A story isn't all that useful if the path of discovering it is absolutely atrocious.
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,"Why so hostile over someone‚Äôs opinion though? As someone who played the first one, ragnarok to me was just overhyped. Boring, linear, but beautiful graphics. I don‚Äôt fault people for liking it, I can see why people love it, but if I don‚Äôt like it why does it bother you and others so much. You‚Äôre allowed to like or not like a game without being attacked by fans of the game. This is extremely toxic disgusting behavior in the gaming world but keep on. You got more rage than Kratos himself over someone‚Äôs simple opinion."
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,To each their own I guess. I loved it.
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,I think its because the main quests mixed with secondary ones is all over the place and it feels too bloated. The second playthrough is muuuuuch better if you know what to do and when to do it. Just my opinion tho
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,I loved it but the Atreus missions threw off the pacing. I can see why people have complaints.
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,The story is the most important part of the game lol
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,"I‚Äôll say this: I immensely enjoyed the first one, but can‚Äôt continue the second one for the reasons you listed. Regardless, it baffles me that you wouldn‚Äôt start at the previous game."
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,I never said it wasn't. It's just not as well done.
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,"Why come on r/gaming and bash a game you can‚Äôt get into? You don‚Äôt enjoy it, return it and be done with it. Stop complaining about shit you have complete control over."
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,Something just didn‚Äôt click for me this time around. Can‚Äôt even tell you why really. It‚Äôs like a bunch of little things added up and I didn‚Äôt care that much all of a sudden.
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,"Honestly not really, the gameplay is the most important part of the game by far."
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,Can't carry a game into being good with just a story.
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,Everything is done way better besides the story. Elden ring just doesn't hold peoples hand.
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,"While I agree with this, it goes both ways, if you like something stop making stupid posts about ""omg I love X game guyz"" or ""X game is great!"" over and over.

While OP comes off really dumb, there are people who have legitimate criticisms for games that the subreddits circlejerk eachother off for. 

Either both are allowed or none of it is."
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,His post didn‚Äôt bash it. He simply asked if it got better. Gaming Reddit is to discuss games and opinions not just say how much you love your favorite games
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,"When you watch a tv show, what do you pay attention to?"
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,If you usually play games that don‚Äôt focus on a story I can see how you‚Äôd feel that way lol
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,Gameplay is *always* KING
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,If you believe that then you should drop the game
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,Yeah. The graphics are better huh. The platforming is just so amazing in elden ring. That clunky combat is laughable. I still enjoyed the world and that's why I enjoyed it.
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,This guy gets it
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,"> A story isn't all that useful if the path of discovering it is absolutely atrocious.

This response suggests otherwise. So do all of his other replies that have been downvoted."
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,"That's a stupid question, God of War is a game, not a TV show. And if we're being honest, while the God of War games have good stories by video game standards, compared to movies, TV shows, and books, it has a mediocre at best story. The gameplay is what ultimately makes it worth playing, the story is just a bonus."
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,Goes for games in general. Progressing through a story isn't all that interested when the journey to get through it is boring.
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,"Elden ring looks way better. But maybe the comparison I'm seeing is from PC to PS5, but combat in elden ring isn't clunky. You might just suck."
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,I've really upset the GOW Fanboys. It just feels like a basic ass game. I feel like you have to be deeply involved into the GOW story to even enjoy it.
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,"I‚Äôm talking about his main post, but yes, no need to talk bad about it to people who like it."
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,"That‚Äôs your opinion, chief. And are we talking about all games still or are we back on God of War. Because ‚ÄúGameplay is more important than story in all games‚Äù is a different statement than just GoW."
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,Do you like reading?
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,Then dont be surprised of you dont end up liking it.
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,"Compared to GOW combat it is most certainly clunky. 

Also. Let's not start with insults. Makes you sound adolescent. It's ok for people to disagree with you."
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,I loved the first GoW and played it like 3 or 4 times thru. Ragnarok did not do enough for me. Couldn't make it thru.
11a0tre,2023-02-23,2023-02-23,"This post is about God of War is it not? Don't try to move the goalposts. Unless you're implying that your original comment was saying that story is more important than gameplay in all games, which is even dumber than what I thought you were saying. 

I think it's safe to say that gameplay is more important than story in 99% of games at least. Even heavily story driven games, the appeal comes from the fact that you are controlling the character, selecting dialogue choices, role playing, etc. Not only that, even the games with the best stories in gaming, don't even have that good of stories compared to books, movies, and TV shows. If you only care about story and not gameplay, then why even play games at all? You can find way better stories in other mediums"

yqrs1n,2022-11-09,2022-11-25,I'm literally on the last mission and the cutscene at the very end is muted. I can hear music and SFX but no dialogue. Frustration doesn't even describe how I'm feeling rn. I've gone the whole game and the climactic moment is ruined.
yqrs1n,2022-11-09,2022-11-15,Had an issue with cutscene dialogue AND subtitles being gone. I just manually saved and reloaded and it fixed it. Regular game dialogue has been fine but just FYI. I'm playing on ps5.
yqrs1n,2022-11-09,2022-11-15,"I have this on PS4. All audio worked fine until it just suddenly stopped During cutscenes. I'm probably about halfway through the game, to where a guy gets dragged into a cave and thats where it stopped for me. There is still audio just walking around and stuff, Which is stranger still. Don't know what to do to fix it. This sucks though. And as for Mono audio and voice boost, both were off. I can turn voice boost on but it will not let me turn on mono audio, it is a dark gray."
yqrs1n,2022-11-09,2022-11-10,Open PS5/PS4 settings. Go to sounds and set 7.1 to 2 Channel sound and it will be fixed.

yqrs1n,2022-11-09,2022-11-14,This is so lame.... Obviously the gameplay is fantastic but without the dialogue the story is kinda ruined. I'm with ya PS4 friend
yqrs1n,2022-11-09,2022-11-14,"I have this problem exept it's for certain sound effects. The sound of the mystic gates when you activate them, the mechanical noise of the svartalfheim trains and other ambient noises. It's annoying and i cant find a fix."

yqrs1n,2022-11-09,2022-11-20,Not sure if you are still having the same issue but for me it was changing my TVs audio format from Auto to Dolby. For some reason the PS was not being set to the correct audio stream using auto.

Edit: also switched the audio settings on my PS4 to bitstream Dolby but there was no change after doing this only after I turn down the volume on music and voice. Just putting in case both need to happen"

yqrs1n,2022-11-09,2022-11-12,Yeah it worked on my ps5
yqrs1n,2022-11-09,2022-11-26,This worked. I had the same issue where the dialogue sounded very faint and far away and I could barely hear it. Weird because I played through the main story with everything working just fine but after that I had this issue. This is great advice and worked instantly. I‚Äôm on ps5
yqrs1n,2022-11-09,2022-11-27,"This worked for me. Odd thing is that my audio worked fine until the post-game, I went in a specific room and everything got muffled with Kratos and Mimir, but this fixed my issue. I even was able to set it back to the original settings and it remained fixed after I followed the instructions. Thanks for the help"

yqrs1n,2022-11-09,2022-12-10,Switch your audio settings to bitstream DTS.  Lower in game audio (less than 9).  Poof.
yqrs1n,2022-11-09,2022-11-20,"My TV only has PCM and raw options, and I‚Äôve tried both, neither fixed it"

yqrs1n,2022-11-09,2022-11-24,this worked really well

yqrs1n,2022-11-09,2022-11-17,I haven't seen anything. I actually have it for the PS5 but just have been looking everywhere for anyone with similar problems. I know the last patch notes for both didn't mention any fixes for it.

12yljlj,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,"> You do more optional missions because you need gold to buy better equipment and more experience for your skills

There‚Äôs also the reasons of side quests expanding the world & characters which are also important for a story driven game.

> Kratos is fragile: 3 hits of any mob and you‚Äôre dead.

The thing about higher difficulties is that the enemies hit harder. You also have to strategize to prevent yourself being swarmed, using all your weapons, the various attacks with them, & using Atreus & Freya‚Äôs attacks as well. Every enemy also has attack patterns that can be predicted.

> Kratos is weak: you need to hit a mob a lot to kill it.

Again, higher difficulties mean tougher enemies. They will hit harder & will take more hits.

> Kratos doesn‚Äôt defend well: 3 hits on the wall-type shield and it will open your defense in the next attack.

So you were overreliant on your shield. Anyone who has played a Soulsborne game will tell you not to do that. Hell, anyone who has played Breath of the Wild will tell you not to do that! This also says that you never learned to parry.

A lot of this stuff is more of an issue with you than it is of the game."
12yljlj,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,">My point is that playing GoW on God of War difficulty is frustrating, irritating, boring, and feels unrewarding!

Then don't do it! Those difficulties are in there for people who want that optional experience, if you're not enjoying it or don't want to do it then just don't. 

Not every aspect of every game is going to be engaging or rewarding for you, nor is every difficulty level going to be balanced in the way you want it to be and that's fine."

I did 100% it on GMGOW difficulty and the only fight I got extremely frustrated on was the final Valkyrie fight that unlocks after defeating Odin, everything else was manageable if you use the right combos of gear/runics/abilities... and get really good at dodging... Most bosses telegraph every attack they have, some just don't give you much time after the telegraph heh

The part I 100% agree with is beating it on that difficulty isn't worth it. There's no trophy, no message, no acknowledgement that you put yourself thru it lol... that's where I think they dropped the ball."

complains that enemy are harder to kill

bro...."
12yljlj,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,Yeah I think higher difficulties in a lot of games just aren't balanced very well
12yljlj,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,"Honestly I think you may just need to practice, and or look up some build/ combat tutorials online. It seems most of the things you mention here aren‚Äôt actually issues the game has, seems like you might just be button mashing or not know how to utilize Kratos moveset. 

The thing about taking 3 hits on shield is technically correct for that one, but if you do the shield attack it resets it‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs the entire purpose of that shield‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ 

Kratos can dodge multiple attacks in a row, especially if you don‚Äôt roll but just dodge more than once. Also after being hit, it‚Äôs impossible to be stunlocked to death he is not ‚Äòdestabilized‚Äô you can also use rage to cancel any stunned animation or if an attack breaks your guard.

You certainly can destabilize enemies using the correct attacks, a single light attack won‚Äôt work in most cases tho in GMGOW. Spamming runic attacks won‚Äôt work in GMGOW because after 2 or so they get a temporary shield against being stunned by them, wait 5 seconds and do it again‚Ä¶

Boss fights are in mostly smallish spaces, but are still easily manageable. Group fights are usually in open areas with verticality and places to jump in and out of the action, way more room for fights than in 2018. 

Runic attacks will stagger most enemies, and there are perks that will raise your defense when using them specifically for the issue you mentioned, but if you can‚Äôt space to make sure you won‚Äôt get hit pick short but still damaging runic attacks, there‚Äôs a bunch. 

Red attacks are most definitely reactable, I think that is likely an issue with your reaction time.

I really don‚Äôt know what your talking about randomness and luck deciding if you win a fight, it‚Äôs quite literally about knowing an enemy‚Äôs moveset and watching for openings, or staggering them into oblivion when possible. As for Kratos being ‚Äòweak‚Äô that‚Äôs most definitely an issue with your build lol, you can destroy bosses with the right setup and being prepared for the fight. 

Having pre fight buffs would make no difference, it would just be an animation at the beginning of the fight lol, you don‚Äôt need buffs when your already strong and have defense lol. I wouldn‚Äôt want Kratos to have to use a million buffs like in Nioh anyways. The point is he‚Äôs already strong, and is in the game if you use his kit properly.

The games you mentioned don‚Äôt have buffs either‚Ä¶.. at least Odyssey, I‚Äôve never played BoTW. Both are completely different games and genres tho and aren‚Äôt really comparable, but GoW combat is much more in depth and better than both imo.  Also what you said you didn‚Äôt in AC Odyssey to a higher level boss would literally also work in Ragnorok‚Ä¶.. 

If your just using basic light attacks,your making the game harder for no reason."
12yljlj,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,"So basically the same problem the last game had, it just cranks up the health and damage numbers on the enemies but lacks any kind of tool to deal with this. So the game plays basically the same as on lower difficulties, but it just takes longer to kill anything.

It's boring and not a good way to design difficulties."

Yes, we already know damage slider and spongey enemies is bad difficulty design, but the reality is different devs have different way balancing the game and unfortunately gow is like this.

If playing gmgow takes out the fun from playing, please lower the difficulty, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that, play at the difficulty that is fun for you,

I play both game at gmgow, yes, it‚Äôs frustating and unrewarding (ingame), but it‚Äôs anything but a luck based, boring experience for me."

My largest complaint is the bloat of side content which as you said iirc that doesn‚Äôt overly reward you for your efforts much anyway because you still get 2 shot by most berserkers especially and that‚Äôs playing on the fucking lowest difficulty. There‚Äôs almost no balancing in these games and it‚Äôs frustrating as shit. I‚Äôm a god‚Ä¶I want to feel like a fucking god."

Your points are all valid, it sucks when you can't even get a weapon skill off. I already struggle with that on normal. But I think that if you play on hard, you gotta power through. There is no excuse if you voluntarily choose to be extreme. You always have the option of doing it on a lower setting to de-stress a bit, or you need to get your shit together and find a strategy, no matter how much cheese is involved.

 And on that note; they could‚Äôve double tapped to reset shield charge and make it work but as you said this is a player issue not fully grasping the situation and diverting the blame towards the game instead."

Just read the damn post"
12yljlj,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,"Not the responder, but I did and beat it in about 52 hours. Both GOW 2018 and Ragnarok on GMGOW, and I concur, it mostly sounds like an issue in your level. Not that I'm accusing you of anything, but learning the enemies pattern is integral in succeeding in the mode. Gmgow is a mode that tests all your limits, reaction times, strategies, skills, runic skills, and your partners Freya and Atreus. 

Throughout the game, admittedly, I got frustrated at certain parts, but that was mostly the Hell Walker (with the 2 axes, I hate that b) and the 3 boss fight in Alfheim. Most of the other things I handled pretty well, even the trials is Muspelheim. In fact, I used my build in 2018 and installed runic and cooldown which helps me immensely in becoming spammy against enemies. 

The King and Gna were up there with the hardest, but back in GOW 2018, I died 50 something times to Sigrun and eventually beat her after coming back. My tip is to play Kratos in GMGOW difficulty as the strategist he is. On GMGOW we know we're at a disadvantage, but to me, accomplishing and overcoming bosses and mods is the rewarding part, because we know we are supposed to struggle. I also didn't use that shield and focused solely on parrying which made most enemies manageable if not a joke at times. Perfect parrying to me has always been better than straight up blocking. Playing games like Ninja Gaiden, Sekiro, Wo Long, Nioh, Monster Hunter has given me insane reaction time. I say take time to play other extremely difficult games to build your reaction time.

But that's my two cents. Hope this helps in some case. :)"

You can't have both ways.  

But we are on point as you mentioned that you got frustrated with certain fights.  

Now, don't you agree that it would be a better experience if we had more usable skills?  

 \- Defensive like a protection against side attacks

 \- Long jumps to avoid swarms

 \- Passive auras

Those skills probably wouldn't be used in normal difficulty but could be nice at higher ones.  

Again, my problem is not how hard it is but how it harms the gameplay."

12yljlj,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,You sound pathetic. I never said I was as good as you. I never discussed my skill level at all. It sounds like you get your self-worth from your ability to play video games on hard difficulty. That's pathetic.

My skill should not be debatable since I stated that already beaten it up to 98% of what one can do in the game.

12yljlj,2023-04-25,2023-04-25,"If the difficulty level you're playing a game on is frustrating, boring, difficult, unrewarding, then you're playing on the wrong difficulty level for you. But you seem to feel required to play on the hardest difficulty because it makes you feel superior. That's the part I find pathetic. 

I don't care what difficulty I play on. I want to enjoy the game I'm playing.

If I was playing on a hard difficulty and the game was more frustrating than enjoyable, I would lower the difficulty. 

You seem to be unable to do that but instead complain about the game mechanics that you are frustrated by. 

When I say maybe you're not good enough for the highest difficulty, I don't mean to say that you're unable to beat it. I mean to say that you're unable to beat it without thinking it's frustrating and boring.

But if you enjoy being frustrated and bored, then by all means keep playing on the hardest difficulty."

I just couldn't get into the gameplay of Too Human; coming off of Devil May Cry and God of War, the right-stick melee combat was too different for me to get my head around. Conceptually, though, it sounded cool as hell."

11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-13,It's probably been said before but Egypt has an abundance of Gods to slaughter. Kratos deserves a nice tropical vacation away from the freezing norths.
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-13,"I have doubts if they can ever replace Kratos in this series, especially with someone like Atreus. 

The entire series IS Kratos."
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-13,"Imma be real with you guys, I thought Ragnarok was great but I also thought Ragnarok felt super rushed when it came to Norse gods. I understand they didn‚Äôt want to make another trilogy and stretch out the story past it‚Äôs means but they built up so many characters, especially on the Norse side, that ended up either not really doing much or just feeling underdeveloped by the end like Thrud and Sif just because they didn‚Äôt want to make a trilogy. Feels like the impact of these deaths and occurrences was lessened because they were just speedrunning both the setup of corruption outside of mimir‚Äôs stories in the first game AND the downfall that comes from it. Like we meet and we‚Äôre supposed to care about Thor‚Äôs family but by the end they‚Äôre kind of just relegated to a small support system for Atreus and will probably not come back the next game since they finished what they needed to with Norse myths. Also playing as Atreus kind of sucked ass after the third section. I play god of war for kratos, not some emotionally unstable furry smh"
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-13,How is Atreus supposed to tell himself how to solve a puzzle 0.5 seconds after he's seen it?
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-13,"If they were going to replace Kratos they would have manned up and killed him in Ragnarok instead of subverting the audience with it's sugar coated ending.  However, even killing him wouldn't have meant much since he could just wake up in various other religious afterlife's (or be reincarnated).  Its pretty obvious that they will never replace Kratos. 

Meanwhile, they are probably going to kill Freya at the onset of the next game. Kratos needs to be pissed about something..."
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-13,"I like how it ends, but I miss Atreus' commentary in post game. I feel like there's definately potential for Loki-based games, but also we have Kratos' next story. He is still a god of war, but now he's more like how they described Tyr: compassionate, merciful, looking for peace. I honestly thought thats where they were going, having Kratos take up a new god of war's mantle. That being said, he has a drive to rebuild in Midgard, and I think he will actually be a god to people instead of to himself. Odin asks if he even knows what its like to be worshipped and loved by mortals, and now he will. I think his story leads him to being a new god who rebuilt the world in the ashes of Ragnerok. I'd like to see that story. God of War has so much potential still, I hope this isnt the actual last."
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-14,"Next in line will be :

*God of Mischief : Loki*"
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-14,"Atreus will most likely end up in a new domain, piss off a couple of new gods and off to another adventure with kratos to kill some more gods. I doubt kratos would be put to the end for Atreus any time soon but both will be used for the story like Ragnarok, Mimir on the other hand has a deal he has to hold up so we'll see how long before he gots that job to do. 

Replacing kratos with Atreus if it ever came to that would be a make it or break it decision for GoW, they'd have to build him to be even greater and likable than kratos which would be the most difficult thing to do"
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-13,Doesn't look like an end to me.
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-13,[deleted]
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-13,"Never played a God of War game, but I really want to see him go after the christian god just to see the drama that would unfold."
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-13,I got the platinum and I must have missed where that was the end of him. Because it sure didn‚Äôt look like the end of Kratos for me based on those final scenes.
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-13,Nice drawing. I've never seen the allure of this series
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-15,Freya looks very young here
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-16,There definitely will be a game in a God of War universe about Atreus. But I don‚Äôt think they will name it God of War. And I am sure there will be more games about Kratos. People like money.
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-24,"This game‚Äôs story was such a pointless, conflict-lacking bore. Thor, Odin and all of Asgard were talked about as bloodthirsty psychos in ‚Äò18 and they were all just boring nothings in Ragnarok. It was such a lackluster experience, I still can‚Äôt even believe it."
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-13,"They had the Egyptian gods at the end of God of War 2018, on the mural at the end"
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-24,The entire game was just Kratos being a chill/non violent dad. At this point it‚Äôd make 0 sense to kill any gods.
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-13,"I simply would not play it if they didn‚Äôt have Kratos.

It‚Äôs like Halo without Masterchief or Super Mario without Mario."
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-13,My thought as well
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-13,"If they make an Atreus game they should call it ""God of Mischief"" as Atreus is Loki, the Norse God of mischief, that way Kratos will always be the protag of the God of War games."
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-15,It was rushed and it felt like they sort of tried to maximize their audience and be more child friendly by giving the story a more Disney cartoon tone and adding in a lot of hand holding
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-14,"I feel like Atreus will probably go missing in Egypt or something, and then Kratos will go out in search of him."
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-13,I know in 2018 GoW they mentioned Egypt and Japan
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-13,"If he goes after one God, he goes after him all. You‚Äôll know what that means, or you won‚Äôt."
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-13,In jotunheim? Thats pretty exciting. But I honestly don't see how they can top this norse gods arc.
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-13,They also had the Eye of Horus on the shrine that showed all of the different cultures‚Äô symbols of war
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-24,unless Atreus gets himself into trouble during his quest to find all the marbles.
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-13,Halo Reach was and is still fantastic. Same with Halo Wars.
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-13,"So, Kratos's creed?"
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-13,"I don't think it would *top* it, just be an additional campaign that's also good."
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-13,Yup. That's what I'm referring to :)
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-13,"I agree, Halo Reach was great, but it wasn't Halo 4, it was a separate off-shoot. 

They still kept Masterchief in Halo 4-6.

If they did a Son of War offshoot, sure, but as long as they dont retire Kratos."
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-14,"Halo reach was incredibly mediocre IMO but it wasn't because of the protagonist, it had to do with gameplay, visuals and voice acting.

At least the level design wasn't total dogshit like halo 4"
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-13,"Yea, except less cookie cutter hopefully."
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-13,Like DLC? Either way I expect a vocal minority to crap on it if it doesn't live up to their hype. If it adds to GoW: Ragnarok like the Witcher 3 DLCs did then I would be very pleased.
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-15,yeah but halo 4-6 sucks
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-13,"And less fetch quest and filler missions.

Assassins creed always looks so cool in the trailer but when I play it I‚Äôm just so bored by all the filler content. That game does not respect your time."
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-13,"No, I mean a sequel game using the next engine (I assume Unreal 5)

Living up to hype isn't the same as *topping it*

For example, Modern Warfare 2019 and Modern Warfare 2022 were really fun campaigns, they didn't *top* previous campaigns, they just were also good."
11q8sim,2023-03-13,2023-03-15,100% truth
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-11,Pleasantly surprised by the design choices so far.
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-11,Just glad they didn‚Äôt make him look like Thor does in movies and every other medium
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-12,THE book? There are so many books about Norse mythology.
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-11,"Also accurately depicting Thor. Red hair and big red beard and fat. Thor was a glutton and most commonly known for it, but being the most loved god next to baldur, everyone just accepted it."
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-12,Mj√∂lner / Mj√∂lnir\*
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-12,"I mean, he looks much more menacing than hollywood Thor.  
MCU Thor just looks like a pretty boy that decided to hit the gym a few times because he broke up with his girlfriend."
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-12,"More like they made the book design after GoW. 
The book came out in 2019 while in GoW post credit scene you can already see the hammer and that was in 2018"
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-12,"Why is nobody talking about how stupid his outfit is? Yes, it‚Äôs shocking that he‚Äôs fat instead of toned and muscular‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶but why is he not covering his nipples and huge gut? How is that keeping him warm or protecting him? Is that how the original mythology was or something?"
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-12,Let me make one thing clear I kinda am not a fan of Thor‚Äôs GoW R looks tbh never did but aye that‚Äôs me
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-11,[removed]
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-12,That‚Äôs a great book!
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-12,He's a God. What make you think he can't look however he wants to.
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-12,Close? They‚Äôre identical
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-13,"The book? What? That aside, first time seeing this, wasnt what I was expecting. But I dont hate it. My biggest problem is there I dont really get any intimidation from him at least with this picture. He looks‚Ä¶ too chill? Idk Baldur at least looked pretty deranged (odd interpretation as well but I loved it). Curious to see how he is displayed in the game"
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-12,I'm so happy someone else mentioned it.
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-12," Marvel Thor is essentially a different character altogether than the one from Norse myths, probably the least accurate version even. So all the complaints that this thor design doesnt fit into the image Marvel incepted into everyones heads is nonsense"
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-12,"People who want him to look like Chris Hemsworth are weird. Dude rapes, mutilates, probably eats newborns for fun. He's a hedonist. Maybe he's too full of himself to believe he NEEDS to be in shape, because any he's ever faced have been an easy time for him."
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-12,Y'all got it all wrong. He needs to look like a scrawny bug-eyed alien with advanced technology. Indeed...
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-12,Yes this way its distinct and has its own identity.
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-12,He can drink the whole ocean worth of mead if you tried‚Ä¶ no wonder he has a beer belly‚Ä¶
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-12,I don't get why he was so beloved. After reading some Norse mythology I think he was a dumb jerk.
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-12,He looks like a pirate and an angel had a baby
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-12,First part on point.
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-12,... or both are based on previous imagery.
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-12,Why does he need to be warm? He is a god
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-12,[deleted]
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-12,"So I would suspect it's a fashion statement from the devolopers. His clothes/Armor are very similar to Kratos from GoW 4 and Ragnarok trailer. Also Thor is The god known for his strength, if any of the Norwegian pantheon is going damn near naked into Fimbulwinter it's Thor and Skadi. Skadi is a completely different thing though."
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-12,"Shut up, he‚Äôs got the armbands, the belt and the hammer. That is Thor"
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2022-01-20,[deleted]
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-11,"Cause that‚Äôs how he was described in the real mythology

Edit well maybe not as fat but I think itd make since seeing how feasts and drinking was a big part of Norse culture"
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-11,"Cause Thor is depicted as a dude who loved killing, eating and drinking a lot also in the previous game mimir literally calls him a fat dobber so this depiction is perfect."
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-11,Considering thor once drank an ocean (or half of an ocean depending on the interpretation) it's safe to assume he's pretty fat.
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-11,You can‚Äôt steal the design when it‚Äôs the legit mythology lol
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-11,[deleted]
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-11,Have you seen a movie called Avengers: End Game?
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-12,This new look is so refreshingly intimidating.
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-12,"Bc you‚Äôre reading it without knowing the historical context. Thor was the people‚Äôs god Bc he cared about their plight and he had an occupation, he was a smith. And as far as him being a ‚Äúdumb jerk‚Äù he isn‚Äôt the god of thunder, he IS the thunder. He IS the storm. You can‚Äôt reason with a thunder storm, it‚Äôs part of its nature."
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-17,No that's literally the hammer design made by the artists of God of War (2018).
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-12,"From what I understand of this Thor from what we learned in the first game, he seems like the kind of guy who could not be bothered for any armor because he is convinced of his invincibility. The kind of guy who doesn‚Äôt even wear a shirt because he doesn‚Äôt want to share his ale with it. The kind of guy whose stare alone begs you to stare a second longer or become the new home for Mjolnir."
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2022-01-20,You did lol
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-11,In some myths he looks just like that
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-11,"I'm talking about the hammers likeness to the book cover, not anything else. The hammers design is not legit mythology as it just has a bunch of weird patterns on it that aren't actual runes or commonly found patterns within norse mythology."
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-11,"Do you also realise he is said to have resurrected his goat after eating it, wouldn't exactly be weird if he didn't gain that much weight (or any at all lol) if he can do that. At the end of the day I think it's kind of weird to just sort of throw one god under the proverbial bus when he's consistently being described as mighty and most powerful of the gods (especially odd when all the other gods in the game series pretty much have been depicted as being more impressive and dare I say, God like."
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-12,"Ah, that's a good explanation. I can also understand that people felt safe with him because he protected them from giants and other foes. But before reading the mythology, I always thought he was some kind of wise, but usually his solution for everything was ""smash hammer""."
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-11,I just looked old illustrations of him they they flucated between hefty and fairly muscular
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-11,Wiat so in endgame they actually made him look more accurate during the final fight?
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-11,"That's literally what the hammer looks like in mythology. Maybe the pommel is a bit more elongated but as far as the hammer head goes, it's spot-on."
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-12,Yeah wisdom is Odin and Freya‚Äôs department. There‚Äôs actually a story about how Odin (disguised as a boatman) was insulting and messing with Thor and wouldn‚Äôt let him cross the river. It started as a back and forth insult match and ended with Thor violently describing what how he will bash the boatman‚Äôs head in if he ever comes over.
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-12,"Yes, the basic shape does exist in a lot of depictions, but the handle and markings are just taken straight from the design on the book cover. But like I said, the book design might've been made by the same artist or maybe the design is some sort of open source asset that they were allowed to use without infringing on any copyright issues.
Also if you look at old rune stone etchings the majority of them don't have that design, so technically I guess you could say that design isn't necessarily historically accurate."
pmgee2,2021-09-11,2021-09-12,"Yeah I've heard about that story, unfortunately it wasn part in the book I read"

pm0jrg,2021-09-11,2021-09-11,I absolutely loved all of the god of wars. The gameplay definitely went from more of a devil may cry to an insane new tomb raider type feel to it. Was very happy with the series as a whole and enjoyed many hours of all of the titles even the one for PSP was good in my opinion even with its limitations. Couldn't help but laugh when I saw the posts about the new GoW and how the first thing I thought of was this depiction of him in Thor: Raganrok.
