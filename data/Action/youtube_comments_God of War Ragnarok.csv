Her selfishness and self centered attitude made her think her getting killed by Baldur would have fixed anything, when in reality, it would have made Baldur even worse and make him a full blown sociopath on a warpath. Plus Freya needed to understand and see that while she lost Baldur, she was given Kratos and Atreus as a new family who deeply cared for her. Im glad they made her come to this realization by the end of the game but it still irks me how the game tried to make it seem at first cause Baldur NEEDED to be put down, even Odin admitted that Baldurs mind was long gone

Im so happy GNA put her in her place.",0

So many of his abilities and skills are just gone. Half the game is just a walking simulator. Exploration is boring AF and no rewards to even give a shit about. Not sure when Jake says there's more gore when it feels like there's even fewer flesh enemies. Gow shoots and letters on PS3 was better than this. Jake must have been high doing this review, because there's core combat mechanics that are missing and I'm like half way through the game.

God of war 2018 and Ragnarok in the story rich category and they got that totally wrong. It really feels like two factions are at war and it's due to very basic political ideology, not to rich to me. Just when they were about to in my opinion open a story gold mine with the mask and the dimensional rip they could have done something great with that but no, atreus thew it away and closes the rip.

Slow climbing down from ledges. I like games like nioh and Bloodborne where there are enemies hiding around every corner and it is more about the combat.

wi63uvjs6Uc,@YuniorGamboa,2024-10-24T23:19:54Z,"The game tells a captivating story that, at times, may feel overly drawn out. It boasts breathtaking graphics and visceral animations. The combat feels better and faster than ever and engaging in combat with the spear provides a particularly gratifying experience, and the addition of free Valhalla DLC enhances the game's value. Players can also look forward to an array of enjoyable side quests and puzzles with great mini-bosses throughout its semi-open world.

On the downside, the game has some notable drawbacks:
- The inclusion of numerous Atreus missions can feel overwhelming and repetitive.
- The pacing of the story may seem oddly sluggish during certain segments, impacting the overall flow.
- Minor glitches within the game can detract from the immersive experience and when trying to quit the game, it would be stuck on the home menu saying it's already running. The only fix to this is restating the pc. It's annoying so day the leas. A few crashes here and there too
- It's worth noting that the companion often provides solutions to puzzles, potentially diminishing the challenge for players.
-Fighting that Gna Valkyrie was tough as a nail. DAMN
 - VALHALLA DLC KEPT CRASHING Constantly!!

Another is to throw the axe at the enemy's head, making them turn around and show their backs to you, them keep holding R1 to attack it multiple times with ice spikes",0

R7rJ16ePOJs,@Matoakas,2025-02-14T09:56:09Z,"One OP thing against multiple weaker enemies is the Light Ranged attack with the Blades (AIM/L2 + R1 on PS5). 

When you draw an enemy closer and into the ground so it goes airborne, 
you can slam that enemy into the enemies that get close (in front of you), and 'block' them from reaching you. 

They stagger when hit by the enemy you threw? sent? shot? the blade at. 
It's almost to easy at times if you do this. Especially if you combine it with Aim + R2 (heavy ranged attack with blades). 

Another thing that should be repeated for anyone that overlooked it:  
The Wretch nests are PERFECT for grinding Skill Labors, and the Wretch labor ofc. 
     They keep coming until you destroy the nest, so you can take a minute or ten whenever you are at a nest, 

and you'll have the skill perks in no time at all! 

I'm also sure ppl know to not waste resurrection stones, or go out of your way to find health.
If low on health and no health is near to pick up, just die. You reload with FULL HEALTH.  
 
Ofc, not in the arena, or if you are SO CLOSE to beat a boos, or if you are doing a NO DIE run. Then use the stone. 
But when FREE ROAMING.. Just die..",0

Por lo que se dijo en el juego anterior se sabe que los dioses vanir experimentaron con la magia temporal, la cual afect√≥ directamente al Sol y la Luna, lo cual deja en claro una relaci√≥n entre el flujo temporal y la salida del sol y la luna, adem√°s tambi√©n tenemos el ejemplo de Od√≠n liberando a los lobos para que persigan al sol y la luna y as√≠ controlar los tiempos para el Ragnarok.
Teniendo esto en cuenta yo pienso que el eclipse que se ve puede ser el propio inicio de Ragnarok y el plan maestro de Atreus ser√≠a encontrar a los lobos para que vuelvan a perseguir el sol y la Luna pero en vez de hacerlo de Este hacia el Oeste, podr√≠a invertirlo de esta manera alterar√≠a el flujo temporal provocando una vuelta al pasado y dando pie a que el kratos y Atreus fueron los que tocaron el cuerno de la serpiente el GOW (2018) probablemente Atreus quiera cambiar algo del pasado con la ayuda del Jormungandr de hace 3 a√±os para cambiar el Ragnarok, podr√≠a ser bastante interesante explorar esa posibilidad.
Por cierto si alguno le interesa estoy subiendo el GOW (2018) en mi canal en preparaci√≥n al pr√≥ximo GOW Ragnarok que se se viene dentro de poco, se agradecer√≠a el apoyo.",10

It's the fact that it's God of War and this part felt like nothing more than a shoved in checklist and chore. It dragged on for about 2 and a half hours. Filled with berry picking, flower picking, skipping stones, and being lectured by a woman about how Atreus needs to learn to fight with his emotions......it's a section forced into the game to make a woman seem superior to a male and she has to teach him everything and boss him around. It's disgusting. Again, for you brain rot idiots. I don't care that there are female characters. I loved Aloy in horizon, and I'm not going to waste my time listing the rest that I like just because idiots want to be intellectually dishonest and act like I hate women for no reason. It's how it's implemented into this game that I have an issue with. And what a surprise to learn that Sweet Baby Inc were involved with this game. That only further verifies why I felt the way I did.

honestly i came in expecting the same thing as the first ps4 version and i wasnt going to be disappointed if it was and this game surprised me in a very good way. it was a top tier game that had a lot of daunting fights that really made me feel like god of war jajaja cx 

anyways, yeah dude the fights were so satisfying and i loved the part where thor killed me and brought me back to life and then threw me and got down with me in mid air. yeah i had more than one time that feeling like ""holy shit how am i going to do this?"" and winning the fight was an absolute win. btw i played the whole game first time on give me god of war so yeah but at least this time i didnt just go straight for the main story like the last god of war.",0

Pacing was awful, combat is decent but its weighed down by pretty bad encounter design, enemy variety only marginally better than the first game, wildly inconsistent tone compared to the first game and the story in general was just so meandering and dull, even Ragnarok itself was uninteresting to play through.

Valhalla had none of those problems though and is actually 10/10.",5

8FrGMC82Odk,@jasonlock884,2025-02-25T16:23:58Z,"This scene is more than it lets on in my opinion. Those who played the original God Of War games saw this man filled with nothing but rage and vengeance. Ready to kill at a moments notice and willing to kill anyone (innocent or not) who got in his way. A man who spoke with venom in his voice. We saw a man achieve his goal and end up as miserable as he was when he started. Then in God Of War 2018, we saw a man who was recovering from his past deeds. A man trying to ensure that his son did not follow in his footsteps. A man trying to come to terms with what he has done. We see more of that in God Of War Ragnorok. But when it came to God Of War Valhalla, this is where we see his redemption arc come full circle. We see him enduring his past dealings and reliving them. Being reminded of the way he destroyed everything in a selfish endeavor. But when we reach this scene, things change. We see him finally confront the one he hated more than anything else in the world. The man he used to be. But rather than refilling with anger, he finally comes to an unexpected conclusion. He was much more than a destroyer. Much more than a stone cold killer. He has always been more. And he has now realized that he can forgive the man he used to be. It‚Äôs honestly so hard hitting. And you really don‚Äôt expect it to be.",5

The games ""pacing"" is in line with 2018 in fact its better since there are no dull moments in Ragnarok. Its fine. The combat is better because it's fine tuned and they removed the socket system which is what most people dislike about the 2018. Ragnorok has far more epic story beats and a way better ending.

_Pc8pOUbgSk,@bass-tones,2025-01-21T15:09:11Z,"To a degree I don't blame people, but far too many have rose-tinted glasses when it comes to GoW 2018. Now don't get me wrong; it's a masterpiece, and an amazing game, especially in the context in which it released in. But people also overlook its flaws. 2018 also has massive pacing issues. You can practically feel the time and budget running out right in front of you as you play the final third of the game.

I also respect that 2018 is telling a simple, intimate story. But to me it's hard to not see behind the curtain and understand that was likely done _both_ as a scope and budget limitation and as a story device. The world feels so, so small in 2018. It literally feels like you, the dwarves, Freya, and Baldur, are the the only people who live in the entire game universe.

Ragnarok has a few pacing issues of its own, but it improves so massively on the obvious flaws of 2018 that it's hard for me not to see it as just the superior game. The story is brilliant as well. It's just as intimate and thorughtful as 2018, but with even more layers and character dynamics, and has in my opinion one of the best-realized twists in all of media that also boosts the game's replayability.",0

And even worse, you have to keep progressing the story to revisit it several times, which wouldn't be so bad if they just put the Mystic Gates in plain sight - you miss one and even with a strategy guide it's impossible not to get lost.  It feels like the scope of the rest of the game was cut back, because a ton of resources were put here and I think they should have pulled it back about 30%.  Never make a map like that again.",0

_Pc8pOUbgSk,@dante93nero,2024-12-08T20:13:01Z,"I think God of War Ragnarok will always suffer from the fact it was the sequel to God of War 2018. For me personnally the story in Ragnarok is better since it's developing more plot points and you can see multiple characters change & adapt (Thor is a big example). 

I do feel Atreus side of the game will always bring the game down even though (except Ironwood which did felt slow) most of the quests were useful to understand Odin/Thor's motives & reasons for why they are who they are.

The shield mechanics to me are a clear upgrade from the first game since it adds another layer of depth to the combat.

I also agree that I was expecting the final battle to be a bit longer and, again, I do feel that Santa Monica screwed themselves here because of how massive the world is. I don't quite remember the realm, but there is a random favor that literally takes you to an entire new zone that has like 10-15 hours of gameplay put into it it's crazy.

Story? Great at most and good at least, Even with the weird pacing and the really low development for Kratos himself in favor of Atreus as you said, It was still great
Game play and combat? Also great! Most of the main story bosses and mini bosses in areas are well-designed and fun.
The one thing I can think of at the moment is that some of the berserker fights are very braindead and extremely badly designed. Like the one with the three sisters.
And some combat mechanics are really.. uhh. NIche, Not really needed and doesn't add anything of value, (**IMO**)

When GOW3 released i saw it everywhere on social media, and in Newsletters. Every Shop where you can bought Technical stuff also had the Game somewhere, so i decided to buy it for 90 ‚Ç¨ and i didn't wanted to be disapointed. I played it on my PS4 but after i met Tyr in his Prison i stopped playing and deleted it. In Summer of 2023 tho, i bought a PS 5 just for the upcoming Spiderman Game. So i thougt, why don't give GOWR a final chance. Long story short, i grinded for the Platinum. The story, the graphic, the Mindset of Kratos and the Bosses were just Chefs Kiss! I grinded the Platinum and let it rest, then again... I remembered this Year in August that i didn't bought the PS 5 Version for this Game and i put another 10 ‚Ç¨ in the Game for the PS 5 Edition, just to Platinum it all over again and Grinded the Valhalla DLC.

Gow 4 kratos was the right direction in how much he developed as a person after the end of gow 3. They shouldn't have changed it!

_Pc8pOUbgSk,@zaster154,2024-11-20T14:42:23Z,"I don‚Äôt usually comment on videos, but this one‚Äôs an exception since you‚Äôre a smaller creator, and I think feedback could be helpful. Hope you don‚Äôt take this the wrong way because I actually found the video really fun to watch and want to encourage you to keep making more content like this!

That said, I have a few thoughts:

First off, you talk about the game like you‚Äôre trying not to spoil it for the viewers‚Äîsaying things like, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt give too much away‚Äù‚Äîbut the video is essentially a retrospective packed with spoilers. This makes no sense.

Some of your critiques were solid, but others left me scratching my head:
- UI: I didn‚Äôt like the UI either, but mainly because it feels like a design we‚Äôve seen in tons of other games. Meanwhile, you criticize the information the UI provides, but then go on to praise the UI in GOW 2018‚Äîwhich delivers the exact same information?

- Shields: I‚Äôm confused about your dislike for the shields in GOW:R. They add variety and improve the gameplay loop compared to the first game. Plus, you can still use the same shield mechanics from the first game if you prefer. Simply saying the shields in the first game were better doesn‚Äôt really explain your point, especially when the sequel offers more depth.

I also feel like you could‚Äôve gone deeper with your story critique. Sure, the game has pacing issues‚Äîthat‚Äôs fair and widely acknowledged‚Äîbut what about the actual story? Were there storybeats you didn‚Äôt like besides seperating Kratos and Atreus? What about Freya's reconsiliation with Kratos? The death of Brok and that story with Sindri? Did the story feel overly complex/bloated compared to the first game? And how about the side quests‚Äîdid they feel like an improvement over GOW 2018?

By the end of the video, I was left wondering about your thoughts on all these aspects. Instead you kept in line with the same tired critique of Atreus sections being long... Anyway, just some constructive feedback to think about. Looking forward to seeing more from you!",1

_Pc8pOUbgSk,@danielpratt3794,2024-11-17T12:56:42Z,"Spoilers




I do think the pacing was my biggest issue, like we spent 2 hrs with angraboda and her issues with her grand mum but like 30 minutes with thor who's one of the most important characters in the story. 

A more personal issue i have is Atreus? Like I feel like his depiction in this second games makes perfect sense where he's older more impulsive and wants to make his own decisions which he does and has a whole section grieving on his mistakes which then a third game he would have his Return of the jedi moments of showing his growth.

But then it just kind of rushes to him being a developed adult and hero whose learned from his mistakes and single handedly saves the day and then ends on him standing on a cliff ready for his adventure to save the giants and I just didn't feel convinced?
But hey that's my opinion many felt it was earned and I definitely wouldn't want to doom the developers into another 5 years of game development when they truly felt they could do it in one. So in the end I'm satisfied with what we got",0

I feel like I wouldn't be able to appreciate the legendary moments without those slower ones. I felt the game was dragging only a few times, and that was just before an epic battle, or an emotional moment in the game, so it kind of sets you up for a great time. And for the gameplay/graphics itself, SO COOL. I did feel a bit overwhelmed at times, as for a regular gamer, to beat the game at give me no mercy difficulty, I had to learn/unlock a few attacks/movements, which was another challenge in itself as there are so many!",1

T77URCcV1SA,@E45F678,2024-08-24T13:54:59Z,"Hey everyone, I thought I'd share something cool. I had a few ideas about where the next GoW game could go, so I made a summary up for ChatGPT and it turned out the following:
**Setting:** The bustling streets of Cairo, Egypt, are awash with the golden hues of dusk. Ancient structures blend with the vibrant life of the city, creating a fascinating juxtaposition of old and new. Kratos, Mimir, and Freya, having traversed realms and braved countless dangers, finally arrive at a hidden oasis outside the city where Atreus has been residing.

---

**Kratos**: *(Eyes scanning the surroundings with a mix of curiosity and relief)* ""We've reached the place. Is this truly where Atreus chose to be?""

**Freya**: *(Nodding as she takes in the exotic landscape)* ""It appears so. I never thought I'd see him in such a far-off land.""

**Mimir**: *(His eyes brightening with anticipation)* ""Ah, the lad's grown fond of the Egyptian lands, it seems. I wonder what stories he‚Äôs gathered here.""

**Atreus**: *(Emerging from behind a large stone column, his face lighting up upon seeing his father)* ""Father! Freya! Mimir! You're here!"" *(He rushes forward, embracing Kratos tightly. Freya and Mimir follow, sharing heartfelt greetings)*

**Kratos**: *(Returning the hug with a rare softness)* ""Atreus... you look well. I see you've made a home here.""

**Atreus**: *(Stepping back with a grin)* ""Yes, and I've learned so much. Let me show you what I've discovered."" *(He leads them to a small, shaded area where a collection of mystical artifacts and scrolls is laid out)*

**Freya**: *(Examining the items with keen interest)* ""What is all this?""

**Atreus**: *(Holding up a shimmering, translucent orb)* ""These are the soul marbles of the Jotnar giants. With the help of Anubis, I've learned how to manipulate soul magic. It‚Äôs through these marbles that I‚Äôve found a way to restore Brok's missing soul pieces to the Lake of Souls in Alfheim.""

**Mimir**: *(Impressed and curious)* ""By the Nine Realms, lad, that‚Äôs incredible! Anubis, you say? Quite a potent ally.""

**Kratos**: *(Eyes narrowing slightly)* ""Restoring Brok's soul... you truly believe it can be done?""

**Atreus**: *(Nodding earnestly)* ""Yes. I‚Äôve studied the rituals and magic closely. It‚Äôs a complicated process, but I believe it‚Äôs possible. However, we'll need Sindri‚Äôs help to complete it.""

**Freya**: *(Frowning slightly)* ""Sindri... after everything that happened, do you think he‚Äôll agree to help us?""

**Atreus**: *(Sighing)* ""It won‚Äôt be easy. He‚Äôs still hurting from Brok‚Äôs death and the fallout from Odin‚Äôs attack. But I think it‚Äôs worth trying. We owe it to Brok and to ourselves to make things right.""

**Kratos**: *(Nods thoughtfully)* ""Then we must find him. If there‚Äôs a chance to set things right, we will take it.""

**Mimir**: *(Cheerfully)* ""Aye, let‚Äôs not waste any more time. We have a long journey ahead, but if anyone can convince Sindri to help, it‚Äôs you, lad.""

**Freya**: *(Smiling gently at Atreus)* ""We‚Äôre with you, Atreus. Together, we‚Äôll do what we can.""

**Atreus**: *(Grateful, he begins packing up the soul marbles and other artifacts)* ""Thank you all. I knew we could make this work if we stuck together.""

---

**Scene transitions:** The group sets off in search of Sindri. Their shared resolve and newfound hope create a sense of unity and purpose, promising a chance at redemption and the restoration of lost souls.",0

To say I wasn't disappointed would be an understatement--I LOVED watching this series! Following his path to vengeance against Zeus and all the pain that he went through was beyond satisfying, which is something I love about these games. They care about their story, their fans, and make sure that older and newer fans are well-rewarded. GoW 4 was amazing to see, especially because I relate to a lot of the concepts explored in that in my own life--starting a new journey, losing what family I used to have, and creating a new life for myself all while meeting new people and finding a new family. It's powerfully-written and brought me to tears many times. Ragnarok was incredible as well--aside from a lot of the Atreus/Loki levels--and wrapped everything up amazingly. I can't wait to see what's next, and maybe I'll even play it this time.",0

It simply returns to him when thrown, if it's lying on the ground, he would have to go GET it, because he didn't throw it there.  Having it hold someone against a wall or something... that's not how it works.  The levitating hammer thing is an artifact of the MCU (as is the sound the hammer makes in the game).",0

-The Queen Valkyrie uses the word ""patriarchy"" in her dialogue.
-Freya defeats Kratos in a fight and saves him multiple times, including during a key boss battle.
-Thor is portrayed as an overweight drunk with father issues, and Odin as a corrupt capitalist.
-The game features a mission involving a race-swapped character and a diverse cast, which the writer notes.
-There is less brutality, violence, and gore compared to previous games.
-Kratos shows vulnerability, is apologetic, and is less proactive, mainly reacting to events.
-The game includes a climate change-related side quest.
-Freya is portrayed as strong, and Kratos‚Äô wife is described as being dominant in their relationship.

It has several moments of greatness with plenty of wow factor but the looming shadow of unskippable horridly written story beats are too hard to ignore. They are very much speed bumps in a runway for this game and prevented it from taking off in my opinion. From B storylines with Atreus that don't fit the M rated nature of God of War games to all the backseating chatter that you can't turn off from companion characters, to miscast performances from Odin and Heimdall(Both of them felt like gas store clerks rather than gods), The rushed battle of Ragnarok, The abrupt death of Thor, To Sindri being written as a contemptable a** to his friends after his brother dies, to being sucked into the mask ""mystery box"" trope with no resolution or explanation of that mystery(basically a carrot on a stick), to a bait and switch regarding Tyr who was talked about so much in the previous game but ended up being a no show in a game that should have explored his character and involved him more. (Maybe that is why we got the free DLC because of this reason. Fans were not happy about a false Tyr.)

This game had lots of issues and feels like another ""Ascension"" game fiasco. This one should have gone through a better quality assurance team before being released. Because the gameplay, set pieces, art, sound and combat mechanics have all improved. The boss battles are very memorable and fun. The side quests were a little more fun and interesting. A little more exploration and beserker challenges were top notch.

But the issues I brought up drug it down and this game ended up being about average. In fact, I'm really not interested in any future GoW games if this is the kind of thing we will be getting. This game should have been a shoe-in for Game of the Year but lost to a FromSoft game that is notorius for ""item storytelling"" which is the worst and laziest kind of story telling. It was a hell of a game from an exploration/graphic/fight mechanic stand point but shouldn't have won GotY over GoWR. 

But it did because of all the terrible flaws in Kratos' latest outing. Even the original creator of God of War didn't like this game. Focus groups and market research needs to be taken more seriously down there in southern cali.",7

The emotional significance and heritage connection that moment carries and the emotions you feel as a player in this grand finale of Kratos after all these years and after the Blades half way into 2018, to be on the last 3rd of this game and aquire the weapon and really on item Kratos owns that signifies who he truly is when you strip his tired life away.......a born warrior. A Spartan. A man loyal in life and death to those in his charge, and the 3 way weapon swapping and range option it tosses into the combat at that stage is remarkable. I dont use hyperbole in life or get caught up in nostalgia. In my honest opinion in terms of playing a video game, the Draupnir Spear is on completely even footing with Levathian and the blades. And that's something not spoken about enough. Most melee action games have 10 weapons etc. Santa Monica has successfully created 3 ICONIC weapons that when you see and play with you only think Kratos. A 3rd weapon could have been so phoned it. A Thors hammer type of debacle. Instead they did something far better.",0

Pacing alone is a big problem. If your game is about storytelling, the pace at which it delivers is preety important and Ragnarok suffers greatly in this.

QdqMpAV1A1s,@NutsorSomethingBerserk,2023-01-06T22:51:15Z,"SPOILERS:



God of War 4 was about Kratos learning how to be a good father.

God of War Ragnarok was about Kratos learning how to be a good man.

At first, I wasn‚Äôt as connected to God of War 4 as everyone else was whenever it was released. I played it to completion and even beat the Valkyrie Queen and many of the side activities. I had fun and liked the story but for some reason it didn‚Äôt connect with me yet like it did for everyone else at it‚Äôs release. 

Now having completed Ragnarok and am working on 100% it, I finally understand. I look back now at God of War 4 with nothing but admiration and playing this title has made me wanna go back and re-experience it with my new found perspective on this duology. 

These 2 titles but Ragnarok in particular are absolute masterpieces. Previous to this game, I was a very casual GOW fan. I played the OG trilogy and 4 but none of them stood as all time favorites in my head. I loved them all for different reasons though. However, Ragnarok did something incredibly special. The God of War trilogy was about a man pushed to his breaking point and beyond being used as a tool, a pawn, and whenever he out lived his usefulness the gods threw him in the trash. That very man sought revenge and got it. Didn‚Äôt matter what collateral damage was in his way. As long as those who wronged him were punished by his hands. Once it was all said and done, he destroyed everything around him. He became a utter monster. God of War 4 began this journey of towards trying to move beyond his past. Live the normal life he never got to lead back in Greece and just find peace. It started his path of redemption and Ragnarok completed it for Kratos. 

The theme of both of these games are ‚ÄúBeing Better‚Äù and with God of War 4, I loved what they did with the plot and the characters there but they only felt like it was halfway there to me, not the whole picture. Kratos became a good father to Atreus but he still felt like he was missing the push to be a good man. He‚Äôd help with freeing the Valkyries and a handul of other things but it was always either out of reluctance or because Atreus would steer the ship. He hadn‚Äôt yet completed his own personal journey towards redemption.

In Ragnarok however, Kratos is by the end of the game, a much better man. Hell, even a hero to the norse world. And he acts as such too. Not just for Atreus. For himself. And for those around him. For Freya, Mimir, etc. He‚Äôs doing what he does to help others because HE wants to. And the moment whenever he saw Faye‚Äôs final mural and cried, I also started sobbing. 

The character development they‚Äôve put Kratos through, someone who was downright monstrous and destroyed the entire greek pantheon just for revenge, innocents be damned, to a man who saved as many people as he could throughout Ragnarok, helped his son find himself, made several friends and companions and helped them on their own personal journeys, saved the realms, and after his mission with Ragnarok was accomplished, he continues to pursue making the norse world a better place and repairing the damage that Odin left in his wake.

Kratos from beginning to end went from a sympathetic but cold hearted man driven by his pursuit of revenge to a genuine hero. And when Kratos realized that‚Äôs what Faye wanted and/or saw him as, it showed him and us that he always had it in him to BE a hero. 

Sorry if I‚Äôm reiterating a lot of things, I just needed to get this off my chest as I just completed this game hours ago.

Ragnarok single handedly made God of War one of my favorite gaming franchises and not only did this game live up to my every expectation, it surpassed all of them. In gameplay, level design, and ESPECIALLY narrative. My only disappointment with this title is that I can no longer play it for the first time ever again.

What a game. What a journey. Kratos was already awesome. But his journey with Atreus has solidified him in my eyes as one of the best protagonists in gaming. Next to characters like Arthur Morgan.",7

Much of it is very familiar, but unlike its predecessor the story seems dragged out and meanders for a large part. And most of the puzzles are ruined by solutions being told to you before you've had a chance to work it out for yourself.

What I don't think he realizes is that to some people, showing some of the most beautiful cutscenes of the game, and footage from various boss fights are, in fact, spoilers.  Don't get me wrong, there was a ton he didn't get into that he could have, but if you make a video this long, and go into as much vivid and well described detail as Skillup does, odds are you're going to be seeing something really cool the game has to offer for the SECOND time on your first playthrough of the game....because you already saw it here first.

The poorly designed bosses, the overuse of pretty textures and pretentious graphical environments, the shallowness of a combat system that is unable to free itself of unnecessary rpg elements, a narrative that forces Atreus to rebel against his father as a teenager and an unfortunate addition of a talking squirrel (though omg so cute!!!) makes it inferior to the first game, and I ask myself the question as to why the first one, a masterpiece, needed a sequel lol :p",3

IsmTHnCbTuk,@theblackknight101,2025-02-20T20:02:48Z,"I wish the writers actually see this only to learn where they made mistakes and improve upon them for their next entry.. hopefully.

EDIT: Dialogues with quips have no excuse after it has been criticised to death in every place it is used.. so unfortunately lazy.

Also, didnt mention the fight with the bifrost sorcerer berserker in the other frozen world (niflheim?).. that fight was so much more toxic than it needed to be that I quit the game.. didnt even fight the berserker king. 

The ""double-blue-circle"" shield-bash/parry indicators were also something I was not a fan of.. most parries stopped feeling rewarding because the game kept telling me most attacks couldn't be parried at all. 

Then the repeat boss fights with ""The Hateful"" were the worst ever.. again because most normal mechanics for other similar sized enemies refused to work for these.. its attacks just phased through all player attacks/defences (infinite poise, seems like) and stun locked Kratos while also burning etc.. overall pain unless over levelled, at which point why bother for just another blade upgrade?

Also, please stop complaining so much about haters.. I truly believe they are in the minority and most people are here to listen, to give your point of view a fair shot, and even critiques can have disagreements/discussions, but constant whining about these negative comments is not fun to listen to when I'm here for long-form content about a game. If its such a problem, address it in a separate video/community post please. STOP MAKING YOUR ACTUAL CONTENT OBJECTIVELY WORSE TO LISTEN TO. I dont mind minor updates about your life or anything positive you have to share, but whining/negativity about non-review related stuff needs to stay separate.",0
IsmTHnCbTuk,@lukathefae3904,2025-02-20T03:31:38Z,"I agree with the pacing issues and some of the other points made about exploration, but the point about prophecy and fate being things that can be broken are found in the first game. 
One of the main ones being Magni and Modi in the prophecy of Ragnar√∂k are supposed to survive, but you kill both of them before the Fimbulvetr in Midgard even starts. 
Then after coming back from the realm of the giants Mimir says that by killing Baulder, Kratos has caused Fimbulvetr to come 100 winters too early.
Even if they aren't very obvious both of these events are Kratos braking prophecy/fate. Especially the Magni and Modi bit the only thing those two are known for is surviving Ragnar√∂k so I think it's obvious that from the start fate being broken was going to be a part of the story in one way or another.",0
IsmTHnCbTuk,@darkphoenix2,2025-02-19T05:06:34Z,"I finally put this game down after a couple months and a few final days bashing my head against the wall in Valhalla, trying to unlock the Rond of Obliteration. Dumbest challenge I've ever attempted in a game. Mastery difficulty feels straight up broken, like the enemy animations are lying to you about when to dodge or parry.

Oh, yeah, anyway...I hated the story. 2018 was pretty good, even if it was a big chain of McGuffin chases needed to propel the characters to the next emotional beat. But this game was a mess in so many ways. I honestly don't think I could retell it with any detail. I'd just have to summarize it as ""Atreus keeps doing stuff and Kratos is along for the ride until he kills Thor and Odin to save everybody"". The big shocking moment with Odin being Tyr all along made no damn sense. I don't understand the point of Atreus' soul marbles and him saying goodbye to Kratos by running off the screen at the end. So many emotional moments feel forced now, with characters constantly sharing each others wisdom as if it's a contest to see who is the most mentally stable. The modern, human way these gods and goddesses are portrayed doesn't really work for me, like Freya talking about how much Odin being an abusive husband affected her. It just doesn't land when she's literally one of the most powerful beings in that world.

I dunno, I could go on and on. The writing just wasn't that good.",1

Ragnar√∂k did feel like a rushed story with not enough substance, though (like the final two seasons of GoT). I feel like, had it been a proper trilogy, a second game could have been titled Fimbulwinter and Freya could have been the big boss and then teaming up in part 3 to unite the realms against Asgard.

I also remember naturally wanting to complete all the side content in GoW and actually wanting to 100% complete the game because of how good the side content and exploration was.

In Ragnarok, I actually liked the Alfheim desert because it was the first bit of side content exploration I did. But once I got to Vanaheim, I skipped through most of it and never came back. Same with Midgard. Everything felt so much more tedious.

Kratos is no longer a protagonist but a guy who reacts to things happening around him. Freya changes on a dime & Domms the player rest of the game bc she is 'powerful & merciful'. Artreyus throws fits, goes to the enemy and gets his way in the end. 

A violent real world lessons scene like Omni man & Mark Greyson would have been BAD ASS. Maybe Artreyus eviscerates a boss more than Modi to save Kratos. Instead of nameless creatures. Kratos comforts him and leads him to pursue peace. But thats against the message. People who yell and whine get their way is what we're shown. Odin's behavior was phoned in and made no sense

It's pathetic to the legacy of our characters but who knows if it can even be fixed. It's being pushed on us as a religion.  Enjoy the 45minute Yak ride & Mary jane scene

If this game had been about Fimbulwinter with Freya and potentially Thor acting as primary antagonists while fleshing out the pantheon of gods, and subtly building to certain threads hinted at in 2018, ending at the point where Brok dies, and Freya is made a reluctant ally, it would have been ace.

The idea that hope and love have the power to save lives and even worlds, to change destiny, that is a powerful idea! Kratos had to learn to be a god, but learning to be a good father, role figure, husband, partner, friend... This was his true journey... And he has overcome everything and has become worthy in every way possible. He did many unspeakable and evil deeds but he learned that change is possible, that change is good. He forgave himself, he fought and became the best he could ever be. The best father, the best friend, the best god he could be. That, I think, is a very good message to every of us. That we can always change our ways, that we can always be better, for us, for our children. I somehow connect this story with Sarah Connor's ""No Fate"" in The Terminator...

IsmTHnCbTuk,@davidmichael9275,2024-11-14T07:36:23Z,"Its one thing for this game to be garbage. I think we all knew once Sony moved its HQ to california their quality would go down and politics would be inserted. A disappointing game was a safe bet. 
What is inexcusable is this game shitting all over 2018. 
What do i mean?
The central theme of Ragnarok is the idea that you're not beholden to prophecy. You can break prophecy. 
Angrboda is told she'll never be more than a character in Lokis's story, and she fights against that. 
Kratos knows he's supposed to die and fights against that. 
Loki knows he's supposed to team up with Odin and fights against that. (Kinda)
The problem is, this idea completely fucks 2018. 
If prophecy means nothing,  then Faye making the murals depicting everything that happened in 2018 means nothing. 
The only reason Atreus is Loki is because of the giants' prophecy but apparently that means nothing. 
Ragnarok IS A PROPHECY. If prophecy doesn't matter, then why have a ragnarok at all?
If you can just CHOOSE not to follow prophecy, then why does Atreus have to be Loki at all?
Was 2018 a prophecy or was Faue just a good guesser?
The game wants to have it both ways. 
The characters absolutely HAVE to do certain things because thats what the proohecy says, but at multiple points they decide ""nah, prophecy doesn't matter, well just be better"" and completely shit on the idea of prohecy. 
The mural at the end of 2018 is what made that game so special. We learned that everything we had done was all foretold, and the story had been decided for us long ago. It was an amazing moment. 
Then we see that Kratos dies. This has weight because everything else that the giants predicted came true, so we had to assume that this would too. 
Then Ragnarok decides nah, its all just choice. The murals, the stories, and the legends were all just lucky guesses. 
Ugh.",1

Pros: 
‚Ä¢ Felt like there's much more to explore and collect.
‚Ä¢ A lot of stuff happening in terms of the story, even though sometimes it felt a bit too rushed. DLC story was kinda nice as well.
‚Ä¢ Nice to play with different companions.
‚Ä¢ A lot of new and old, likeable characters.
‚Ä¢ Nice addition to rage choices.
‚Ä¢ Spear?

Cons:
‚Ä¢ Really dumbed down combat and its difficulty even on the Give me God of War.
‚Ä¢ Atreus arcs and especially the 3 hours of bs in the woods with Angrboda (ü§Æ).
‚Ä¢ Super lazy DLC design. Like who wants to play the same level over and over again? I'd rather do the Muspelheim trials than that shit.
‚Ä¢ So many cool options in DLC armor selection, but the main game armor sets were kinda mid.

Este momento profundiza en la idea de que √©l no es definido por sus decisiones pasadas, sino por su presente y por lo que puede hacer con ello. Aunque sigue buscando una redenci√≥n que tal vez nunca encuentre, ha comprendido que a√∫n tiene esperanza. √âl menciona que hay esperanza y el puede ser la esperanza.

- The mural show Kratos is Farbauti and the Norns also call him Cruel Striker which tranates to Farbauti.

4ZN6_YNpzmo,@medalgear654,2024-09-20T02:52:33Z,"the game is awful. The story feels like a bad CW drama, with Atreus being an annoying, self-righteous brat. His decisions feel like they‚Äôre there just to stir up cheap drama. And the dialogue? Straight-up MCU cringe, constantly undercutting the serious tone. Even Kratos is out of character‚Äîhe spends the whole game avoiding war when we know the real Kratos would be preparing for it.

The worst part is they tried so hard to add ‚Äúdepth,‚Äù but the series already had depth! It didn‚Äôt need all this forced emotional drama. They basically rewrote history, acting like the older games were just mindless violence when they were already complex. And Odin and Thor? Built up as these terrifying forces in the 2018 game, but in Ragnarok, they‚Äôre reduced to a mob boss and a drunken brute with daddy issues. It‚Äôs such a jarring shift that it makes their buildup feel wasted. The story drags on with unnecessary subplots and cringe-worthy moments, and the characters suffer because of it.

On top of that, the game constantly takes control away from you with long, unskippable cutscenes where you can only walk around. And Atreus‚Äô levels? Total pacing killers. You can‚Äôt even properly properly explore until you beat the final boss. Ragnarok just feels too restricted, too cinematic, and it misses the mark with its messy story and watered-down characters.

It‚Äôs not a boring game, the soundtrack was fantastic but compared to the classics and even God of War 4, it‚Äôs a huge step back.",1

4ZN6_YNpzmo,@steverainingagain7956,2024-01-15T08:59:29Z,"I'm surprised at the Kratos being nerfed narrative. I think the only thing I found underpowered was  Spartan Rage, and I only really used it to get health. However you have 3 different weapons for the majority of the game, each with 2 seperate runic attacks. If you play it correctly you pretty much have runic attacks available at all times. Thats not to mention Atreus runic (I use the wolves) and your relic (Bifrost one is really good). 

Having finished the game my only regret was that I did it on No Mercy instead of GOW difficulty. Would have stretched the game time and made the big fights feel more significant. Other than a handful of Berserkers and the trials of Musphelheim (these were probably hardest part of the game), I got through most fights with ease thanks to the high availability of runic attacks. Even Odin and Thor only took me like 2/3 tries",0

4ZN6_YNpzmo,@curiousconsultant7922,2024-01-04T15:22:30Z,"[Spoiler] The ragnarok invasion was the only let down for me. We had spent 2 games with Mimir drilling our ears about the end of times, the war to end all wars, and they foreshadowed how Kratos would have to pick up his general's banner in the end but did so little with it.

I would have had Kratos take charge of the Raganrok army at the start of the final act and then have the player do the tour of the relms to rally everyone and then have a huge war room meeting planning the assault  only for the final mission to play out kindof like medeval strategy warfare but without actual troops management on the player's part.
Maybe even have Kratos not be on the front line right away but instead you play as Atreus carrying out the general's orders along with everyone else. Only for Ktratos to jump in as the much needed reinforcment showing Odin ""the god he once was"".

So utimatly the ending was rushed a litttle after having such a slow pace. Another option would've been to have this game be called something else and end with a failed invasion where Surtr doesn't show up. And then have a third game that's all about the Ragnarok war which could be a long term battle split accross the realms (kinda like Mass Effect 3)",2

8T7KljHutCU,@BahamutBreaker,2022-11-30T13:30:06Z,"Very solid guide! I remember your Forbidden West videos ‚Äî which were truly outstanding. Glad to see you have some solid content for other fun games, too! I think the best piece of advice I can offer here (to players) is to try getting accustomed to BOTH the Dauntless Shield and the Stonewall Shield. They behavior of the two shields (and the play-styles they mesh with) are very different. Being able to competently switch (in the character subscreen) between the shields, depending on the type of enemy you‚Äôre fighting, is a BIG advantage for the player, in my opinion.
Later in the game, some enemies have very annoying attack combos that feature repeated ‚Äúyellow-ring‚Äù attacks ‚Äî each with *different* delay times between the yellow-ring and the actual execution of the attack. The Stonewall Shield is great in those situations, providing forgiveness if you mistime a Parry. However, in other situations, where the enemy‚Äôs yellow-ring attack timing is more predictable and manageable, the Dauntless Shield is way better.",8

8T7KljHutCU,@grimm6jack,2022-11-21T00:03:05Z,"Really nice walkthrough once again. You really are an inteligent gamer, for the newbies and less experienced players, this really is the best early game build.

For the people who are veterans at GoW 2018 and mastered the parry and dodge and also the timing of your attacks, forget about any other stat but strength, especially if you play in Give Me God of War difficulty. Yeah, you will die a lot to get used to the new enemies attacks, but once you have them figured out, it will feel extremely satisfying to beat them fast while not receiving any damage. That's the way to beat enemies actually, focus on not getting damage while also focusing on maximizing your attack power to kill enemies faster, since the faster you kill the enemies, the probability of you making a mistake over time is also less. If the builds give you the nice perks like Realm Shifts, extra strenght while in a XX% HP state, or something else, that's a bonus.
As usual, high risk, high reward.

The game itself in the shops allows you to select which builds are more focused on each stat, a really nice touch and QoL improvement that makes it so much easier to choose your build according to your playstyle.

I'm currently end-game right now, but compared to how Horizon did its sequel in terms of gameplay mechanics, which IMO were very good overall, GoW was just a step ahead, while not having nearly as much ""clutter"" as Horizon had in terms of outfits and weapons.",21

With the gauntlets and waist, inflicted stun damage basically never goes down! Combined with the chest armor's perk to regain health on every stun grab, this makes for an excellent tank build!
Add enchantments that increase your stun and melee damage at high health, along with runic attacks that deal lots of stun and pommels that take advantage of stun, and you get a seriously OP build!",15

Otherwise, you'd only press X for menus and interactions. The X button becomes a much better choice for dodging because we are more accustomed to pressing that button for important reasons and not just for interactions. I swapped X and circle early on my playthrough, but I soon swapped back. I realized that even though I am used to using the circle button to dodge in most games, I would find myself bashing the X button in dire circumstances over the circle button to survive. X felt better when I needed my character to do something while squeezing my controller in certain death.",1

UBkF5AHTArM,@Vitalserum,2022-12-19T13:05:24Z,"My key learning: understand power levels and health bar colors. The single most important factor that defines how much damage you do (and take) is your power level. It's not your skills, your stats or any other character tweaks. The game doesn't tell you that it grants huge attack & defence buffs if you are at a higher level than your enemy (green health bar).  Likewise, it'll give you a huge debuff if you're fighting a higher-ranked enemy (orange, purple or red health bars). Yellow means the same gear level, these enemies are usually quite easy as well. So much so that it actually doesn't really matter what kind of build you have, what matters most is that your equipped gear is leveled up. It's a bit of a workaround by the Game to manage difficulty progression, but also cheapens the whole character progression imho.",1

I2zGOmc0H5w,@pincushiontimmy,2025-01-11T19:18:41Z,"I believe that there will be 2 games.

Sindri will accept that Brok doesn't have an afterlife because of his actions, not Atreus's.

The second game will be Kratos going back to Greece. ""bUt I wAnT tO sEe KrAtOs KiLl AnOtHeR pAnThEoN!"" Well, guess what? Kratos is the God of Hope, now. Kratos will most likely return to Greece to help his own people rebuild.",1

He was only there for one game. He does not own any creative reigns on Kratos or his story.

Genuinely hate that people still refer to him as the ""original creator of God of War"" when it was a massive team effort to get the original game up and running, and he quit SMS shortly after GoW was released.

1VLBODeIHwo,@chaseowens9627,2025-02-26T09:48:47Z,I somewhat get what he means but at the same time he said it very negatively. He wants his character to be a specific way because that‚Äôs how he intended the character to be. It‚Äôs understandable to be annoyed that your work is being altered into something you didn‚Äôt want. But at the same time his reasoning makes no sense as he seems to completely and utterly forget that God of War had family as one of the major core aspects of the franchise in a LOT of ways. Kratos killed his wife and daughter after being tricked which literally led to EVERYTHING happening. Kratos spend almost his whole life up to that point thinking his mother and brother were dead and that he had no father. He later finds out that Zeus the one and only true target for Kratos aside from Aries is his father which adds another level of complexity. Hell Kratos even struggles to let Pandora into the flame because he begins to view her similarly to his own daughter that he misses. The dude used his dead wife‚Äôs bracelet as a form of coping through illusion based torture and ground his mind back in reality. He gave up ALL of his godhood and even his actual life to be in the fields (afterlife) with his daughter before having to leave her there so he can stop all of creation from being destroyed killing everything and everyone permanently. Lratos saved his brother after spending years thinking he was dead just to watch him ACTUALLY be murdered right in front of him furthering his rage for the gods. Literally over and over and over the plot and story is driven further by family and family relations. Even other gods get involved due to Kratos killing their family members for getting in his way.,0

1VLBODeIHwo,@daleodorito,2025-02-25T08:56:07Z,"The thing is... I agree. Kratos is not that. Sure, his drive motive was always family, but the whole point is that all that was so tainted by hate, rage and anger by his sadness and guilt that he lost himself, it is, quite literally too late to go back. He does not deserve redemption, not a new family.

Besides, that makes no fucking sense narrative wise. Like how did we go from the end of 3 to the norse saga? That's still fucking unexpplained. You CANNOT do that when you care this much about story and characters arc, you cannot have a massive gap on the arc and never touch it just cause it's convinient.

Current Kratos is a good character. And the dark past the characters needs to work does fit with old Kratos. But they are not the same character at all.

1VLBODeIHwo,@ethanbezzina1887,2025-02-20T04:02:09Z,"In my opinion, changing a character after a long period of time is fine (and even good in many cases) as long as the change makes sense for the character. It‚Äôs similar to how a lot of comic book movie adaptations take creative liberties and alter the source material to better serve the movie. The changes that work still serve the story without completely destroying the character or disrespecting the source material if it deviates wildly (changing Namor‚Äôs origins, making Wong a partner to Doctor Strange rather than a butler, making the Mandarin an actor originally) while bad changes will just straight up ruin a character for no good reason or to be edgy (Batman using guns, Taskmaster having no independent thought and just being a weapon, Deadpool having his mouth sewn shut).

For Kratos, this is a change that made sense and felt like natural character progression. Indiana Jones (in the final 2 movies) didn‚Äôt feel that way. They just felt like the character randomly changed for reasons that didn‚Äôt really feel natural for the character or franchise.",0
