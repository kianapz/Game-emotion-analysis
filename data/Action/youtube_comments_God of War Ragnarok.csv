Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,"this is amazing, as an full time dad, 2 full time jobs and every other responsibly i have, i just don't have time to play. i'm grateful for channels like this, thanks alot."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,the craziest line ive ever heard was when kratos said death can have me when it has earned me hes truly a god
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,a path. one i had never imagined  to finnaly know what it feels like to be loved again. to not looked at with fear and horror. but with respect and trust. we are not here for revenge. but justice. this game is one of the most beautiful stories ever written. kratos is the greatest story in gaming.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-23,i love the way kratos treats the blades. at 115428 he just discards them on the floor. really shows how he wishes they could go away forever.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,"13718 atreus impersenating his father is hilarious, and kratos admitting faye is better at fishing than him is just wholesome family moment."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-02,"that one scene where he was trying his best to hold out his tears and surprise when he saw the prophecy where he was worshipped not as a monster but finally as a hero was so heartwarming. after all he went through from all the hate, rage and death he went through he finally found something to protect, to be proud of, something he won't have shame hiding anymore. soon he won't be known as kratos the god of war, god killer, a monster but kratos the savior of the nine realms, the hero who ended odin's madness, the persecutor who delivered justice."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,"132952 after watching this entire masterpiece, i can say my favourite scene is this. kratos fidgeting with his axe, trying to find the strength to say sorry to his own son. the way they made him move in that moment, the way he lowers his head until atreus speaks, just like someone that doesn't want to be hated for the mistakes he committed."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-01,this was a fantastic watch. better than anything ive seen on netflix recently. thanks for the playthrough
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,it's amazing how most of us started playing gow when we were angsty and rebellious adolescents and now we're all grownup with kids of our own. it really feels like we grew up with kratos and the lessons he's learned have resonated deeply with us. from an angry and vengeful demigod to a redeemed father who's only concern is the safety of his son and people he loves. this was the most well written and cinematic masterpiece of a story and game. i'm looking forward to the next installment of this wonderful story.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,"3358 to those who wonder why kratos said no like that, back in greece he was a general. and he thought like a general. that resulted in him making a deal with a god that costed his soul, as kratos said in god of war 4, it was done out of desperation not to die by the barbarians ares! destroy my enemies, and my life is yours!. and thus he got the blades of chaos. he was doing the bidding of ares for some time until he and his army raided a village, kratos got in the temple, killing everyone, and accidentally killing his first family. his skin is as white as it is because the village oracle after seeing what went down cursed him to wear the ashes of his family forever. that gave him ptsd until god of war 3's end where the power of hope made him forgive himself."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-14,the development of kratos throughout all the games is so well done. what a great series of games!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-12,this is where i come when i get stuck
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,"what i love about this is how atreus does and say things what kratos used to said now, which does put a smile on kratos face."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-17,180606 seeing kratos nearly cry because he saw people praising him hit me hard
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-05,"for the very few who have watched this whole video as i have, congrats. youve spent 18 hours in the presence of a cinematic masterpiece."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-02,this game i cant stand too many puzzles i shouldnt have to watch this video in order to play the game  i missed all the health boosts
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-15,our actions have consequences. to be reminded of them is not punishment now this was something life changing.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,"3358 you can see mimir realizing what atreus is about to say to kratos and knowing that he is not gonna like it one bit, such a cool detail"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,atreus i'm sorry do not be sorry father.. be better he student become teacher that fucking smile of kratos after that.... i love it
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-17,thanks!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,just finished this now. what a masterpiece! loved everything about this game. 165824 this was probably my favourite part the horn alongside with the soundtrack it's just phenomenal.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,"74830 it is difficult to seek forgiveness when you feel unworthy man the writers are fking geniuses. i love how the god of war series matures with its original fans. pure brutal action during the early days, but now a journey of a grown man interacting with such relatable quotes throughout the entire gameplay. this is definitely one of the games one must play during their lifetime."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,i just finished the game took me around 20 hours with only the main story skipping the side quests. this game is a masterpiece as a long time gow fan im truly satisfied and blessed by this game. its both a cinematic and playing brilliance. some scenes almost had me drop some tears. especially when kratos asked his son what should i call you? and when sindri gives a tirade to atreus.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-17,one more vid till i go to bed
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,"154124 the way kratos said son got me in tears, kratos has become such a caring father."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,115408 i love that he threw away the blades like they were a curse and did the opposite with the axe
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-21,just finished it. kratos's speech before going to war and that scene where kratos says ''loki goes but atreus...atreus stays'' really made me cry. best gow game ever!!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-23,12656 i love how as soon as brok opened the door music started playing  this dude has his own uncle ruckus theme
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-13,"18 hour long gamegasm. i am so proud of people making this game and keeping it as awesome as others. especial thanks to our friend, who made this video, so we may enjoy it with all our heart."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-13,can we all agree that brok is such a legend and have the best humor in the whole story and made us happy and sad and laugh all at once r.i.p brok
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-16,"man, can i just say thank you for uploading this entire video. i have spent the last three days just wathcing this and holy shit, just to see how much kratos has grown from the beginning of this game is so inspiring. the journey of the broken man into a strong father and leader was so emotional and powerful. i will contine with my life and promise to be better. cheers to the developers and all those that share in the battle to keep to that promise!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-15,my favourite game of all time.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-02,"love how they capture realistic human emotions and the relationship between father and sontrials , tribulations, frustration anger, forgiveness and love. and you may be a god of war..but you still have human emotions..."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,"after 2 days whatching this master piece i can finally read the comments ... what a journey man, i'm speechless!!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-14,"this game had it all. development for every character. kratos, atreus, freya, sindri, even brok had an arc. the twist with odin being tyr was so well done. they really exceeded our expectations huh."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-03,153203 i expect you to bite my blue buttcheek i love brok
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-20,"when kratos wanted brok to bless the spear, i teared upkratos character development is amazing. props to the devs"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,"132730, for me, this is the greatest father and son moment in gaming history, ever. nothing can be better than this. kratos was driven by vengeance and revenge in the past, but to see him being emotional, understanding, and atreus being understanding and teaching his father, the god of war, to be better. the first time seeing kratos smile, for some reason, it had me in tears. the amount of sorrow, destruction, suffering, being banished in to the depth of hell, killing all the gods, never having true peace, to see him smile, i don't know about anyone else, but it made me cry. i loved the person kratos have become, till the very end. he has grown so damn much, makes me very happy for some reason. i loved the teachings he gave to his son to make him better. i loved everything about this game. well done devs! and well done for sharing this with us sir. thank you!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-14,"crazy how kratos says, i do not wish to fight you! in the beginning. young kratos killed anyone who even slightly got in his way without hesitation. older kratos tried so hard to convince baldur to let his hatred of his mother go, and so hard to make freya let go of her hatred for him."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-27,i still can't get over the music and how majestic it feels on 230
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,finally kratos has shed some tears. we never really seen kratos get emotional and compassionate like he did in this game
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-18,one of the things i love about this game is the fact that your allies will alert you to where the enemies are in proximity to yourself
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-03-28,"it's amazing that you went through the whole god of war ragnarok in one video and didn't want to break it up into parts, respect to you"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-18,"just finish watching the whole game video, i cried. the story, the gameplay, the music, the game is effing masterpiece!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,154820 one of the best dramatic tirades ive seen lately. almost made me drop some tears. when sindri asked we? i pronounced the words there is no we anymore out loud and just at the same time sindri was saying these words with me. what a masterpiece this game is. truly will become legendary for generations to come.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,"at 115600 and you start seeing that kratos is hurt that faye might just wanted to be with him because he iswas a godslayer. an essence of feeling betrayed, that faye. the woman he thought loved her regardless of his flaws probably only wanted him because of those flaws. he is tired because this may simply be another war, just like how zeus, gaya and the olympians wanted to use him. i feel for him at the end now and... and take this away, we are that broken as mellenials. but we have to be better."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-15,"i like these walkthoughs, but please cut the parts where you're trying to solve puzzles, its painful to see you do mistakes again and again, just cut the parts where youre confused, it takes you too much time and its boring, people watch these videos because they have no time playing this game for themselves or not having a ps5"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,"this was the most epic story i have ever seen. god of war never disappoints. hope we will see more of this! unbelievable job by the developers and the whole cast of actors involved, truly amazing! thank you!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,"the moment ragnarok said i am ragnarok was really one of the ragnarok moments of our time, bravo chad cox."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,you know i never thought i'd feel so bad for kratos. but he's been through so much in such a short time.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-03,"nah , sigrun be like some principal who's had enough of a person's bs and just want to end it all"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-26,one thing i absolutely love about mimir from last game and this one is hes funny without being annoying. he knows when he should talk and just hang in silence
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-17,i just love how everything was taken in one shot. like it feels like youre actually on the journey with them.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,31929 i love how atreus tried to copy his father while opening chest like kratos did in the god of war 4 and in this game!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-02,well done can believe this dude can not sleep at 18 hour god of war ragonarok
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-30,i just finished watching 18 hours of this. longest thing ive ever watch but hella worth it
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,"i like the increase of dialogue between characters, not just so much them talking about important things, but them just talking to each other about random stuff that makes sense. like mirmir apologizing for his impatience"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-10,this game had made me emotional. the end made me cry hard as a dad. this game is truly a masterpiece.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-07,15848 he wont give u the compass if u dont leave from that door lmao
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,at 906 he was like im proud son that dad moment made my heart happy
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,the ending part where kratos drops a tear. deym! what a masterpiece! happy to be playing this game from the first up until now.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-14,"what impressed me more than the fighting and storyline was the writing of the dialogues, truly a masterpiece reflecting alot of emotions"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-03,i cried when fenir died
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-09,"why can't movies be as awesome as god of war ragnark? the whole game is basically just one long camera shot and nonstop story, action, and character development. videogame storytelling at its finest."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-14,freyas voice actor killed it. her whole character is incredible
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-03,"now i've watched beginning to end, it's fair to say this is the best story game i've ever seen. the quality of its production and eveything. i love it"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-27,cant believe how kratos became calm and composed after you witnessed how he dismantled and butchered gods in the previous series. literally gives me goosebumps whenever i think about it.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,faye seemed to make kratos more than the spartan soldier he was. human actually. i cannot wait to play this in a few days.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,"kratos saying death can have me, when it earns me is so wise its amazing 93447"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,i love how atreus tries to break the chest like his father like father like son. jacksepticeye is gonna love this.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-14,"i like the story. tyr and kratos are 2 sides of the same coin. both god's of war, both have trauma, both betrayed by fathers of their pantheon. used and played by fate and prophecies. tyr may not have killed odin but he also isn't wearing his families slayen ashes as skin. so the scales balance. loki head strong, arrogant and young seeing visions of victory at face value is immaculate story telling and characterization. if kratos got off hid ptsd kick he could stop the boys foolishness. man would rather fight thor than tell his son his whole story and what he feels."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-20,"kratosatreus is hands down the best fatherson relationship in gaming history. made me cry at the end. this deserves to be the game of the year no cap edit finally completed watching the gameplay on 20 november 2022, sunday at 623 pm"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-20,93435 death can have me when it earns me hardest kratos line ever
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,"115502 whenever this theme plays, i know i will rather have goosebumps, cry, or bow to the epicness of it"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-20,i might be getting a ps5 for my birthday and im gonna download this game
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,"wrath of a mother, love of a father, fight of a warrior.... god of war is a complete package. truly masterpiece"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-03,"43835 my heart stopped for a second. 60406 college students during finals. 63253 my mom every time my sister gets back home from a girls night out. 72225 my wife when there's a mouse in the kitchen. 84542 reminds me of a certain god with winged boots. 90036 typical phone call with mom. 93451 yeah, sure kratos...100013 105351 you must be over 18 to enter this site. 112617 spongebob moment. 114533 also known in america as mr. mountain dew. hard refill indeed. 170537 just thanks for this. i mean, you were in the midst of the apocalypse and your friends needed your help but you can't deny it was worth the pause. awesome."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,so sick they had the death sequence and thor brings you back to life.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-10,the amount of puzzles in this game thank you
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-10,"the fact this game didn't win game of the year, is so suprising to me. visuals, music, storytelling, acting, everything hits so hard."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,at last scene mortals start worshiping to kratos made me cry  what a wonderful story this game deserves all trophies
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-18,"i just gotta say, this gameand the preceding one are absolute masterpieces. they could win every award in existence and it wouldn't do them justice. the characters, the story, the cinematics...unlike anything i've ever seen."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-20,this is teh best 18 hours of my life
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,to see such an amazing transformation about kratos until now its just a masterpiece that can not and will not be duplicated. the whole thing is just legendary
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-11,"53112 hilarious how atreus doesnt actually have a bow, hes just shooting arrows with nothing but his hands"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-03,904 kratos smiled. never seen him smile after those years
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-11,kratos can move onto the egyptian gods now.

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,"atreus' impersonation is absolutely brilliant. i could not stop laughing after that  'woman, guard the house' 13715"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,4745 the game doesn't start without someone sending kratos flying in the air
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-19,"these 18 hours was the best ones of my life and totally worth it , god of war , a complete masterpiece"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-05,"i think after this episode there should be a whole life story of faye. she said she was just a mortal, but really? a wife predicted all the paths that her husband and her son would go, an adventurer who used to travel around the realms, a once fierce warrior who fought thor and left behind a huge ice thunder tree, claimed she was just an ordinary giant? god of war 4 and god of war ragnarok are successfully performed, and a whole new side story about faye will be another success"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,cant believe god of war ragnarok is 20 years old..
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,"i had a heart attack for a seconds, i thought it was a new game lol!"

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,anyone else get the feeling this was thrown together because there was anticipation that they were going to do something for the 20th anniversary?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,we all wanted a god of war ps2 remake. the least they could have done is release all the original god of war games on the ps5. like how they did with the sly cooper games a few months ago.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,we need the god of war greek saga remastered! upd for pc

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,they slowly preping us for the egyptian arc. this new cosmetic set is so egyptian.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,surely thats not all were getting for the 20th anniversary is it? thats depressing ngl

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,if the new game is like this shit then i wouldnt care i want the old gow back
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,something any other company would have charged money for this is another free add on for a fantastic game
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,best 20 years of my life free contact
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-21,"fans hey, playstation, gow is 20 years old, how about you remaster the old games to celebrate? playstation best i can do is cosmetics for a 3 yo single player game nobody plays anymore cuz they beat it already"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,i thought for a second i was rip van winkle and slept for almost 2 whole decades. only to realize its literally a cosmetics update.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,"always on march. always! gotta love their dedication to that month  if you understand why, i love you."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,"it's sad seeing the creator joffy have to work for keemstar now, too, make ends meet on lolcow nightmare every night"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,"i love god of war since game 1, but when i see this dlc skin for 20 years i think, who cares."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,20 years... if you do a remasterd collection  take my money
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,sony has lost its touch...this is only there announcent on there anniversary?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,remaster incoming
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-21,"put all old games are pc already, were getting any younger for the love of all that is holy!!!!!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,it should have been a remastered collection of classic gow trilogy to all new gen consoles and pc for anniversary not some dumb costumes for 25 hours story game. this is such a bad move
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,wth writers think we wanted gold clothes maybe because of asgard? f no we wanted another game and were 100 ok if atreus was left out of it.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,really a trailer for a skin?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,if bros didnt think he was black then this gonnna change their minds
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-21,"cosmetics don't interest me, nor will they ever interest me. it's cool that they're free, but i think an announcement like hey we're making the next game set in egypt would have been more appreciated than this."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,black kratos for dlc.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,hm. i thought that update was for something.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,"gives egyptian mythology vibes, so this mean we are not getting that setting?"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,"remaster the classic god of war ,come on sony at least a little teaser !!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-21,i mean at least its free..
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,i mean i love god of war but why would id be interested in that ? especially for people who 100 the games
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,its very funny that games like the last of us have a lot of remakes and the first games of god of war not.....
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,so does it give you a new power up or is it merely cosmetic??????
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,"still haven't managed to finish this game, played the first one to the bone, took on all the valkyries and got the platinum trophy but theres just something about the atreus parts of ragnarok that make me lose interest and turn it off, like the mary jane parts of spiderman but longer and more frequent"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,who thought it was a new game!?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,wow this greek saga remaster looks great... oh wait
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,i was wondering why the game was downloading contents today
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,do they look like egyptian gods? it reminded me of ac origins.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,so they made a christopher judge skin. nice
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,cant wait for future games
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,really thought this was another dlc like the other one
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,kratos loses his right
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-21,do we need to fully upgrade our weapons before being able to use the dark odyssey appearances for them?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,"give us the goddamn og games, wtf is this!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,almost thought it was more story dlc
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,i think this was meant to come out in like 18 years but ok
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-21,is the biggest piece of dog shit
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,"for our 20th anniversary, we will gift you black kratos ok?"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,"bruh, it's 2025 now, and we even got a trailer for cosmetics???"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-21,never got the shields man

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-21,just checked the psn and there is no dark odyssey collection.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,i hope they bring back the fear kratos skin. black and red.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,there is a dark odyssey young kratos skin also in god of war ragnarok update
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-21,"wow, that definitely looks peek and now ive got another reason to jump back into this amazing game! its been awhile.."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,i was thinking of playing this game again now i have a reason black kratos goes hard
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,i still have hope for god of war greek saga remastered collection because they announced god of war 3 remastered for the 10th anniversary of god of war as a surprised so they will probably reveal a greek saga remastered collection as a big surprise after the exhibition event is fully over
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-21,keep your expectation low and you will never be disappointed
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-21,this is what happens if u spend most of ur time on direct sunlight
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,"kratos looks absolutey sexy in black i aint gonna lie, been awhile since ive seen your channel"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-21,"i finished the main game twice on my ps4 before upgrading to ps5. i recently finished valhalla on ps5, and want to use the valhalla bonus stuff but have to finish the main story. now i have even more of a reason to do it"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-21,ive always wondered where are you from i love your accent my man!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,fear kratos 2.0?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-21,how do u equip the black and gold skin color change for kratos????

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-21,i was getting so frustrated watching you in the first few minutes like i feel like it was extremely easy to change everything and you were acting like it was so hard to figure out
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-21,i dont know whats harder rn me or this skin
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-21,my weapons don't show up for gold
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-21,stop putting update it's mods
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,god of war 3 all cutscenes movie  httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vtjokmkktia8
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-18,to grieve deeply... is to have loved fully this line hits at the heart.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-14,kratos is literally the absolute greatest example of perfectly written character development.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,"death can have me, when it earns me if anyone deserves to say that its kratos"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-06-02,"this series turned out so much deeper, better thought out, and downright impressive than i had expected. a true masterpiece in my opinion."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-16,"when kratos was telling the story, and saw his son fall asleep in the comfort of his presence  and how it hit him realizing how much he loved atreus....man i cried."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,damn near ever line of dialogue from kratos sounds like a man who is constantly holding himself back from unleashing rage upon everyone and everything. it's truly incredible acting.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-05,"death can have me, when it earns me  kratos. if that isn't the most badass line i've heard."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-24,one of my favorite parts of this game is the transitions between kratos and atreus and their dream worlds. it's so smooth and seamless. there's no meanwhile or moments later
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,its like a 7 hour free aaa movie. love it.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,that is 7 hours of my time that i will never regret. it was beautiful. wish kratos journey doesn't end here.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,"seeing kratos step into fatherhood and really become loving toward his son is beautiful. especially from where his story started. when atreus hugged him after coming back that second time, he was on the verge of tears. tears! i cant believe his emotional development!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-06,"43325 you can literally see the smile form on his face from hearing those words come from atreus, the amount of pride he had in him in that moment was immense."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,an insanely beautifully written story. felt like i just watched a 7 hour movie. the massive amounts of character development in this story was outstanding. seeing kratos almost breakdown because of the prophecy that he may be worshipped and loved by people. manthat was really moving and sindris change in personality to broks death honestly hurt. ive never felt so bad for a character like that but it shows just how much a death can change a person.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-19,"a little detail i'd like to mention during ragnarok, when sindri goes with atreus, he is no longer using his dwarven magic. before, he would use it to cross the terrains to not get filth over himself and be very cautious of his movement. but here, he doesn't give a damn anymore. it's even more heartbreaking, seeing him covered in filth during brok's funeral. he really did lose the best part about himself."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-07-12,"4528 kratos secretly wanted a snack, but was too proud. someone, get this man an olive."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,"i love how he added the entirety of thor's and odin's fight, dude knows what his audience wants"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,loki will go. atreus remains. right in the feels
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,from a man who lost everything who only sought rage and revenge to a man who has gained everything and is willing to see past his hate and rage this series has made a legend
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-21,"i love the way they did the norns in this. they aren't oracles, just some people that watched a lot of stories to the point where they can predict their main plot points. they're like us! when we see a movie, we can see common tropes the bad guy is actually the good guy, and our ally is actually the bad guy. the best friends in the teen romcom turn out to be the true lovers. the hero is on the verge of defeat, but after reaching deep down inside they unlock a new power to succeed! they can see the characters of their realm, predict their stories, and because they are so good come to the right conclusions so often that they are deemed fate weavers. in reality, they just pay attention and pick up stuff. i also love the norns' character establishment because it allows their prophecies to be wrong. even the most astute moviegoer can't predict every film's plot, after all. truly brilliant!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,"it is the nature of a thing that matters, not its form. the scene where brok blesses the spear is so amazing"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,"seeing kratos, the kratos, almost breakdown in tears when seeing a mural of a future were he is remembered lovingly is really moving.  edit i know he's being worshipped, what i meant is that people are not worshipping him as the god of war"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-02,35320 odin has anyone ever worshipped you? can you imagine that kind on love? no! the entirety of the spartan army after gow1
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-08-08,i love how odin is portrayed as a sleazy megalomaniac crime boss. such a contrast to the allfather harsh but fair benevolent warrior god that he's usually portrayed as.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-13,"something i've realized about this series. at first, it was about anger, hatred, revenge. then it became about truth, and the resolve of grief. finally, about justice, and protecting your loved ones and the places they live in. beautiful really."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-17,love the scene of brok blessing draupnir. truly love what they did with his character in this game
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-01,man sindris arc still just makes me cry and gives me chills hes the most caring and once brok dies you can see he literally stops caring by the broken and dirty armor hes wearing
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-06,"this is oscar winning story telling, my god if youd told me that the most beautiful story told in the last 50 years was a game play through id have laughed at you, but here we are. this game put all of modern hollywood to shame"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,"that scene of kratos crying over his son, while telling him a bed time story just made the whole series worth it. jesus just seeing these expressions, being on the verge of tears is such a turn for krators. i love how he grew as a character"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,"kratos and i thought my family was disfunctional. but seriously, the amount of buildup from the last game can't even compare to the events in this game. the developer really took our hearts out and strap them on the emotional ride."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-17,seeing kratos's lip quiver out of sadness when atreus walked away sincerely made me tear up. beautifully written.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,"seeing sindri refuse to clean himself at the end hit different. subtle story telling, no one had to say it to us for us to see the damage. it's all told by a very well written and played character. sindri not cleaning himself was one of the hardest hitting moments in any movie media i've seen i think in my entire life. it was such a potent, impactful change to his character that had been cemented and seemed as if it would pervade no matter what, but brok literally broke sindri when he died. i don't see any movies pulling off storytelling like that anytime soon. so magnificent."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-10-18,42010 this is one of my favorite moments in the whole game. atreus realizing his mistake and kratos accepting he pushed his son away after trying his hardest to keep him close. the storytelling in gow 4 and ragnarok are amazing.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-16,"559 not enough people are talking about freya screaming kratos name with such rage, hatred, and pain. danielle bisutti did a fantastic job voicing freya"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,"the emotion kratos felt of how unfathomable and surprising it was for him to see that for once after all this time he's loved and worshipped as a god, not as a destroyer, but a better god holding faye's axe and not the blades of chaos was astounding and what a lot of us have been waiting for! the character development over the years was amazing. amazing series."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,"this can legit pass off as a movie, thats how good the story is"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-03,"as a recovering addict, thrud talking to his dad gave me chills and tears to my eyes. ive heard similar words and i cant imagine the pain she was in"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-07,"to see kratos smile, at his son in pride. what a time to be alive."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-14,"kratos's story is the proof that there's still hope for broken men drowned in sorrow, suffocated by anger and have shut their hearts from the friends and family around them. truly a good story"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-05,"it's incredible how the series evolved and matured so much. started as a beat em all full of puzzles, and now it's a philosophical family story revisit of nordic mythology... where you beat them all, of course."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-09-07,"this games story mode is better than most movies in the last 20 years. great plots, subplots are excellent , every character has some kind of significance even if we've never seen them on camera, every threading that knits the lines in the story together so well. i haven't been blessed with the experience of gameplay yet, but i will soon. this story is amazing !"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,"kratos finally being seen as something more than a destroyer is heart warming. he knows how corrupt and selfproclaimed many other gods are. this is the journey he took, to redeem those who have suffered at their hands. and finally seeing how people view him now i'm sure puts his sacrifices and hardships into perspective. loved watching this."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-29,i shed a tear at this scene at 35000 it is the nature of a thing that matters. not its form truly amazing writing
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-19,"this was literally a 7 hour movie, this story was so unbelievably well written, movie writers should to a class by the people who wrote this the visuals, camera angels, cinematography, what a master piece."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-29,"there is no destiny. there is no grand design, no script. only the choices you make. but your choices are so predictable , merely make us seam prescient. you are the sum of your choices, nothing more."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-17,this was incredible. i've not played a single god of war game and yet i'd have happily paid to watch this in theatres. amazing.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-03,mimir finally solving broks riddle at the end was wrenching and pure writing genius to make us wait for it
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-25,"i still can't get over that death can have me when it earns me line, it's so badass"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-10-31,"13728 tyr lectures atreus saying there is always a choice! while later at 63700 odin continually denies having a choice when atreus confronts him about what hes done. like most manipulative abusers, he is a hypocrite."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-16,"my man truly taught us all an inspiring life lesson. the phrase its just a game is nothing but empty words compared to this fantastic character weve all grown to love. no one, not even kratos can hold onto rage, anger, and hate i hope this teaches all of us to show love and understanding to those weve grown to hate. i truly hope everyone has a beautiful night or day. god bless you all!!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,kratos and mimirs relationship developing into a brotherly type bond is really nice to see tbh. you can tell kratos really trusts him.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,"i love how kratos is so fearless, he has fought collosal beasts and killed docens of gods, but is so vulnerable and scared when it comes to atreus and he breaks down when he remembers faye. his biggest fear is losing his family once again, and he is capable of doing everything in his power to protect his son, literally everything i just love how human he feels in this game"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-10-20,"i love how in all the god of war games of my childhood you're just alone in a quest for blood and vengeance but now we have an actual family and friends that care for you, you have a squad of people with their own stories and by helping them you gain their trust and their support. this game is a masterpiece on a lot of aspects, even the music is surprisingly amazing and deeper than what you would expect at first from a god of war game"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,i started tearing up at the end seeing kratos finally at peace and finally finding his real purpose hes came such a long way
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,i haven't cried in a long while but this game managed to bring me to tears. its message just really hits hard from growing past your hatred and learning to heal from people who have harmedbetrayed you and many more. this will definitely be a game i will hold dear to my heart. it was entirely worth the wait.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,"sindri's change was heart wrenching. god of war has come so far, its incredible"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-07-18,"can i turn into a wolf?  they wrote this full circle so well. it's just the writing that's always so good! also. i am so upset for how sindris ending was. it's really well done, but it also really hurts."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-13,"the final scene when kratos see his future was touching, he finally saw a path out of death and destruction, this is definitely a master piece that bring me to the verge of tears."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,what i love about kratos so much is just how human he is with such little dialogue. i can't really explain it in other words. terrific writing.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-16,"thor resurrecting kratos so he could keep fighting him was such a power move, i love it."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-08,45250 one of the most underrated and heroic parts of the game was when birgir sacrificed himself for the team
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,"the character development is top tier, the story was absolutely brilliant and the graphics were simply immaculate to watch"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"the part at around 35000 where kratos just walks into the room. the sound effects, the animation, the music was brilliant. i could feel the tiredness kratos must feel, the years dawning of him. looking at the chains, at his past, the ashes of his first wife and daughter staining his skin. and then the pouch bringing him back to now, to faye and atreus. it really is emotional and im glad these kind of games are showing this to a widely male demographic. seeing kratos lip quivering, ready to cry. its important to see"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,i feel sooo bad for sindri man! that dialogue when he tells i gave you everything and lost my family too that was tooooo deep too heavy
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-03,65754 i love that mimir answers immediately when kratos is strictly only talking to freya
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-19,"65340 is absolutely amazing. such an emotionally brilliant moment. kratos, former god of war, slayer of pantheons, showing his son that he loves him. nervous, scared, and not knowing what to expect, he places his trust and care with his boy, and finally shows him all the love he's wanted to since we started this journey. absolutely amazing."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-13,the last scene was the most emotional of all literally after so many decades of war and killing finally kratos can burn his past and move forward as a god whom everyone will no more hate and fear him but theyll worship him . this game symbolises the relationship between a true father and a son much love to this game. do not forget my friends we can always be better
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-17,its crazy how weve gotten to the point where video games are better movies with better stories and characters than actual movies and this game is still a masterpiece in 2024
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-08-07,this wayyy better than soo many movies being made nowadays
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,54825 that moment between mimir and sigrun the valkyrie was so heartwarming to watch. such a nice detail to follow from the previous game.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,"43326 damn, kratos smiled for the first time, i have tears in my eyes man. i can feel the guilt of kratos, the voice acting is top notch."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-10-08,"65834 such a beautiful ending to a story, an ending i didnt imagine but it was such a heartwarming thought to see kratos finally happy with his life"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-25,"as someone who sadly doesn't have the time anymore to play games of this calibre  i want to thank you endlessly for stitching this narrative together in a format that's easy to take in. although playing a game is a different experience, i was still able to emulate that feeling through watching this, and felt just as empowered despite not being the one with the controller in hand. this is a story that is impossible to forget  something truly timeless and so rare. loki goes.. atreus remains"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,"to grieve deeply, is to have loved fully. that's probably the hardest line in the game, and had me bawling like a baby."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,"in all those moments kratos is all alone right before he's about to sleep, that time that he spends with himself , sitting thinking , remembering his past and trying to hold on to the last living being he cares about, man there's so much of emotion in it. i like how the story used to revolve around the ghost of sparta has slowly turned into such a beautiful masterpiece, those who have been sticking around since gow 1 came know what i'm talking about. loved this masterpiece , long live kratos !"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-12,i know i have class tomorrow but i'm loving this
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,the absolute chills i got from brok blessing the spear 35015 may this weapon strike true. may it be wielded with wisdom. may it be put down when its job is done.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,atreus almost became everything kratos was running from. powerful story. cant wait to play this game!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,just came here to say that this story was so touching and a great end to a long awaited journey. this last ride with kratos will never be forgotten.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-27,this is the first time i watched the 7 hours cutscenes without skipping the whole part. its so beautifull! i cant hold my tears
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-06,as someone who doesnt have a father anymore the moments with atreus and kratos when they reunited and also when they went their separate ways at the end really hit me in my feelings.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,"45258 wow.. birgir's death hit hard. for people who dont know, he is reciting a norse poem, which translates to death comes to livestock, death comes to friends, death comes to you as well, but i know about something that never dies the reputation of the deceased. the band wardruna has a song around this poem as well called helvegen. edit as pointed out in the comments, the runeword fe is for livestock, not fairies  which in hindsight makes more sense"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-18,"ugly crying right now, loved it. kratos came a long way when he started his journey into fatherhood. when he almost broke down seeing how he would be loved by peopleman my heart  great character development. i love their story."

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"a true game for sure, can't wait to play one of the best sequels.."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,the type of game that makes us fall in love for this medium all over again.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-05,"ah yes, the best part about this game is surely the puzzles they are the best part because the game literally tells you how to solve them if you cant figure it out in 30 seconds!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,there is something so special and satisfying in this game series. it's kinda like you're rewriting the mythology but in a fun way.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,i'm glad the father and son relationship is still the centrality of the story
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,wow! great to see the gow franchise going strong by each sequel and all the credits to the developers for understanding the sentiments of millions of fans and give us something even better to experience.

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,finally a game that lives up to the hype
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,imagine creating a sequel to a game heralded as a masterpiece and going beyond that it's impressive that the developers not only met but also exceeded the fans' expectations
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,another playstation masterpiece. best publisher in the industry.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"we all have come a long way, lets give kratos the best ending he deserves the one he desires , as this is the last game in the norse saga."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,thor vs odin already enough making this game 1010
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,the only game series to keep getting better with years really amazing they manage to do so
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,so kratos obviously survives the game if you can do end game content after the story.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,always knew this was gonna be a banger. sony and santa monica never disappoints
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"gotta say the person playing is doing an amazing job showing the improvements to the combat, im already seeing it have a lot more layers and face pace compared to 2018"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-24,"the game tells a captivating story that, at times, may feel overly drawn out. it boasts breathtaking graphics and visceral animations. the combat feels better and faster than ever and engaging in combat with the spear provides a particularly gratifying experience, and the addition of free valhalla dlc enhances the game's value. players can also look forward to an array of enjoyable side quests and puzzles with great minibosses throughout its semiopen world. on the downside, the game has some notable drawbacks  the inclusion of numerous atreus missions can feel overwhelming and repetitive.  the pacing of the story may seem oddly sluggish during certain segments, impacting the overall flow.  minor glitches within the game can detract from the immersive experience and when trying to quit the game, it would be stuck on the home menu saying it's already running. the only fix to this is restating the pc. it's annoying so day the leas. a few crashes here and there too  it's worth noting that the companion often provides solutions to puzzles, potentially diminishing the challenge for players. fighting that gna valkyrie was tough as a nail. damn  valhalla dlc kept crashing constantly!! unfortunately 810"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,you know the review is heavily biased when they have nothing at all negative to say about the game.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,wish this review didnt show so many clips of cutscenes that have never been shown before.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,was there ever any doubt ragnarok was going to be amazing. gow 2018 was easily one of the best ps4 games of the last few years and ragnarok seems like its going to exceed it.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-09,loved every minute of this game
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,'spoiler free' proceeds to give spoilers
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"this is not a game , this is art at its finest !!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,"749 it's nice to see more dismemberment outside of finishers like the original trilogy. aside from getting that one trollk's heart in helheim, the pevious game didn't have nearly enough gore"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-19,"the thought of having to backtrack through an open area on rails, while having to either shimmy, crawl, climb, squat, paddle, sled, or squeeze through any environmental obstacle gave me onset anxiety. atreus are we going back to help that spirit find his son? kratos no."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,this is not the review we wanted but the review we needed!!!! masterpiece. cannot wait to get my hands on it and be kratos once again
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,"this... is... what the gaming industry needs!!! passion projects that don't rely on servicebased formula, open world fillers, nor microtransations!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-03,"imagine creating a masterpiece, and then making a masterpiece sequel"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,"this era of gaming is soon to close, and i'm grateful to have been involved with it all this time"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,shout out to simon cardy! yet again a stellar review. funny and informative!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,"although a 10 for this game is the only logical option considering everything, however this review felt like a sales pitch rather than a review."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,sony santa monica is officially the most trustworthy company you will ever find in the market. every game they drop is a masterpiece
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-07,spoiler alert! the only issue with this game is the ending itself. gow 2018 took its time and build the story well enough. ragnarok on the other hand feels very rushed especially towards the end of the story.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-08,the best game ive ever played
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-18,story and writing was better in 2018. this had some irritating the characters tell you how to solve everything before u even get a chanse to try but its an epic game some amazing visual environments. gameplay fun as hell. strongly recomend
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-19,ign voice actor   keeping things.. spoiler free  ign video editor  huh?..
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,so ridiculously hyped for this game.

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-05,"lol, yeah the whole point of a puzzle is to have the answer screamed at you 20 seconds in xd"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,"we need more games like this. no micro transactions, no lootboxes, complete on release, great writing. lets hope this game compels others to follow"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,most anticipated game
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,been on gow since 2005 and still am amazed by the whole series and they still one up the game before!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,we deserve a less rushed ending.... we have waited 2 years.... 2 years patiently waiting giving santa monica all the support they needed... please hear me out... the ending is unfulfilling and leaves one feeling that the game is short and needs a more elaborate end... endgame content is great... but we want a fuller feeling...

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-29,"when i played on the ps5, my go to shield was the dauntless shield, it was really good and also increased your cooldown stat. but on my pc playthrough, i used that guardian shield, it felt a lot easier to use with more fps and is great at counterattack against bosses which the dauntless shield sucks at"

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-19,just about to start my first play through! stopped by here before i begin. thanks for the tips! looking forward to hunkering down for the winter!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-24,the best shield in the game is guardian shield . you can literally interrupt the red attacks followed up by yellow attacks

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-14,excellent video just as hzdfw is. will rewatch once i start ragnarok. replayed the 2018 gow  this sequel looks like a great improvement.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-31,"i hate how complicated games are nowadays, ghost of tushima did such a great job with making it look simple and easy to use and dont need to remember a billion button combination like a computer"

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-13,"stonewall can kinda parry, because it can activate rond of nine realms if you block last second."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-23,"1210 for some reason, i could not get past this stupid fight! i would get so close with one last enemy but i would always be one shot at that point and i got super discouraged i stopped playing it! watching some of your vids to get my motivation back up. gonna watch the combat master next lol. trying to get back into gaming after years of not playing anything. my thumbs need some work lol. cheers for makeing these guides!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-23,great tips.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-20,"there are actually setups to build up stun fast. one of them is to combine these skills first, use blades press l2r2 enemies turn their backs towards you then do the hyperion grapple, then keep pressing r1 to hit them in the back another is to throw the axe at the enemy's head, making them turn around and show their backs to you, them keep holding r1 to attack it multiple times with ice spikes"

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-23,"more ragnarok content, sweet!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-31,"i love how this video instantly mentions hyperion grapple. i also realized around 23 through the game that you can handle the vast majority of enemies by just grappling into them over and over again. with the right handle this often stuns them in one or two hits. so fights were just me slamming myself into guys and then doing stun kills to them. edit this guy's videos are so good, they really put all other gameplay tips videos to shame"

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,so it took yall so long to realize this?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-01,sadly this video has nothing to offer me all of this information i already know well that's what happens when you play games at maximum difficulty but still it has one things that i didn't think that the burn status could be a game changer but i'm more of a melee fighter i use weapons when i see that the stagger is not gonna work here
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-23,bro u dont say how to do it like hyperian something..we r here to learn how to do not just listen that its possible
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-07,you actually can stun grab most bosses.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-05,i missed getting the pommels of undying spark
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-23,new horizon game news ??
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,"if u are low in hp and rage, just find a mystic gateway. interact with it then cancel it, it will refill ur health and rage to full"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,i'm convinced falcon doesn't play any of the games he does videos for. the amount of times he mispronounces things that are said in game is incredible lol
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-14,"special mention there is a relic called the mystic heirloom that doesn't seem to do anything when you trigger it and it has a 16 second cool down. what it's for... is you use it close to these troll statues which are in 3 locations, and you awaken the troll for a troll fight like from the first game. there is also a dragon statue you can use it on to get those last pesky dragon claws necessary to upgrade the armor you get from the crater. this stone dragon is literally the last dragon in the game, and not really all that tough as dragons go."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,"for those hesitant to mess with the high contrast display and don't want it on at all times, go to gameplay setting and navigate to touch pad shortcuts, there you can set a swipe motion on the touchpad for high contrast display which lets you toggle it on and off."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,"i almost missed the crater. it was massive, has amazing enemy diversity and loot, has some really beautiful locations, and ties into the story pretty well. it adds a good 56 hours on and is completely missable. crazy."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-13,when traveling in the realm between realms you don't actually have to move for the exit to appear. if you just listen to the conversation going on it automatically appears in front of you when the dialogue is complete.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-30,"my personal easytomiss thing that i severely overlooked was how amazing the realm shift build is. with the right setup and a full mastery over your favorite weapons, that can easily turn the tide of battle in as little as five seconds. for it to work, you need the pommel, handle and hilt of the nine realms after a certain point in the game, which upon triggering permafrost, immolation or maelstrom will trigger a 1.5 second realm shift. the rnd of the nine realms is also mandatory as it triggers the same effect under a parry shield doesn't matter, though i would recommend either the onslaught or stonewall shield for efficacy on interrupting blue rings. accompany that with a boon of the nine realms and your damage goes sailing under the realm shift effect. you can also throw in the hilt of hofu to extend the realm shift timer, allowing more damage with your runic attacks and shredding health bars very quickly. i was able to bring down king hrlf in 3 minutes due to this build, so my recommendation is get yourself a nine realms kit as soon as possible."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,"bonus tip you can still quick turn in this game. i don't remember the game ever actually telling you how, but in this game since down is for putting away your weapon, you press shield and then down to do a quick turn. it helps a surprising amount and i thought they just straight up removed this from the game but it was just kind of hidden"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,as someone who is legally blind. im loving all the little options sony has been putting in their games to be more accessible. just makes things feel so much better instead of struggling with basic gameplay like qtes or dificult to see items like this.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-09,you should include the survival armor set  give you stats in every categories if you fully upgraded 79
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,ive just played the first couple of hours and i am already in love. this game was worth the hype
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-05,a good way to know that you have explored every area in god of war ragnarok is by collecting all 48 ravens
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-01,"my biggest end game note that i'd provide is that unless there's a secret realm tear or a few in the game, you will not have enough dust of realms to upgrade everything. i did a completionist playthrough and bought every piece of gear and spent time gathering materials to upgrade it all, and by the time it came to upgrading my shields  ronds, it boiled down to being left with either one shield, or two ronds unable to be maxed out. not the most important note to provide, but given that new game plus is an implemented feature later on, i would recommend being picky with what you max out in case there's a specific build you want to use in a ngp playthrough."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,"it's better to use fury to get out of a stun and cancel it instantly, it uses very little and lets you break stuns more often as it recharges"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-13,for me the high contrast mode was the smartest move by the devs to help all gamers to find every collectible in order to reach 100 completion to each area of the realms.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,"about the omar creatures, the game actually tells you really early about them when you are doing main quest and even gives the hint of attacking it from behind though. ragnarok does a good job of giving you information about these things."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-28,"you forgot one. if you equip a stone from all 9 realms, it vastly increases the damage of l1 triangle attacks. the game doesn't tell you or give you a hint that this is a thing."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-20,"imho, by far, the most valuable resource the game doesnt give you a great reason to collect until you find the pond are the shard fragments you can get by using the spear to break them all around the crater. also in vanaheim certain plants will give you resources. hit them with the purple spell then break by throwing the axe"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-30,"something the game doesn't tell you is that, while playing with atreus, you can dodge while aiming and shoot while dodging, atreus will do a leap while aiming, it's super usefull and i found out only on my second playthrough"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,"i only saw 10 and 9, and i feel that im spoiling the game on me. im definitely coming back to this video after two days! thank you for your great work as usual"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,"a great time to be a gamer. so many games to look forward to, including this one. happy gaming, everyone"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-30,"biggest tip i can give is to not ignore your permafrost move the l1triangle charge move. it can do soooo much damage with the right equipment. i used the relic that slowed time, the axe attachement grip of the nine realms which gives you slow time when you activate permafrost, and permafrost and that shit just melts enemies. spoilers for an equipment you get later in the game also throwing the spears is so much better than throwing your axe if you're trying to take down an enemy projectile or even if you just wanna back up and throw some projectiles while you get some health or whatever"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-09,some of the berserker souls actually have the same attack pattern.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-14,"worth mentioning on number 4 that valor is also usable when you are stunned and if you time it right it right before you get it you negate the damage, get a damage buff  health back. seems better than wrath in most cases."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,they never told me caillou grew up
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,i'm so excited for this game and i have to say thank you guys for all your videos cause i enjoy every one of them.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-01,i used the high contrast mode against the berserker in vanaheim. fighting a green berserker assisted by additional greencolored enemies in an effing forest was so frustrating. so i turned the background white and the enemies red.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,along with the ravens tear cuirass there's a particular vitality enchantment that needs 60 vit to activate. provides constant passive health regen. very helpful
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,"just started loving it so far, and i'm sure that will continue!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-30,... it only takes one opening to tear you down to nothing in terms of health shows gameplay of taking almost no damage
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,the chest armor that gives you a health burst when you hit r3 for a finisher is op!! also the waist armor that slows time when you dodge at the last second is a must have
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-29,another muspelheim seed is found in vanaheim near freyrs camp where you throw your spear into the hole and jump across from there. that way you can get it earlier than what you showed us

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,thanks! these videos really help.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,"i waited so long to watch this today lol, i was so torn because i've been avoiding basically everything on the game due to wanting to keep it all a surprise, but on the other hand im sitting here feeling like my entire day is messed up bc i haven't watched gameranx daily video today lol. i know you guys work hard to never throw spoilers out and thank you dudes for that. ultimately decided to come check it out because i know there's going to be a point later i miss something covered in the 10 things they don't tell you video. thanks guys for all the amazing content! im so hype for ragnarok to drop, ill for sure be going through many of the symptoms of the late night gamer videos. that's ok though ! im true to this not new to this !"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,just a few hours to go! i'm so excited! thank you for these spoiler free video's.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,downloaded this the first day and was about to start it but at the last minute chose to play gow 2018 first since i'd never played and i'm glad i listened to everyone who suggested to play it first. how amazing!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,the way he said mooseleheim is so funny
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,"did i just wait until midnight to start it? yes, i did! is it as awesome as i expected it to be  no, it's waaaay waaaay waaaay more awesome!!! the only game i have ever preordered! can not wait to sink hours in it!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-14,you can also get the second seed for muspelheim in muspelheim when you go there in the story
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-21,"in the land of the dwarves, there is a dragon statue you can awaken and get all the dragon tooth you need. it keeps respawning after you defeat it."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-02,we're gonna let you slide on those muspelheim and cuirass pronunciations just this once lmao. keep up the good work mate
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,so excited to play tonight!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-02,one of the things the game doesnt tell you is there is one final boss hidden away after beating the game that is way harder than any boss in the game and you get hints of where it is through scrolls from doing a certain side quest at the end. avoiding spoilers here.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-07-23,1040 sorta poop out at the end so true
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-02,"cant believe he did not mention the stone trolls you can fight using the mystical heirloom, cause thats a thing the game actually does not tell you about whereas most of the things he listed are not that hard to find and you get a really good armour set for it"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-12,mispellheim and queeriss of raven tears  bruh
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-14,please stop saying muspelheim...
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-13,948 dio  the world!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,"015 at number ten, how to acces missspellheim."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-28,meh spell heim  sorry i laughed too hard at that!! its not a dog you find its a boar.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,i just think its funny that in every video with falcon in it he finds a way to horribly mispronounce a name lol
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-14,"one op thing against multiple weaker enemies is the light ranged attack with the blades aiml2  r1 on ps5. when you draw an enemy closer and into the ground so it goes airborne, you can slam that enemy into the enemies that get close in front of you, and 'block' them from reaching you. they stagger when hit by the enemy you threw? sent? shot? the blade at. it's almost to easy at times if you do this. especially if you combine it with aim  r2 heavy ranged attack with blades. another thing that should be repeated for anyone that overlooked it the wretch nests are perfect for grinding skill labors, and the wretch labor ofc. they keep coming until you destroy the nest, so you can take a minute or ten whenever you are at a nest, and you'll have the skill perks in no time at all! i'm also sure ppl know to not waste resurrection stones, or go out of your way to find health. if low on health and no health is near to pick up, just die. you reload with full health. ofc, not in the arena, or if you are so close to beat a boos, or if you are doing a no die run. then use the stone. but when free roaming.. just die.."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,i'm speedrunning the plat for god of war 2018 before that to honor the long shot style of this. almost as though i'm seemlessly going from this to ragnarok.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,can't wait to get off work and play at midnight tonight. let's goooo.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-30,the crystal well i found being super useful to get resources to upgrade
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-17,get the 3 pieces of lucinda's armour and upgrade it. gives poison damage when using hand to hand combat. i beat alot of the end game bosses using this.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,"you guys are the best, you guys never have dull videos ."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"ivaldis anvils or mists of helheim is more helpful if you go for area attacks, ivaldis avail can hit enemies behind you and paired up with the hels touch you have 4 stun wave blasts if fully upgraded all the way"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,"dude is just straight telling you where things are. let people have a chance to find things themselves. the game isn't even out for me yet, damn."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,"so who else is staying up till this drops, and playing it for a couple hours? even if you gotta go to work tomorrow?"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-18,the game tells you all of this.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-17,i love that god of war makes you have to roam around and seek things out but at the same time i wish there was a point where you can upgrade the map to show you the general location of certain chests and whatnot. why give the incentive to explore if the paths to do so are so easy to bypass?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-03,"tip for anyone struggling in musphelheim, or want to farm upgrade materials. just change difficulty settings to easy, farm and then change back as you still get the same rewards regardless of difficulty level."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-21,muh spell heim
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-06,every tip listed is essentially spelled out to you in the game. all these tips are layer out in a way that's almost impossible to miss.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,i loved watching your guys channel when elden ring came out. it was such a fun time when elden ring was still new to release
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,musspellheim is crazy tho
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-08,vanaheims the crater was absolutely a banger. it was the only really fun and rewarding puzzle to solve!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,"in addition to the slow down time relic, may i present the radiance armors set. i think the gauntlet and the waists armors slow down time each time you get a last second evade and its been my favorite set. plus you dont have to wear them all because they timers dont stack so you can just wear one piece."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-06,1000 it was my favorite relic item in god of war 2018 and it's still my favorite in ragnarok
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,"i really appreciate the auto pickup of resources and of healthrage stones when needed. also, being able to hold down a button instead of mashing it. i just wish kratos could climb a little faster up and down on the sections where you can only climb. and one day, the squeezing through cracks in the wall mechanic to slyly load areas will be a thing of the past, eventually."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-29,raven tear cuirass is my absolute favorite bro. working my way thru the game for the first time and absolutely has saved my ass a few times. that plus the berserker resurrection stone
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-03,love how he says the realm shift is the best as he straight up gongs that tracker shield
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,damn this looks great. also just wondering whether you guys have a 1 year later vid planned for bf2042. think its in a much better spot atm and i reckon your opinions would have changed greatly since launch
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-06,major props to this for not spoiling anything for anyone
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-23,as soon as i heard moosepellhighm you lost me
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-16,"the accessibility features in this game are great. even as a non disabled person, i've found a lot of use out of the features."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,love your vids keep up the good work
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,these are some of the best tricks bar none for gowr. thank you so much for helpingy stepping up my game. just subbed.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,so excited for this game!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-12,"omg, i i killed two ormr during my gameplay. this morning i achieved the final few trophies i needed for 100. i thought i was done with the game, but now i'm going to hunt them. ack!!!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,what a shame i miss realm travel via tyr's temple
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-04,"big picture note here be smart about your xp! there's more than enough freyaatreus xp to upgrade all of their skillsrunic summons, but there's not enough kratos xp to upgrade absolutely everything of his to max in 1 playthrough. you will need ng to do that! i completed all laborsfavors, etc. there's no way to get xp unless you spend literally hundreds of hours killing random enemies and that unnecessary grind is just not worth it when ng will come eventually. i just figured it was worth mentioning you should prioritize kratos xp on the runic and relic upgrades you know you'll wanna use the most you can still get all skills, but that costs you the ability to get all runic attacks and relics to lvl 3."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"so something i found out, the second muspelheim seed can also be found in the legendary chest by freyrs camp"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-03,"most of these are fairly well spelled out if you ask me or at least as much as anything else in gow. i will add, in case nobody else has, that in accessibility to change the options so you don't have to mash buttons, just hold them. i find mashing buttons annoying and you never know if you're mashing fast enough or more than necessary. it also feels more fitting for what's happening in most of the prompts"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,don't watch the video now! there can be some spoilers. watch it after playing the game or after watching youtube playthroughs whatever you do.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,"that's why i come here, a youtube channel with real tips, thanks guys"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,damn i thought this was gonna be tips and tricks and things to help you start out not hard spoilers right out the damn gate
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-18,the most real review ive heard. every other video ive seen says  how i defeated the berserkers easily
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-03,for point 4 fury is way more useful for breaking stuns as it only uses a small percentage of your rage bar if you just cancel it right away.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,high contrast mode is kind of like odins sight
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,"another thing the game doesn't tell you the best pieces of equipment statwise are the initial ones, when you upgrade them up to lvl 7 they gain new stats that outclass even the late game equipment. same for axe and sword equipment."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,idk if yall noticed but showing freya as a companion somewhat in the first thing is kinda a spoiler no?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,falconnnn!!!! weve missed you bro!!! make them let you do more reviews!!! i love your delivery man!! youre easily my favorite gameranx member
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-19,i'm surprised you didn't mention the relic that supposedly does nothing but can actually be used to awaken stone trolls. edit and also other creatures! i awakened a dragon the other day.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,i'm just dropping by to leave a like and say i'm so excited to play this game i respectfully decline to watch the video for now but i will come back see you then guys
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,can't wait to platinum this
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,"i just bought god of war, i'm excited to play now. i've put it off for a while now . thanks falcon."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-25,misspellheim
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,love your reaction to the host haha
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,with a significant game release like this we think it's important to take a moment and say thank you very much for watching us throughout these years. much appreciated. hope these videos help.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,"we need more games like this. no micro transaction,no lootboxes,complete on release,great writing. let's hope this game compels others to follow."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,"one thing 2018 and ragnarok did that i really respect is they didn't throw away kratos' story from the original trilogy. in this age of reboots, it would have been easy to take the easy road out and say new mythology means different story. instead, sony santa monica took the difficult path and did so at such a high level that kratos' overall story arc is phenomenal. while you don't need to play the original trilogy to understand this story, doing so will surely benefit the emotions you feel at the end of ragnarok"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"side quests, more in depth scandinavian mythology and improved combat from 2018 will be the bread and butter of this game for me. a must play adventure like the previous one for sure."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,definitely appreciate your dedication to this community with these videos. it's become tradition to watch these videos both before and after i buy.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-02,im close to 40 hours as of right now from just exploring around clearing out all the side quests and stuff and i gotta say this game has been incredible so far its been amazing seeing different sides of kratos and the game itself just feels amazing i love the armor they brought into this one the weapon combos you can do are fantastic.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,the fact you put in so much effort to avoid spoilers is exactly why this is the only ragnarok video i've listened to aside from the trailers i haven't even watched any of the in depth stuff from sony because i wanna go into it as close to blind as i can. thank you for all you guys at ganeranx do for us over the years and here's to many more!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,"yes, it is not always exciting to slowly climb up a ledge or shuffle through cracks during exploration, but i prefer it to the alternative, which is a loading screen or lagging graphics. they use those moments of slow traversal to load assets for the next area in a way that doesn't break immersion and allows us to experience an unbroken singleshot narrative. i also appreciate how they often add meaningful dialogue to those areas the first time you visit."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-20,this game draws in my personal top spot. it shares that spot with ghost of tsushima. both are incredible games and you can get lost in the story and environments. ive platinumed both bought gowr the day it came out and just wow. every player should commit to all of the bosses and favours because this game is such an amazing experience to have.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,it looks like they didnt change the hud layout which is great because i loved the simplistic feel and look. and i am excited to hear they have more enemies and enemy types. that was the biggest issue i had with 2018. but i am here for it!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,finallythe before you buy for a game im definitely going to buy
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,"man, i love these videos. they're so authentic. just reasonable gamer opinions that aren't trying to be clickbait. paints such a good picture of what the game is."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"can't wait for this satisfying combat to be back in my life. this one is a no brainer but appreciate all of the before you buys you guys make, always helpful when i'm looking for something new!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"you had me bigger battles, more cool gods, more gore, bigger worlds!! my only complaint with the last god of war was i felt the game was lacking those big amazing battles that its predecessor were so good at creating. yes, the last game had some most definitely epic parts but just not enough of them!!! i can not wait for next wednesday!!!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-04,yeah after playing this game and going back to 2018 it's insane how much they improved upon a game that was close to a 910 for me
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,my biggest complaint about the 2018 game was the lack of variety in the enemies and it looks like they mightve fixed that for this one.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-04,"i've found your reviews to be insightful, detailed enough to be very informative without being so long that it gets tedious, fair and accurate. when i want a game review before i buy, yours has become my goto."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,thank you for all your hard work jake. you and falcon are my favorite people on youtube. keep up the good work.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,cant wait! props to developers for not making a 3rd one and finalizing the story in these 2 games.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-07,"13 minute video that felt like a 2 minute. very smooth and informative review, great job jake! can't wait for the ragnarok"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"i've needed this game since it was announced. i've been playing god of war since the original back on ps2, and it is still my absolute favorite video game series to date."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"fantastic video, well done, jake! i'm super excited to play this now, this is the kinda game i'm really needing these days. my preorder is preloaded ready to go, just need to avoid spoilers for another week. can't wait to get immersed in the world and see how this chapter ends."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-13,one of the best games i've played in the last 3 years. having an absolute blast with it!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,literally the only channel i look at for game reviews at this point though in this case i already pre ordered. keep up the great content
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"this is probably the first before you buy i'm watching before i actually get my hands on the game, lol. great review guys"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-05,was already 110 percent going to buy this game but here i am still because i love your take on games. thanks for the thorough and honest reviews. keep up the great work!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"i'm so pleased this game seems good! i love 2018 gow, looking forward to playing this one!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"easily my most anticipated of the year, amazing review as always! few more days left"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-07,the only thing i didnt like about the game was how the enemies would attack me while i was still hitting them as if i wasnt attacking at all
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,a perfect review. i really wanted to hear about the story themes compared to how they were in 2018 but everyone else just talked about the combat or the exploration for the entire time. great job!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,fan of the series from the beginning. i cant wait to play this and i can only imagine how incredible it is.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-23,the ironwood section is terrible.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,"i took a chance watching this because i knew you wouldnt spoil it for me, jake. i was already set to buy it and im even more excited now. youre very much appreciated and ive watched you for years, i hope to watch you for a long time to come."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,love all your before you buy videos. hope to see more!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,"granted i'm only 10 hours in at this point, but for me the story has felt like this god of war 2018 kratos learns to be a father god of war 2022 atreus learns to be a son which i think i really like, outside of me being annoyed at any teenagers, even in video games. hahaha"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"i was 100 guaranteed to buy this regardless, but this before you buy was the cherry on top. thanks for your dedication to releasing these videos!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"jake baldino back at it again! great vid, can't wait to get the game"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-05,the bug squish at 935 is why god of war is a great series
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,they should never stop making these games
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,was waiting for this review! love the videos
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,"god of war ragnarok is one of those games that still keep playstation feeling like it did back in the 2000s during the ps3 era, so many great, original titles back then when companies actually tried. i cant wait to play this masterpiece."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,love how your voiceover talked about how the game's story delves into fatherhood while contrasting nicely with kratos slicing a fool in half at the same time. was pretty funny.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,you did an amazing job of reviewing it without giving too much away
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-05,i was on the edge of my seat waiting for the initial 1st minute reaction. ive always loved this franchise and was looking forward to this living up to the expectations. thank you for the consistent amazing content
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,greatest review on the internet thanks for bringing high quality unbiased reviews to almost every game that comes out!!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"i just know this game is gonna be pure beauty in terms of the combat,the story,the graphics and so much more,already preordered,now patiently waiting"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-22,whos here after ps update
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-02-24,its funny how i always watch this after i bought something
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,i feel like that whole dreki suprise moment still constitutes as a spooiler. would have been cool to come across that situation myself without knowing one comes barrelling in after concluding the other one is dead.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,0000 in and i'm already sold. i'll still watch the rest of the video though.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-16,been absolutely loving the game so far. my only nitpicks are the boringrecycled finishers. most of them are just neck snaps. i was hoping for some variety. i love the brutality of the werewolf finisher which also is exactly the same as gow2018 and wished they kept that energy on other finishers.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,game looks great and i loved the first one and all of the games in the franchise. saying that i will wait for a sale because i am more budget conscious now with my money so i have no issues waiting for a sale. got a ton of backlog games i need to play
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,"330 i didnt mind all the coffins and chests. even when it was just money i still found it satisfying finding so much money everywhere, while still barely having any"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,i hope there's a sort of endless battle arena for those trying to complete the combat feats cause i only had two issues with god of war 2018 which was the amount of time you spent on a boat and the fact that once you're pretty much at the end of the game it felt like you were running out of enemies to fight
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,this game just never stops throwing new thingsconcepts at you. it's unreal how much better it's improved upon the last version and then some.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-09-05,"i absolutely love playing this game and something that definitely helped me not get overwhelmed is knowing i didn't need every single item or upgrade to complete the game and have a fun time.i always went out of my way to collect as much stuff as i could because it does make a difference if you explore,i'm not a complitionist though so i'm not bothered if i finish the game and don't have every collectible or upgrade unlocked"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-14,i just completed the game and i love it. i never really played the first 3 games so coming into the 2018 god of war was brand new . i loved the 2018 gow. and it perfectly set the tone for ragnarok. and with the new game santa monica delivered. everything in this game is perfect. i loved how much detail and depth is in this game. everything from the story to the sounds and the battles i had goosebumps the whole way through. this game was amazing. i had to stay away from youtube for days so my story didn't get ruined and your video was the first one i was coming to watch . honestly just to see if you were talking crap about it . loved the game. appreciated the review. this game is easily hands down the best game release of the year
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-21,just finished this game. i think it's the best game i've ever played.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-07,"my gf and i started with 2018, and we had a blast and love the game. so we're really excited about ragnarok, and this video made me even more! thanks."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,you guys make some of the best gaming content on youtube! keep it up 3
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,replayed the 2018 god of war about two months ago and got every single trophy  this was my first game that i have ever got a platinum trophy.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-05,810  this is sparta!!!!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,"spoiler i loved the part when they were having this huuuge battle and kratos says, it's goding time. that was absolute masterpiece."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-11,this game singlehandedly changed the way i expect single player titles to be from now on
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,"man all these kind of gameranx videos is why i watch them, but they're filler videos are usually just as good, overall a great channel on new content or great background noise while gaming!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,"i enjoyed the 2018 gow, but was a bit hesitant to pre order ragnarok bc this isnt my usual cuppa tea. your thoughts on finding enjoyment in the exploration was great news. will definitely be picking this up. thanks."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,"my daughter has been playing games now for 3 years she is 14 she is so lucky, she has saved her god of war experience till she got to it. now she is getting to play the first and immediately get to play the second right after. she doesn't even know how lucky she is while the rest of us had to wait for years for this."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-06,i have played every gow games including the ones on the psp and i have to be honest that i was a bit disappointed with the shift from greek mythology to norse in the last game. but the more i played it replaying it now as we speak the more i feel the series needed a change in direction for the better. thank you for your video.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"amazing guys!! i wonder how you decided who would get to play and review this one, i'm sure there was a hell of a lot discussion beforehand."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,"took me about 38 hours to beat the game, with a few side quests here and there. overall it's a fantastic game and i feel it's easily going to be goty."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-08,i have been keeping my self from spoilers for a year and finally i am getting the game cant wait to play
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"great review without spoiling it for me, i am ecstatic and can't wait for rounds 2 of god and boy."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,this is one of those games that you buy immediately because you already know its gonna be legendary
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-07-22,i like the fighting your character is really responsive when you try to defend or attack
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-11,"im a huge fan of the series since 2005 and ive beaten them all including ps versions of the psp games. honestly, i am not as hyped for this game as i was for the every single one of them before. i didnt buy this one as soon as it came out but just last night. its now downloaded and ready to play but i still am not crazy curious, i dont know why. maybe its the extreme familiarity in looks to the 2018 game which i absolutely fell in love and beaten twice. anyway, i will of course play this one and finish it off too and hopefully and most probably enjoy a lot. lets see.."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-01,i'm planning on buying this so i replayed the ps4 version recently and i forgot how good this game is
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,i like how the enemies enter to fight from the cut scene rather than simply spamming in the last part.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-16,they just put it on ps
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-04,"no spoiler, but i personally liked the ending more in the first game where it was really both physical and emotional culmination. on other parts this games is bigger badder and crazier for sure"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,i'm not playing this game until i get a ps5 until then i will not hear anymore gow reviews or read about anywhere else. i know they have it for the basic ps4 but the guys at gamestop said it kind of freezes a little on basic ps4. so this is the only review i need. thanks for making it spoiler free.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-09,absolutely loved every minute of this game except for the fact that there is no ng
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"incredible stuff man, cannot wait to to have this in 6 days!!!!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-15,"checking this video again ahead of the pc release the 19th, my body is ready boooooiiiiii"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,already preordered this game! and this is the first before you buy video i have watched too. and i am still damn excited! and the game play and the added elements looks amazing! like i noticed that they changed how the xp works. cause now kratos and atres get their own xp separately. whereas in the 2018 it was a sort of combined thing and you could use the points to upgrade attacks and whatnot. so this is interesting to see that they are changing up the formula just a little. and i am so excited to learn the story of this one. i have played 2018's gow a bunch and have beat the main story at least twice. so i am very excited to see where kratos and atreus go next.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"after two huge releases with 30fps, it's wonderful to see a new major great looking game running 60fps"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-05,can't wait!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"great before you buy guys, just a few days to go now, ive been waiting for this one!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"are there hard bosses like sigrun? that's what i'm most concerned about as those fights are fun as hell. also, is it harder or just as hard as give me god of war?"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,that arkham knight video still holds up sir. still one of my favorite games. batman sim. keep it up
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,i so cant wait to play this on wednesday!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,"they cracked the code with combat in 2018?! i'm sorry, but i legitimately had to laugh at this. no offense. i usually agree with your takes, but in this case, the code was cracked in 2005. i was obsessed with the originals on ps2, to the point that i can still remember them pretty clearly. with the reboots, it seems to me like instead of cracking the code this time around, they lost the cipher entirely. i put maybe ten hours at most into gow 2018 precisely because combat is so utterly stilted, lumbering, nonintuitive, and stale compared to the originals. gow should've remained an arcadestyle hackslash."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-11,just pre ordered on steam so as usual gotta watch before you buy immediately after buying a game
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"i know these before you buys are a long standing tradition for you guys but i think this is definitely one of those before you buys that should be an after you buy. maybe that's just me, anyways keep up the great work guys!"

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-20,"there is no need for this video cuz we all already know that this game is truly amazing and worth every penny! i preordered the game as soon as it was available, and beat it 2 days ago. all i can say is a masterpiece!"

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-09-14,"esta pelea entre thor y kratos debe estar en la cima de todas las peleas, espero por lo menos 3 rounds en el juego, claramente kratos rompiendole la madre al fina con su mismo martillo, va ser epico."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-10-06,"se me ocurre una teora algo loca pero que puede tener algo de sentido con la escena de atreus y skoll y hati. por lo que se dijo en el juego anterior se sabe que los dioses vanir experimentaron con la magia temporal, la cual afect directamente al sol y la luna, lo cual deja en claro una relacin entre el flujo temporal y la salida del sol y la luna, adems tambin tenemos el ejemplo de odn liberando a los lobos para que persigan al sol y la luna y as controlar los tiempos para el ragnarok. teniendo esto en cuenta yo pienso que el eclipse que se ve puede ser el propio inicio de ragnarok y el plan maestro de atreus sera encontrar a los lobos para que vuelvan a perseguir el sol y la luna pero en vez de hacerlo de este hacia el oeste, podra invertirlo de esta manera alterara el flujo temporal provocando una vuelta al pasado y dando pie a que el kratos y atreus fueron los que tocaron el cuerno de la serpiente el gow 2018 probablemente atreus quiera cambiar algo del pasado con la ayuda del jormungandr de hace 3 aos para cambiar el ragnarok, podra ser bastante interesante explorar esa posibilidad. por cierto si alguno le interesa estoy subiendo el gow 2018 en mi canal en preparacin al prximo gow ragnarok que se se viene dentro de poco, se agradecera el apoyo."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-09-14,"que increble la tecnologa grfica, parti jugando gow en ps2 y ahora ver lo que se puede generar es increble, parece pelcula. grande kratos!!!"

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-09-15,es hermoso el detalle de cmo se va iluminando la luna a medida que el sol cae d
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-09-14,"en efecto, es cine"

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,900 the dauntless shield has the ability to redirect projectiles. i've been perfect parrying the grims' acid projectiles in svartlfheim using the dauntless shield.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-14,"i used the stonewall shield for a bit, but found that it ended up leaving me worse off in the long run. i learned bad habits and while its more challenging, i would recommend the dauntless as it forces you to really perfect your skills"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,this is the perfect content i need as i play the game  no one does it like jor!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,dang great tip at 244 i did not know you could get even more xp by killing every single one instead of going straight for the main burrow kill lol
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-17,"jorraptor i have loved your content for the past few years, i followed your assassins creed guides and now your gow youre a great asset to the gaming community keep up the work!!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-23,"900 the dauntless shield does redirect enemy projectiles, it just doesnt have the same animation as the guardian shield. the projectile bounces off as opposed to kratos throwing it."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,just getting home with my copy from gamestop. i've not been this pumped for a game in a long time.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,i got it this afternoon and this game is amazing i already asked for a day off at work tomorrow 4 hours so far it aint enough to enjoy the marvelous game

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,im glad im not the only one who failed with the dauntless shield
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-06-26,you can parry yellow attacks when the stone wall shield is fully charged to avoid getting staggered. it helps when doing boss fights
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,can't wait to get home to play this game. one of the best game ever. i have all the god of war games
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,"love your videos, so much help. keep doing your thing"

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,"i absolutely love the fact that more and more, game developers are becoming accommodating for people with accessibility needs. it's such a positive change that impacts so many people. that being said, i can't understand why anyone without the need would change those options in game. like... i feel like you're robbing yourself of an integral part of the game. those qtes and button prompts keep the game play experience flowing. it keeps you engaged. i just don't get why someone would be like, i can't be bothered with that button press, i'm getting my mind right so i can press more buttons in a few seconds."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,super amazing content on this video extremely helpful. thank you so much for this. this is the type of stuff i look for on youtube.

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-16,"now this is an actual helpful video, unlike certain other videos out there use evade on bosses, use runic attacks on cooldown, use the environment lol?"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,i just started an hour ago but im not a fan of the new menu. maybe im not used to it yet. thanks for the tips
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-23,to the low amount of people that maybe are just starting to play the game like me . i have notice trough much dying of my own  the boss fights specially the ones where they come out of the blue hole . much of those fights are conditioned to small area for the fight those making it difficult to maneuver and i have found useful to map the are in my mind so not to get stuck with a wall behind me and not being able to jump back anymore .
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-31,all killer no filler! lovin the preset changes!!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-13,amazingly helpful video as always!!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,already loving the game on the ps5!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-14,i am loving the game so far. though i have run into a bug. where my game does not allow me to lower the difficulty level.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,my ps5 will be here tonight and i can't wait to make this my first game on a next gen console
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-13,finished the story now working on 100 .i really enjoyed the game
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,is there a setting to change when you press the attack button it brings out your weapon instead of just punching?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-03,really wish games could hold my attention longer if at all anymore this one and rdr2 do that for me
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-05,"great video, i subscribed.."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,"i find the dauntless shield parrying is satisfying, so i'm just using that one"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,started it last night 3hrs in hooked already
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,being able to set it to automatically pick up loot is so much better
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-15,excluded myself from any content from gow content downloading the game now im diving head deep down the gow ragnarock ice berg to re enforce my purchase
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,i just assumed skills didn't get credit since you don't get xp. thank you this will be extremely helpful
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-09-14,"i swear the dauntless, star, and guardian shield shot back projectiles....didn't use the stonewall. but now i might."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-12,should i really be upgrading anything gear wise during play? or should i just use what gear is leveled up until end game? or does that even make sense?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-20,i'm convinced jorraptor is just kaptain kuba doing an impression of borat.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,i dominated the hateful with parry. it works so well in this game
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-13,the dauntless shield redirects projectiles too
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-14,i had no idea r3 points you in the right direction. woulda come in handy.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,it took a bit to get used to the control change. but its really good after practice.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,tbh just changing the camera speed is much easier than the quick turn. have mine turned up to 9 and i turn around just as fast
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-18,"i am on my 2 play through and found out that u cant skip cutscenes . also any news on new game  i seem to remember that new game  was added to bow 2018 like 4 months later, do u think it will be the same for ragnark?"

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,"so hard. want to watch the game, while saving up to playing. don't want any spoilers. but so far the game looks beyond epic. even more open world then the last game. can't wait."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,"youre the goat for the nest trick, fuckin awesome. also whenever you find it, go over the starshatter shield you hold guard to generate a full charge"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-16,my duanleas shield was sending ranged attacks back when parried
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-13,"i love your content man, but is says  best start in the title so there shouldnt have to be so much gameplay of the game later on"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-14,just got it so waiting for the download to be done
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-17,the dauntless shield also can deflect proteticles to the enemies
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-21,can you start the game over after you beat it with all weapons.????
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,i have voice cues turned off in my game but there are still certain times in the game it will give me voice cues like when using the blades to burn through the smoke stacks during the first side quest in the dwarf area and i can not figure out how to turn it off
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,"the game has been downloaded on my ps5 for a couple day's now, unfortunately i won't be able to dive into it until this weekend. working 2 jobs sucks balls, thanks for the helpful tips"

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,i can't see anything in tunnels and caves or dark areas. is this meant for the game? i've tried messing with settings and hdr settings but i can't seem to lighten up dark areas in the game

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-20,death can have me when it earns me legendary line from kratos editholy hell 800 likes??
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,fate only binds if you let it. 401 starts playing do what is necessary. not because it is written. mjlnir and leviathan clashes we will make our own destiny. words that are now carved in stone. see you all at day 9 waves
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,the clash of thor''s hammer and krato's leviathan axe at the end of this track is like the clash between unicron and primus another pair of gods in a familiar franchise
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-07,"a fierce warrior, a killer made a hero, a man made a god, a god made a father and master, a master and a father made a legend"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-12,loki will go atreus...atreus remains proceeds to cry
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-10,kratos theme 238 faye's theme 250 atreus theme
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-25,"2018s theme adventurous, hopefull, a story of a god in exile ragnaroks theme deathly, sound of a war cry, a story of a god picking up the torch and leading an army into battle"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-14,"no spoilers just beat the game and man i got nothing to say but goty. the bond between atreus and kratos the story, the ending, the side characters, twists, soundtrack, themes were all amazing. thank you santa monica"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-08-15,"053 . absolute goosebumps . the way this theme perfectly sums up the story is incredible. i feel like it matches kratoss nobleness as a warrior, harsh when necessary, but also just and most importantly his love for his son"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,"does any one else have like chills in this part? 050 like, the trumpets hits, the percussion gets harder, idk this song is legendary edit lol 1k thanks"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"419 i could hear the sound of kratos and thor battle screams as they throw their weapons, which collide each one with another... magical."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,"between bear mccreary, michael giacchino, ramin djawadi we really are in a golden age of composing"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-23,"this is a perfect main theme for this game. its so epic but so symbolic. it starts out dark and menacing but goes into a heroic and melancholy sound whenever the female faye choir kicks in to symbolize kratos suppressing his nature and settling down and living with his deed of killing his previous family. when the female choir leaves it goes back to dark and menacing symbolizing her death. but then a bit later fayes theme comes in and combines with kratoss to create atreuss theme. after a while of kratos and atreuss theme playing, fayes choir starts singing along with kratoss theme symbolizing that shes with him even in death"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-05,"was thinking wow, this is great, then 238 hit me like a truck. also, never noticed while watching the trailers, but the choir chants ragnark at 419. nice touch."

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-18,major magical feels from 349  355. when the gates were opening with this song going off it felt like some culmination of endgameharry potter its own thing all at once.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-23,i wish i could play this game for the first time again. this was truly one of the best experiences i've had
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-20,"i really love how fayes theme gets blended into this eventually, i think its really touching after playing through the game"

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,this theme is the definition of how powerful music can be
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-06-19,that was the shortest 4 minutes of my entire life. masterpiece.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,237 i love how they added a bit of faye's theme. i hope we get to see her in the game somehow!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-02,wow! can hear that the tones are much stronger but this part 236 is truly well done. feels refreshing with what i assume fayes voice
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-28,"brother, what did you see back there ? a path. one i never imagined. from the dreaded god of war, to the wisest and beloved god of protection."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-22,"the way this soundtrack just sends chills down your spine, the thumping of the drums just makes you think war"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-14,"this is so beautiful  it's genius how the theme matured from just being kratos' song to now including his wife and son. 233 kratos' song being the main anchor, 238 faye's song joins him, followed lastly 250 atreus' new theme a son's path completes it. kudos to this masterpiece of a game."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-04,"that slow pace at 340 makes it that much more powerful, that much more heroic. i imagine an incredible act of redemption, victory over his own shadow, the power of sacrifice and a long war not with enemies, but with himself. it's amazing how many things that minute conveys. i love it"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"to merge kratos's deep, cold, cynical, determined, epic and now matured, almost legendary theme with faye's theme  her angelic and voice, especially at 236 into this spectacular composition is something i could only wish for, 4 years back into gow2018. bear mccreary, has done it once again.  ragnark is almost upon us..."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-03,you cant improve on perfection  bear mccreary hold my mead
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-05,"kratos is probably gonna go down as one of the greatest video game protagonists of all time. hes been through so much, throughout so many years. this ost brought out so much emotion in me as it made me reflect on the character and how far hes come since 2005. i cant wait to see how his norse saga ends ragnork awaits"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-25,he became a god he became a father he become an allfather
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-13,"235 you can hear the main theme belonging to kratos, then faye's team enters, resulting in atreus's theme! such magnificent work from bear mccreary"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-20,this song brings out the strength of a man the grace of a women and the adventure of a child...what a beautiful mixture of sound
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-02,"god of wars soundtrack feels like a battle hymn! ancient, powerful, and unstoppable. its like you can feel the weight of kratos journey in every note. id love to hear more cinematic metal takes on this!"

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-02,"i have no words for this bear mceary you are the underrated goat of music. this music actually made me want to cry and scream screams of excitement, joy, anticipation i dont know what to say its just beautiful. this is not a joke im being serious wallahi."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,they merged mother's theme 239 ragnarok vibe 401 amazing work as usual. this theme feels like everybody is matured now
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,the second half and especially the ending will never fail to give me goosebumps and chills.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,i remember the announcement with the live band for the reveal of god of war and it was amazing and not everyone was completely sure what the game was until we saw kratos. great times
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,i want this to be played in my funeral and no one is allowed to leave until it is over
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,dare i say it...this theme just might be better than the main skyrim theme  and i've held that theme in high regard for a very long time.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,230 had me in tears.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,this soundtrack makes you go from man to god

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,"holy cow, .. the crescendo of the melody change in this part is making me goosebumps 356"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-14,this version of song is more heroic then the previous games. which symbolises kratos evolution from a monster to a hero... they really done themselves with the character development of kratos and atreus alike.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,this theme has the entire family of themes  kratos's theme  memories of motherfaye's theme  a son's path atreus's theme combined into one legendary ost. literally brought tears to my eyes

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"i'm honestly speechless... i've never thought the 2018 theme can be beaten but i was proved wrong! this is so epic in every aspect, completely in sync with the characters and how they've grown  matured since the last game. last night when i heard it i was tearing up i was in complete shock. i can't even describe how incredible this theme is. bear mccreary, you've done it again!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-07-29,when i finished the game i felt empty like i lost apart of me the story was just amazing and so entertaining the deaths the drama the grief really drove me into the story
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,"spoilers 052 is one of the best scenes in gaming, the music and the introduction of kratos's new spear is just mind blowing!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,"this game deserves, no...this franchise deserves some award, idk what award it can get but for sure it deserves most of it. masterpiece"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-05,047 that change is insane
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,i love that fayes theme also kicks in through this because faye told kratos that she will always be a part of him and he will always be a part of her.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-20,i went into this game 100 spoilerfree and when i heard the female vocals in the battle songs for the first time i knew i recognized it!! hearing eivr in such a masterpiece of a game feels like the stars have aligned!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-09,this totally deserves best sound track of the year

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-07,"i am a monster, but i am your monster no longer gives me chills"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,"338 onwards hits different, for me at least. i can't stop hearing this part with a mashup with gate to olympus in my imagination as bear mccreary did with faye's soundtrack in this track. that was the track which tones consistently played throughout gow greek era and i always considered that as his hero theme. and i imagined that because those tones will fit so perfectly, also because the blades made a comeback so...i think a tribute to one of his old theme would be nice to hear in this soundtrack, as he's more of a hero now, not a monster. gate to olympus httpsyoutu.bew9mfce6vbau the notes repeat, even in gerard marino's end of vengeance timestamp 321 httpsyoutu.be4foyhb5x0pk"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-06-13,game of year for me is this! this soundtrack is one of the best soundtracks in the gaming world.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,337 everytime i get goosebumps man i cant explain it
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-13,"233 i like particulary this part of the track. faye theme joins the theme of kratos. her theme dissapears but the chorus of the theme stays and join kratos, becoming a part of it. like the character they represent, she is ni longer there, but she is a part of kratos now."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-03,im not sure how you managed to make a better version of the gow 2018 theme bear mccreary but you did it. oh my sweet god this is an absolute banger that gets me even more excited for the game. i cannot wait to play it. thank you bear mccreary for delivering an even more amazing ost.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-10,"this is the greatest thing i have ever heard in my 31 years on this planet. coincidentally, gow ragnarok is also the greatest game i have ever played, second only to its 2018 predecessor."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-29,best part of this entire thing is that distracting the beast and defeating it was kratos' idea of dangerous. fighting it head first is his safe game plan.

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,the fact they knew someone would continue throwing the axe at the chime and made extra dialog just for it proves they know their audience. excellent.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,the squirrel of war was such a good addition. kojima has really nailed it once again
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-07,i absolutely love when the troll boss makes its first appearance in that cutscene and kratos instantly chops its head off. thats the santa monica team basically looking right into the camera and saying we heard you
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,"i love how you finally meet a mini boss that is from the last game and you don't even fight it, you straight up execute it"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"finally, a dunkey and prozd crossover episode. even if sung won didn't know he was in it."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-04,"the thing that is the most impressive to me is the sheer amount of fucking dialogue in this game. theres so many little lines they added to keep you immersed and make the characters seem real. like whenever mimir is telling a story but you get out of the boat before he finishes, he has a specific line for this specific story about the specific part of the story you left off at. they couldve easily just had some plain line like oh what were we talking about again? but they put so much work into this so that youre never annoyed by lines repeated until infinity. except for when atreus asks if bifrosted is a word"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,one of my favorite parts of the game is how much effort they put into the dialogue for when characters are just wandering around and exploring. mimir telling stories and bantering with atreus and kratos makes exploring feel somehow more real than in other games where you are following objectives and quest markers.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-03,"in this game, the plot i i give up. the way this is delivered and edited  pure comedy."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"as goofy as it is, that interaction with the squirrel guy and the chimes is a great way to handle repeating events in a game. instead of saying nothing or repeating the same phrase, he adds onto what he said previously. it may seem like a small detail but a lot of games miss out on the small things like that and it's just nice to see the extra thought they put into their game"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,i agree. this game deserves the aaa title. it's super polished and carefully curated. excellent performance as well.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-28,i love how dunkey said the names of different characters with ease
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-04,the fact they anticipated the squirrel chime interaction is just amazing.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"truly a calm and reasonable review, thanks duntos."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,i absolutely love the fact that you can have atreus shoot at the little spiders and other creatures on the wall and actually kill them. i've played so many video games where there are things on a wall and you can't interact with them at all. they added so many little things like that to the game and it's incredible!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"you know that when there is little to no sarcasm and lots of praise in one of dunkeys reviews, its a god damn good game."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-07,"god of warragnarok being god of war 2 and 3 is the best way to describe it. going into it completely blind gave me an absolutely magical experience. one of the best video games i've ever gotten the joy to experience. so thankful to simply be alive for this era of gaming, there's so much beauty being released and discovered as of late."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,it is truly inspiring to see more games learn from knack 2 just like god of war has done. what an absolute masterpiece!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,dunkey being happy with a new game warms my heart
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-28,"453  545 absolutely incredible. when a reviewer's sheer joy over a work of art spills over into his editing, it proves that there was something special there. that emotional payoff of 5 minutes of buildup makes this reivew high art. gotdamn!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-30,"without spoilers, there's a bit where you're told to leave while 2 other characters talk. there's am interact button to eavesdrop and if you keep doing it, it's hilarious because they know youre eavesdropping. at one point they're like did you know that they'd be so weird? and this is getting awkward"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"530 the combination of the visuals and the music gave me chills. great editing, dunk."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,odin's voice actor richard schiff doesn't get enough love. stellar performance. my personal favorite in the game.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,this game really makes you feel like a real chime ringer. 1010 chime of the year
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-04,540 that is legit one of the coldest moments in gaming cutscene history
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"growing up my dad was always the one who got me into video games at such a young age. we have a special bond when it comes to this series, the second one came out a day after his birthday which felt so poetic and we just finished it. something about this game and dunkys review makes me so damn emotional. i know this is one of those games that change my view of life and grew such a connection between me and my dad i will always come back to it. what a magnificent peice of art"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,man. when dunkey really likes a game it so good to hear how he explains it. i love it
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,havent played the game but it sounds like sung won nailed it with the squirrel character. his vocal range is so fun to hear
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,god this review with the inclusion of those shots of kratos hugging with faye and atreus separately made me genuinely tear up all over again. no single game will probably make me as emotionally exhausted as this game did. santa monica absolutely knocked it out the park and i cannot wait to see what they do next.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"this is my third game that engrossed me so much that i couldn't help but go for the platinum trophy. 45 hours later and not a single part of this game disappoints. the ability for the developers to create such an engrossing personal story and weave it into a significantly larger narrative with such satisfying gameplay is still astounding to me. i can't wait to see what sony santa monica does next and i hope this game serves as a benchmark that future developers strive to meet, like the last of us was in 2013"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,no game has ever blown me away like this. just the attention to details and the amount of clutter and assets that were made. and how well it performs on last gen. it's mindblowing
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-04,"the 535 moment actually gave me goosebumps im sad to admit, i havent even played ragnarok. wonderful video as ever dunkey"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"man nothing gives me chills like that score, so beautiful, so expansive, it truly conveys the beauty of the god of war universe, and how far kratos has come as a father"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,dunkey stopping hitting the chime after the squirrel screamed had me dying
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,every one of your reviews manages to introduce and elaborate on each of your ideas so cohesively in such a small amount of time while still having comedy throughout. you've been the best in your field for years never stop.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-16,yo why am i tearing up as dunkey is finishing off the review with the montage of kratos holding faye and then holding atreus. 520
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"spoiler as a someone who played the original games, the last scene where kratos sees him being worshiped as a god of peace brought a tear to my eye. dude started off jumping off a cliff because he saw himself as irredeemable to someone people look up to is just beautiful.another indomitable human spirit moment. ragnorok is one of my favorite games."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"even the dunkey cut of ragnarok got me with the chills. its absolutely amazing and its one of the few games i wish i can go back to and experience it for the first time again. honestly the worst parts of the games were the slow traversal parts that are intentionally placed to slow you down in between load segments. its a ps4 game at heart, and i cant imagine how much better the flow would have been without those segments."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"the cauldron battle really was dope but the wolffox sequence was so lightheartedly serene, i loved those moments that broke up the action"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,repeatedly throwing the axe at the chime was one of my favorite things i've done in a video game. definitely got a respect point and a laugh out of me.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"the final scene between kratos and atreus hit me as hard as a real life event, and having never played any of the gow games in the past, i still felt like i understood kratos' journey and how far he had come when looking at that last mural. it had me choking up. the acting, score, and direction are simply better than a vast majority of films."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,death can have me when it earns me is one of the best lines written anywhere.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,that squirrels outburst at the end made this a mastapiece on its own
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-30,there is more artistry in some of dunkey's videos than there is on entire youtube channels.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,dunkeys videos are like art man i could listen to this guy talk about the games he loves forever
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-03,"the nidhog boss fight is probably the most visually stimulating and brilliantly crafted giant monster type boss fight to ever exist. this game is beautiful, brutal, emotional and just fucking wonderful."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"ragnark is genuinely one of the hardesttoputdown games ive played in a long time. if given the opportunity to play it for the first time again, i would take it instantly."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-29,the amount of additional dialogue for specific scenarios or gameplay is amazing.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,that edit with dunkey saying goddamn immediately being followed by the three ba ba bas gave me fucking chills.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-02,dunkey really does a better job promoting games than actual game promoters. his excitement when explaining the game he likes really is contagious 6.510 not enough knack
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-15,"i've watched dunkey's video multiple times. twice before i got the game, one after i got this game as a gift, another after completing the story. what a masterpiece."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-30,you know it's a great game when dunkey doesn't rate it
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"i platinum'd it with 100 completion at 56 hours 3 days ago.... by far the best, most complete and refined game i have ever played. i physically miss playing it, new game cannot come soon enough!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,the squirrel's response to repeatedly beating the chimes is a nice and funny touch. i think all other games i've seen just have the character stand there.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,my favorite part of dunkviews positive ones anyway is the montages he puts at the end theyre always well edited and capture the way i feel about a game. this and the jazz montage form gow 4 are my favorite.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-12,"just finished the game today, been waiting to watch this till i finished and god damn it was a great finish"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"530 one of the best moments in a dunkey video ever, great review"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-29,"that part kratos cuts the troll's head off was such a good nod and fist bump to the player. gow 2018 was great, but it had too many of those bastards."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"the whole monologue after 440 with music in the background ending in this fantastic crescendo was so fucking amazing i almost forgot it's still dunkey speaking, instead of some motivational speaker trying to get me to live one more day for the sake of life's beauty."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,ive been waiting for this. thank you dunkey from the bottom of my heart
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-28,the editing in this video is top tier  great job dunkey last minute or two in particular
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"everytime dunkey uploads, he delivers not only in the technical side of things, but also with what he says in the videos. this man makes me laugh too much without even trying"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-17,this game and the breaking bad finale are the only times in recent memory that a story made me cry.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"this game had moments that will be remembered and looked back upon for years to come. incredible stuff from the music, to the beautiful visuals, to the scale. havent felt like a game story was such an epic event in years. feels like halo 3 in terms of the bombast and grandeur and grace in its execution"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-06,"not only did they nail the characterization of the gods themselves, but they tied everything into the actual mythos very well. everything from the subtle details on the walls to the plot points that originally seem to be oneoff parts of the story. as someone who has played god of war since the first game, i was blown away by not only the attention to detail and respect for kratos' past but how they also made this character with nothing but blind rage into an interesting, wise, moral, and realistic human being. mastapeece. the climbing does really suck, though"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"i am 52 hours in, and still playing. there's content to play specifically for after the ending of the main story. it's so damn good."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-28,"apart from the already obvious and many times mentioned things great about this game, the extra dialogues as you've shown with ratataskr here and the attention to detail is what makes it truly a triple a game. you can feel their passion, and that in turns create a fun game. also, it actually surprised me, seeing a damn huge game without a single game breaking bug. also, the reason why i wanted for there to be 2 goty awards given out this year."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"i've been waiting for this forever, like a calm and reasonable person"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-01,"ive played many games. but its been so long since ive felt such emotional weight emanating from the story, the characters, and the music. there are a few life lessons that i will take, being a father now and wanting to be a better man. cant believe im saying this, but ragnaok has now become one of my top 3 games of all time. i hope more people will play this game and find things they can take away from this journey. god damn!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,there is nothing more amazing then seeing dunkey throw away the memes for a small section of his video and really go into deep and enriching talk about how good a game really is thats when you know your game is good. when dunkey really takes a second to speak from the heart and show how amazing a game really is
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-05,"in my 30 years of gaming, this is the best game i've ever played. a true masterpiece."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"the traversal, where you are climbing in long areas is actually a trick. the game is unloading and loading assets to avoid loading screens. there are a lot of little tricks it uses to get away from them. they usually use those times to insert dialogue or world building. it is honestly genius and probably a nightmare to design."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-04,i literally just got to the end credits and all i have to say is what an amazing video game and what an amazing video!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,536 got me shedding a tear no story will ever be held this near to my heart. im going to miss wondering how it will end.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,the fact that prozd voices the squirrel makes it even better
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-28,the story was perfect to me and that intro was the best intro ive seen in a video game and it was so epic. everything really felt like a movie for each cutscene for me
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-06,i have just watched 10 hours of god of war content to watch this video gow 2018 and ragnarok. love you dunkey
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"what's hilarious about 116 is that if this game was bad, this clip would be presented in a bad light. but because the game is phenomenal, it is presented in a humorous light. the duality of dunk."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-29,"this game might not be high art, but it is high entertainment this is well said mr. dunko. i think this is a good way to look at what triple a games bring to the table"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-16,when i heard they were finishing up the story of this god of war series with 2 games i was skeptical. the first was so good but i didn't see how they'd tie up all the story threads and still make a satisfactory ending but here we are. they did it with ease.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-08-15,this is my favorite dunk video. it show's his incredible ability to review games while making it entertaining. i've watched this video numerous times because it makes me feel like i'm getting to enjoy the game all over again. the editing is second to none as well. thanks dunkey for making a video to put in my favorites and come back to whenever i want to relive the feelings of one of my favorite games.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,this man always makes a perfect review. every line feels like a perfectly refined punch line.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"honestly the last scene is the highest acknowledgement dunkey ever gave to a game, it looks like he's once again showing something goofy, but at the end the game actually was prepared for dunkey's behavior. so dunkey includes the footage without comment, as a nod."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-28,"when i finished the game and the credits rolled, i was highly impressed, then i played more untill the real credits rolled along with the huge emotional weight of the scene and then i head blood upon a snow. it's was truly a masterpiece."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-06,i like that you show brok coming in the house when you say incredible cast
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"the only thing that was missing was appreciation of the gorgeous music that filled the world with life and culture. from the epic crescendo of the main score that gives me chills every time i hear it, to the quick rhythm of combat jigs, every piece of music completes a realm's atmosphere. bear mccreary really outdid himself this time."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"i loved the part where atreus said maybe the god of war was the friends we made along the way, truly, a 1010 game"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"as the credits rolled, really felt like i was saying goodbye to old friends"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-07,this game really makes you feel like emotions.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"it may not be high art, but it is high entertainment this is it. this is the sentence ive been looking for, whenever i want to describe a game or a show that isnt particularly lifechanging or thematically deep, but theres so much entertainment value that comes out of simply enjoying it, in one way or another"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-28,this game really makes you feel like being annoyed at your companions for telling you what to do within 3 seconds of trying to solve a puzzle.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,my favorite part was the part where kratos sat down and ate with his friends. if you told me a 5 years ago that would be a scene in a god of war game i would have thought you were crazy.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,the god damn with the theme returning for the matched cuts gave me serious goose bumps
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"this is a public service announcement if you beat this game and stopped playing there, boot the game back up and do the postgame sidequest in svartalfheim. the ending of this game is honestly masterful. it is so rare to see any story end as perfectly and confidently as ragnarok's."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"i'm even more hyped to play this now. also, i always considered the first fourth game's story to be impressive because it was so good despite being based on such a simple concept. very excited to see them break out of that for the sequel"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,when i finished this game. i actually went and gave my dad a hug. made me realise the sacrifices he made to keep me safe.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-01,i was not expecting to be sobbing in the first 10 minutes but hey here we are
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-29,"i love dunkey reviews, but it definitely hits different in a good way when you get this type of review. love it!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,0336 we finally got ot see the crossover between dunkey and prozd.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"236 not sure if he misprounced jungle or if gungle is a real tree in mythology, but dunkey saying it just made it funny for me. favorite youtuber by far, keep up the good work dunk"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-04,right from its opening shot... you mean from the beginning of its only shot. i love love love how these games are presented in a long take a la halflife.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-10-06,207 kratos eres una persona tranquila y sensata kratos 500 aos anteszeus tu hijo ha vuelto y con la destruccin del olimpo
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-05-03,"248 me encanta como, durante todo el triler, solamente se escucha msica, pero cuando tyr se levanta, estando frente a frente con kratos, es que suena el tema de god of war, siendo ellos mismos la representacin fsica del dios de la guerra en ambas mitologas."

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-11-10,"joer, lo que me encanta de estas entregas a diferencia de las entregas anteriores es que se siente fresco con el ingreso de un aliado como lo es su hijo, y una especie de consejero y gua como lo es mimir, a parte de un kratos maduro pero sabiendo que si se desata como antes, l solo puede acabar con ambas partes en el ragnarok."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-02-25,"lleva mas de 2 aos, sin duda el mejor juego que he probado y visto, la cinematica cuando toca el cuerno... la mejor de todos los juegos"

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-30,"las voces de los personajes kratossu voz es genial como siempre. atreusal principio dije queee? pero luego me convenci. mimir,brok y sindrisublimes y thor ms o menos"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-11-24,esa voz de kratos que transmite respeto..
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-30,"amigo la voz de kratos es la mejor sin duda, le sienta bien a su personalidad, buen trabajo del actor que lo viene doblando desde 2018, y la de atreus tambien es muy buena al igual que la de mimir"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-03-14,"ser muy honesto, el gow 1 y el gow 3 solo los jugu un poco porque los play en los que los jugu no eran mos, pero por lo poco que los jugu me encantaron, recin me compr una play 4 y jugu el gow 4 y qued fascinado, tanto que investigu y me adentr en la historia de los gow anteriores para conocer el trasfondo de todo, y la verdad me encant, ahora estoy super emocionado por el estreno de gow ragnarok como muchsimos aqu."

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-30,"como siempre, la voz de kratos es epiquisima. y muy buenas elecciones por parte de la voces de atreus y thor. playstation siempre se luce con el doblaje en latino!!!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-30,"me encant la evolucin de voz de atreus, y la edicin en este trailer captura perfectamente la escencia del triler original!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-10-02,"deja de pensar como un padre y empieza a pensar como un general  1. matan a todo su ejrcito y en un acto de desesperacin le da su alma a un dios que lo esclavizaria para siempre. 2. por andar destruyendo ciudades con su nuevo ejrcito y contagiar a los dioses con los males del mundo, lo terminan traicionando y matando, para colmo en la bsqueda de venganza termina matando al nico soldado sobreviviente. creo que tiene razones de sobra para no hacerlo xd"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-06-07,"me lo he pasado, y platinado y aun me pone caliente este trailer"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-30,que buenas voces carajos. me siento orgulloso del nuevo voz de atreus.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-30,esto si es digno de un dios como idzi dutkiewicz.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2021-09-30,"que hermoso el doblaje, me gust el cambio de la voz de atreus debido a su crecimiento, igual su voz de infante era buena."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-08-24,que bueno que volvieron los actores de doblaje del juego anterior. y la nueva voz de atreus es increble queda muy bien con la nueva madurez y crecimiento que tiene en este juego
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-13,"they did a terrific job with young kratos, you can see his rage even in silence. looks like he's ready to kill at all times"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-13,you know a character has completed their development and gone full circle once they have their own shakespearean monologue about themselves.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-23,love how they formatted this as a long monologue like in ancient greek plays. great call back to kratos recalling greek tradition.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-18,went from a guy just killin shit to a guy killin shit with purpose
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-13,young kratos is literally the dude who can stare into your soul
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-13,"this is exactly what pandora wanted for kratos since gow 3. for him to finally understand the power of hope. its not just a power, it's a deeper understanding. for kratos to finally accept himself"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-13,idk if its me but young kratos is terrifying and older kratos makes me feel safe
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-21,"305 i love this moment, when young kratos lowers his hand and stares harder, like hes going say it. tell me what i am, and what you are. tell me, kratos tell yourself"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-12,"i like to think that young kratos had no words for his older self. for better or worse, he's still part of him. a reminder of his cruelty and foolishness, but also a reminder of how even that young kratos wound up changing."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-27,"it's just a free dlc, you don't need to try too hard. writes the most beautiful monologue since the days of shakespeare."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-18,when kratos speaks softly it's almost like a whimper. it's incredible how kratos was brought to life in every emotion besides rage with christopher judge.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-27,135 20 gunmen and agent ross waiting on the other side
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-17,"243 i absolutely love that it's only when he recalls pandora's words to him that he reaches a turning point. before freya, before mirnir, before atreus, and even before faye, there was someone else who was able to speak to the humanity within kratos, hidden under all the rage and pain and that was pandora. it's been hundreds of years since the destruction of the greek pantheon, but kratos still remembers her last words to him. that's beautiful, man."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-21,i love how much kratos cares for his friends now especially mimir when he almost accidentally killed him bc of being tricked he sounded genuinely scared. the bond of the two of them is amazing.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-16,"the symbolism is so strong. him talking to his hatred,his pride, his arrogance who had control, confronting it. by the end he accepts what he did and who he was, but is no longer. he took full control and literally took the seat of control showing that it no longer is the driving force within him and has no more power over him."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-03,145 so nostalgic song
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-26,tyr is that therapist we so desperately need.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-13,"i love the lesson here. its the classic you cant get rid of something that essentially part of who you. all you can do is accept, but also remember to be better than what you once was or expect to be. thats the only way to find peace and how you can move forward"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-12,kratos talking to his younger self was so emotional
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-05,bro finally ended the long war happening within him.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-23,"i really appreciate the line kratos says that young kratos was always more than what others said he was. acknowledging that the character was always deep, not just a mindless action power fantasy character even during the older"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-06,love how mimir smiles when kratos says that hell like to sit for awhile. mimir witnessed a man come to terms with himself and cant be happier
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-04-12,"kratos was alone the first time he sat on the throne, now he is with a friend"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-07-27,tyr holding that punch like it was nothing 004
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-16,"whats a tad freaky to me is that young kratos is reacting to what is being said. hes not just some avatar for kratos to yell at. when kratos says there is no forgiving you. you chose!, you can see his lip curl. this is really digging deep into kratos mind. that this part of him is still there and so, so angry and hurt. but he has finally learned to temper it, to harness it for something good."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-18,"young kratos' body language is so subtle, yet it says so much. when kratos enters, he's tired, and bored, and hollow. his throne has given him nothing and taken everything, and he's unimpressed by the man he will eventually become as he's lectured. he's young and arrogant, and doesn't believe he needs to hear what he's being told, like a petulant teenager. when kratos approaches him and begins to chastise him, his lip curls and he sits up, staring kratos down, and it even gives kratos pause. when kratos begins to scold his past self for his decisions, he sets his jaw and stares right through kratos, totally unimpressed as kratos realizes that they were still his decisions, no matter how much he's changed. after kratos realizes that he needs to accept his past and forgive himself, we can't see what young kratos does. it's easy to believe that he merely disappeared off screen, but honestly? i'd like to imagine he got sick of kratos monologuing and simply got up and walked away to sulk somewhere else."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-17,one thing god of war as a franchise has that many others do not have in their newest instalments respect for what brought them to where they are now. this is true fan service
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-03,0011 lowkey thought he said hard fart
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-04-14,"when i was a young teen playing god of war, it was an outlet for all my anger and angst. now i'm a father playing god of war and feeling it dig into what it means to grow as a person. kratos grew up with his audience."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-13,"at the end, kratos grabbing mimir from nothing was hilarious. kratos just accepts valhalla doing its thing and doesnt question it"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-02,"ironically, believing yourself to be damned and still choosing to do the right thing anyway is one of the most heroic things i can imagine."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-06,613 pov me finding that one chair thath was really cormoftable i used when i was a kid
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-13,"i was expecting a fight, but this feels so much more appropriate, kratos has moved past times where he solved every problem with violence, still uses it obviously, but only when he has to, he's grown and now confronts what is before him instead of just beating it to bloody bits."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-19,"it's pretty fucking crazy that when mimir reappears you can see how light and at peace kratos is. that little smirk, the way he leans back. the animation is really top tier here, in a free dlc. crazy shit."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-12,was hoping to hear t.c. carson voice young kratos again.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-28,this is a conversation every man should have with himself.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-13,"what remained was hope, which you chose to release back to the world a testament to cory barlog bringing this franchise back to life, as far as im concerned. thank you, cory."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-13,"young kratos eyes make him look 10x scarier, kinda like how anakins eyes looked when he turned to the dark side"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-26,this is what mike tyson feels like
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-24,the scene where he says but i have hope while his lips trembled touched me deeply with this little move the character gives all his emotion which he accoured at al series to player. masterpiece
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-13,"i love that they took the time to completely model a younger kratos, he looks so damn good. possible next gen remakes for the older gows incoming??"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-13,kinda hoped to hear young kratos talk but this is just as good he finally came full circle
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-23,"finished valhalla and this got me into so much emotion. played this game since the start of the series in 2005. character development at it's finest. santa monica. thank you for closing 2023 with this. it felt like this scenes was the final scene for kratos' redemption arc, and it got me crying."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,"534 all hail kratos god of war, lord of peace, bringer of hope."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-14,314 when the original theme started playing here i wanted to cry so bad this series has truly aged well
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-13,this dlc feels like a bridge to the next game. tyr boss fights he uses weapons from egypt and aztec mythology. thats already a big hint.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-13,"not only the dlc was free but it added to the story, further developed kratos, and the ending was perfect, i was at the edge of the seat expecting a battle with his younger self, cant be the only one holding the controller waiting for a fight. but it was just him reflecting on his past self and accepting his mistakes and aiming to be better, ending was purely perfect."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-25,"this scene is more than it lets on in my opinion. those who played the original god of war games saw this man filled with nothing but rage and vengeance. ready to kill at a moments notice and willing to kill anyone innocent or not who got in his way. a man who spoke with venom in his voice. we saw a man achieve his goal and end up as miserable as he was when he started. then in god of war 2018, we saw a man who was recovering from his past deeds. a man trying to ensure that his son did not follow in his footsteps. a man trying to come to terms with what he has done. we see more of that in god of war ragnorok. but when it came to god of war valhalla, this is where we see his redemption arc come full circle. we see him enduring his past dealings and reliving them. being reminded of the way he destroyed everything in a selfish endeavor. but when we reach this scene, things change. we see him finally confront the one he hated more than anything else in the world. the man he used to be. but rather than refilling with anger, he finally comes to an unexpected conclusion. he was much more than a destroyer. much more than a stone cold killer. he has always been more. and he has now realized that he can forgive the man he used to be. its honestly so hard hitting. and you really dont expect it to be."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-14,"without sounding cheesy and over praising, this was purely beautiful. they took one of the most selfish and single minded video game characters of all time, and transformed him to into a truly remorseful and sympathetic man. and it never felt forced or unearned. this is a massive achievement, and every one who has ever worked on the god of war franchise should be proud."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-13,i think this truly is the most beautiful thing to come out of this series. a series that has come such a long ways in development both emotionally and story wise. its stunning to watch a man who has grown from a cold and hateful being to a calm and aware one. to see his journey from bloodshed and gore come full circle to him finally embracing who he is and what he has done. for all of those who took the time to read this and be apart of the community since the first gow game came out. i solute you
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-14,"to all the god of war fans that are here since starting the journey with kratos in 2005, what a truly epic moment this is. i am crying. thank you santa monica."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-29,anyone who grew up with gow series can relate. we all did things we regret and still carry. maybe not to this extent... i hope. still we can all be redeemed sometimes even if we dont deserve it.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-12,they made the young kratos look so fckin scary!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-15,"this brought me to legit tears hearing kratos accept himself and monologue his mind. the pain and suffering he endured, and the acceptance that he was more than he put himself as... damn dude... this is the writing we didn't deserve but we needed."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-01,"he was no longer the god of war, of pain and suffering, because he was more than all that... he was now, the god of hope."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-20,but you are more then that hit so hard
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-22,as he sat on the throne once more i got chills down my spine i felt like a long chapter has ended and a new one begins.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-12,"watching this scene, i got very emotional and reflective upon my own journey in life. the hatred we carry towards our past selves, without understanding the reasons why you made those choices. changing the perspective from you to i, you then start to understand that you are the person who made those choices but it doesnt mean you cant change and be better."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-18,christopher judge is just amazing with his performance and handling of kratos. this is just fantastic acting.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-23,when kratos lifts tyr up its straight up like a 5'11 vs 6'1 meme
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-13,"self accountability  shadow work is such a difficult, arduous and uncomfortable journey. as someone who has been on  is still on that journey, this monologue resonates with me heavily. even after doing the unthinkable  unforgivable, we must still find a way to look at ourselves in the mirror and move forward. gow ragnarok is undoubtedly the best video game ive played in my life. the lessons kratos has embraced are priceless"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-13,i wanna talk about a weird but kinda cool comparison the goatee on younger kratos allows more of his scarier features to show while the beard on older kratos hides most of his facial features making him look remarkably gentler in comparison case and point kratos is now the god of beards
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-13,"i love how the developers realize that the fanbase slowly started seeing the past entries of the franchise the way kratos does, as him simply being a bloodthirsty monster. this dlc is basically the game reminding both kratos and the players that although the greek saga was violent, it wasn't because thenkratos was a blind monster, but because he was hurt and broken. both the community and kratos himself are reminded that his past was not as black and white as they remember. it serves as a great character development for kratos while also being meta as fuck by calling out the player's own revisionism of what happened in greece."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-05,035 is cold
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-13,i remember the day people compare kratos vs thor. and now look how they depict young kratos in this dlc. how scary he is comparing to thor. that death stare alone already showed his absolute strength and wining over everything.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-18,it started with him sitting on a throne as the god of war. now it ends with him sitting on throne as the god of hope. now that's the best character development i've ever seen. also love mimir smiling after kratos said i would like to sit here for awhile it looks like he was proud of his brother
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-13,"this made me cry. for me, this single moment brings kratos' journey so full circle. to see him look at his past self and truly attempt to confront it in this way is so poetic and human. i started thinking about letting my stuff go, lol."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-30,"i love that head tilt, such a classic christopher judge motion. teal'c lives on in subtle ways."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-13,"kratos, the god of hope."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-13,"i was a little disappointed that we didnt get a young kratos as the final boss of the valhalla dlc, but this is certainly a beautiful way to end it edit 2.2k likes?! this is a first"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-16,what a beautifully crafted story. such a full circle moment. the developers really poured their hearts and soul into this and it shows.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-14,"we were young and angry like kratos once too, we grew up had kids and families and now we know what it means to be patient and truly fight for something beautiful rather than destruction and revenge"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-13,i think its cool how towards the end the light makes it look like the ash isnt on his skin anymore
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-13,618 mimir genuinely looks so happy when he heard kratos say that
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-13,419 feels like a response to anyone who said he wasnt a deep character in the greek games
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-23,"i still come back to this video every once in a bit, its like we grew up with kratos, in which we did really, some of us probably were in the same shoes as kratos, hateful, wanting nothing more than to watch the world burn, and yet no matter what we do to attain that, it always fucks us over, but thats the issue, some of us chased the one thing that didnt work in our favor, and thats what i think is comforting, that we all grew up alongside kratos, had our own personal growths and became better, we sat in that exact throne and told ourselves i may have made my mistakes, and may have burned many bridges, but i am better than who i was, to those still going through this, never stop, never be sorry, always be better tomorrow and the next day."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-17,kratos is easily one of the best characters made in fiction. his journey of forgiveness and redemption is beautiful and perfect.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-13,"ok the modern rendition of young kratos look genuinely intimidating. back then, yeah he also looks like hes full of rage and all that, but you could still get the protagonist vibe when you look at him. but here he looks like a whole ass villain, mans look like a fucking sith lord with those pairs of eyes lol he looks like hes ready to bounce up any second from that throne and straight up give you a mortal kombat fatality. i would not want to fight that guy, this guy aint playing"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-13,305 young kratos over there like swing... i wish you would
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-02,"seeing one of my favorite video game characters basked in light, at peace with himself, and relaxing is what i needed right now."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-13,older kratos is swole asf young kratos was shredded
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-03-10,"you are cruel, and arrogant, and selfish but you are more than that. this part makes me tear up. such a beautiful line. theyre really nailing down the fact that kratos really was more than just a killing machine too angry to die in the trilogy. he was always a tragic character who just couldnt catch a break."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-12,"welp, time for a ng replay with the young kratos skin"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-28,don't be sorry kratos. be better!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-14,"they manage to make young kratos looking more ruthless and savage, i could feel his every rage through the screen sheesh."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-21,"does anyone else kinda notice after he turns around to his younger self the last time calling him arrogant, selfish, and cruel, that he looks tan again. almost as if, he lifted the curse off of himself to have his wife and childs ashes stuck to him for life, like he finally let go. the most beautiful, gut wrenching, destructive, full circle storygamemovie i have ever witnessed and will have ever witnessed in my life"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-13,304 young kratos is so terrifying that with a simple gesture even kratos himself closes his mouth for a second
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-24,this just hits you different when you played this game as a teenager and thought you were invincible and now i am older and i have four young children.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-12,man.... this was full of emotion. i'm tearing up at how good this is........ truly phenomenal. they did an amazing job with this. you can feel the conviction in his words  realizations.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-14,"a god of war, a god of pain. what a dialogue."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-15,i love how his theme plays in the background but in a really calm and hope inducing way.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-25,400 sooner or later here or in the afterlife your past will catch you and you will crumble you can twist your story but you cannot change fate
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-13,you know aside from the menacing pose and lighting what makes young kratos intimidating is the way they convey his seething rage through his eyes.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-12,i was actually expecting tc carson to start talking when young kratos appeared
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-13,"i will be honest this is one of the best cutscenes in the god of war franchise as kratos was able to confront his past and finally make peace with it and became the god of hope not war and i would definitely say that this is an example how he was truly changing how pandora changed him and at the end of god of war 3 when kratos finally got his vengeance against the gods he felt regret, knowing that vengeance destroyed his homeland, and he even went as far as to sacrifice himself to greece could eventually heal. he tried to redeem himself for the crimes he had committed. eventually, he finally found redemption hes more than just the god of war hes more than death. he is the god of hope."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-20,"the god of fools, the god of hope? after everything he realises it. a god of war may be powerful, but one of the few things that breaks any hardship, any conflict upon its knees as kratos has so many challenges is hope. there is no force , earthly or immaterial as powerful as hope, and for a man who has defied the odds, defied the very gods at every turn, time and time again to take that throne now realises that he is that bastion, that example of the purest emotion we can feel is a perfectly fitting ending. there is no greater thing than hope, nor a greater god."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,as i watched him getting angry not forgiving his younger self and then..... slowly realizing not forgiving himself was what held him back and that his present is far better then his younger really shows wisdom and remorse really is the most incredible thing i've seen in gaming history i've never played god of war and only watched the game play footage from the first one to now
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-17,this is such a beautiful and amazing scene. is something so poetic but yet so outspoken about the scene. this is truly amazing and the writing is superb. this scene really brought his character full circle.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-13,bruh young kratos just moving his arm down sent me chills lmao
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-28,318 i expected hands of death could not deafet me ... talk from young kratos
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,death can have me when death earns me  kratos
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-16,"man... sindri's story hurt. a lot. like he's that one character that hit his breaking point to the point that he actually gave up kratos and atreus as friends and family. the last game felt like everyone was just on the edge of being able to reconcile but couldn't see past themselves, while brok and sindri were the only ones that could acknowledge and make peace with each other. in this game everyone is patching up their trauma and forcing sindri through it, occasionally stirring up his own trauma in the process! he truly gave his all, getting his heart smacked around like a volleyball, whether they meant to or not. the fact that it was the brothers' openness and kindness and unconditional love that ended up separating them forever is beyond tragic. he is the hole of this story. the one who's lost the most even his capacity to love."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-05,"135739 when kratos says and when death arrived, he... ... it is for me the most chilling moment, the suttle movment of his mouth and eyes, as they shake, the immergion, how he starts to realize his own life might actually come to an end right when he has the most to lose, it just tears me up every time, can't help it, best writting in game history, props to the developers, chirs lads"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-20,kratos redemption is complete and his honor is clean. i became a god of war fan in 2005 at 22. seeing this characters conclusion in 2022 at 40 is beyond gratifying. an amazing ending to an amazing story.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,15 hours may yet be my longest watch time. . . and it shall be filled with glorious cutscenes
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-02,i love the end part where mimir solves the riddle of brok. a hole gets bigger the more you take away. how perfectly it explains the pain of sindri for his brother......
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-30,"anyone else find it cute that when atreus is practicing his argument that he will have with his dad, even he can't help but agree with all the points he knows his father is going to bring up?"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,"off topic but i can't imagine how long a 15 hour, 4k video would even take to render. kudos to this channel"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-30,the transitions between scenes in this game are so well done. i love the part where atreus puts down the knife on asgard and kratos picks it up at yggdrasil
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,i cannot believe i watch all 15 hours of this and enjoyed it
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-14,"150829 i adore the composition of this scene so much. this feels like the type of scene where atreus and angrbodo give their heartfelt goodbyes for now, before atreus strikes a triumphant pose as the camera seemingly wants to zoom out around him as he stares off into the horizon, ready for his next adventure. but instead the camera lingers behind kratos, who watches silently, admiring the man and righteous warrior his son has become. we dont get to hear those final words nor see that final shot around atreus, because those are no longer parts of kratos story to tell. we remain with the god of war as his story finally comes to an end, as we watch from a distance as atreus, as lokis story truly begins. one that only he will be able to tell."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-01,"a subtle but massive detail i overlooked when loki casts the soul spell, four ethereal spheres emerge odin, fenryr but when fenryr passes, one of the spheres goes directly to the knife, prompting angrbodas comment later in the story. the four soul parts are also explained by i believe? sindri later as mind, body, direction, soul. this game is unparalleled in story telling in its details."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,"i'm 7 hours, 44 minutes and 57 seconds in and the story just keeps getting better and better.... why can't we have this competent kind of writing, this kind of competent writers in tv and movies."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,sometimes it feels as though kratos is speaking directly to us when imparting those fatherly wisdoms
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-25,"this game is full of hardhitting moments, but brok's death and grief turning sindri into a completely different person is probably the most heartwrenching. in the previous game and the beginning of this one, those two were something of a comedic relief, always there to bring some much needed levity into the team and at the end, poor sindri is the most broken one. all that light died with brok"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,"it breaks my heart seeing sindri like that. what a story lads. just kept on giving. the rare case where a sequel outshines the first one, but this story was a real gem. well done sm, well done."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,when the death screen comes up and thor says no and resuscitates him. so badass!!!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,i adore every segment with kratos and brok as a team. an unlikely but very interesting pair that makes for some of the funniest dialogue
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,"odin really went, you turned him against me! you have done that yourself."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,damn broks death and mimirs answer to broks riddle really hit me hard in the end.. this game is really a masterpiece.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-01,"i love the full circle that they go on the grief about faye, kratos had to be strong when he was devastated by her death for atreus so he could go trough the grief. now atreus is being strong for kratos when he finally has to deal with the grief that he buried."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-18,this whole game is a masterpiece but don't be sorry father.. be better followed by kratos' little smile almost had me in tears. our angry boi has come such a long way.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,whoever writes the storylines for the god of war games sincerely needs to consider a job writing screenplays or television pilots. they are incredibly good.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-04,110012 i love the smile on kratos's face when atreus says his father's phrase
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,"this... is not the ending i expected for kratos, but it is the ending he deserves, after all the pain."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-19,. . . i also used it for light.  kratos is the fucking best. it really is the little moments that make him a comedy icon.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-07,"god damn, i can't believe i really watched 15 hours of this, it was by far the longest youtube video i have ever watched, and the whole thing was enjoyable, i can't wait for the next game, and i hope one day i can play it and complete it myself!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,bro the cutscenes in this game legit look like an actual movie. actually almost all of the game feels and looks like an actual movie except for the fighting
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-14,"not gonna lie, there was multiple times where this game damn near had brought me to tears. beautifully written and kratos finally getting the ending he deserved! , props to this channel for doing this. couldnt imagine how long this took to edit and render.. i watched every minute!!!!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-30,"ive cried so hard, so many times while watching this. god this is so good. i feel like im standing in front of a giant, ancient painting and am only able to grasp the picture as a whole without its details, theyre just too brilliant for me to understand. love this so so much"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,"my god, the team behind both gow games is just straight s tier. the og games are also really good. you can feel the love, money, and effort that went into this games kratos definitely deserves his spot on the annals of gaming history"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,"the ending truly hits home, kratos foresees that he will finally be a god that people pray and worship to, damn near brought me and him to tears. what a great god damn story, from a video game nonetheless. gonna be game of the year again...."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-30,"gotta say, i really love how they portrayed thor in this game. they really nailed his mythological appearance, gave him great depth of character, and did a great job of making him true to his mythological personality while still being a sympathetic character and all around badass. i especially like how they nailed his mannerism as a recovering acholic."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,"i love the report that kratos and mimir have now. before he would have essentially told him to fuck off when mimir gave him advice, but now he not only takes his advice but even sees his wisdom and reliable even when it comes to atreus. theyve grown to respect one another more than most allies hes had in the past. a teacher and a friend and an extra pair of eyes all in one."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-14,"the fight with heimdall is one of my favourites in the game. the way kratos killed him at the end by choking the life out of him, really reminded me of gow 3 boss fights and how brutal this man was to his enemies. he gave heimdall two chances to walk away  i remember a time when kratos took enjoyment out of cutting off hermes legs"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-06,"kratos return my son, or you may meet the god i once was. odin visibly concerned absolute perfection"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,"that final line from mimir. the answer to broks riddle, that broke me"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-18,"ive spent the best part of a week watching this during work breaks, after dinner and laying in bed before going to sleep and i do not regret a second of it. this has been absolutely astonishing to watch and thank you for uploading it glp"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-02,"games like this are why i consider video games to be the current pinacle of human creative expression. storytelling, writing, music composition, visual design, acting, cinematography, level design, gameplay and so much more all culminating in this absolutely beautiful masterpiece. thank you santa monica studios for allowing me to experience this. and thank you to this channel for letting me experience it despite not owning a playstation. now if you'll excuse me, i need to go cry for several hours"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-19,"i was really not sure about this interpretation of odin, but he's actually a really great character. probably one of the best. i love his dialogue, very funny."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,"12 minutes in and im already crying, that hit close to home. thanks for the upload! love that you include a bit of gameplay with the cutscenes."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-31,"at 2000 kratos calling his axe evoked a veteran reaching for the gun under his pillow. a lot of people get distracted by the killing god kratos, and they forget the traumatized mortal kratos. he straight up has ptsd"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,"151035 when kratos sees hope that he can finally redeem himself, such a really touching scene"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,i appreciate people like you who put up videos like these. i absolutely suck at playing video games like these but i've followed the god of war story line since the first game. i wanted to keep up with the new ones too. i absolutely love the writing for these games.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-25,wow this is pure quality. this is exactly the level of thorougness i wanted. the looking around every once in a while so we can see the environment... the atention to detai. just amazing. great work
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,finally a player that interacts well with the gameplay interactions you have to do
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,"53424 this one hits home for me. i seldom made clear of my intentions in life to my parents, about my dreams and so on, yet they always support me."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"a complete masterpiece. thank you for including all the bits and pieces that gave us the whole story. santa monica studio really out did themselves, and i could not be more amazed and in awe."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,i love the incorporation of side quests in this movie. it adds more value to the main quest making this movie worth the 15 hours

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-11,"this game was an all around blast to play. everything was epic. the storyline, the characters, the battles, etc. it was hard to see brok die though. loved his character."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,the smile kratos gave when atrius was able to do everything alone and realized he's growing up made me so happy
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,definitely worth the whole 15  hours. excellent editing done in this. the game playmovie watch timing was impeccable  quality stuff right here. thank you for this.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-05,"when you know 'the twisty', watching tyr's reaction in groa's shrine and mimir laughing next to him is so satisfying."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-19,"i love how beautiful this game is. good writing, solid gameplay, and just wholesome father and son questing."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-13,whoever wrote the dialogue in this game deserves an award and big pay raise.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-11,this game is a masterpiece in every sense.. kudos to this channel for bringing it to us.. so many hearttouching moments.. and when thor says no..
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-04,"i watched all 15 hours, it took 3 sittings. amazing."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-05,"120540 when kratos grunts, atreus does a little one himself, love how far they've both come."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-14,i enjoyed that you went to each side quest area as well. that extra content was a nice treat as the last one i watched was lacking it! nice job!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-16,134025 the farther son duo rage mode that we have been waiting for! it gave me goosebumps!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,42807 shes what atreus? say it. dont be scared 83440 and because you kill gods. the way this was so nonchalantly said  rip baldur 103026 damn i teared up  115810 never thought we would get a chase scene 120225 birgir is that guy 121110 atreus questions how birgir survived the fall. kratos suggests magic then proceeds to fall around the same height and tank it with his big tough physicality. must be nice being the god of war huh kratos
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-30,finally! i managed to complete it. this was really long but very entertaining. thanks
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,literally 1010 game made me cry a lil bit at the end ngl just magnificent
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-13,"wow. just wow. an absolute master piece. from start to finish this game was incredible. cried at least twice, jumped with excited more times than i can count. for the first time i can say this is a 1010. happy i got to experience this"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-30,i love this editing cutting the useless fights keeping the dialogues very very nice
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,"ever what makes god of war games great? the smallest details that you never notice, but are still there! example 4355 watch kratos' hand when odin goes to place his hand on atreus."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,whoa man that felt more than just a game. it's a movie. thanks for the cutscenes man.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"5127 that's some pretty clever cinematography, punctuating thor's earlier this feels familiar and brok's leviathan was meant to fight mjolnir with a look at the frozen lightning bolt."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,many thanks for uploading all the cutscene specially the dialogue ingame which is very important.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,"im surprised at the amount of sensitive topics this game touches on. parenting, trust issues, alcoholism thor  sif, redemption, forgiveness, and love"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-15,"one thing i like about this is that they address the discrepancy between who hails from where in regards to the dwarves and dark elves in the mythology. things got really shuffled around over the ages, particularly where and when the mass christian conversion comes into play. hel, in some versions dwarves and dark elves are one and the same!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,so obsessed with how kratos is just a helicopter dad.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,"the guys you throw your stuff to fix. the dudes you visit a million times. the brothers who help you any where at any time and will always be helpful to you no matter what happens to you. have you said, thank you? they took the damn stage. amazing story telling. never thought secondary.. no.. they aren't even secondary characters. they're the friggin npc's! never thought they could be front and center to the entire epic. given, they didn't do much. all they did, was make a hole. in your heart."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,110035 im happy for kratos fr man that was a special moment
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-10,"i wanna say thank you for this. putting these videos together like this is alot of work. and you really know how to show all the good gritty details..... also, good camera work, thank you"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-13,"111417 in peace, sons bury their fathers. in war, fathers bury their sons."

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-11,"i have watched this three times, and i shall do it more. it provides entertainment for my meals. and is long enough that i forget the finer details of the beginning. i love the story, even with the terrible twist that occurs with the huldar brothers. seeing sindri so friendly at the beginning, then after the incident what he turns into. truly super sad. i hope there is somewhat to recover what was lost. thank you for your time in putting these together. i love the inclusion of ingame dialogue for the movies, really provides an extra kick to the viewing experience."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-25,loki went for a sleepwalk. a very enthusiastic sleepwalk. he tripped over some plot along the way.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-07,"115525 he called kratos a monster, but heimdall might as well had been looking into a mirror when he said that. i mean, really. he gave him two chances kratos and atreus talk about making a choice on their own and not by fate, and by offering to spare heimdall twice even, i think kratos kept true to it. he wasn't a monster in that battle he was a father crushing a infected cockroach that was aiming for his son."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,"it wasn't shown in this video but the real tyr is even more weird than odin's tyr. also brok's death and kratos finally being worshipped really made me cry. this game is truly amazing, lots of life lessons to learn as well if you pay attention. i hope it becomes the game of the year!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-16,i literally sat down and spent two days watching this. incredible writing and story telling.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-11,"it took me a couple of days but ive finished it, and i have to say, one of the best movie ive seen so far."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-11,thanks for doing this and putting attention to the subtle details of the game. best compilation out there. saves me from buying a playstation and sinking days into this game
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,honestly i didnt think the game would be anymore than average but for the first five hours its been brilliant and when you get to the dwarf realm and get to the lake wow its brilliant there is loads of stuff to do .also im on the ps4 and it runs fine
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,i was waiting for this one instead of finshing the parts  your officially my favorite cutscenes youtuber ever keep going!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-22,"so this is the second time i've watched through this and i've just realised that they cut out brok's most iconic line, the one that resonates with kratos and the line that indicates why brok was the one to figure out spoiler. brok it's about understanding mimir understanding what? brok the nature of a thing's more important than the form of a thing."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,61115 this moment is so powerful.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-20,135542 one of my favorite atreus and kratos scenes. boy is still boy and wants to sleep next to his father before war.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-28,i can't thank you enough for putting this video together. truly a masterpiece.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,this mustve taken a lot of effort on your part to edit and put together this is exactly what i was looking for and i want you to know we really appreciate it all i have never had a console but never wanted to miss out on the literature and story telling that is present in games so people like you make it possible thank you very much for your service
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,"after 4 years of waiting, ragnarok is finally here!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-29,100 worth the watch. i feel like this is a solid end to kratos finally getting his peace and changing his nature. brok's death was completely blindsided. one of the greatest stories i have ever seen.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-20,i watched this in 2weeks and am very happy to have completed it. what an amazing story! thank you for taking out the time to make this.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,"23127 last time kratos chased a crazed tall guy with long hair and no shoes it really didn't end well for the guy... 111030 finally sparing an enemy. even more a boss. i love this. this is what more games need to plunge you deeper into the story. 132910 the fire demon evil guy most fearsome thing in the nine realms as they talk of him, chill guy speaks sense and calmly"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,thank you for this. i was never going to play this game but watching this was like watching a really long and really good movie. i appriciate you recording and uploading this.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-18,"this has to be the single greatest game movie i have ever watched, and thats saying something considering i make up about 13 of your watch time views on the cod ww2 game movie. editallow me to elaborate the character progression each of the characters going through their own struggles, we saw every side the amount of story and grief i felt with the characters was real. i cried watching this it was just so, riveting. honestly 1st well done with the editing and fitting everything together you put so much effort into your videos and i think i speak for all of us when i say i truly appreciate the work that goes into creating a cohesive story from pieces of a game. 2nd. i watched all of this and i can definitely say it was 15hrs well spent."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,it's good to be back!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,i liked how impressed jack was about the fact that even the bear has a name but bjrn is the swedish word for a bear
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-17,"when kratos found out that the bear he defeated was atreus and he panicked, almost thinking he killed another child of his is just so heartwrenching to think about."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,the death screen fake out and thor reviving you with his hammer like a defibrillator to keep the fight going is so clever.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-06-27,freyas kratooosssss scream in the beginning is some fantastic voice acting
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,"out of the gate, the nod to atreus being loki with the antlers framing his silhouette, as well as him raising a wolf named fenrir, i'm hooked already"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-05,"fun fact, atreus's voice actor, sunny soljic grew so much since the first game they had to modify atreus's voice through a filter because it didn't fit the boy appearance."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,seeing atreus having to tell kratos to stop thinking like a father and him straight refusing is so heartening to see after their initial coldness at the start of the last game.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-26,"i like how at 5809 and 5927, each time odin mentions atreus, kratos quickly holds his axe in case anything happens to him."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,i like how jack's definition of ugly armor is just anything that involves kratos wearing a shirt and not being bare chested
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,"kratos solemnly saying i do not need a snack in his deep, gravelly voice is something i'll keep in my heart forever."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-10-13,reading the diary entry at 2233. kratos describing mimir as compact made me chuckle! xd
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,it's so nice how kratos and mimir are actually friends now. he even takes his advice about things!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-19,"i don't think sean noticed it, but at 5925 when odin is about to put his hand on atreus... kratos reaches for his axe without a moment of hesitation. he was dam well ready to fight thor and odin right then and there just to keep him safe. such a small detail but means so much for kratos's growth."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,"id like odins look more if his beard was longer, but i like what they did with him. hes deceptively harmless looking, appearing frail and weak. hes charismatic to distract from his sadistic scheming. its very appropriate"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-06-28,"i love the way odin conducts himself, hes like a businessman, hes just so smooth"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-19,"i like how kratos writes the journal entries in this game rather than atreus, implying atreus taught him to read  write"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,thor and kratos putting their weapons on the table is like two gunslingers putting their revolvers on the table before going outside to kill each other...i love solid foreshadowing.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,"i love how odin is straightup a mafia boss in this, from sending an enforcer ahead to ensure safety, to his mannerisms. i mean, hell, even the way he wears his clothes is a nod."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-06-06,10542 that frozen lightning bolt is the coolest thing ive ever seen
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,jacksepticeye playing video games for 2 hours with no live chat and no other distractions is my safe space. takes me back to being like 14 when things didnt matter
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-12,"fun fact! sunny did the mocap for the bear, shapeshifting into animals is an ability he learned to mocap this game! what a dedicated actor!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,i squealed so loudly in excitement when kratos reads the giant language my cats all ran away. he continued learning from atreus. my heart.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-08-25,minutes of the game starting and i was already in tears for fenrir. the detail of the life visibly leaving his eyes was too much for my heart
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-04,right out the gate with the dad of boy edit is so perfect
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,"i love when atreus told kratos to stop acting like a father and act like a general his facial expression is just like it took me years to become the father, i will no longer be a general"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,mimir is literally just that one uncle that tries to keep the father and son relationship happy lol
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-08,11150 little did sean know he would in fact be getting one of those spears back there lol
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,brok calling odin the allfucker has me dying
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,i like how this odin is so different from most other portrayals. it really emphasizes his paranoia rather than his raw strength
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,i absolutely love how freya yells kratos name. just the exact same way he yelled ares name when he wanted revenge.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-06,"4253 until you learn control, we will take no unnecessary risks best line in the game"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,"2234 seeing kratos call mimir brother in his journal was heartwarming, until he said that he was easy to transport and doesnt cosume precious resources. made me spit my drink out, that one"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-26,"5926 i noticed that as soon as odin reaches for atreus, kratos reaches for the axe!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,dad of boy had me giggling. your editor deserves a raise sean.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-20,"as a swede, i am very happy and surprised by how well jack knows nordic mythology! props to him"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,i love that we're witnessing how loki comes to be. kratos is like an incredibly strict parent so atreus has come to value sneakiness to help him forward his goals and such. small thing but great.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,"the fact that the leviathan axe is so powerful, that it froze a bolt of lightning from mjnir and thor is terrifyingly cool"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-14,mimir atreus can handle himself. kratos i'm not worried about him. i'm worried about others encountering him...
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-09-02,"im genuinely dumb sometimes and i decided to watch this series first while it was coming out, so a few weeks ago i decided to watch the entire first series and im now rewatching this. cant help to say its worth it, sean is really one of my absolute favorite youtubers, and these type of games are just top tier."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,"i love the detail of atreus wearing a necklace with the arrow piece that broke baldurs spell. the attention to little things in character designs, i swear."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-05,they really start this game off by making you feel every emotion possible in the first 20 minutes
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,they absolutely nailed the mannerisms of wolves. fenrir's squeaking and ears folding back are spot on to a tired old pup.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-28,i love how jack literally predicted the whole game in the first half hour about the time travel stuff
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-16,i just love how serious kratos is no matter what he says. i do not need a snack
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,"the writers did a really good job showing kratos love for atreus considering his tough personality. the times he holds back his anger, the light touches and even the way he looks at him is so sweet. this game looks amazing already."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-22,"god. thor's expression and seemingly needing a moment to get that under control, thus looking away when odin calls his dead sons useless. this game really does a lot of little things that make it so much more impressive"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-06-19,"5653 odin is such a hypocrite here. hell admit magni and modis deaths were selfdefence which they were, but somehow, killing baldur whilst baldur was trying to kill kratos, atreus, and freya isnt?! baldur may have been odins best tracker, and had other skills odin valued, but that doesnt mean baldurs death wasnt a case of both selfdefence and defence of others. it was. also, note the words odin uses to describe who baldur was to him. tracker. closer. and others that surround baldurs usefulness. nothing about loving his son, or baldurs personhood. that? that is objectification of the nonsexual variety. people are just tools to him. this first interaction between odin and kratos is what absolutely convinced me that odin is truly a villain, not just through the stories we heard in 2018, but from odins actual behaviour when we finally see him in person. it doesnt matter how much odin and the aesir insist hes a good person, or how much the game sows little seeds of doubt in its throughline. he is well and truly evil."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-19,hearing kratos say i don't need a snack is the funniest thing so far
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,"whoever is voice acting atreus is doing an amazing job, that scene with the dog was heartbreaking"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,"i really like the fact that in the first game, the journal was written as atreus', but in this game it's kratos'. like kratos realised having a record of his enemies and knowledge he encounted could be a good thing after seeing his son's"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-08-22,kratossmiles jacki love these games
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,can we talk about how perfect ryan hursts voice is as thor? he just brings so much calmness and intensity to the character.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-18,you seem like a calm and reasonable person .......that line absolutely hit me. i also like how they designed the sir. they did darn good.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,"957 dude, i almost cried at that proud dad smile that you can see through his beard if you look closely. considering that kratos didn't even feel comfortable touching atreus in the first one, this is a huge growth in their relationship resulting from the adventure from the first game"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-27,"i've had this series on repeat since he first posted. even if it's just background noise, it's just comforting. thanks, sean, for being easy and fun to watch"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,"i don't know how to explain it, but kratos just sitting by the fire making arrows in silence gave off the same exact feeling as being a kid watching dad work on something while he explains nothing."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-13,oh we've got a model father here. such a good line lmao
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,he was literally talking to the wolf the way i talk to my dog. to say that the tears were gonna pour out of my eyes would be an understatement
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-17,"i lost my dog about 5 days before this aired, so seeing fenrir pass like that in the boys arms hits incredibly close to home and i could feel his pain. screenwriters did an awesome job"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,i honestly love how much odn comes off as a mob boss
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-10,"atreus's spell in the beginning translates to sleep, from now on, sleep, from here, sleep, sleep"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-24,"i watched this in the dead of night while dealing with my child as a newborn only a few weeks old at best. i have always and still do enjoy your content but am especially appreciative of this series that got me through my postpartum. im not a dad of boy but as a mom of girl, thank you for your game play. i hope that you always see happiness and success in all that you strive for"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,"i love the little things that go by so quickly in this game. for example kratos learned to read runes! he started learning from atreus in the first game, but now he is actually capable! such boys!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-13,the fact that you can hear thor's tooth fall on the ground after he throws it proves how good this games sound design is
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-04,i really love the fact that in god of war2018 atreaus wrote the codex book but in this game its kratso
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-29,5612 funny how atreus goes the long way to avoid the camera crew
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-17,i loved it when jack said heeuuughsilver such touching words.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,"as someone who has lost a pet that ive loved so much, the scene with atreus and his wolf really got to me. what a great emotional scene so early in this story. we are in for another hell of a game im so excited."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,love how jack was like even the bears have names the bears name bear but in swedish
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-01,"4308 i love how that as soon as atreus says stop thinking like a father for a moment mimir's face immediately cringes. he already knows what atreus is about to say, and knows how kratos will react."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,"4301 man that hit hard.. kratos has been many things, a killer, a general, a soldier, but right at this point he knows he buried his past in order to become a father"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,"i love mimir and kratos' convos, it's literally just kratos' brother one of the only people he'll open up to"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,10531 the fact that they froze a bolt of lightning is badass
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-07-03,that look that kratos has in the beginning is the same look i have on my face looking in the fridge at midnight
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-03,"i recently lost my soul dog and the scene where atreus had to let go of fenrir hit me so hard.. its such a heart wrenching scene for those who know the feeling. hell, even if you dont, i think it still hurts the soul to watch someone say goodbye to an animal that means so much."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-13,"something about kratos standing all buff and intimidating and saying in a deep gravelly voice, i do not need a snack is just so funny to me"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,13 minutes in and jack is already holding back tears. this is gonna be an epic ride.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-23,i love the first thor fight cause thor is constantly like is that all you got let me see the god of war my brother under odin you are only alive because you heal between cutscenes. you are fighting an ax designed to save people rather than the blades that were made to kill gods.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-14,i'm sure kratos appreciates the irony of being the target of someone else's revenge. i also like how freya and atreus actually try to not hurt each other.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,"oh my god odin is literally the godfather. they made this man a celestial mob boss, and thats honestly incredible"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,2133 i interpreted this as kratos finally realizing hes bald and ive been crying on the floor for ten minutes
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,i love all these dad of boy games and to see sean always playing them is amazing
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-16,"this may seem stupid ,but i was in tears almost the entire video. my dad was looking forward to this game releasing but he passed this march. whenever i see this game it just reminds me of him. the fact hes not here to see makes it even more difficult. love the videos sean, keep up the good work."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,ive never been so disrespected in a bossfight before he killed me then brought me back
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,i didn't expect to be fully crying under 15 minutes into this playthrough let alone for a newly established character but here we are
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-09-08,i love watching the intros of these firsts episodes because you can see how genuinely excited he is
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-30,"i like how kratos has grown. instead of saying no! when brok suggests replacing his broken shield, he takes the time to explain what's what."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-14,i love how much they've improved facial expressions and body language into this. it looks so good even my grandma watches me play to learn about the lore
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,i don't think there's ever been a game that has made me cry in the first 15 minutes but my god they did it with this one
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-06-08,"20300 what on earth did i experience just now?? that has got to be the most professional outro i have ever heard, in my entire life. sean your getting reeaaaalllly good bro. lol"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,"i do love how the real norse mythos thors hammer wasnt like, super worthy only mode, it was just so insanely terrifyingly powerful you couldnt wield it without destroying yourself usually"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,that moment where kratos is proud and accepts atreus is growing up is so heart warming. 955. would love to see gow with egyptian settings and gods in it
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,your a good boy a really brave boy but now you can rest you need to let go i know the feeling atreus
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-09,"13 minutes in and i'm crying. never met fenrir, haven't seen any interactions with fenrir up until now, but the pain atreaus was in as he let him pass on was the quickest any piece of media has made me cry. what a start"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,"less than 20 minutes and i already cried, what a good boy the wolf was"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,"kratos is trying so hard to be good father. it just makes me respect him more for trying his damnedest to be a good dad. ironically, he's becoming a great one."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,i feel so hard for atreus with fenrir. he found it so hard to let go. that only hits me so hard because ive recently lost two cats in the time span of two weeks. i love it when games can show this depth of emotion with their characters. its no wonder we can relate to many characters so often.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-10-16,"around 10710, thor slapping kratos's axe aside, then piledriving him when he went for health is great. it really captures the feeling of oh fuck, this guy is strong."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-14,youre a good boy instant sobbing
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,they let me post a day early! so false alarm my birthday is actually tomorrow when the game drops heheh
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,cory that better not be odin! odin you know who i am that part is phenomenal
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-30,"kratos's struggle to be a father is so heartwarming and endearing to see. nothing can prepare you for raising a child, let alone as a single parent, but he does his best, and it really shows."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-18,"this game means so much to me because the original god of war saga were the very first violent videogames i've ever played in my life... and before i played them myself, i used to watch my dad play all of them... now that this one released, it was just me playing them by myself with only memories of how me and my dad used to play them before"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-03,odin how about peace? kratos yeah im with it credits roll
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,"this depiction of odin is so perfect. i love that he is a stark contrast to thor, physically. thor is huge and all about raw power, while odin is all about words and deception. i love that they didn't make odin look like a warrior or anything, because he isn't one. he actually never fights personally in the myths well, aside from the killing of ymir for the building of the world. but yet, he has even more commanding presence than thor, he walks in states that you know who i am, grabs chair for himself, and drinks the mead from the table. i also love that when mimir says if he tells you snow is white, he is lying and odin just dismisses it with what kind of wisdom is that?. mimir, who is really smart is still made to look like a fool with that line."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,the fact that cory is playing this on the hardest difficulty and is making it look so easy is crazy
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-13,112 i was literally searching for a playlist of the first god of war way before he started saying this
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,good stuff!!!!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-01,"5810 subtle detail when odin approaches atreus, kratos puts his hand on his axe."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,the words ill see you tomorrow coming out of corys mouth made me so happy also happy birthday
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-22,2422 cory yes i like to watch you pick thing up kratos pick it up cory bruh
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,there will never be enough appreciated for the actions that cory has taken. such a good guy.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,not even 15 minutes in and i'm already crying at the fenrir part when he spits out the food
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-10,cory that better not be odin. odin you know who i am. cory
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-12,5829 all this standing up just to say no
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-06-17,who else loved this series so much that they have to rewatch it again? we here
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,my boy atreus really went through the 5 stages of grief
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,5426 cory that better not be odin odin you know who i am also cory closes the game
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-23,happy very late birthday legend 052
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,"happy birthday brotha, thank you for being a positive influence in our lives  being you, have a blessed day ik his bday is tommorow but i stated this now incase there is no upload tommorow"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-12,5232 can we just take a moment to appreciate the strength of that table. able to hold the weight of 2 superweapons
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,this episode alone is literally the bomb. they clearly killed with this game. super excited to see how this series progresses with cory. absolutely goated game and youtuber put together.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-17,"i remember watching the series when they came out. this brings back memories of 2022, lets watch it again. whos with me!"

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-13,i usually watch corys gameplay videos without caring about spoilers but damn this game looks so good that imma have to come back to this series after i play it
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-10,"i love how they made odin. in myths he isnt a fighter he is a manipulator, and he is depicted exactly how i imagined him from the descriptions of the first game"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,"happy early birthday cory!! its been an honor being apart of the samurai community for about 6 years, truly its been great. you say how you are very blessed to do what you do, but we are also blessed to have you here. thank you for everything and i hope you have a lovely birthday god bless!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-28,"5753 youre missing one thing cory, in norse mythology, odin is a gigantic nerd. regularly pulls off the most elaborate schemes in his quests for knowledge. and hes not exactly a big strong dude in the myths either"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,"that last part was the most suspenseful thing i have seen in a video game in a while, i was literally shaking, frozen with anticipation and i even almost broke a sweat, cory was right, that is how you start a game tt. p.s the fights scenes are gorgeous"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-08,1018 that dap must've sounded krazy two gods at that madness
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-13,5930 the finger snap thor uses to summon the hammer is so simple yet so different from anything we've seen in the movies  instantly iconic
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,"i dont care what non of yall say except that this man is so damn funny, can make the aura lighter, and can make a good difference on a really bad day. man i missed you cory, i'm really happy your back"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,this felt like a whole episode. happy late birthday cory
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-30,can we talk about the way the bear fight went? cory was literally twisting bjorn's ankles into dust the way he was weaving his attacks
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,thor's entrance was hype but the way he just swung on kratos when odin gave him the go ahead was too clean
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,"you couldnt control your son, so i had to body him had me dying"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-06,3539 kratos atreus where are you!? atreus 3 milliseconds later right here bi
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-20,"i can not believe its been a year since you posted this im rewatching it again because of the nostalgia, we miss you cory"

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,"happy birthday cory, you deserve all the love and praise for what you have given us as the samurai community"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,all ima say cory is that if you dont keep posting ima glue your toes together and make step on a lego and happy birthday

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-02-28,"shout out to kratos's sleeping position, gets me through many uncomfortable nights"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,happy birthday cory! thanks for being my inspiration for all these years.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,"love cory's reaction to odin's appearance. it's kinda ironic and makes sense because in the original mythology, odin is more of a trickster god like loki. he makes his enemies underestimate him with his silver tongue and somewhat frail appearance. but underneath all that is a viscous god."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,can we talk about how the motion where thor snaps for his hammer and uppercuts kratos is so smooth 5856
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-20,"welp, its that time of the year where i will rewatch this series for the 50th time"

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,"he's a machine. he's a monster. he doesnt sleep, he just plays."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,"death can have me, when it earns me the god of war"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,i dont think people realize that mk has been keeping single player games relevant on this platform probably the most for a long time. thank you mk your content has always been amazing!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-12,"while watching, something in my mind kept telling me that brok would just pop out of nowhere and surprise us. so sad, i will always love this game. although i really do miss the previous vicious ghost of sparta, it is nice to see he has become better. such an awesome game."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,i'm thankful they didn't add paid dlc to this game. i felt like i was back in the ps2 days.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,"the fact that u take the time out of your life for 19 hours to play this is real commitment, you just earned a sub d"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-23,this guy is a.i how he goes crazy and plays these games.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-08,one of the greatest game of all the time. i beat this game in 4 days and i enjoyed it
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,thank you for your game movies they are of the highest quality on youtube that i have ever seen.thank you very much for releasing them on the youtube platform!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-02,i still wish there was a way for kratos to have actually be able to speak to faye one more time just to have that peace. that closure. its something that kratos has never once had and i genuinely feel he deserves after all this time. just for faye to tell him that hes okay would probably break him and help heal him at the same time.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-26,i love the fact that the npcs actually do something in this game... most games they do absolutely nothing but get their ass kicked.. in this game i saw freya kick the shit out of an enemy's ass a strong one at that while i watched mk fight a boss freya was whooping ass lol
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,"smartest man alive with strongest man alive, poetic."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-26,80522 i love how brock is down to scrap alongside kratos but delivers effectively zero damage.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-24,this definitely has to be mks greatest game of all time or one of them... i enjoy watching this as a movie all of the gows such incredible storyline...
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-24,"but i miss that old kratos rage, that circles..."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,my favorite game since the 1st one.

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-15,what bitrate do you use in 4k video ? bcs in case of best settings you should go with 40000 bitrate ! then the file get bigger of 256 gb instead of 20 hours approximatly
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,"i am sick of games that do a sequel. only to have the graphics and cpu increase. so that many who played the first game are shut out its like having to buy a new tv to watch the next show season. its disgraceful and inconsiderate to gamers teach the developers s lesson by boycotting sequels that exclude previous players if they want to get their cut for pushing gpzu ram and cpu sales then create entirely new games for that, otherwise support the buyers from previous games, without shutting them out. imo"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-23,"brother, do you know if there is a way to solve this shadow rendering problem? if you pay attention, when you jump into the arena to fight, the shadows stay in line and render in front, deposition is normal. do you know if there is a way to reduce or resolve this? your video was great, congratulations!"

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-02,who loved the fight against heimdall
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-11,this is such a hey chatgpt write me an essay video
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-02,"mjolnir doesn't care about worthiness. marvel made it up, it's actually just really fukn heavy"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-02,"it's not really a signal but more of mockery and a statement of power, he doesn't need to snap, he just does it to make the statement like calling the strongest weapon in the universe in the snap of a finger"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-06,bro thor literally comitted a genocide. the hammer doesn't care about worthiness.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-03,source i made it the fuck up
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-01,my own jer
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-03,"thor treats mjolnir as a weapon to kill and destroy, thats why he snaps to call it even though he doesnt really need to its sort of a way to show that mjolnir is just an object, like a dog to be called upon his masters signal. kratos, however, treats leviathan as something precious to him as it clearly belonged to his 2nd wife. he holds a very special and close place for faye in his heart and anything that passed down from her to him is very sentimental to kratos that is why the axe is his favourite and actually cares for it even if it is just a tool"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-02,unworthy? this is not marvel lol
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-03,"everything you said was wrong, this isn't marvel"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-24,that bar fight scene was one of the best fighting sections i've ever experienced in a video game.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-08,"worthiness? in norse mythology mjolnir is just a really, really heavy hammer. anyone could pick it up if they were strong enough."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-26,"ah yes, thor's hammer myojear."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-20,my oh jeer is crazy
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-04,i heard some people say the reason why the hammer wobbles and falls is cause it's also intoxicated
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-13,the hammer seems to have a conscience its even drunk when thor is lmao
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-04,its just a show of strength. a flimsy way to keep up apperances of command and power.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-14,the hammer has a conscious mind of its own and thor seems to be the only one who can speak to it
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-17,"to me it looks like that version of thor seemed like he mixed with mcu's thanos a little bit because of the voice, and that snap."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-12,ive never heard someone say thor's hammer like that i busted out laughing  mio jeer dude wtf
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-10,you know why i think he does it because its dope af when he does
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,my own jeer i heard that hammer name call
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-06,while mortals beat their hammer thor talks to his
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-01,"thor is lefthanded. he tried calling mjolnir with his right hand, while drunk."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-12,they should honestly give the blades of chaos their own consciousness. after all this time imagine the conversations kratos and the blades would have about all the gods deities that theyve killed.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-20,if i had a weapon with its own conscience i probably talk to it too.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-04,"ignoring the elephant in the room, its not actually atreuss sword, its freyrs"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-15,"mjolnir crashes through the wall mjolnir to thor oh bloody helheim thor, really? drinking?! i thought you had promised your daughter, be better"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-19,myogeer is crazy
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-05,"the snapping is focus. there's no enchantment on it that has to do with worthiness. that's a marvel comics things. thor struggles with his drinking and by the time we see him, he's a broken man. he and kratos aren't in their prime, but still very powerful. the snapping is a way thor can focus the hammer to him, even though he can easily call it without doing so. he was drunk in that scene and could barely function"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-02,"i always saw the snapping is a way to gove orders, hes demanding the hammer to be in his hand versus kratos where he only open his hand merely suggesting for it to arrive"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-07,if you feel stupid just remember this video exists
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-17,the snap is pure theatrics he calls it by extending his hand twice at least in the game the snap just gives it a level of showmanship
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-22,"he doesn't wield mjolnir because he's worthy, he is the only being strong enough to lift it"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-05,i would love a miles morales size game of playing earlier this universes thor going around playing him while hes a total savage
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-29,the way he said myo jer
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-09,god of war ragnarok genuinely is such a unique game. there are so many little details put into the game that makes it stand out like no other game in this generation. this game will be amazing for years to come.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-28,ahh yes his beloved hammer my oh jir
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-16,"ah yes, mayojier, truly the best and most legendary weapon from any mythology"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-11,bro thinks mjlnir cares about thor being worthy or unworthy
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-11,"although not mentioned in the game, ingrid atreus sword was instructed to be made by freyr who imbued it with his passions and motivations, giving the sword its own soul for lack of a better word. given its behavior is similar to mjolnir, its a fair assumption that it was made by dwarves as well. the reverse assumption is a good guess as well, that similar to ingrid, brok and sindri applied something intangible into the forging of mjolnir. either way, both atreus and thor share the giants inherent ability for soul magic."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-12,ah yes we saw this dynamic in thor love and thunder when thor and stormbreaker were having a fight
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-31,"honestly i would love a thor spin off game, he was my favorite character in the new gow."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-13,mjolnir  myojir
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-02,"wow, your editing is topnotch! im just starting out as a creator and finding so much inspiration from your videos. hope to connect with likeminded creators like you!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-05,he can call to the hammer as he wishes. je was drunk so he couldnt control where he was bringing the hammer. its like a drone he cant control.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-17,my source is i made it the fuck up ass video
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-20,mimir my goat actively tells atreus when he asked about it that it's just a weird habit he picked up out of nowhere
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-06,"the part where you call the axe, swing full force at him thinking hes wide open, and he snaps, the hammer parries you then flies to his hand was pretty cool"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-07,i could get behind the hole giants talk to weapons that were special made with like a soul or something in it that makes it more alive.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-06,"really dont get the pessimism in the comments, this game looks sick. i admire any studio willing to push themselves by tackling completely new gameplay mechanics and genres like this. hyper light drifter already exists, so instead of trying to recreate it why not try something new"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-12,mayojir  wtf
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-22,"i north mythology there was no rule to be worthy to wield mjolnir, it was just so heavy that no one besides thor could pick it up"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-17,i talk to my sword too every night
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-27,hearing meyeojerr made me have to take a double take
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-14,did this man just call the hammer milojeer
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-18,"atreus asks mimir if thor talks to mjlnir because it has a conscience like the sword ingrid, or if he is charming the steel or something. mimir states that none of this is the case, and he is just a weird bloke. this is further backed by the fact that the huldra brothers made the leviathan axe as a more polishedrefined version of mjlnir, which we know contains no sentience, even though it returns to its wielder. the snap might just be there because it is cool, or a way to call it faster when in a hurry or in combat, as we see it takes a considerably longer time to call without the snap."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-27,imagine snaping at something and getting ur hand ripped off
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-02,oh my god the hammer pulled you off?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-12,i always imagine thor kicking the ground with so much force to negate the impact of mjolnirs weight and speed that he leaves a crater where hes standing. also the reaction time to catch something travelling at the speed of light must be pretty difficult too
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-09,im glad myojeer sees thor as worthy.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-06,my oh jeer
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-19,i fell in love with there version of thor it's how he should be he was a viking not just a god
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-28,i thought the snap was a call versus him being pulled to the hammer. that's why he can fly. he can throw the hammer and pull himself to it or snap and call it to him.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-30,dont he only snap his fingers to impress odin when he knows that he is there
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-14,"that sword called ingrid isnt atreuss, its freyrs aka freyas brother and he can also recall the weapon to hand."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-13,"i never understood why its so hard for games and films to depict mjolnir correctly. i also havent seen them make use of his gloves or belt, some of his most important gear considering they allow him to even use mjolnir."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-13,i hope they make a game dedicated to thor would be cool
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-12,kratos axe can either hear the spartan rage when he flexes or that the axe can hear him flex his fingers
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-14,"ah yes, thor's infamous hammer mayo jar"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,its a sign that he is drunk and the snap is just a show up
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-01,"well in norse mythology, when a weapon is made with that calibur of power, the weapons are alive they are made to be their own beings controlled by only those they were made for. consider the sword of summer. its the sharpest blade to ever exist yet it can only be wielded by the god of summer"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-13,having conscious weapons sound awesome
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-18,wow i didn't notice that i though he only can call miojir by snaping his finger
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-01,"the snap is for call to his left hand, calling without snap is for his right hand"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-17,and humans talking to their pets like they are normal because they are apart of our lives
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-11,so he needs yo snap in battle but in the same clip you show the hammer crashing through a wall
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-20,next gow that weapon must be in kratos arsenal !
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-10,"fun fact thor has nothing to do with lightning, hes only a warrior god. the lighting thing came from us retroactively connecting the thunder, which the vikings thought was caused by striking something with mjolnir, to lightning"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-28,"ah yes, myohjeer, hammer of thor."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-16,worthiness isnt a thing in norse myth or in the god of war game . however the weapon having a mind of its own is a thing
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-28,nobody would think thor is crazy for talking to his hammer... everyone knows that thor's hammer is sentient.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-02,there are a couple of scenes where kratos tries to use it mid battle but cant i think hes tried twice. i believe if kratos had more time he could eventually use it but in other scenes people have used it easily. examples when odin picks it up and hits thrud with it and another scene is when thrud picks it up and flies off with it and in mid battle kratos throws one of the blades of choas into mjolnir and he swings it at thor but he dodges his own weapon. its really interesting to me how i think the weapon doesnt care who uses it because if mjolnir is sentient wouldnt it just stop and be like pulling a brick wall or is there a certain strength requirement the only other weapon that has stopped mjolnir fully is the leviathan axe sindri and brok made i know they made both weapons but thats crazy another weapon could match it maybe even fully outmatch it boc. overall the weapons are badass in the gow games. gow is one of the first games to get me into gaming. im talking like a kid young.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-01,it's just how this version calls the hammer. not everything is deep. it's an audible cue for you to avoid the thing when it returns while fighting thor.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-14,"mjolnir doesn't care about worthiness and isn't sentient. it's enchanted to act according to the will of it's master, as many of the godly weapons were in norse myth. the reason thor messes up the recall when he is drunk, is because he is drunk, and just like trying to walk a straight line is hard when drunk accurately summoning the hammer back is probably hard to manage for him while drunk. the hammer is just really heavy in norse myth, but not immovable. one myth literally revolves around the hammer being stolen by a group of giants, and thor having to dress up in drag and almost get married in order to get it back"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-01,"wrong, mjonir is drunk. you can see thor feeding him with mead when he shows up on kratos house"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-06,ahh yea mayojeer my favourite gow weapon
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-14,mjolnir caring about worthiness is a marvel thing. the actual lore doesn't even suggest it has a conscience at all. it is just a magic hammer. one only thor can wield because he's strong enough to.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-06,"worthiness means nothing outside of marvel, its just really heavy. the hammer does have a consciousness though, but thats different."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-05,i like that marvel made it a matter of being worthy.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-10,the a trace at the captions made it too obvious
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-28,"bruh, this is such a misunderstood fan. in norse mythology, no one has to be worthy to wield mjolnir. its just really heavy and thor is just really strong."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-14,"i wish thor made it  he had an arc that would make him and kratos removal the blood from their hands as they restore the greek and norse pantheon that would be sick ! hope somehow, his spirit is still in the hammer now guide thrudd"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-14,"the thing is, mjlnir is literally the same exact thing as ingrid. a sentient weapon. we see so when ingrid and mjolnir are fighting by themselves in the bar fight in asgard. ingrid and mjolnir both also speak. ingrid squeaks while mjolnir makes that same metal ringing sound while it flies. the weapons dont care who the wielder is as long as theyre pure of heart. so yes worthiness does work as the weapons are sentient and only know how to do one thing. kill. the hammer doesnt care if he does dumb shit, cause he knows deep down that hes pure like we see when he betrays odin."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-08,bro laviathan probably communicates but kratos cant speak to it
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-22,theres that one scene where mjlner fights ingrid without thors help
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-24,"mjolnir was drunk, art director said that"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-09,thats a big stretch. a more likely explanation is he can call the hammer with a gesture but a finger snap gives him peefect control ober it.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-29,imagine if kratos spoke to the chaos blades. how awful would that conversation be?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-10,"it may not be true, but i get the feeling he also snaps his fingers cuz its the closest thing he can do practically to a thunderclap."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-02,miojeer that hurt to here
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,"i have been playing for the past few days, and all i will say is.. stay tuned to this series  prepare yourselves. appreciate all support on this episode. enjoy"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,it looks like the devs have created yet another masterpiece and this might be my favorite portrayal of thor from any form of media of all time.

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-17,i really don't like freyas armor in ragnarok so am pleased about this new witches frock the most
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-14,so hyped
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,ill most def be doing another play through of ragnorok on the 22nd with the new skins the blades of chaos looks sick
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-17,i'm not expecting them to announce god pf war greek saga remastered on the 22nd. what i'm expecting is the announcement for gow 6 and the live action tv series
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-16,storys finished. still exploring and completing the favors. what should i do with atreuss freebies lol?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,see i dont blame santa monica i blame sony they just dont care about us anymore they could easily port the old games onto psplus without streaming and santa monica doesnt need to be the ones to remaster or thehy could just port the collection i mean xbox has backwards compatability with loads of games and they even put on banjo kazooie a game that ran on n64 but made it playable for new audiacnes sony only remasteres recent games like horizon
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-14,the cosmetics are just the devs' way for them teasing the greek era god of war saga to get a remaster and a release for pc.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,"all i want is god of war 1 ,2 chains of olumpus, and ghost of sparta remastered not even a remake just make them look like 3 and ascension and ill be happy"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-14,they should bringing back the melee skill tree from gow 2018 same goes leviathan axe and blade of chaos and able to customize the key binds after that skill tree expansion with new movement mechanism. also they should returning the lost runic attacks from 2018 that aren't present in gow ragnark. armour enhancement socket should be returning only ng exclusive. trinkets should be needed for little enhancement. the armour set that i wanted to see added einhejar midas ivaldi niflheim expansion valkyrie dark elf light elf also the pommels from 2018 should be returning from raganrk and purchase them through workbench. weapon level should increase capacity to 15.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-18,i wonder if we'll ever get fear kratos cosmetics
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-16,this game is 3  years old.what were they thinking
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-17,yet the last of us gets 14 remasters
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,would've preferred god armor.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-14,i'm fine with that. means ps4 users gets the content.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-17,bro their last game was when atreus turns into a teen that was so long ago. i guess we have to wait like 10 yrs for the next game ?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,i want the newer god of war 3 to come out
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,"awesome video, i've been following gow for forever now but leakers are letdowns lmao"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,i hope they make a remaster because all of the greek games except gow 3 can only be experienced on a ps3 or ps2
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,imagine if they put fear kratos skin in ragnarok you know what im talking about?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,"wow, how exciting. just what i wanted!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,! them! what a colossal disappointment! at least they should have revealed something about the next game!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-17,"sony doesn't love money at all,the easiest way to make a ton of profit from the concord is to remaster all greek god of war, the easiest cash grab for old to new players"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-16,my only question is is this just for the ps five or is it all for the ps4?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,god of hope.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-16,at least the god of war community is more civil than that stupid resident evil rumor community.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,i'm not seeing the avatar you mentioned.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,the end begins
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,sony been lacking lately like whats going on lol
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-17,"i'm not in the loop. if they haven't mentioned anything about the anniversary, leave 'em be, they are probably working on the next game. y'all acting entitled to something, instead of letting them cook for their next game. again, that is only if they haven't announced anything of the sort. they might not have the capacity for what the fans of gow are asking of them while maintaining a steady pace for the production of the next game in the franchise. edit grammatical errors"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-17,so those that mean i have to be on god of war during the update to have them
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-18,mjolnir should've been added in the update
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,maybe a new game will come out
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-16,we don't need anymore remakes. just make a god of war 6.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,"so instead of giving us kratos' classic original god armor from god of war 2 they give they give us the cosmetic from god of war 2 that no one uses? what??? not even going to squeeze kratos' breastplate from his days as a general? this some old bullshit. hay you know what? iv'e lost hope in sony the next god of war update, the only thing they'll give us is kratos' old cow fursuit if you know you know."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,is it available for ps4 too?!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-16,and the odyssey skin for kratos and atraeus how do i know if it free
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,"we need a remake not a remaster, like they did with resident evil or the last of us"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,so .. just a new look?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,anniversary is next week
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-14,take that jeff grubb! ha!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,how to use it
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,20 4  2025 not update for new armor for 20 years
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,yesssssssssssss!!!!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-14,i hope this isnt all there planning on doing with the best game series ever made and i just got done playing 2018 and ragnarok so not going to be playing it again for some time so this doesnt benefit me at all prey they make a new game
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-16,thelastblubberbender
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-16,wtf ? nobody wants this the game is old af why are you adding a couple skins.. dropped the ball with this one smh. shouldve gave the fans what they wanted instead they do the laziest shit ever
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,disappointing actually
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-21,i wisch remake to 2 and 1
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,so is it a new armor or skin ?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,so xbox port when?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-16,what how do i know if its free?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,handle
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-18,amr almedhwahi
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-16,i would like to have gow ascension to play multiplayer
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-16,im not mad just disappointed.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,god of war 3 remastered remastered
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,"honestly, i do feel like they're trolling us with this. revealing a potential remake later on just to screw with the leakers"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-17,boring give us a new game with a new pantheon of gods
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,merch and cosmetics? so nothing actually interesting.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,what a disappointment
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-18,empty hahaha. zeus
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-19,idc i want the new god of war
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,i didn't want a remaster of the original trilogy move forward im tired of remasters
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,subscribe for more god of war ragnarok content! secret steinbjorn armor might get nerfed httpsyoutu.be4zd8pgk7gu amazing secret items httpsyoutu.beguni5qmxvyi
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,so basically finish the game defeating the hardest enemies to get an attack that you wish you had since the beginning lol
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-01,"i just beat the game on gmgow, doing all the musphelheim challenges before beating the game, then finishing up the last few berserker fights. early mid game i used the bracers that increased stun damage paired with lunda's armor poison damage on punch attacksparries and the belt that increased poison damage. end game i used the armor that gave more damage based on rage, as you can go from like 3 hits max to 5ish if you have leftover rage when you lose all health, paired with the musphelheim gauntletsbelt that increased your elemental buildup, and the amulets that increase your max rage based on vitality. also a really good amulet thing to use is the one that improves your dodgeroll speed and distance. you can very quickly scoot away from the berserker aoe attacks"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-07,i used the poison armor set to beat the berserkers. i used the dragon waist guard to increase shield strike damage. and i used the status increase effect as well. i just kept mixing it up. the main thing is knowing to avoid the attacks. which the amulet to extend your roll distance is most useful.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-16,"just got this, used it on a mini boss, and can say it's the most op item i've ever used in a game"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-15,this and gna are the toughest bosses in the game. there's not much left to do in the game by the time you get this hilt. fingers crossed for ng.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-31,"for the bifrost berserker, using valor the health restoring rage also cures bifrost damage in case youre taking a lot of damage and the healthstones arent enough to keep you afloat"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-16,my top 3 favourite relicshilts in no order 1 hilt of hofud slows time 2 hilt of skofnung the one in this video 3 huldra project 9 mimir turned into a death machine
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,"got it last night. honestly some of those berzerker fights felt more like i won on,luck then skill. im on the second hardest difficulty so gmgow is probably a nightmare. since some of them are gank bosses with minions. the final one was honestly my favorite because its one on one against a very powerful enemy. and the relic is pretty powerful by itself."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,the valkyries imo were so much more cool and hard af to take down. i loved finding and challenging all of them in gow2018
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-05,"instead of the berserker chest piece, use giptumadrs breastplate. it has chance to reduce both runic and relic cooldowns by 70"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,as soon as i saw the waist armor in the thumbnail i knew what this vid was about. they give me a fight on standard  ive beat like 3 so far. i want that relic to use against them tbh  not after i struggle against them
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-01,this dude must be a god at the game when he keeps saying all these berserkers are easy
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,got the berserker armor at the end of my play through. need new game plus to use it as ive platinum the game already so not much to do
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,we need load out presets
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-17,for the jump attack theres a timing to it when the circle stops following you it means they're about to strike if its still moving with you then you gotta dodge when it stops
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-17,"the trick with the berserker jumping is to wait for his dialog during the jump to finish. as soon as he stops talking during the jump, dodge roll."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-06,"ok let me get this straight, i need to beat the hardest boss to give a weapon that i need to beat the hardest boss."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-20,cant wait for a new game  to use this set and other cool sets in a god of war difficulty run!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,"the only thing that i didnt like in this game is that i wanted that hammer! i still think about getting fire, ice, wind and shock."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,it doesnt matter if you play on story or hard difficulty side fights like gn or berserkers just for the platinum trophy will always be hard no matter what. you can really feel the diference in difficulty in the story not outside.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-16,"i had the berserker set on for a while till i finished the game 100, i then started upgrading all my gear, best stats on any gear surprisingly was the survival set you start with, hoped to have known that before i finished everything 100 so im letting yall know so my discovery will be of some use"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,these boss fights are really challenging. i'm playing give me no mercy and i've only been able to take down 4 so far. edit second playthrough i 100 completed the game on gmgow
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-21,if anyone cant beat them you can turn on miniboss checkpointing to lower their health
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-07-28,fable lost chapters started that ghost sword ability!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-19,"i think the raven armor with the surtr waist is the best combo for me. having that healing, even the small amount and the increase from the crystals is a must have. i've already 100 the game and used the raven armor the entire time."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-02-16,your videos never disappoint.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-15,seriously struggling with the berserker side quests. tips would be much appreciated
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-20,i was about to quit on one of the bosses til i seen the armor and cool skill now in about to go get them  thanks so much
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-16,"now even kratos got summon sword like dante, vergil and nero"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-01,"the battle with the 3 was the worst for me, i died so many times it was insane. then time rest were not that hard. and the king i beat with the lunda build. that was hard too for me."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-17,"i spent 20hrs to refight 3 berserkers sister in alfheim, and it's worth my time."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-05,"i'm taking a break before doing ragnarok, i'm amazed at how much stuff i ignored."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-11,can't wait to play new game  so we can use everything we worked hard to get after the story is complete.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-09-19,just picked this up a couple days ago just started it yesterday and just playing the starting chapter i'd say theyve outdone themselves on this one then 2018
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,a dlc with new bosses would be cool to use all this armours and skills.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-01,that sword relic paired with the wolves runic summon from atreus is absolutely oppoo
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-03,the sisters are also weak tough to there respective elements 851 i needed this for gmgow
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-30,great vid. thanks.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,we need a thesaurus for all these best armors
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-16,"thank you ,,good video 's!!! today i did the full armor from other video"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-18,"if you can get that sword, youre already strong enough to kill every boss of this game."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-15,"also skjothendi, one of the last ones you have to beat isn't just in a late section of the game.. you literally have to beat the game to get access to that berserker fight."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-06-04,"i appreciate the info, but his is a no go for me. tried to fight a beserker on easy and got crushed. same with gna, didn't even take half her life. it was absolutely demoralizing. if i got close i would have kept trying, but no. would have had better luck pushing a boulder up hill. at least the boulder might have rolled back, crushed me, and got it over with"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-01,the rond of purification is the best. no matter how much bifrosted u are its completely transferred to the enemy. real game changer
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-16,i got the platinum trophy for this game just today
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-02-24,409 .... really? i never ever payed attention to these tiny signs during the fight... i have to focus 100 on the enemies attack patterns...
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-04,you can fight the berserkers along the way once you get the sword hilt. you don't have to wait until after you beat the game. i've already beat a couple.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-16,man this is making me excited for new game plus
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,i need this now. struggling on fighting the maven atm
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-16,this is beautiful
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,nothing can beat the thrill of fighting sigrun on gmgow nothing
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-14,"anither tip is that it is, and i mean it is much much better to just run when the berserkers go up in the air and do the green circle attack, dodging is nearly impossible and in ng i would rather keep my dodge for the red circle attack after instead of getting stunned by the roll"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,dragon armour is my favorite
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-11,this game is hard as fuck. especially for a regular old dude that doesnt game as much as he did years ago.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-22,you to badly don't get that relic until you beat the wannabe king dead dude but i'm going to try it on the valkyrie queen and see how it goes for me.good video btw
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,"fml, i fought the beserker king last, after killing him i had nothing else to do, nice to see that the relic can attack hahaha"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-03,its damn nightmare to kill these berserkers... i tried nearly 40 times on normal mode with 1 and i have enough xd
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-19,run this with the health regeneration relic is pretty op and worked absolutely perfect when fighting the valkyrie along with the dual berserker battle.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-17,bruh i literally just finished the game today and i find this video afterwards
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-07-21,"comment no one asked for i wish the head smashing ability was back, which you need to hold r2."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-17,the dual fights are a pain i get kill quickly i haven't finished the game yet just doing that extra land where you fight the dragons so fun that land almost finished with that land. i'll try my luck again my defense it's close to 500 and strength it's over 300 hopefully i do those dual berserk does the realm shift works
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-15,"by the time you get this, there's only really one place to use it since there's no new game . i used it on gna. that's it."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-16,"this is so funny i literally wore the starting armor fully leveled up for the final mission and they give you a whole new armor thats just the starting but red, and its worse somehow"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-11,i posted my battle w the berserker king. took wayyyy longer than i wanted on it
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,"i know you guys say you play these games on normal, so that extra damage would probably be almost a 1 shot for people on no mercy and give me god of war difficulty. so i think setups will vary"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-12,this will be great for new game plus
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-26,can you tell me how you playing the game from the beginning and the power of kritose is full power ? please answer and show me the way and thanks for you with my best regards..
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-31,seems like it'll be great for ng
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-10-19,"aka a weapon that wouldve been helpful earlier in the game, but is useless now because all the hardest bosses  enemies are defeated."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-16,"i broke 2 controllers fighting the valkyries on give me god war. luckily, that's not the case with these berserkers."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-16,see me get excited thinking oh a weapon i can use to kill the beserkers fml
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,which armour did you equip while fighting the berserkers ? an important info know ?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,someone plz tell me what kratos is doing with mimir at 312??? i beat that berserker like 6 hours back and i still cant do whatever tf that is.thanks in advance!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-19,for me the best armor is steinbjorn set you literally become a boss for enemys
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-26,"only like? buddy, you deserve my subscription. you explain everything very well!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-27,skofnung is mine! you can't have it king hrolf
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-13,bro what difficulty you playing on? those health bars are plumetting so quickly
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-08,duude! where do you get that relic at?!?!  thats freaking insane!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-18,amazing game. tho its problem is the difficultyreward. i just did it on gmgow mode and zero reward. the story path felt like it was on normal too compared to all of the rest of the game. crazy how i stomped every single boss in the main story very easily on gmgow but got wrecked a lot by the simplest enemies out in the world. mad.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,"just one word, brother."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-04,i hope they put in a new game plus in this like the last game
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,is there no more tuesday assassins creed valhalla weekly update?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-30,kratos is the storm approaching with that relic
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-15,"ur confusing me, so use the hilt of swords or switch it to time rift?"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,"so the best relic is rewarded after beating the nearly toughest bosses in the game, got it"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-16,santa monica not playing around with all the variety of bosses this time lol.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-30,i'm stuck on the vanaheim crater berserker with the elemental shield. he just keeps wrecking me. i believe he's the last one before the king. but i'm still just under level 7 i need to find a faster way to level up.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-20,tbh i played both i felt gow2018 valkyrie was toughertook me sometimes to slave it
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-04,love your content but i am confused. in your video i see that your using the op relic on bersekers but i just unlocked the bettle with the king berseker and still haven't aquired that op relic so my qurstion is where do we get the op relic?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-06,who do you think is stronger the berserker or the valkyries?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-06,"so, does this game have a secret hidden weapon, like the ee infinity gauntlet in gow2018 or was that just a relic?"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-29,got everything did all berserker bosses just missing some treasures
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-18,just imagine hilt of skofnung x chaotic flury  rip boss
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-16,"very dumb question, is melee damage bare handed damage or any damage with weapons??"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-16,i already have the platinum and now i want new game plus
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-11,reminds me of the hades magic in gow1
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-22,the green aura in berserker looks like ivaldies armor from gow4
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,what difficulty are you playing though?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-01,if you want to beat the berserker you have to be almost max level because the tips wont work otherwise

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-19,did you get that orb yet? no linda no i did not get the fucking orb
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-06-29,things i personally hate in ragnarok doing chores in ironwood lunda asking for the orb everytime you havr to get something from her shop father you're on fire! but you probably already knew that
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-26,lunda is doing yall a favor your lucky you even get a blacksmith. plus she gave yall the best armor in the game for free
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,are we going to ignore atreus giving you hints before even figuring out the damn puzzle?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-26,that plant in vanaheim takes all the spots
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-26,"1  i didn't hate muspelheim trials, i liked it in this game more than 2018 2  i didn't care about nippleheim challenges 3  i didn't hate lynda"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-07,1. puzzles 2. vanaheim's plants 3. brok's death.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-19,"so, did ya get that orb yet spartan rage"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-26,ironwood two hours of picking fruit
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-08,dies from some frost attack atreus wow that looks cold
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-26,the worst part about god of war was the plants in vanahiem edit thanks for the likes
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-06,the actual things people hated about god of war ragnark 1. vanaheim plants 2. vanaheim feeling like a maze 3. vanaheim
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-25,1.ironwood 2.ironwood 3.not being able to fight the bosses unless you replay the game
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-14,"shes definitely no replacement for brok, but lunda is a god damn national treasure! brok would kick you in the shin if he heard you talking about her like that"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-07-18,"ya handsome, ya beefcake! lunda"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-21,things i hate about ragnarok 1. frickin puzzles 2. doing things in ironwood like why 3. vanaheim plants jumpscaring you
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-13,"bro said everyone and literally no one hates these things, i loved the muspelheim trials, and lunda"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-27,no she wasn't don't agree! lunda was a sweetheart she even told kratos do you mind me saying you look good  kratos says in his deep voice no!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,linking sigils that stupid grunt your partner makes when you run into them your stupid partner being absolutely useless in boss fights dumb lines when you die
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-11,nobody will ever replace brok. knowing how close kratos was to brok i dont think hes ever going to let anyone touch his axe again we miss you brok
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-26,lunda is not a bad npc at all
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-20,the fight against that green dude who jumps away and uses ranged attacks? f that guy. 50 deaths easily by the time i beat it my girlfriend saw me genuinely tweakin and i think she thinks less of me as a man because of the green bastard.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-21,those atreus missions took years off my life
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-24,"if you miss ivaldi's workshop, then something is wrong with you."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-28,none of these things bother me about gow ragnarok. the frequent moralism in the plot.... the pacing... the lack of much intense largescale action for the climax such as not getting to murder thor or odin brutally...
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-17,i didn't miss the niflheim challenges one bit lol especially fighting a valkyrie while your health drains from the mist
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-31,"one word, ironwood"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-02-19,lunda be like find that orb yet? yall still looking for de orb? hey hot stuff. remember.. i need that orb.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-08-06,"in the ironwood section where we go into the caves, i kept getting lost and went insane"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-26,lunda is such a good character wdym?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-11,"lunda so, dijja find dat orb ye uhh why is there a circle prompt above my head??"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-17,you forgot the grind that people have to go through in ironwood. lunda was actually a wise addition cos she is the only blacksmith you get after finishing the main game cos you lose both brok and sindri.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-09-20,you forgot to include every regular battle having 45 enemies vomiting on you andor throwing shit at you
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-03-03,this words still haunt me until today lunda have you found my orb yet?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-09,so nobody gonna mention that whole bit with angrboda edit i saw the comments. were all in agreement ironwood was torture.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-30,nah the worst part is when you have to play as atreus for 45 fucking mins lmao
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-18,"playing as atreus in general was absolute torture. like, it should be a war crime to play as him. the government should use this as torture."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-06-30,people are really crying over linda? she was so unnoticeable in the game i forgot she existed
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-06-09,lunda was not bad. people just were thinking about brok and sindri.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-27,"the three things i've seen people hate on the most in this game in no particular order just a little note here, i haven't actually played the game, but i watched it so the validation is kinda low 1. ironwood basically everything people hate about filler content 2. the plot basically railroading kratos with no control over what happens in the story like the previous games 3. those stupid puzzle solutions that treat you like a complete idiot on puzzles that aren't even that hard to begin with this annoys me the most since i love puzzle solving, but there's no point in having puzzles when the game basically does them for me dishonorable mentions bare fisted combat nerf, the vanaheim plants"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-13,"shoulda brought a pail of water, or tweny!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-15,"the real worst things in ragnark  the onesidededness of berserkers being able to interrupt most or all of your attacks, but you being completely unable to interrupt many of their attacks as they armor through whatever you try to do and take your entire healthbar in a single blow.  atreus jtunheimr story section drags on for way too long his other sections are fine in my opinion, but jtunheimr just takes wayyy too long.  how anti climactic the actual ragnark portion of the game feels after the swelling of the music when kratos blows gjallarhorn, the next few moments after entering asgard are very anticlimactic and severely lacking in music, with the actual music during gameplay sounding somber and sad the whole time, instead of what should be a climactic final battle, the biggest battle in history, a short yet gigantic war that's fated to end in a blaze of glory.  jrmungandr's venom not even getting a mention in regards to being fated as the thing that kills thor.  the exploration anxiety from stepping foot in the crater for the first time"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-27,not having a more complex unarmed combat like the 2018 version was kind of a bummer as well
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-26,1 i don't care much about the muspelheim trials 2 gow 2018 niflheim was a little annoying 3 lunda is cool but i miss brok and sindri the only thing hate about this game is the ironwood section and how long it is.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-07-11,still looking for that orb? i can still hear it in my dreams
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-20,nifilheim definitely had bosses and exploration before and after you destroy asgard. collect all ravens and then you will fight the ravens keeper in a series of battles.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-22,bruh i fucking loved lunda.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-26,bro lunda is cool. what i hated the most was the atreus gameplay. it was too boring
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-14,"the only reason why i hated linda is every single time im buying resources in a shop, she kept saying let me get my forging hammer she does this everytime i go to the special items."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-26,"fun fact lunda is lily, the att girl."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-28,"lnda   you should have brought a bucket of water ! or twenty  when you hear that for the hundredth time, it tends to make you mad"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-19,1 those damn light and dark elfs 2 ironwood 3 vanaheim all of above
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-09,the worst part of ragnarok was either the entirity of ironwood or those goddamn plants in vanaheim
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-26,i actually didnt dislike lunda
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-08,i think we all hated how they made kratos into a beta male simp
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-26,"only thing that irritates me about the trials this time is trying to remember which combinations you did already and which ones you didn't. nifelheim is...ok? i didn't care too much for the maze last game. lunda is more...forgettable than say brok or sindri, but that doesn't mean she's bad."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-06-07,"the only thing i hate about gow ragnarok 1. imbalanced, unfair berserker trio fight"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-11,whaaaat i love lunda man  if you get her orb asap all she does is gas kratos and freya up lmao. plus her armor makes some fun builds
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-05,lunda was brilliant. sending kratos on a quest to find a squeaky toy and then freya and mimir mocking him afterwards.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-19,i just wanted some more bare handed combat it was lit in gow4 and some bare handed executions
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-10,those stupid elves who literally fly away before you can even touch the button to attack. cowards
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-26,i haven't played gow ragnarok but it is sad to hear it doesn't have nilfhim part thing cause it was my fav thing after the main story line  the fact that i spent over 12 hours only there
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-26,"well i had a love hate kinda relationship with niflehim in gow 2018, i was very sad when it was replaced with just a training arena. and as for the muslpelheim trails yeah they were repetitive in 2018 but i still liked them a lot and hoped sms would do something better in 2022 but man do they dissapointed"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-03,thr trials only have to be completed 1 time each. you can do a warm up and immediately back out.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-09,no. 4 they nerfed midgard to the point where it was about half it size.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-10-23,mans got a bone to pick with lunda
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-08,"i liked muspelheim trials, i played them all on god of war difficulty on my first playthrough."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-06-10,"you got that orb? yall still looking for that orb? remember, im gonna need that orb."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-26,lunda wasnt that bad she kind of reminds me of my grandma so i find her very sweet honestly and the two realm trials areas not being as good did bother me a little but the game was so good it didnt bother me too much
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-13,the crater in vaneheim
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-08-29,one thing everybody hates about god of war ragnarok no helheim favors
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-10-28,"i'm still mad we didn't get to use mjolnir. i don't care if it was too easy to do, the hammer looked gorgeous in this interpretation and i wanted to use it. it's just straight robbery we didn't."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-29,"i dont hate any of these, but then, this little video was meant to spark engagement, so i guess you win here"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-26,he made us realize we love her you see his plot twist. he got everyone to say whats their fav
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-26,"when you realize that after done all trail once, you can just activate a trail and immediately interact with the monolith again to cancel it, but still mark the selected trail as combination."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-12,i actually loved lunda! thought her interactions with the boys were hilarious! especially when kratos convinced her she could keep carrying on about his muscles!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-03,yall still looking for the orrrb??
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-11,the worst was getting rid of brok!!! i literally cried and theyd better have a way to bring him back in the next gow especially if its in egypt. get him back!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-09,the only things i hate about ragnarok is gna battle. it's so frustrating when she attacked you from long distance
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-09-25,dont diss my goat lunda like that ever again or else were gonna have a problem
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-26,what i hated was the fact kratos wasn't much of a general in ragnarok. g got a burning rage for lunda
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-17,6 playthroughs later and i find these 3 things annoying all atreus missions blades of chaos clipping through black bear cloak that one berserker king that nukes the entire map only because hell be to far for a shield strike honorable mention would be vanaheim just vanaheim..
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-27,"i just wish there was more lore and information. i also wanted to see njrr, vili, v, ullr, and the other unseen gods."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-30,developer really wasnt thinking about the games replay ability.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-21,"ironwood for sure. and honestly, the crater."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-07,3 things that we actually hated  playing as atreus  heimdel  the plants in vanahiem
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-02-25,"honestly the only thing i hate most about this game is the bare handed combat. in the last game, i would mainly use bare hands because i mostly fought smaller and weaker enemies. i would act as if they werent worthy or strong enough for kratos weapons. only times i would use the weapons is when i fought enemies that were stronger and more challenging or if there were too many enemies to fight at once. it was fun using bare hands as my main weapon in that sense because you could do so much more with them in gow 4. now in ragnarok, i have to completely rely on the weapons for literally everything because bare handed combat is just plain bad."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-21,1 forced inclusion jotunn and vanir having dark people 2 boring ironwood 3 short ragnarok 4we needed more concequences to fix in the realms after ragnarok 5god of hope thats horrible 6 not showing the spring in midgard after ragnarok. 7. kratos not having good old rage sex with freya and having a new son vidar perhaps? 8 show us forseti damn it!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-08,i like how no one hates these things
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-21,"you forgot about one not being able to wield mjolnir. thrudd flying away with it was the biggest fuck you, use the axe instead."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-06,things we hate about gow ragnarok 1 ironwood 2 ironwood 3 ironwood
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-26,"the musphelheim trials in ragnarok were a lot more fun given they gave u more weapons and abilities, niflheim was annoying and lunda aint bad"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-03,things we hate about ragnarok 1 no mjolnir gameplay 2 no mjolnir gameplay 3 no mjolnir gameplay
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-05,i liked lona yall just babies she didnt think a god would care about getting a ball for her dog because all god she knew were asier gods. people cant break bad habits immediately you think someone like thor or any other god would get something unless it was actually valuable. but she wanted it to make her dog happy its the ends of times leave her be.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-09,one thing i do hate and miss is all the ruin attacks! they left quiet some out
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-28,cant be worse than ironwood gameplay
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-21,no niphilheim challenges   valhalla has entered the chat
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-26,ur speaking facts. i lovecthat u know so much about god of war
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-10-16,"i truly respect you for making these longer videos, absolutely amazing. i hate when people finish an entire game and smush it into a 1015 minute video. i love the time and effort you put into these."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-10-10,"didn't even realize this was a 40 min video, that's how good it was. well done brother looking forward to the next one!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-10-10,"god of war ragnarok is my favorite playstation game. up there with nier automata, elden ring, horizon zero dawn, okami, god of war 2018, and marvel's spiderman. edit here are some games i intend to play ghost of tsushima sekiro shadows die twice omori cyberpunk 2077 dragon ball fighterz miles morales powerwash simulator edit 2 1329 hey there i am"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-04-08,"vanaheim is one of those realms in god of war, ragnarok, where youre going to need to switch to the valor rage type because even in story those enemies can kick your  so i recommend when you travel to vanaheim in new game plus be properly equipped im talking a decent armor decent grip decent pommel decent hind and decent artifact all of that op !t if you dont believe me during a battle, one of the stupid poison things plopped on me and i basically died in that battle so be careful and good luck in vanaheim. youre gonna need it."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-10-30,my wife and i didn't platinum either games but we got every upgrade in both games and did all the side quests in both games i just love watching your videos man. keep it up

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-03,"only kinda negative thing about this video you did the hafgufas quest with freya and not atreus. the dialog between kratos, mimir and atreus basically about sex is funny af. i believe most sidequests were funnier with boy but sadly finished most of them with freya too cuz i did not think that atreus would leave me..."

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-10-13,so heres the thing. i had way more trouble with the berserker king than i did with gna. and i was dreading gna because i was told she was the hardest boss in the game. the berserker king took me 8 tries while gna only took me 3.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-07,1051 coldest kratos line ever broo
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-10-10,"3618 bro when i i say i howled laughing, glad i started watching your videos"

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-08-15,i never thought i could catch myself doing gmgow but after seeing people beat the game on the difficulty i tried it on ng and its thrilling
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-10-30,i found my hellish experience from dropping normal difficulty to easy for sigrun to be motivation to at least finish the plat on normal. i ended up having a rough time with king as it took many many attempts to defeat him. i rushed into gna though and killed her in my 4th attempt. thought i got lucky but i helped my friend kill her on his save file by stomping her in the first attempt. i still think sigrun was the pinnacle of gow bosses so far. great video though. was an amazing journey.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-02-20,"2500 yep, got me in the feels hard. i never played gow 2018, i watched the playthrough on youtube. i just got a ps5 finally and finished my first run of ragnarok yesterday on give me balance and only died about 20 times the entire game. beat odin no problem.and then i attempted the berserkers. what an absolute nightmare, especially the twin berserker fights. after nearly having a stroke i managed to beat them all. and then i made it to the king.what an absolutely infuriating boss fight. i stop counting after 50 deaths. finally beat him almost at the cost of my sanity. cant even imagine playing on gmgow difficulty."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-10-10,i'm happy i was there to see it live well most of it u did amazing and i had a great time watching u for 2 hours a week 3 days out my week to watch u it was so worth it  much love keep it up
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-10-11,"it was great to be on the journey with you, congratulations on 100k and can't wait for the next one"

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-19,"you got a new subscriber bro, love your content"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-19,"do you know that you'll get slightly different dialogue on side quest depending on who accompany you in said quest? between freya and atreus, i mean. one of the dialogue that hit me the hardest is the one where they went on and free some kind of jelly fish, if you did it with atreus, he would ask why he kratos did all of these, because atreus knew kratos was not really someone who's bothered by other's problem. mimir then said that maybe kratos did all of these to spend a little more time with atreus before sht hit the fans. and with that kind of ending, with atreus gone, all of that kinda make sense. it's like the writer's way to knit the story together and justified why kratos would want to do the side quest if the player choose to do so. it's so neat and well thought out."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-04-01,"i finished gow ragnarok on give me story i had no experience with gow prior games and even on easiest mode, beating gna and berserker king was hard. bit boy o boy, beating those people was satisfying."

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-07-31,"the thing i love with ragnarok is that we get to see more than once kratos slip back into the ghost of sparta. heimdall had every chance to leave and walk away, but since he was so arrogant he caused his own demise. when mimir tried to talk kratos out of it, he didnt want to hear it. he had already lost everything before and he was not about to let heimdall start him off at square one. this is what i call a great father."

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-10,did they make movies out of the games storyline or is it only in the game coz i want to bing watch the movies if i get a chance

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-05,"the god of war franchise is really a masterpiece... i am also stunned of kratos character development. he was once a brutal warrior, in servitude of the gods of olympus. before all he wants is revenge because of what happened to his family, what ares made him do but now, he is matured. he wants peace, not war. he is fighting for his son because he loves him and he wants to protect him. this is not just a game, it is a game where you can learn something also..."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-09,"10055 greatest hit ever. 250200 second greatest fight. 284430 best party ever. 300945 best father  son moment. kratos, as a father, understands that his son must be safe and away from any kind of deities from asgard. as the former greek deity of war, he knows that most prophecies always lead to war and destroying the foundation of their government. arteus only understands that loki is meant to find the other giants and bring about odin's demise. sure, he knows what his real name means, but his giant name shows him doing more than living as a man should. both of them had an interesting fate. and they each would bring about the destruction of certain rulers to change the life of everyone. god of war series is worth it."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-09,193836 kratos comforting his dogs is a fire moment and a small portion of character development u dont get to see when watching main stream youtubers who play just the campaign
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-07-04,atreus' voice actor is great in the immediate moments after brok's death. that half crying voice and slower speech he does is exactly what i sounded like the first few days after my dad passed away
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-01,now this was the most emotional and saddest game in all of the god of war. brock breaks us all.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,over 32 hours...dang. give this man a trophy.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-09,14623 when mimir asked brok how's life been treating everyone favorite azure valgrian? mimir was actually saying how's life been treating everyone favorite flower
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,legit better than most tv shows
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-28,love how much the creators showed the height difference between the gods and kratos.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-06,"it's beautiful. i've looked at this for 32 hours, 17 minutes, and 36 seconds now."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-30,"this game is a masterpiece, thank you for this"

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-15,i feel like i have been holding back tears so many times throughout watching this and they didn't have a moment to push me into a full cry but then 1081222 did it. this game is beyond incredible
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-29,so grateful that you do all the side missions and listen to the conversations. no other youtuber does that
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"mans really said part 1 and posted the entire game, absolute unit."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"i'm addicted to games too, but i've never seen a 1 day video on youtube, good job man!, hope you make more videos like this"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-30,10055 gotta admit the clash of mjohnir and levaithan was pretty cool

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,thank you for playing most of missions mk you're the best! please countiue playing the game there are still few things should be explored after ending
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-16,i just noticed the connection between thor saying this feels familiar when he and kratos create the thunderbolt to the thunderbolt we see in vanneheim. this game's foreshadowing and story telling is a master stroke.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"odin makes a perfectly reasonable request, that they not kill each other and mind their own business kratosno"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-07-16,truly appreciate these full walk through uploads.

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-06,shit man at 230000 something about kratos smiling and being wise hits hard
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-07-26,"absolutely excellence. all of the god of war story so far has been nothing but a masterclass of storytelling, worldbuilding and character development. i balled like a baby at the end of this game, and cannot wait for the next installment, whatever it may be."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-17,"291508 before and when brok got stabbed by odin also killed by odin as well the game completely forgot about brok's funeral, they also forgot when mimir solved brok's riddle the answer to the his riddle is a hole  what gets bigger the more you take away?? a hole"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-30,"when atreus tells his father to stop thinking like a father and start thinking like a general no no no, that's much worse"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-03,144830 kratos talk about pandoras box
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-08,i love watching you play. i know you do some editing but you still are a great player to just chill and watch. as long as you keep putting out content you will always have a fan. i legit watch ya and i am yelling pick up the health its right behind you. oh snap your gonna die....don't die. yeah i do this knowing darn good and well you can't hear me but it should be a testament to you game skills. your play style isn't perfect and i love watching ya. the only regret i have is that i didn't find your channel sooner.

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-01,love that this creator does the completion. i feel like only following the main storyline has me missing pieces.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-27,"the best graphics, fights, gameplay, greatest plot twist and most painful deaths. what a master piece."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-13,"it took me too long to finish it. meanwhile i also started and finished 100 the previous game, after watching it here 3 years ago. its a good game. memorable one which we are seeing rarely these days. wish the last battle was not this fast."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-16,11 hours in. great run. can't wait for this to port to pc. hopefully it will be as amazing as the original port.

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-07-03,"1011321  flashbacks to every god in the pantheon...the trauma of his past, and the mercy shown by just choking him to death rather than ripping his head off or taking his eyes out"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-15,i think this game nailed odins character. a god of extreme thirst for knowledge and obsession with obtaining it by any means necessary.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-03,"for those who have watched the whole 32 hr video  i watched, have you?"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-09,seeing kratos be nice to sindri and brock is like when handcock tried to be a good guy at the bank and started complimenting the officers

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-07-28,how i truly wish faye and kratos could be reunited.. the man deserves to be happy after the 500 kinds of hell he's been through. the true champion of the jtunar and finally redeemed as a hero. the new norse god of war.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-06-03,"i wonder, when kratos opened that box the first time back in greece, did it not only effect the greek gods but others who have such desperation."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-01,"i am a little over 27 hours in. thank you, for this awesome video walkthrough, first one ive ever seen before. i do wonder is there a part 2 to this after the 32 hrs  17 minutes are done? because i noticed this says part 1 and with how much seems to be left, i dont think 5 hrs more is enough time to wrap it up, especially when i havent even been to jotunhiem yet or asgard besides atreus short visit there"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,awesome... i have been waiting for this. thanks for playing and uploading

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-16,the best boss battle is kratos vs heimdall.... that's sooooo epicccc!!!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-11,when kratos stops holding back
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-14,"53 comments and most of them are just asking for the mod, so im just passing by to say thank you for the video! i grew up as a youtube gamer kid, never got to play only watch video, so a video like yours is amazing to watch. so well edited as well!"

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-11,prime kratos was insane
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-09,059 bro that kick was so fucking personal

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-16,"555 oh god somebody, somebody help the bearr!!! kratos kratos nooooooo"

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-09,nice to see other people rocking the only good looking armor in the game! the rest is too shiny and dont fit kratos at all

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-11,saitama
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-13,mod ?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-16,with all those stats you still play with gui on ....
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-10,"impressive, but lore accurate hmm kratos wasn't that strong. the guy had more struggling than that and the cutscenes don't count. i will say it still makes kratos the equivalent to escanor from the seven deadly sins anime. dmc5 dante or his family equivalent to meliodas and or zeldris. halo infinite maater chief equivalent to ban."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-13,"mod? anyway, i see this."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-10,"there is no gameplay, just cutscenes"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-14,"one shotting all of em, how is this fun?"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-14,nahh even the original lore accurate kratos take a time to kill his enemy and elite boss this is not lore accurate more like over power kratos possess by pandora power
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,all odin scenes here httpsyoutu.be49dzfkbpsg?sidubwwdrkxf54l1fz all thor scenes here httpsyoutu.beuvjvavfun6m?siagcptgduc43c2wq
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-25,"i love how you've got christopher judge kratos and ryan hurst thor duking it out to see who has the most intimidating voice, and then you've got richard schiff odin strolling into the room sounding like someone's uncle."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,the fact that odin talks for 6 minutes and kratos says no and refuse to elaborate is perfect
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-14,"i love how the very first scene of thor and odin shows you which one is the true bad guy. thor asks for permission to come in, brings a gift, accepts the offered seat and puts his weapon on the table as a sign of peace. he shows utmost respect for the host in his home, even if his intentions are ultimately to fight him. meanwhile, odin barges in unannounced, uninvited, takes what he pleases and struts around like he owns the place."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-14,059 if you listen closely with the volume up it sounds like kratos says hide mimir. cool detail.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,"if he tells you snow is white, he's lying i absolutely love this line"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,"thors tiny, tiny little emotional look away when odin says his sons were 'kinda useless' is quite telling."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,"bout time was such a brilliant line to start the fight with, acknowleding the audiences wait for this fight."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-06,odins you know who i am. as a statement as opposed to a question is maybe the perfect opening line for a character introduction. that single statement shows all you need to know about this guy.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,i love how they made odin. so passive aggressive. so intelligent and cunning. perfect
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,this encounter was surprisingly more civil than i was imagining.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,"odin lets make peace. kratos this game is called god of war, not god of peace"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-02-15,"fun fact at 1621 when thor throws his tooth out, if you go back to the frozen lightning bolt in that area youll see the tooth still sitting there on the ground. it stays there the entire game."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-15,"little things you notice the second playthrough  thor doesn't actually drink the mead because he's trying to go sober  you're no fun anymore is because odin could order thor around when he was wasted. now that he's sobered up, he's probably not obeying odin unquestioningly anymore.  odin cares more about the value baldur had than the fact that he was his son, quickly showing the player how selfish he really is.  huginn and munnin, odin's ravens, become his tattoos when he calls them back.  the camera almost seems to huddle behind kratos when thor is talking like whoever is holding it is pissing their pants in terror  the very second odin even acknowledges atreus, kratos reaches for the axe. no one threatens his boi."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,you seem like a calm and reasonable person never though id hear that ever muttered about kratos
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-16,539 i really like how when odin motions towards atreus its kratoss first instinct to reach for his axe. its a small but telling detail on his protectiveness.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-22,1126 this is the god that murdered a pantheon because they hurt his feelings?! even i was like damn! that hurt
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-08,"the camera pan to show the size difference between kratos and thor, before he walks inside, is brilliant. to the audience the whole halfgiant thing isn't immediately apparent. thor is just some dude rocking up to the house surrounded by lightning, welding a hammer to our imagination and knowledge of past interpretations. next to kratos, and we know how big kratos is thos is a mountain x"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,"one of the best boss fights in the entire series. he goes man to man with kratos, doesn't even pull out mjlonir until kratos has his axe back."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,the fake death into being defibrillated by mjolnir is the best thing ive ever seen. whoever came up with that should be immediately given some kind of medal.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-09,656 notice kratos putting his hand on the axe the second odin puts his on atreus' shoulder! full on dad mode!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-13,"when i first saw odin, i was kind of surprised. i imagined odin as an old and grizzled, but still physically intimidating warrior with a deep voice, not a small, fragile old man. but since odin was kind of a treacherous tricksterlike manipulator in norse mythology, i think the design and personality fits him. thor, of course, is badass. maybe the best depiction of him i have ever seen."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-28,"the fact that odin feels nothing for the loss of his grandsons and is only upset about the death of his son because he happened to be a useful asset tells you about his callousness. the way he looks and carries himself shows he's a talker, not a doer. and he's so slick with his appeals to supposedly shared interests that you know he's a master manipulator. such wonderful character building in just one scene."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,"a little detail i noticed is when odin already knows where to pull up a chair on the side even though he just entered the room. they really went with the whole all seeing, all knowing thing real good."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-15,gotta appreciate the subtlety of kratos and thor sizing each other up before thor enters through the door. 0 fear from either of them.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,the simple act of odin drinking from both cups at kratos' home showed me everything i needed to know about him. i love it.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,i like to think odin offering to keep freya off your back actually pushed kratos even further to declining it. he knows what freya has been through and as we see a little later he truly feels shes still an ally even when shes trying to kill him
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,ryan hurst did an outstanding job voicing thor i love the dialogue between kratos and him
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-08,656 the moment odin lays his hand on lokisuch a good dad
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-30,"these are incredible depictions of the characters. thor is a drunken, somewhat comedic old fat guy, yet an absolute powerhouse, and his entire personality is that he is odin's greatest weapon. odin is the head honcho, the great evil, yet he's so human, so softspoken, so polite. every cutscene with them is absolutely fantastic to watch."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-05,i was laughing way to hard when odin pulled up. the self defense line absolutely sent me since he seemed more charismatic then i was expecting.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-19,i just noticed that kratos' dialogue gets progressively more savage as the fight goes oni.e. you started this! i will end it! and then you will join your sons!. thor was already drawing out kratos' previous mentality.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-04-03,i love how thor share some of the wine to mjolnir
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,thor reviving kratos just to keep fighting him is the coldest shit i've ever seen
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-15,i love it at 655 when odin puts his hand on atreus and kratos first instinct is to get a hold on the axe. kratos always ready
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,thors design is really good now that weve gotten a better look at him. i love it.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-30,olympian allfather don't confuse this...object...this construction of hephaestus with your own flesh and blood. norse allfather this little shit.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-10-05,"if he tells you snow is white, he's lying. that line always gives me chills. it makes you wonder just how deep and thought out odin's deceptions can be."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,"i love how the reason kratos rejected odin's ultimatum is twofold, as explained in the journal one, most obviously, because mimir told him not to, and mimir is one of a very slim number of people who kratos trusts. two, and most interestingly, odin's promise to kill freya in return for standing down kratos still considers her a friend and does not hold her attempts to kill him against her in the slightest, because he knows he would do the same in her position. he refuses to side with her ex against her even as mortal enemies."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-07-03,"610 really love how odin's anger slipped through his voice when talking to mimir,it really shows his vengeful and petty side of him"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-04-05,imagine being in atreus's place and all the 3 of them looks at u like that 546
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,odin seems like a mob boss rather than a king of gods.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-07-12,"i love how, in his diary, kratos directly admits he was about to accept odin's offer until he mentioned freya because, in his own words, making a deal against her with her exhusband is unacceptable."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,couple little touches i love the fact that kratos and atreus made sure to hide mimir before thor walked in and atreus immediately grabbed him when he started talking and how every time odin steps towards atreus kratos grabs his axe. theres so much attention to detail in just this scene
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-20,"i love how mimir says if he tells you snow is white he is lying! pretty much showing that odins language is lies, even when he tells the truth, he is twisting something for his own selfish gain"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-03,"everyone is complimenting hurst for his incredible voice acting performance, but no one seems to be mentioning richard schiffs incredible job as odin!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-11,i've never played any god of war games but i could watch these cutscenes all day. the amount of detail put into them is a modern marvel.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-13,there he is.waves the hammer theres the god of war that line still gives me chills
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-14,"love thors line for mimir hes lost weight. not only clearly antagonistic humor toward his physical state, but also a reflection of how they truly no longer hold him in any regard whatsoever, further cementing odins offer for them to keep him. dont know for sure if this was the exact intent of the line, but brilliant nonetheless!!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-25,thor saying this feels familiar will mean so much more after you complete a certain quest line in vanaheim. this game is top tier
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,"if he tells you snow is white, he's lying! holy crap man idk why thats such a brutal, direct, and easy to understand warninginsult. comming from a man we grew to love and gain knowledge from in the last game, its just suuuper easy to be on mimir's side and take his word instantly no question! excellent delivery by the actor as well i love this!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-28,it's good that kratos whispered to atreus and said hide mimir xd
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-17,"i love the thought of thor explaining blood payments, basically revenge, to a dude that has been fueled by this exact concept for 3 games"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-19,thor 2018 bring me thanos!!! thor 2022 bring me kratos!!!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,"the fake death part was literally a fucking kojima made moment. like, i wouldn't even expect that in this game. genius moment."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-18,the first 7 minutes of this scene felt like a tarantino film. the absolute tension building simply from thor and odins presence even being in kratoss home is palpable for the moment thor asks if he can come in.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,"i stumbled upon a quote from the book the white raven from robert low i had forgotten that, while thor hurls his hammer from stormclouds, odin prefers his strike to come out of a calm sky. the way thor announced his coming with earthshaking thunder and lightning while odin simply knocked on the door... it just perfectly mirrored that quote. i absolutely love the writing of this game. and the casting, the acting, you can see thor's pain in his every move. i think thor is the best thing about this game. so well written and portrayed."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-04,"if you look carefully, when odin raises his voice and slams his hand on the table about what kratos did to thor's sons, thor actually looks like he is about to agree with what odin was going to say. like he was hoping odin was going to say something about how kratos needed to pay his debt to his sons. but then thor immediately showed resentment when odin says that it was self defense for what kratos did. it's very small to notice but it's a very realistic detail for gowr"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-13,"the va they got for thor sounds so freaking amazing, i swear when hes not shouting and just speaks calmly, he sounds like josh brolins thanos, god like"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-20,"you can actually see odin's ravens found mimir before he even walked in the door. odin is literally his birds, they are him. he pretended to not know where mimir was to keep the illusion that him and his birds are seperate."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-06-05,i love the fact that odin is voiced by richard schiff. it's so perfect. i also love how thor knows who kratos is and his past. that was a great touch.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-02,"400 love his tattoos appearing on his arms when the ravens return to him. such a great detail, definitely a labour of love."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-25,you know my past?.. then you know what im capable of! kratos is with all the smoke! also the simple no after odins whole peace pitch kills me . just beat the game last night. immaculate.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-20,thor using mjlnir as a defibrillator never gets old. lol!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,i like how the norse gods are kind of being presented as like a mafia family unlike the greek gods who were like a royal family edit dang thats a lot of likes
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-21,"on a rewatch, thor refusing to drink mead takes on a new meaning when we learn he was trying to stay sober. not only did odin mock thor's sons as worthless right in front of him, but he also mocked his son for trying to stay sober."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,"didn't really think much of odin's design but after seeing more and more of his character, how manipulative and conniving he is, i totally dig the design."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-25,"i love how well these games show kratos' strategic side  he may not be tricksy and manipulative like odin, but he is always evaluating the situation and thinking ahead. at 334 when odin knocks, you can see him do the calculation  address the unknown threat but leave atreus with an unsupervised thor, or have atreus deal with whoever's at the door and bear in mind, last time this happened it was baldur but never take his eyes off thor. it only takes a moment, but he rightly deduces that until proven otherwise, thor is the biggest threat."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-11,"833 not going hard, i wanted to hear all dialogue. i'm not judging you the dialogue's the best part! the voice actors really earned their keep with this sequel!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-12,one little detail i lovethe wound that kratos inflicts when he hits thor in the gut never actually heals. he still has the wound in every subsequent cutscene. shows you the craftsmanship of the huldra brothers
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,"god, i was squealing on my couch like a fanboy when odin came in. i was so happy that we finally got to see odin after all the buildup in the previous game, and so soon in the game, no less. i was wondering for a second whether mimir would be part of this conversation, and thankfully, he was. he made a wonderful addition past foes reunite as bitter blood boiled. and thor, god he was so intimidating. his voice almost sounded like thanos. it reminded me of inglorious basterds, when landa entered the french home and conversed with lepedite, with even casually pouring drinks being an act of tension. it really set the mood of how dangerous and important this meeting was. it was all wonderful!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-06,i always found it hilarious how everyone was slamming everything on the table
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,"i like how this showed how strong thor was at first, he actually murdered kratos but brought him back"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,hurst's performance as thor is amazing.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-29,"you know the one detail that a lot of people miss the first time, myself included, is the fact that by saying no to the deal, kratos was actually protecting freya. he knew that if he accepted the deal, even if it could be trusted, it would be at the cost of sacrificing freya to them. so instead of making her a target, he chose the harder road instead by making himself the target. honestly, there's so much subtlety and nuance to these characters' actions that i can't help but admire the hells out of it. good job devs!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-18,"i love how odin comes in a says how about peace and isn't kratos so nice to not point out i found peace until your son balder came looking for a fight and your two underlings came with him to stir the pot. i found peace and it was you who made war, which i'm going to finish"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,"at 740 the sound of that hammer is just so ear catching!! i love how it started to sound, it warmed up before it reached thor's hand and knocked kratos through the roof!!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-25,i love that thor sounds so modern style pissed in the fight sometimes dumbass.  the fuck you say?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,"this fight with thor is everything i hoped for a first fight, can't wait to see more"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-17,the small detail of kratos putting his hand on his weapon whenever odin is near atreus is such a good detail.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,"i haven't seen any comments about this. but their approach on odin gives me massive hades from disney hercules vibes. that slimy, cunning, mob boss vibe. love the way he says you silver tongued little shit"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-06-17,you have to love the little attention to detail like kratos reaching for his axe when odin put his hands on atreus shoulder ready to defend him. every gow story is so incredibly well told. i dont know if theres a video game hall of fame but every person whos had a hand in making each and every game 15 deserves to be inducted. absolutely incredible.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-10,seeing all the cutscenes with odin..he gives off the ruthless ceo vibes
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-19,that cutscene at 1315 when they clash and walk in circle was too good
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-25,"coming back to this, 1348 when he said this feels familiar cos it is. a side quest when kratos finds reasons why theres an identical iced lighting in vanahiem, completing the quest reveals that faye and thor fought too, with the same weapons clashing, causing that iconic iced lightning. pretty cool detail that you'd just brush off when watching this for the first time."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,"if odin wasnt afraid of kratos he wouldnt have tried to end things peacefully first, hes terrified ragnorok is upon them"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-12,"i love the script and direction of this game. 313 when thor says kratos seems like a calm and reasonable person he then asks him if he's truly like that while looking at and touching mjolnir, threatening kratos"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-16,i love the rage look on kratos face the moment thor says and your boy 1600 the strength that it gave him is insane
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,"let's take a moment to analyze this little meeting odin and thor come to kratos's home, invoke sacred hospitality, let him know that they are well aware of who he is, and try to negotiate for peace, what with odin's offer being surprisingly reasonable regarding his terms he knows kratos is more trouble than he is worth, and attempts diplomacy first, because kratos actually has a strong position from which to negotiate in the first place however, in their brief exchange, odin shows just how casually callous he is about everything and everyone, ranging from his own family to his exprisoner to his exwife kratos needs only 3 minutes to get a grasp on odin's character, and this is enough for him to decide that, even though his deals sound appealing , he wants nothing to do with odin he is not someone he can trust as for thor, he is just as callous, if not more, and it's clear he's only bothering with hospitality and diplomacy because odin calls the shots he not only mocks kratos for trying to be a good father to his son, he gleefully admits he couldn't give a hot shit about being one himself his only interest is having fun, even at the expense of everyone else he is well aware that kratos singlehandedly decimated an entire pantheon, and this only makes him grow excited at the prospective challenge he only leaves kratos alone after he shows a glimpse of his power as the god of war, of the ghost of sparta his bloodlust is sated for the moment, but it's clear that soon he will be back for more oh, and kratos is clearly disappointed in atreus for searching for tr, like that's not asking for trouble he doesn't say anything he doesn't have to at this point he does, however, put his hand on the leviathan axe when odin points at him, subtly indicating that atreus is still his son, and that threatening him is a death wish"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-09,i am absolutely speechless of how good this looks. incredible.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-20,literally one of the best scenes of all time in gaming unbelievably well written
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-26,i love the moment at 1036 where thor snaps to summon mjolnir to block kratos' blow. shows he's not merely a brute but a seasoned warrior capable of learning his opponent's patterns quickly and his level of absolute control over the hammer.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-20,539 love how kratos reached for the axe when odin got a bit too close. man is a pro
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-23,i like how odin sends thor and two ravens that fly in while the door was open. the ravens see if it is safe and thor to handle the situation in case kratos is hostile. only after odin determines that kratos will not out right attack does odin make himself known.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-15,353 me going over to my childhood friends who i havent seen in 6 years
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-20,the axe and hammer throw was some movie shit bro damnnnn
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-06-29,"shit, ill even sweeten the deal they low key were one writer away from odin saying bro"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-09,that door knock  335. odin was playing mind games before even entering the frame.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-16,"from 221 to 241, you can see one of odin's ravens looking under the bed, which is how odin knows that mimir is hiding there. that's such a cool and neat detail!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,"odin's drip with that jacket cape, they did him justice alongside everything else voice, mannerisms, personality. contender for goty here."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-28,the way she covered recruit's eyes
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-28,exboss  why do i hear boss music from that man? wasn't i supposed to be the boss here?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-08,"kill was so brutal, doomslayer joined with his chainsaw"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-26,the finisher on those wolfenemies is crazy. tearing them apart by the jaw is brutal.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-18,a move only calm and reasonable men would make
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-07,"doom slayer mind if i join in? kratos sure, no problem"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-03,i see he has acquired the chainsaw of olympus.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-07-15,"aw, the way she covered the little guys eyes, it's quite adorable"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-06,you hear kratos' boss music. know there's no hope left for you.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-06-03,i love how freya covered recruits eyes like he's a precious baby and innocent
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-22,i remember playing this and my dad walked in while i was finishing someone. he looked at me and i just said kratos gets a little mad.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-17,you thought i was in here with you? evil maniacal laughing intensifies
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-28,freya being a good mother to recruit i see
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-03,she really just covered recruits eyes like she had a new son
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-03,"you were one of the heros, arent you?  not any more"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-18,he seems like a calm and resonable person
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-28,"how did he get a damn, chainsaw."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-29,love it that we went from  to r3
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-20,"berserker king please, have mercy! kratos sorry, all out of mercy."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-13,when the music kicked in was glorious
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-15,ngl the moment when you finally get the berserker soul down and you just see that beautiful r3 above his head is a well deserved moment of rage and happiness
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-28,wait till the circle appears above freya
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-05,when the boss hears boss music
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-21,i want a game where the enemies can see the execution button floating around them like they know they're cooked and there are just many different reactions to it
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-06-11,that moment where kratos just pulls out the axe is bone rattling and awesome at the same time
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-02-03,i wouldve died if kratos pulled out a dualsense controller
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-29,damn recruit got a hole future ahead of him
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-18,"when youre a boss fighting kratos, he doesnt hear boss music. you hear boss music"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-28,you know your screwed when you see l3 r3 or a circle above your head
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-04,pressing r3 against those fucking berserker souls was the greatest feeling ever i stg
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-03-22,doom slayer in the back smiling and being pround of kratos because he used chainsaw
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-27,"freya don't look, luv..."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-10,game dev puts r3 on freya's head kratos ourah. clapping noises
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-02,its such a crucial part of the game. the brutality he inflicts adds to the atmosphere. it truly feels like youre a god when you destroy bosses

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-23,"this and god of war 2018 are some of the best examples on how 1010 can mean totally different things to people. god of war 2018 is as close to flawless and perfection as you can get hence why it's deserving of a 1010, god of war ragnarok in comparison has some flaws especially in regards to ironwood, but the game is much bigger in scale and has many more highs than 2018 hence why people would still give it a 10"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-24,gow 2018 and ragnarok are two of my favorite games of all time. probably the most meaningful story in a game ive ever played. man i love this game.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-05,i would like to add that the crater part is such a magnificent part of the game. its like it is its own realm waiting to be explored and having so much side content.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-23,absolutely still love this game but probably the biggest issue i have is the event of ragnarok itself. it didnt feel like a war but felt like a small skirmish. like the odin and thor boss fights were still hype but compared to baldurs where were fighting ontop of a dead giant was really missing that scale. wish we were fighting thor ontop of the wall ngl. overall tho i still like the game
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-23,"2304 you can transmog your amour btw, you just have to upgrade it to level 9 before you can apply the appearance of any other armour. that still kinda sucks tho"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-24,"i think one of the biggest issues is that this game should've been split between two games. if we had a trilogy, the final battle would've been better designed"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-28,anything that breaks the plot line happens  brok that's finbulwinter for ya!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-24,"gow 2018  1010 gow ragnorok  810 its very good, but the story was better in the first game. i also didnt need the very long ironwood section or most of the atreus sections."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-24,"i wish most games are reviewed with this much passion and thought behind it. keep it up bud, youre reviews are top notch"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-24,"i think the game would be perfect if on replaying it or on ng you could have the option to skip atreus levels. or at the very least, ironwood level"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-24,imo they should have never switched creative directors or whatever cory barlog was. almost every playstation exclusive sequel for the ps4ps5 was made with a flaw that made it inferior long term to the original
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-24,the story would have been better if the atreus sections were removed.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-24,the could have made the war a whole single game and im sad they didnt. still enjoyed the game a lot
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-24,whats crazy is odin is seriously addicted to controlling everyone. he could have so easily killed kratos and freya while they were sleeping. he just couldnt let go of his want to use everyone
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-23,"i absolutely love this game, i played it so much and re did the story a lot. the only two problems i have with it is the iron wood mission, the first time it's cool since we're discovering but redoing the whole section is awfull. and the event of ragnarok itself. other than that, im sorry to say this but, it's a perfect game im biased asf"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-24,love this game but replaying the atreus section with angrboda is such a drag. hate that section so much.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-24,"i liked to play as atreus. but the jotenheim bit was dragging. like i went back and replay it, and it truly felt like the angreboda adventure felt slow"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-26,"my problem with ragnarok is that it's passing and ending are abysmal, to the point i avoid replaying it, thanks god valhalla exists"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-26,tyr and odin are the same character and when you realize that in a second playthrough you gain a new perspective and appreciation for odin's character
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-24,"i played god of war 4 for over 4 years straight, while i dropped ragnarok in 4 months"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-24,"i hated playing as atreus, and the final battle of ragnarok did not live up to the hype even though it was still very impressive"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-07,2018 was one of the best narrative experiences of my life. ragnarok was an improvement in literally every conceivable way
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-08,"fyi it's not the 5th installment of the series, it's actually the 8th. even 9th, if you count a call from the wilds"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-23,oops i think you accidentally put the word 'flawed' in front of 'masterpiece' in the title
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-12,"atreus mission suck, really suck, if there was an option to skip them no1 would play them"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-24,"to be rare i also blame covid for the rusted story dont get me wrong i think this game is great and is just a good as 2018, covid did stop production a lot and that was really unfortunate."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-03,"odin was a monster from the first moment he mentioned his grandsons and baldur. atreus doesnt know well enough to despise him, but plenty in the audience were like kratos and rightfully wanted nothing to do with him."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-24,"3243 what, honestly what do you even mean here, its freya's story, her mission, obviously you need freya here, this point makes no sense."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-28,"the first god of war and jedi survivor did this really well re world design play dark souls 1, bloodborne, sekiro or elden ring"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-01,"this definitely should of been a trilogy, it had the potential to. but what i would give this game is the emotional key moments. such as when kratos had his last dream with faye or when he saud goodbye to his son. these scenes actually made me cry."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-25,"man, imagine how much more impactful would the ending be if loki left as an actual young man in third game, rather than still a teenage child."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-25,i hated how ragnarok was just a small backyard fight full of colors.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-24,it is very storynarrative driven vs 2018 being more character driven but i think they balanced it very well
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-26,the og kratos is simply unmatched
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-24,the chain kick was everything
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-29,"the problem with odin is, you never really have to second guess, if he is truly evil. this whole cool grandla act is entirely unbelievable, because we know he tortured mimir every day for a hundred years. just sick to the core maniacs would do sht like that."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-24,"i think part 1 is better because its more replayable aldough you have less choises, but ragnarok was very nice as well"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-24,im literally just finishing this game today
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-24,if not for elden ring being a once in a decade superstar it was dropping in the same year ragnarok definitely wouldve won. i think it deserves game of the year if it came out in just about any other year
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-04,god of war 2018 is a bonafide masterpiece but ragnaroks story imo is absolutely abysmal great side missions unbelievable gameplay but the story was absolute garbage
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-02,"i love seeing these kinds of videos, you should do one on tomb raider,silent hill 2,re4,rdr1,detroit become human gta or ghost of tsushima"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-18,maybe this should have been a trilogy but the way they wrote the story so that it made sense as 2 games was genius
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-24,this could have been a proper trilogy even though i have enjoyed this game thoroughly and my only platinum till date
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-10,"i love 2018 and this game. i said it in 2022, i still say it every time i play through the game now  there is absolutely zero reason ironwood needed to be an hour and a half long."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-08,this is a game you need to play twice. you will pick up so many subtleties with tyr and his twist.. plus i think kratos altered fate when he refused to kill the innocent in asgard.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-22,"my main critique of odin is that he should've been introduced earlier which goes back to what you said about the 2nd and 3rd game being compressed. i think it hindered the process of wondering if odin wasn't as bad as previously revealed. if we met odin earlier, and saw more of him being good, maybe even giving counters to mimir and freya's points, thereby questioning who is the good guy and not. i think that would make the reveal and the nope of course he's evil at the end work better."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-29,"i am glad this video was critical of the game. it really was a huge let down for me. specifically because of the story. why would odin blow his cover like that, even though everything went exactly according to his plans. why would kratos take atreus to the destruction of a realm without a secure exit strategy? why would they want to destroy asgard only to kill odin, the one guy who can leave the damn place whenever he wants to? this is such a big point, it justifies repeating why did our heroes suddenly actively persue ragnarok, even though they have no problem with the realm, just with odin? why would they not just use fenrir to travel to asgard? why is kratos lauded after needlessly destroying a 9th of reality? why was the big forshadowed fight between thor and the snake the most underwhelming thing imaginable? why is it okay to kill all the animals in asgard after the game spent hours and hours teaching us about how wrong animal cruelty is? why would atreus go to odin after hearing that this is what happens before his father dies? why would odin want to trap the moon, if he knows that freeing it is another puzzle piece towards ragnarok? why would kratos say no to peace between him and odin i know he does not trust gods, but this is not him selling his sole, just an agreement to peace? i swear, there is so much in this game that does not make sense at all."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-24,this came with my ps5. it was my reintroduction to gaming after the ps2 cycle. i love it and hold it close to my heart. i also appreciate the ragnarok dlc to just get into the action.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-20,"me personally, i prefer this story. i loved getting to know thor and his daughter, as well as the rest of his family. how kratos went from being cold to overprotective although that happened throughout both games also loved the spear, the first weapon a spartan learns to use. the only issue i have is odin's boss fight, it felt so anticlimactic and not as strong as everyone made him out to be. like i defeated him first try while i had issues with other bosses. my first playthru i almost never used the spear but when the dlc released, i played through it again and actually loved it a lot, i mainly used it in the dlc too lol"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-25,i hope you have a great christmas
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-25,kratos killing heimdall mimir  this isn't who you want to be  kratos  it isn't who i want to be but it's who i have to be
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-23,"i'm a huge fan of the series, and i have to agree that ragnark felt slightly rushed. it could've been a trilogy. i feel that all media in general are working to meet fans expectations, and the whole egypt talk was going on even before ragnark, they decided to cut it short. and where i do agree a trilogy would be better for the die hard fans, it would've come with the moaning and bad critics of people that want something new, all the time, right away. and this is why we can't have anything nice anymore, not good video games, silly sitcoms or tv shows, movies, etc... but i really appreciate your break down of these 2 games!"

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-26,"i agree with you virtually 100. it's a rocksolid game, but between the rushed story, being compared to gow4, and a light sprinkle of dei bs sweet baby inc loved to advertise this, i was a little disappointed by this game. that, and i buying a ps5 for this game only to be a little annoyed several months later that it would have been fine with my ps4 and said ps5 is collecting dust isn't helping."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-26,"the game was cruising along to be near perfect, until the events of ragnark. for most of the game, ragnark was built up to be this mega warevent that lasted days and i was looking forward to 510 hours of battle with some pauses for planning and character building. but the game severely disappointed me and ragnark was so underwhelming. and just as most people think, this game should have been split into two. the battle alone should have taken up 25 of the game, imo."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-23,funny how i just watched the 2018 review 3 hours ago and now this one just released
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-24,the one thing i wish they didnt cut out was the fists. my favorite part of gow 2018 was punching the crap out of enemies
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-19,on harder difficulties the berserks are harder than the valerkies because they have other enemies with them or you fight 23 berserkers. 1v1 is way easier.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-14,i can forgive the atreus section even though the ironwood date was brutal to get through and even worse on a second playthrough. what i can't forgive is the ragnarok final battle being so lame. why weren't we riding fenrir up the world serpent to try to reach thor before he hammers it back in time? why couldn't we team up with thor to try to stop surtrragnarok before odin killed him? why couldn't we get even a small glimpse of the green crack whatever it was before closing it? what was the point of it being there at all? it was the battle of the gods and it was over in 90 minutes... are you kidding me? ugh... what a shame.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-06,"what i really hated was the camera, its way too close, for the sake of being cinematic? after half the game when i did most the optional bosses i was fed up and installed a cam mod to zoom out to normal levels and the game feels so much much better."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-18,one thing i never hear mentioned and my only problem with the gameplay the axe doesnt sound or feel as heavy. the axe had so much weight in the 2018 game in this it feels like it lost like 20lbs. it might be a nitpick but the axe is my favorite weapon and i felt like it was downgraded.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-24,"i'm not in love with ragnarok as a package, but you're spoton about odin. richard schiff should've gotten best performance imo. they did such a good job of making me want to trust him despite all i knew about him. they completely subverted my expectations of him. i think he was the best part of the game."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-04,"i love this game so much gow is my favorite franchise, since gow 1. i believe the only thing that could improve, it would be the ability to skip cutscenes."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-26,"god of war ragnaroks hype was massive, wanna know what else is massive?"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-02,"i disagree about odin, for me he is a terrible character. i liked the idea too of him being a smart old man manipulating people but for that to works odin should be smart which is not because the guy is litteraly trying to avoid ragnarok, hide under tyr appareance he know everything of what we are doing and when he clearly know that kratos make a weapon draupnir specially to kill heimdall he still send heimdall to vanaheim instead of sending thor or anyone else or atleast dont let heimdall go with the gjallarhorn, idk how we can think odin is a mastermind is a total idiot he is litteraly under cover the all game and didnt do any trap or get any advance on kratosatreusfreya actions... and i will add to that, odin being a mastermind has a threat will works with thor being a real physical threat complementary to odin which is not the case im sorry but thor is not scary in this game he is just a broken guy i never feel he was dangerous to kratos and he is not even has god of war 2018 tease him, extremely powerful, dangerous, ruthless, in ragnarok he is just a drunk fat guy who's getting judged by his wife and daughter and roasted by his father we are really far from the guy who praticly beat to death his son because he failed in the previous game... i mean really there is reason why heimdall is still the only fight we remember more than the ragnarok and the two last boss its because he really looks like a threat compared to the disapointing duo thor  odin."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-24,ive played it ove loved it ive cryed for it and im still have the soundtrack on my spotify playlist i miss this game so much it was perfect
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-29,hi the ability where you can change the look of your armour is available in ng. once you start ng its there in the appearence. it should have been available in the non ng. i agree with what you mostly said about the gameplay. sometimes i felt the characters were too manybut ig it was the final war so they were bound to be??? apart from that once i reverted back from atreus gameplay the story felt so completely different the pacing was also different. im guessing 2018 had a lot mysteries which were revealed in this but they didnt live up to the hypejust my opinion.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-11,"i agree with your take on gameplaycombat, but i would say that there are some unfair difficulty systems. systems i don't like that make combat both harder and easier. i experienced these issues in the no mercy difficulty. i really didn't like the enemy tracking. it's when you do a roll dodge from an attack, but the enemy in question breaks the laws of physics and curves to you midair like a magnet. they already started their attack, you roll, and the enemy tracks and hits you anyway. it feels like the game decides that an enemy will hit you no matter what. there are also moments that feel too unfair. you get hit once, and kratos is stunned so long that a single enemy can chain his attacks and keep hitting without you being able to do anything about it. there were so many times that i went from full health to basically dead because an enemy could hit me once, and then chain hit me because kratos keeps being stunned. then in the other direction, the game would constantly babysit you and alter the difficulty dynamically. in a single combat encounter, after many attempts the game starts giving you more health than you originally started with. than it becomes clear that the attack patterns from the enemies become easier. they attack less often, and use attacks that are easier to block. sometimes they even reduce the amount of enemies there are. the game also dynamically scales difficulty over wider areas based on your recent performance. some areas can be much easier than others because the game decides that it was too hard. because of this, the difficulty feels incredibly inconsistent. i also don't want them assisting me when something is a challenge. if i end up beating a group of enemies just because they clearly made it easier, it's the most unsatisfying feeling. this is what i mean with that there are systems that make it both easier and harder that make the combat inconsistent and frustrating at times."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-30,gow 2018 quality over quantity gow ragnarok quantity over quality
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-16,"i mean before i watch the whole video, some issues i had are  mid section of the game, no skill tree for shieldfist combat as that was quite fun in the first game oh and i mean i didn't mind it too much i don't have as much hate as everyone else does but that atreus section in the woods was long other than that the beginning was amazing keeping that kinda atmosphere would have been amazing and the ending was also amazing, some more atreuskratos combos would have been fire as those moments are spectacular. but i think both games for me are a 1010"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-25,"i enjoyed the game, i just wish that it wasn't rushed. i wish they did a trilogy."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-07,"this is simply the same game, an extension.. same battles.. same...everything with a different colour...how disappointing... both last gow should have been one game..."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-18,"yup. every single problem with gowr can be traced to its condensed nature. its just rushed. i really wish it was a trilogy. otherwise, its a pretty damn good game. the concept of the story is really awesome, and it would have been perhaps, the best story in gaming, if it was not so rushed"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-24,"rag is not a masterpiece, its a solid 810"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-16,so basically the game is bad because its so good you literally want more of it but it isnt longer
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-23,great vid. ghost of tsushima next pls
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-03,"definitely agree with most of the main points in this video. the scope and ambition of gowr is remarkable, especially from a gameplay perspective. but pacing is all over the place, making it thematically incoherent at times. i actually kind of disliked the ending for this reason. create your own destiny feels like a platitude from a disney movie, and it sidesteps meaningful reflection on earlier themes of responsibility and sacrifice with an overly convenient resolution. still, the characters are great odin being a fantastic antagonist, the diverse environments are really fun to explore, and the combat takes things up a notch. absolutely a banger game, despite its flaws."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-26,"my grips with the spear is that he replaces the bare handed combat and solely exists for a stun build, it has his merits, but it didn't need to be a replacer for the bare heand even if its better overall"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-24,he really said cory balrog! awesome
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-27,"i did not play this game but rather watched a playthrough, and honestly i did not have any issue with the pacing or the angrboda ironwood section. i loved all of it, the slower times and fast paced final battle. that said the final boss fight did seem less grand that i wouldve liked, and actually the amount of side missions annoyed me, at least while watching jacksepticeye play through them xd"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-03,im looking through the comments and either people call it a masterpiece or majority flawed. the story is great with some weird parts that couldve been better. but it was the gameplay that killed it for me. 2018 fighting just suits me better. also you are correct they made a huge mistake condensing this into 2 games instead of a trilogy. it was just odd and short sighted.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-30,"the title and review is a fair way to put it. it is a flawed masterpiece. overall its an amazing game, great story, great graphics, but definitely has some flaws that i think making it a trilogy would have absolutely helped with. i also just would have liked to explore more of the depths of norse mythology in this world since we don't get a ton of it in media. i actually feel the same way about a lot of your points and would have liked to see a lot more thor and a redeemed thor that survives. it probably doesn't help that they announce some games 35 years in advance but i feel like we build up some of these games away too much these days and then try to overanalyze every aspect of them instead of just enjoying it... but that's a whole other conversation lol. not saying thats what this is, i feel like you did a good job of giving fair critiques. that being said, overall despite somethings i wish they did differently, this game absolutely lived up to the hype for me."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-27,"i thought this game was amazing, imo the 2019 game was ok, but this game surpassed all of my expectations. just that section in the iron woods really dragged on, i mean it's 2 hours that you can't skip cut scenes or dialogue skip as you basically go around and do endless chores. some of artreus' missions dragged on, but i really enjoyed this game, and it very effectively moved the overall story along. i also enjoyed doing the missions with freya and how you can have different dialogue on the outcome of certain quests based on what character you are partnered with."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-25,best god of war since the last one
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-24,"agreed, the game is truly impressive with its cinematic experience and storyline. as for the gameplay, i cant really give my opinion since i havent played itmy hardware can't handle it. i'm considering trying the boosteroid cloud service for this, as i saw that the game is available there."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-23,"i feel like ragnarok was a masterpiece even if it is a flawed one, 2018 was also one but i would not have it anyother way. the hype for the next one would be filled with doubt if they would have reached perfection with ragnarok. with valhalla they answered many open questions of ragnarok and they did it with dignity without seeking additional profit from the fanbase"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-25,i hope they take their time with the next chapter ... if we are going to egypt ... either make a trilogy but.... if they are worried about time effort money etc... reduce quantity  focus on quality .... if they can keep up 2018 standard but make 3 shorter games that comes out fairly close they have almost 1 if not 2 big quality games in 3 ... what do you guys think ?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,great review
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-26,my first time playing ragnarok i really hated it and didnt care for it but on my second playthrough and actually taking my time to play itim really enjoying it
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-26,"i think the 2 newest god of war games are far from being masterpieces, it is more like playing one of the tell tale games than playing gow. 2018 game of the year is clearly red dead redemption, endless replayability and truly innovative gameplay and design, gow is not even close to that. gow ragnarok did not live to the hype, odin was a complete joke of a character, loki was a waste just as thor, the game achieved nothing, it was just that, a whole bunch of nothing."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-24,"the spear is absolutely cracked. in valhalla the spear was my main weapon by far, but it is also great in the muspelheim trials. i did think it was pretty bad at the start, but building it correctly makes it a house and by far my favourite weapon"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-24,no transmog? u sure?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-23,"i think that combat, boss fights and graphics are the only 3 things that gow ragnarok did better than gow 2018"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-30,"i will try to analyze each of your points because there is a lot to talk about. first you conclude that a trilogy would be better. this argument does not follow it cannot easily be concluded that a third game would have been better. the fact that a story can be extended does not mean that you should, sometimes they can be left with more material than is really necessary, just watch the hobbit and the godfather to see a perfect example of that, often in movies. and books, it is the case that there is a lot of leftover meat and sometimes it is better to cut it so that it is written as best as possible, it can also be the same case with video games. if we stick to the developer's argument, they would have had to tell too original stories again and have to constantly remind the player of what happened since the first game with mimir stories and that would become quite voluminous. sometimes you also ignore that those parts that you consider could be too long should also be included in gow 2018. gow 2018 and ragnarok give a total of 50 to 65 hours, a considerable amount to tell what is necessary. unlike the classic gow saga, which with 6 games has a duration of 35 hours and that saga had severe pacing problems because it has a deep story with kratos but there was a lot of simplicity as it is a more interactive narrative and you notice this a lot with the others characters, one can have it easy saying that with 3 games you would have done better, but as an author you will always try to make it as least voluminous and as best as possible, i am sure that was also your case when it came to making the script for this video, that's why you make a draft andand you rewrite and modify again and rewrite again. i will make another comment because i don't know the limit of youtube comments."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-24,god of war ragnarok had transmog
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-26,in my opinion gowr did not have enough characters. you mean to tell me that the world is going to end and there are basically only 7 gods. where is the rest? kratos killed 7 gods in gow 3. it just doesnt seem like an endgamekind of game.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-26,brooooo the sprear is my most used weapon its amazing wtf
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-23,love your critiques man.. watched your last of us 2 critique and i agree with most of your points..
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-23,i love ragnark and 2018 gow but ragnark is not perfect yes it's flawed to hell but the characters some of them and the soundtrack will always be timeless. i give ragnark a solid 810
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-31,"well, now we know where kratos gets his temper from"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-04,i am your monster no longer kratos to his creator
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-03,bro just wants kratos to treat everyone like the boat captain
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-27,"he is not the original creator of gow. he was just the director of the 1st game, and helped in the conceptualization of kratos. he did not even design him. after it was done, he was gone. and for sequels they never once consulted him on anything. he was only there for one game. he does not own any creative reigns on kratos or his story. genuinely hate that people still refer to him as the original creator of god of war when it was a massive team effort to get the original game up and running, and he quit sms shortly after gow was released. and his incredibly ignorant opinions on kratos and his character is extremely hypocritical. considering gow has always been about family. every single one. family is an integral part of gow."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-22,"i don't mean that disrespectfully, less 30 seconds later, fuck you"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-30,and i wonder why he wasn't invited back to continue the series.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-05,kratos even broke the chains of his creator. kratos i am your monster no more.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-25,i dont want these characters to grow thats some peak storytelling
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-04,"my man treating kratos like ares treated him, a mindless killing machine, nothing more."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-03,man's literally ares irl
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,i am your monster no longer.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-13,"can i point out something about his spielberg comment? i'm older now, and i'm really into family? excuse me, when was spielberg not into family? duel? well, that was a straight adaptation of richard matheson's story. pretty much every story he has told not adapted since then has been about characters with daddy issues. there were family and daddy issues in jaws, close encounters, indiana jones, e.t.  it's been his trademark since 1976."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-27,i dont want these characters to grow is such a wild thing to say out loud especially as a writer
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-22,that final  no fuck you  was extremely personal
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-06,"isn't kratos literally covered in the ashes of his dead wife and child? it seems a pretty natural story arc for him to lose his wife and kid, go on a rampage and get revenge, and eventually try to regain what he lost"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-16,imagine thinking anybody wanted more of kratos killing then blaming everyone else and never learning a thing.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-10,"are we gonna ignore that in the first game kratos grew to accept he would never be let go of the nightmares, and so tries to end his own life after giving up hope"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-02-13,david jaffe i dont want kratos to grow up. gow 2005 intro cutscene kratos jumps off a cliff
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,there's a difference between appreciating the story of kratos in his young and aggressive age and keeping a character static. sucks he wants good characters to be in limbo instead of progressing themselves.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-06,bro doesnt want kratos to do things other than yell at the sky screaming zeusss unprovoked
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-12,and i dont mean it disrespectfully 30 seconds later no fuck you!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,reminder that cory barlog has been writing god of war since 2 and worked on the very first one. he isnt just a guy who walked in and took control over a character he didnt know.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-16,"honestly. as a writer and story artist. hes both right and wrong, there will always be an engine for specific arcs and character types, but youve really only got a trilogies worth of stories to tell before not having your character grow, becomes the narrative issue. meaning if gow 4 was about old kratos being like young kratos we likely wouldve ended up with a force awakens effect people praising it at first before realizing its just retreading the same old. kratos had to either grow? or they had to reboot him as his rage trilogy was, by gow 4, closed. having young angry toxic kratos ripping through the norse gods sounds cool for sure, but whats the story? he was more than just a guy who hated the gods in the first 3 he had a personal connection and vendetta to dang near all of em. so even if you try and tell gow 4 with a young kratos you still have to have him grow in some capacity so the gods can bring him back down again. hence the hes right and wrong. cause even in his perfect world kratos would still have had to narratively grow as a person to justify to be drug back into his youthful rage and that narrative direction."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-06,wasnt kratos a family man in the very beginning
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"since the first game all kratos wanted to do was to end his suffering. the fact that the gods wouldnt allow it, is the reason kratos just went bat shit crazy and he really just wanted revenge on aries and zeus only after he betrayed him, everyone else just got in the way. it makes sense for kratos to grow as a character, hes been depressed and suicidal since the first game and he cant die, it makes sense for him to try and find happiness, which he wont find by continuing to be a mindless murder machine."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,"kratos redemption is one of the best things ever, such a crazy character settling down cuz he's done his goal is so real, it's natural reaction, and he grows which just makes him relatable. and he still has murderous tendencies with spartan rage!!!!!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-02-23,kratos defies his creator. very fitting.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-08,"how ironic, the actual guy who created kratos doesn't love him and wants him to go back to feeling pain and remorse. he's literally ares."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-05,the writers mustve used him as inspiration when creating ares
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,isn't this the guy that got stuck in that one room with the breakable ceiling in metroid dread?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-15,fate only binds you if you let it. do what is necessary. not because it was written. we will make our own destiny.  the god of war
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,imagine how boring media would be if all we did is repeat the same story oh wait fast and furious is still going
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,"kratos was always very emotional, not just angry."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-01,this is the same guy who couldn't figure out how to shoot up wards in metroid dread....
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-09,i want kratos to remain one dimensional like its 2005.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-03,i love how he essentially says don't bring family into a god of war story even though the entire story of kratos' character comes from the fact that his family was killed
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,the fact of the matter is that hes allowed this to happen before. kratos grew when he accepted the loss of calliope. he grew when he tried to protect pandora. he changed after meeting his brother again. kratos has always had character changes as a result of his relationships.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,"this guy is so arrogant, he genuinely doesnt care hes only upset because he doesnt get paid, he also ran twisted metal into the ground"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-12,i don't want these characters to grow and there you have it.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,him you will always be a monster. kratos but i will be your monster no longer.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-02-01,creatoryou cannot change. you will always be a monster. kratos i know. but i am your monster no longer.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-18,he was a big emotional ball in the first 3 games. anger is still an emotion. we watched him try relentlessly to fill a void in the first 3.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-12,its really ironic that hes upset over them having kratos focus on family when he was driven by the death of his wife and daughter to slaughter most of the greek pantheon.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,i dont give a fuck what goes on in the studio. respectfully.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,to think this guy created kratos as a man seeking vengeance for his daughter and wife......
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,the plot of god of war 1 the only game he had any involvement in the making of is quite literally about kratos seeking revenge against ares for being the one responsible of the deaths of kratos wife and daughter. how has god of war not been about a father from the very beginning?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"mind that this guy hasnt really been the series creator since gow2 on the ps2. cory barlog, the guy who originally lead the animations team and is personally responsible for the original chaos blade animations, would be the creative caretaker of the series from 2 onwards. barlog grew with kratos, saw how much he had stagnated by time of ascension, and he was the one who pushed for kratos to change when the studio largely wanted to scrap the character and start anew. david jaffe definitely deserves a seat at the table, but to hear him talk like this makes me feel like god of war would have stayed very stagnant in the modern era, or been cancelled entirely. the emotional development is a huge part of the reason god of war has remained a staple, impactful franchise."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-01,i thank him for creating god of war but he is just salty that his character changed a bit and because the new games are more popular
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-08,"kratos started as a father, killed his family, went on a revenge quest, sacrificed himself to give hope then, regretted his action, found fay and became a father again. it seems like the character went on a curve or arc"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-13,he's just jealous they made a quality sequel without him
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,its odd because this is the creator saying i didnt make gow for the story and the community replying yeah but it still needed it its a great message to all devs. write a good story.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-05,if you didnt want kratos to grow and be a good father then you shouldnt have made him a family man to begin with. he didnt kill ares because he was bored that day after all
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-08,i dont want these characters to grow the literal first game starts because kratos is struggling with the guilt and depression stemming from the murder of his family he goes on the athena's quests to remove the nightmares. the first scene is him attempting suicide. the whole point from the literal first scene is that he ultimately wants to move on
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-02,yeah bro missed a chance to see the value in a truly well written and masculine character development
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-12,family was pretty much the only reason why he went on his revenge mission . makes sense he would have another
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-08,it would not make sense though for kratos to still be eternally horny and angry after having killed everyone that crossed him and ended the entire world.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,"in my opinion the stuff we see in the new god of war games was always kind of there in the old ones. kratos has always been a family man, thats his motivation. he kills gods because he blames them for what happened to his wife and daughter. the first three games are kratos coping with what he did and the loss he suffered. but i think its only a natural process that after killing an entire pantheon to feel better and than discovering that you dont, you try something new. the only thing thats gonna really help kratos is how he thinks and acts in the new games"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-03,so the creator just wants the series as a whole to stagnate forever? no growth just kratos killing for the sake of killing until the sales and fandom wither away because theres nothing new
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,when a fictional character has more character development than their creator.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,says i don't mean to be disrespectful 1 minute later fuck you!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-04,"im against character development is something i thought id never hear come out of a directors mouth, but here we are."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-21,oh david jaffe the guy who notoriously has horrible gaming takes like calling metroid dread bad game design because he didnt piece together to shoot a wall to progress through the level
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-09,kratos can't stop killing his father. even now he lives rent free in his creator's head just raising his blood pressure
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-31,the creator just liked chaos he sold the franchise when it was dying out and is pissed it's doing better with the characters naming improvements
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-21,he doesnt want kratos to be a family man. despite the fact he made kratos getting revenge because hes a family man.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-05,"i have changed, i can do so much more now really aged well."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-05,don't give my one dimensional character depth is what i heard
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-04,"he wrote in that kratos 1 has a deep love for his family, and a deep hatred for the gods, due to being tricked into killing his family 2 got his revenge on the gods and learned that it only ruined the world around him leaving him worse off than he started he literally laid the groundwork for kratos to take a step back and heal from his emotional traumas by letting him resolve his grief but showing him that it didn't help anyone, least of all himself. why is he upset they're doing that exact same thing? it's not like they make kratos any less ruthless, just that now instead of fighting to avenge his family, he's fighting to protect them."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-01,so basically he's just whining because they didn't go with his 1 dimensional idea of kratos being a rage killing maniac with no end an sight.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,i didn't make it so i don't like it creator of god of war probably
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-06,kratos matured more than his creator
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-04,"i disagree with this, the new kratos is one of the best example of character evolution and it was done beautifully without dismantling the original character or emasculating him like many franchise did to its male characters, the new kratos is strong ,sophisticated, stoic, and above all good, it was the right choice for the franchise after 5 games of him killing thousands of people to take the redemption path."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-04,david jaffe you cannot change. you will always be a monster. kratos i know. but i am your monster no longer.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-20,bro's just mad that the new gow has nothing to do with him
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-03-15,"i can't believe kratos, a family man who kills god to avenge his family is trying to be a family man you can tell who hasn't played the original trilogy, or understood it in the comments lol"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-03,"as a day one god of war fans he's wrong, the worst thing you can want for a character is to not grow. he's just sad he's not part of the studio anymore and no one would hire him."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-04,i dont give a fuck what youre going thru at the studio but not to be disrespectful lmfao
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-16,"exactly, i loved the first 3 games but hate the gameplay and story of the new games."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-30,"sorry, david. kratos is your monster no longer."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-04,"kratos is a character that shows you no matter how bad youve done, you can change."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-02-10,i am your character no more
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-07,"he got a point but kratos vs atreus, kratos  atreus was immaculate"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-20,kratos character has always been tragic. he went from spartan warrior to aries slave. he killed his wife and daughter and vowed vengeance on the gods. modern kratos is still amazing compared to modern indiana jones.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-02-22,kratos said it before  im your monster no longer
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-05,moral of the story ares is based off him
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-20,i dont want these characters to grow that says enough lol
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-20,"i think it make sense for kratos to grow and change he was a loving father with his daughter but got blinded by power and rage by ares making him kill his family blindly, if he didn't even care he wouldn't have any nightmares of that night or the times he killed for the gods without question he even tried to end himself in the first game due to those nightmares bc he has had enough of em and now here in the north he was able to grow further be more of a family man rather than killing people out and about, learn to be more of a father to his child, respect people"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-02,"did this guy forget that kratos was originally all about family? his wife and daughter, the only things he cared about?? did he forget he tried to kill himself over it and had a whole arc revolving around it? this is an insane old man take, he doesnt even remember the character he made"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-16,"original kratos was basically the doom guy set in ancient greece, so i can see why the creator feels that way"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-01,the whole reason he tore down greece was to avenge his family
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-21,i don't want my character to grow is bad enough... especially when the growth in question is maturing beyond a 14yearold edgelord's powerfantasy oc
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-06,"the growth of kratos was what made me stay intrigued with the game story. it's super badass and cool to see the violent, cold blooded kratos. but that makes the more mature version of kratos seem even more incredible. giving him weakness only makes him appear stronger. at least in my opinion."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-15,david jaffe has said his inner creative is an angry violent teenager. this is living proof of it.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-04,i dont want them to make my character better is all im hearing
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-18,it would have been weird to revisit kratos thousands of years later and have him be the exact same character. though i would have liked to see the brutality amped up more in the scenes where he slips up and the godkiller comes out. like when he killed heimdall
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-29,what hes basically saying is don't let your personal life interfere with what kratos is as a character.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-03,i don't want these characters to grow
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-02,kratos regressed. he cant jump now
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-21,"one thing to note is he didnt create him alone, he simply helped in the process"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-01,i like mike mignola's approach to this. my hellboy was the one i wrote. what happened to the character after that is their own idea or version of hellboy.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,"maybe i'm a rare breed, maybe i'm just a tired dad in his 40's, but i play a round of valhalla at least once a week. something about it just never gets boring to me. the skins will be cool as i usually play around with different armors each time, but i'm also waiting for some greek saga releases for the ps5 preferably a remake. this isn't the worst news, but it won't scratch the itch of any actual fans."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,"no remaster or remake? then the gods of olympus have abandoned us, now there is no hope."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-16,"oh man, can't wait for god of war ragnarok dark odissey set full movie all cutscenes 4k 60fps"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,"the hands of santa monica could not defeat me, the devs could not hold me and you sony will not see the end of this day i will have my remasters!!!!!!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,i hope they also bring odyssey skin for young kratos too.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,67 inchs of jormi?!?!preordering now
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,wouldve been awesome if they gave us kratos' god armor from gow ii instead of the dark odyseey skin
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,the plushie is the best part. the bluepoint game was 100 supposed to be announced.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,"honestly, i think some people were believing that leak too much, which just made it a given that they would be disappointed for what santa monica studios was actually planing"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,i'm still surprised that god of war came the same year i was born.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-17,"theres a guy named gustavopredador whos doing more for the fans than santa monica itself! hes remastering god of war 1 and god of war 2 directly on the ps2, adding hd textures, using god of war 2 models in god of war 1, and everything has been redone. and sony isnt doing any of this. hes working on this project to raise money and help his cat, who has ulcerated breast cancer. the project is free, and its called god of war 2 20th anniversary edition."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,this feels lackluster for the big 20th anniversary. i will definitely still pick up the skin though.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,they didnt announce kratos jumping return
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-17,"i dont understand why people are disappointed, expect nothing and you will never be dissatisfied"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,we should've had a fear kratos skin also
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,hey the skin does look cool
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-17,"hope is what makes us strong, it is why we are here! it's what we fight with when all else is lost. pandora"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,"there is no live service, there is no egypt, and there is no greek trilogy remake"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,the black and gold look super sleek
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-16,"its not worth sludging through ragnarok again, once is enough."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-17,disappointing skin? it's easily one of the best behind the god armour. be grateful we got anything at all.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,"keep your expectations low, and you'll never be disappointed"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,"not going to lie, the dark odyssey skin is bloody awesome. always loved it in gow 2 so now i find thats reason enough to play more"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,same thing will repeat for bloodbornes 10th anniversary
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-16,the dark odyssey skin was the only one i would use every time i played on ps2 and still do on ps3. also that kratos head statue with the world serpent looks like a future battle to come.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,most of us don't want stuff and small items...we want the next game.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-17,"i don't know why anyone would have expect much else. sony has embraced modern sensibilities and they would find the pre2018 gow games to be problematic. i'm sure at some point we'll get a full on remake of the first game, but it will changeretcon so much as to be unrecognizable."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,would be cool if they released a skin for the blades of chaos that turn them into the blades of exile
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-16,thanks for the info bro!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,bro i love gow and watching your videos are just keeping the flame awake
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,"by the way its not only the dark oddesy skin,..its also an dark oddesy armor imo"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,the gods of olympus have abandoned menow there is no hope
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,at least put the golden fleece or something
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,santa monica we will have our revenge
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-16,"boi! , come back we have a new skin to wear"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,did they give us a skip angraboda option?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,thats why i respect capcom giving amazing renakes at the same time new resident evil games and probably dmc remakes next ong why not the same with gow
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,"looking at it, i'll be 20 yr old this year too"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,well i guess it's best to assume the remastered greek god of war collection uncensored is never going to happen but who knows maybe it'll come out of nowhere.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,all the previous gow games will be dlc for ragnarok
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,there was a 10th anniversary exhibition for god of war 3 in 2015 and what did they do after the exhibition event ended they announced god of war 3 remastered online so they will probably do the same thing with the greek god of war saga remastered collection after the 20th anniversary exhibition ends okayyyyyyy
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,"they should have had all the skins from gow 1,2,3 and ascension normal skin kratos"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-16,i am disappointed with sony's lack of care for the customers who have made them so much money. it's just another way to show they don't care about nor respect their customers
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,woohoo a paint job swap to celebrate 20 years. wow not even a newly designed armor lol. literally just a paintjob. incredible
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,we want egypt ! but thank you for the update !
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,the world feels normal when you post gow content
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,im almost 100 sure they had planned to announce or release a teaser for the amazon tv adaptation trailer by this 20th anniversary mark. obviously this was canned when we learned they scrapped the scripts and the producers for a new creative direction back in october.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,damn god is impacting this month gonna get my thor hammer signed by ryan hurstthor my second signature and now this
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-19,i wish i could play god of war 1and 2. you can't play them even if you have ps plus . you can only if you download it a few years back
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,"kuba did you forget as per the leaks it was mentioned that any remake or remastered collection would be from nixxes software, so why are you so quick to give up when its clearly not being done by santa monica? just hold out hope a bit longer until the day of the anniversary, only 1 week left to go before there is truly no hope."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,"the gods of santa monica have abandoned the fans, now there is no hope"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,153 we gotta wait for the 40th
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,definitely picking up the plushie but i agree with you kuba the legionnaire set would have been so much cooler than a simple reskin.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-16,im totally shocked they got tc carson to ageee to show!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,i vote for replaying the game with the dark odyssey skin. i'm definitely a fan of the spear new look and i'm always down for more god of war
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,"the best way to deal with this is keep your expectations low boy, and you will never be disappointed."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,god have abandoned santamonica studios
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,am really happy with those skins honestly cant wait to replay the game with them i was already gonna try a new build playthrought and it will be sick with this new skins i dont mind not having remastered trilogy i grow up playing the greek games so just replaying same ones all over again dont really interest me but if there would be a remake with modern gameplay then yes i would be hyped for the trilogy coming back
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,"the armor set looks so nice, hope it has a cool gimmick"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,don't lose hope guys they might announce the remaster on the 22nd the anniversary day
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,i'm gonna by only plush jormungard. he saves that anniversary..
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,guys we need to make a petition for a deimos skin.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-18,300 yeah you can play those on playstation plus... if you're in the right country. over here in australia and a lot of other countries the only way to play those games is either emulation or spending too much money to buy not only a working ps23 but also paying for the games themselves which can sometimes be more than the console they are on now.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,cool to get cosmetics.saddens me that we will never get remasters of these beloved games.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-16,i attended the 20th anniversary yesterday hate to say but very disappointed nothing special nothing new just a shirt that says god of war 20 th anniversary for 30 bucks other than that nothing but paintings we have already seen nothing new they fumbled
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-17,cool skins.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-16,"would've loved an update allowing the ng cloak to have starter armor colors, much prefer it over the black and yellow"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,"damn, i want those retrospective books as well"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,i feel really bad for kratos. you can see he trying to be better
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-16,i wish to wear the valkyrie armor once more.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,yea ill be doing a full play through with the new skins from start to valhalla skin is fire
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,i really want to use the golden and blue blades of athena from 2 and ghost of sparta again.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,remember when companies would give what their fanscustomers wanted? i guess gone are those days. so disappointing.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-16,"in my opinion if you are set on releasing new cosmetics for the 20th anniversary of your game, just make more of them. at least 5 more."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,"lets remember that they like surprises . in 2018 the blades of chaos were the best kept secret they even lied about them to keep the surprise . when they dropped valhalla it also came out of nowhere , and so when they announced ragnarock. they are fans of surprises so i dont expect them to tease they will announce a new game before hand , if it happen it will be out of nowhere"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,"i always thought dark odyssey looked really cool as a costume in god of war 2, so i'm completely okay with this lol"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,i hope that's not all we get for the anniversary
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-16,i hope they add the god armor as well
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,will the dark odyssey skin be available on ps4 version of gowr
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,"hopefully they also announce an anniversary themed controller, like they just did with the last of us."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-17,the gods have frowned upon us.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-17,"the irony of having tc carson there but not even doing a remaster of the greek saga. sms really hate the old fans huh? what am i gonna do with a bunch of skins? oh cool. lets do another slow playthrough looking through movie cutscene but its fine because we have god of war dark odyssey skin set. yeah. as if a skin set is gonna do anything in that game. its already a chore to finish through that once i platninum'd the game, i immediately delete it."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-19,109 this the only thing im hyped about
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,"the santa monica devs have abandoned us, now there is no hope."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,"all you had to do, was remaster the greek saga santa monica!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-17,"its something, but they really couldve and shouldve done more for one of the most iconic ips in gaming"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,well. black and gold are the definitive colors of egypt and egyptian gods. could be foreshadowing
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,maybe they didn't mention 1 or 2 because they're making a remake. that's they will announce later on at the art exhibition thing
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-16,"honestly, the fact that we got anything at all. that makes me happy. it's rare that game developers truly just want to give back to fans unless it cost money. so, while it's not a remake of god of war iiii or a subsequent game entry. glad santa monica is at least thinking about us. now gives us the god of war fish skin!!!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-18,like the book collection what are all the god of war books you have i'm trying to collect all of them myself
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-17,they better shadow drop gow remake man bc this 20th anniversary for sony most beloved series looks like a fuckin joke
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,greek god of war shouldve been remastered bro! wtf???
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-16,sony never misses when it comes to missing opportunities.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,136 should have released a dlc where you could get mjolnir or for some reason we had to go back home to greece to fight someone or something. that way kratos can use the lessons he's learned in his new home to save his old one
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-17,"i feel that there's still something coming...call it a gut feeling or whatnot, but i have a feeling that on the 22nd, we will get something"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-16,say whatever you want about the celebration as a whole but the dark odyssey skin and weapons look soooooooooooo sick
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,what i hope for the director of gowr will announce all these on the 20th anniversary celebration. then cody will come in with a black turtle neck and jeans and say one more thing... and he will announce the greek remake.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-17,a deimos skin would have been way cooler.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,i just finished god of war ragnarok today so will i get the skin pack?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-17,"hey, sorry i am not playing ragnarok again just for skin lol"

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-07,"kratos you're about to wish you were calliope, boy"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-10,the most emotionally complex rendition of the word boy in all of fiction
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-07-27,the fact he infects people wearing other suits is crazy
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-11,bro boutta pull out the slipper of olympus
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-15,bro took awaking young kratos too literally

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-17,then o appears
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-08-24,the young kratos with old kratos body looked cursed
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-07,that is a really good transition
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-03,bro unlocked the belt of chaos
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-09,you know kratos is mad if he called him boy
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-18,atreus had the  above his head
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-04,when i played the game and kratos walked through the door it scared the shit outta me
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-21,bro about to use belt of leviathan
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-28,"kratos, calmly  boiiii!!!!! atreus  shits"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-07,the people you trust can hurt you the most
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-22,i thought younger kratos was part of the cutscenes for a moment
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-04-18,story just becomes more bizzare.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-26,kratos booooooooooooyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-16,kratos for a moment turns to his greek version
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-05,let the rage of the father fuel your belt kratos!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-07-19,atreus about to get the belt of sparta
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-21,i love this slightly out of context
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,og kratos looks so much scarier
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-07-28,old kratos be like bow is added to your inventory
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-12,ultra instinct kratos
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-07-26,kratos with the sisters' amulet
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-23,not the booooy
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-09,in the end there will only be chaos
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-02-06,when u hear boy run ateus run
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-12,boy! health bar appears.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-03,"let the rage of sparta, fuel your belt kratos!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-07-07,could you imagine a level where kratos has to fight himself in his prime with the best weapons he gathered
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-25,"kratos,health bar pops up"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-06,i cant wait for god of war 10 where kratos yells at jesus too run his fade
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-07,bruh imagine him trying to kill the god who's immortal like 7 times over
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,"also in sigrunds old home, you find an egyptian ahnk, and in kratos' journal he mentions that it's a land he longs to visit"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-15,"the developers already hinted at where the series is going in the first game. i decided to play it over again after beating ragnarok and noticed there was a mural in tyr's vault showing the lands other mythological gods he's visited egyptian, greek, chinese, and mayan. idk where the next game will take place, but it's going to be in either egyptian, chinese, or mayan."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-08,tyr the god of yoga. tyr namaste kratos...
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-05,"i love how much tr seems to have studied and learned from other cultures and philosophies across the globe. it not only makes him really intriguing as a character and councellor for kratos, but also makes the world seem so much bigger beyond the greek and nordic pantheons. to quote general iroh, another great spiritual guide from avatar the last airbender it is important to draw wisdom from many different places. if we take it from only one place, it becomes rigid and style. understanding others, the other elements, and the other nations will help you become whole."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,kratos vs anubisgod of death that fight would be insane
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-08,"most likely the next game is gonna be egyptian mythology, as there could be some problems with kratos killing nondefunct pantheons"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-24,"tyr in midgard  standing heere, im standing here"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-07,"kratos has changed a lot since the greek mythology he no longer just kills god's he kills bad and corrupt gods and befriends the good gods like he befriended freya,mimir,real tyr and many more meanwhile he only killed absolute bad gods and that also at absolute peak like heimdall he was abt to spare but heimdall had the mood to die and also he spared thor and only killed odin. so,if kratos reached to hindu mythology,he is prob going to befriend like shiva,vishnu,brahma,etc and only going to kill the bad and corrupt ones"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-08,only people who missed it are people who didnt play after the main story
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,it actually makes a lot of sense this would also connect the theory with athena and the mask but it will be so long till we even get a teaser so even this connection will be forgotten
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"kratos  jesus!!!!! i come here seeking for forgiveness jesus  come and sit, let us drink wine and see what have you become"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-22,the fact that he didn't get a cutscene makes freeing tr so anti climactic after all we've been through with tyr
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-10,imagine you could find the actual tr during the story while odin is faking as tr
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-07,if this game got to hindu mythology its gonna get canceled so quickly
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-12,almost everyone overlooked how god damn beautiful that horn sounded
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,fun fact god of war 2018 should have been egyptian mythology but then they changed it to aesir
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-07,"i want to see kratos in egypt mythology in the next game, that would be cool, imagine kratos vs seth, or kratos vs osiris"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-17,in egypt outing you left foot forward and arms crossed was a sign of respect
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"god, i so badly want to see kratos throw hands with horus"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-14,i cant wait for gow 8 where kratos says to muhammed wake up!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-25,"i think the next step for god of war is atreus in celtic mythology, especially scottish. that's where mimir is from and he probably told atreus all about his homeland during the time between gow and gowr. also, there are many tales of giants of which atreus has said he wanted to learn more about in celtic mythology. most notably benandonner, the giant who threatened fionn mac cumhail into building the giants causweay. i believe this is the logical next step in the story and not egyptian just because its the next most popular mythology."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,"fun fact in gow 2018 and gowr you collect hiemdall's horn twice. once as an item in gow 2018 , and another when you kill him in gowr."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-12,personally i'd like to see kratos fight sun wukong
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-12,tyr's wavelike pose makes me laugh and i love it
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-07,wait till people realize record of ragnarok exists
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-16,that feeling when you get bored easily and scroll down the moment the most interesting part comes and you come back to the video to watch it again
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"i read about tyr in the fandom that he was the one who locked garm in the helheim by letting him chew on his hand...just think about it,if he was at his best,he could be one of the strongest allies during ragnarok"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-16,good to see tyr kept his hand this time around.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-06,so we going to egypt? kratos next story?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-06-07,i honestly thought kratos would pick irish mythology since the giants could be considered as the tuanan de danan of ireland and atreus found them and asking his father for help.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-06,that gotta be careful if they start doing incredibly popular religions that people hold dear. egyptian may be ok because they have any versions. it might not be the best to do hindu because people are very protective of their religion and gods and would be insulted. also if you try to explain it may be difficult for people to understand.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-15,loki meets wukong would be dope! could see loki learning a thing or two that could make for some sick gameplay.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-07,i found this on my own after going back to the game i just thought i'd go to alfheim and practice fighting and found tyr i was so thrilled
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-21,impostor tyr i dont wanna war real tyr supp
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-17,spoiler alert tyr is just gonna become a yoga instructor. the kind your girl tells you not to worry about.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-03,"honestly kratos got a great closure to his story, i wouldnt mind if the series ended like this. id prefer a new story following atreus or just a new franchise"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-06,they gotta be very careful about kratos going after any hindu god cause if kratos tries to kill any hindu god we indian gonna be hurt way too much
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-11,",,..and in midgard, he is just standing.  ,,men, they are standing."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,if they dont make a game about atreus imma be pissed
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-11,there's so many questions and scence that was left un answered from 2018  like it would be cool to the war between the giants and thor
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-06,actually there is a exact kratos like character in hindu mythology his name is parashuram edit their is also another interesting similarity between kratos and parashuram maybe coincidence. in the end times parashuram will be the guru of kalki who is like atreus aka loki in god of war now that i think about it
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-18,kratos actually spent time in egypt before arriving in midgard. a prequel set in egypt sounds amazing. the norse games seem like a very fitting end to his journey
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,"if kratos goes to chinese mythology, thats god of war finale kratos dies to sun wu kong"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-03,cant wait for kratos to tell asura that he needs to chill
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i was anxious watching this vid i thought it would be a rickroll with tyr dancing
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,i have never had an experience like wandering around post game and coming across tyr. one of the best moments i had in game.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-06,man.. just make the new game open world.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-28,egyptian gods would be nice to explore next... would wanna see atem challenge kratos to a duel.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-06,"i believe that the next game would be set in china, japan, egypt, celtic lands, mesopotamia, or subsaharan africa!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-15,"i think the poses are a reference to several mythologies, as he does do the thinker pose, which could be a reference to the greek statue. we seen reference to chinese, egyptian, and aztec mythology in gow 4."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-15,the waffle house had found its new owner
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-08-11,"that was the worst, seeing tyrs in a jail that he can break with one finger lol"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-01,"bro i'm hindu. and it would be so cool to see a god of war based in hinduism. kratos can play a role in ramayana or mahabharata. there are plenty of op demon kings, bad demigods like karna and monsters for him to kill ravana, kamsa etc... he can help hindu gods like krishna or ram . he can also have a friendly fight with parashu ram who is similar to kratos  always angry, killer of demons, picking fights, bearded, muscular, and an axe for a weapon lmaoo"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-07,they should not dare to disrespect hindu gods at any cost.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,"i think is more indicative to the fact that tyr has been to other worlds, and so he incorporates motions and poses he learned from other gods...possibly hinting at a much larger story for god of war."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-23,"seemed like most people missed a lot in the game. like the snake was jormengander and the jormengander at ragnarok was that snake not the one in midgard, and that faye was marking her funeral pyre trees not the stave. thank you for holding everyone's hand they really do need it."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-15,the waffle house has found its new host
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,the sun pose was the praise the sun emote from darksouls
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,when i first seen him doing those poses i thought he was just doing yoga
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-14,some of the pose were in the paintings you see in god of war 18 and ragnarok
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,the waffle house has found its new host
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-27,"egypt will be apep a gigantic serpent deity, mother is goddess neith, her symbol two crossed bows."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-05,"i didn't 100 it, but still found him, he was in odin ravens place, and he is there after asgard falls"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-06,"there was an easter egg in the first game that hinted at egyption and japanese mythology, i would assume egyption would be first considering that they featured it so heavily in that one comic"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-03,i hope they do go with egyptian mythology
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-05,can't wait to get my hands on that game.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-18,wonder how many people trying out the valhalla dlc but never rescued tyr post game react to seeing tyr playing a major role.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-17,the director actually addressed tier in the end game. he said that like 2 of the poses and a few of the phrases he says are a clue to something. he didn't say what the clue was to but i think we all know.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-08,"well even his weapons tell a lot about future games shield and spear typically greek weapons macuahuitl typically aztec weapon kopesh typically egyptian weapon katana typically japanese weapon if you remember even in gow 4 there was an image in tyrs temple where were visible an horus eye and a tomoe, both typical symbols of egyptian and japanese culture."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-12,its implied that kratos will party crash a certain tournament to annihilate a different version of his father as well as the man that lied to his son. i can see him giving petty lightning the poor mans dim mak while ironically reverting to his old ways after getting to know patchy
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-30,i just platinumed the game over the weekend and saw all these water eggs. hope to have a trilogy.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-02-01,"that was so crazy, i was in niflheim to get a berserk gravestone and i came across the prison and when i found the i was sure it was a odin loyal, but then i looked it up and its actually him! im so glad that hes actually alive and not many people know about it cuz who goes to niflheim randomely"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-17,the original plan for the god of war reboot was to have kratos go to egypt
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-06,in god of war 2018 mimir talks about the egyptian gods in tyrs temple during the black rune puzzles
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,"in the first shot, you couldnt see kratos face so i thought it was doom guy"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-11,in god of war 2018 they mention egypt in tyr's vault because they talk about a sandy desert or something along the lines of that
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-11,what makes it more exciting ive read on wikipedia that in skjldunga saga and yngvunga saga odin is actually a conqueror from asia scythia tho not india so in the sequel maybe his original people will demand the yggdrasil to themselves.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-25,you know with the mask supposedly having greek writing on it i am surprised kratos didn't think much on it unless he did but just didn't say anything
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-14,"did someone say yogafabian, gta v"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-21,"i think this was like a little bit of a hint for valhalla, but also for the next god of war games. there are egipt, aztec and japan on the line. these 3 were hinted multiple time so i suppose the next game will take place in one of those places but with what purpose and what he will do there, is yet to remain a mystery until we have more info about the next games. cause this series is far from over. a spin off or something like that with atreus is also likely to come. or one of the next game could involve atreus being capture by one of the gods from either egipt, japan or aztec ones because he did something bad and kratos going to save him. and that will involve killing a few gods as well or all of them in that region. and seeing him in either egipt or aztec time will not be so weird considering that it kinda blend with greek and norse vibe. but japan? that would be really weird to see kratos there. and the gods there too.  but all of those are just some hints and small speculations of mine. one thing is for certain is that god of war franchise is far from being over. is just a matter of where kratos will go next and with what purpose."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-16,the vikingsgermanic tribes also had a form of yoga as they were an aryan indo european people... all indo europeans including indians shared the same culture.. indians did not invent yoga
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-08,"kratos punching out anubis, a fifteen foot tall god of death jackal"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-12,yeah the poses relate to the six stolen treasures from other lands that you can find in midgard.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-02-03,god of war comic? what rock have i been under?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-09,afalhiem is crazy lol
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-12,"people keep saying that's gonna be the next game cuz tyr doing buddhist thing so it's gonna be in india no bro since the first game it has been said many many and many times that tyr has travelled to another lands and learned new cultures because he likes it, he likes new experiences, it's just that, it's just to show that he acknowledges other cultures, next game is definitely gonna be called god of mischief and atreus is gonna be the protagonist to look for the giants that aren't really dead duh."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-25,'uncrossed legs' it's called kneeling hahahaha
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-14,there's hints in the gow 2018 and in this game that if there's another game probably a spinoff of atreus it would be on egypt
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-24,there was also that reference when kratos picks up an ankh and mimir calls it an artifact from the river empire. hope freja's still there
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-22,i reckon egypt is the next pantheon to get shredded and fall victim to the blades of chaos
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,seeing kratos in ancient egypt would be crazy. i can dig it lol
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-13,"me heh, cool. tyr is a dark souls fan."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-02-12,this man has been glazing the absolute hell out of egypt
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-23,kratos vs wukong is something i would give everything to see
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-03,not only that but evidence it is for ra is that the original idea for the reboot of god of war 2018 was egyptian mythology most likely being a nod to the original idea
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-15,if yall didnt notice or havent watched or played the dlc these poses hint to the wepons try was using or him being in the dlc
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-23,egypt mythology is much more marketable imo. nobody will be so hype for indian
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-09,am i the only one here hoping that atreus will be the one who starring god of war as the mc in chinese mythology with him as sun wukong since atreus or infamously known as loki who is god of mischief and sun wukong is also known because his mischief along with the fact that both of them have the ability to shapeshift into anything???

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-26,i just want to share . i got a platinum trophy in gow ragnark on the hardest difficulty and no resurrection stones.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-26,my number 1 game of all time
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-09,"proudly, i have every items mentioned. got platinum on gmgow few days back. definitely once in a lifetime experience."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-26,ts was way easier than gow2018 with that stupid niflheim maze.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-26,irrelevant but fun fact most of the berserkers in gow ragnarok are women. the ones wearing body armor are women and the ones shirtless are men
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-30,took me i think 5 playthroughs but i finally got to the point statsarmoretc where i could defeat all the berserkers including the king as well as gna.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-05,this isnt an in game item but the platinum trophy was a huge pain in the ass. so worth it in the end tho
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-08,ragnarok was one of my hardest platinums i learned to hate berserker king hrolf.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-05,"only 2 platinums ive ever gotten are the newest god of wars. cannot beat these games, so good"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-27,"well are some good facts on that game , i have jumped into yet .since i have played god of war  full out yet , but tips are great ."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-16,is it just me or is the stone wall shield insane with the dragon set
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-26,oh were real early
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-27,a 1010 game for sure!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-18,i havent platinumed the og games but i have platinumed god of war 2018  ragnarok and i pretty much mastered give me god of war difficulty by far my 1 games besides atreuss part they couldve left that out
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-06,some how when i started new game plus i got everything for free only thing i was missing was the zeus armor
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-04,aphrodite may have a word about the hardest thing in gow.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-27,if you play better its not that hard to obtain. if you really enjoy the game you will play better. kratos be better. probably better than last time
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-21,pride of sparta took me a month
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-26,more than 10 000 hour playong over the years....and still play 2024 per day
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-04,it took me an hour to beat the king and 2 hours to beat gna lmao
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-02,honestly max strength and and max defense no problem 105
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-14,its so hard to get og kratos i still havent got it
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-16,pov u plat the game and finished 2 ng and at least 1 on give me god of war
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-12,"i have platinum trophy in every god of war in l, ll, lll, lv and vl"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-26,22 minutes is insane
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-26,let's go fellow spartans.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-15,tbh 3 berserkers in alfheim is harder than beating king hrolf.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-05,i got them from ng
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-14,i didnt do a single crucible and when i made my first ng it just gave me it?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-14,"so uh i beat gna, king hrolf pretty much every hardest boss in the game i think i got to strong"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-17,wait wait wait was that the blate of olympus
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-03,god of war? more like god of drip!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-27,i got most of these by playing ng
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-25,if u complete valhalla can you get the items there or will it be transfered in the main game or ng just started valhalla btw
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-02,"9 mins, ive never seen that attack..?"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-28,surprisingly i did all of these with ease. have the platinum for all of the gow games ever created.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-26,flawless berserker armor?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-20,"the berserkers were such bs fights, even the valkeries in the 1st game were more fair, even siguine, i died to them ore thrn any other time in my time of playing the gow series"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-04,who did it on no mercy? i did first try at the game..
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-31,so much shit!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-26,like if youre not boi
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-19,"so let's get this straight, some of these armor sets can only be unlocked if you beat valhalla on the hardest difficulty?? what an f'n joke this game is!!! valhalla is so ridiculously hard that less than 0.1 of players can beat it another reason i shelved this game because of it's pathetic difficulty spike compared to god of war 2018"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-31,"hot take, but the trolls were harder than king hrlf. and i had it on the second hardest difficulty, idk if im good or just op. i had the full upgraded dragon armor"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-26,hardest thing to get is over the fact that that ragnarok is overrated.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-19,ragnarok may just be the greatest single player game ever.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-14,its so stupid that u need to play 3 times for a armor set kinda trash
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-19,"if you like this build, check out my latest spartan rage build guide httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vdgdpz33v7ug and yes i meant to say trolls instead of giants"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-24,im hoping they add a feature to save builds like custom classes so you can quickly switch between different builds that you like to use
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,"i dont know if you'll ever see this, but i just wanted to thank you. thanks to this build i was finally able to take down both the berserker king and the valkyrie queen bosses and earn the platinum. i also managed to do both without using a resurrection stone. thank you."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-30,bro you are a legend! this build took me from literally almost destroying my controller in berserker fights to being able to take them out with ease! thank you so much! im not skilled at all in parrying or dodging so being able to take hits like a champ really helps.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,"i had the steinbjorn armor with even higher defense, but didn't have the constant health regeneration stuff. i wish i had known about this build before the words for asgard! were permanently seared into my nightmares like i was greek era kratos."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-17,"when it comes to amulet, you guys can replace his 6 celestial panacea, 7 poison protector and 8 bright eyedemblem for a set called niflheim's to increase your damage output when you're above 75 of your health based on your def which is already amazing."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,"this build was great. i went from getting killed in 34 hits by king berserker to just tanking everything. way lower damage output, but that's the tradeoff. i did make a few changes since i only care about bosses. replaced the status effect resistances and slotted in 3 pieces of svartalgheim. also wore the berserker belt for a bit more dps. i don't gave everything at level 9, but this put me at 501 defense and 179 vitality."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,"dude, this is such a smart build. i'm considering using it to get rid of the berserker trio in alfheim"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-28,"dude, you weren't kidding about this build! and since i'm using it on level 10 in new game plus mode, it's even more op! thank you!"

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-03,"thanks for this build! all trials became super easy and i eventually beat hrolf, gna and got my 100 completion"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-05,thanks a lot. i was able to beat berserker king by dying only once near the end but used a berserker stone to revive and kill him using wrath. then i didn't even need any resurrection stone for gna. i just beat her on first try. don't think i'd be able to do it otherwise. you saved me a lot of time.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-25,"thank you for making this build! i had to clear the endgame before i finally got all of the items, but i finally created it! i still have the berserker king and the queen valkyrie to deal with so i will be making use of this! i'm looking forward to hopefully being able to save these builds in the near future!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-06,thank you! was really frustrated with the last 2 bosses and literally just needed to beat them both to platinum. couldnt find the right build to manage the 2 but then i decided to gave this a try. it was a grind but its done! many thanks!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-15,"afyer 2 days and around 5 hours of fighting the beserker king, this build helped me to finish him off. i didnt even need a res stone on my succesful try. thank you!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,thanks to this build finished gna and king something. just changed the light and heavy attacks to more single target oriented ones.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,one thing that annoys me is that you can't fast travel just by going to the map and picking one of those portal locations. you literally have to go to it and activate where you want to go which makes backtracking after you complete the game a pain.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-11,"i have to admit that i was impressed with this armour because i have spent over 70 hours with the game, i have done all the quests and i have found everything there is to find, there is nothing left to do, the platinum shines beautifully so the only thing left to do is to slaughter the next wave in the arena and this armour is perfect, it makes a very difficult level very easy, well done mate, as you wrote you can't die"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-03,finally made it with your guide. i just switch spartans rage to fury. this worked much better for me.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-19,i did a similar build. i doubled up on the the surtr arms and girdle and i used the spear grip that gives you a burst of rage on a finisher. then i used the niflheim and svartalfheim enchantment sets to get more damage and stun based on my defense. then i use the shield item that gives cdr on a parry which with everything feels like a no compromise build. you're as tanky as can be you have lots of damage tons of healing and you've got enough cooldown you can dump your load when you need it.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-17,thanks i didnt think i would be able to beat the valkyrie or the berserker boss in ragnarock. your guide helped me platinum the game for ps4  ps5 thanks so much
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-14,thanks a lot man! did this build and gna was a breeze first attempt
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-05,man you are genius. i wish i used this way earlier. i was stuck with berserkers and gna for ages! thank you aye!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,"the unstoppable aura relic is a very good safety net for keeping you alive in a battle, but when i am playing more offensively, i use the one i can't remember it's name that sacrifices health to deal damage since this build makes you tanky and have self healing, so that lost health won't be gone for long."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,awesome build my freind all i can say is thank you i really do feel like kratos now as as long as i play aggressively im literally unbeatable my health bar never goes below half i beat both the berserker king and gna first try with this build and destroyed them both and all the challenges of muspulheim are legit a walk in the park!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-22,you are a legend you just helped me beat gn on the hardest difficulty and i got my first platinum i love you!!!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-05,thank you so much!! i just got my plat. im in so much joy. it took a long time. i played on ng and i didnt have to use a resurrection stone. this build is insane! i love it and especially because im terrible at the combat
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,thank you! i spent hours and hours fighting gna. with this build is only took me two tries and i was finally able to get platinum!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-08-05,"i never comment on videos but i have to say i was stuck on the final 2 bosses for 4 days switching back and forth trying both and tried multiple youtubers super setups and nothing worked, i tried this setup exactly and beat both of them without even needing a resurrection stone. shot out to this man because i was a few more tries away from throwing my controller through my tv"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-22,"killed the beserker king in one try with this build, thanks!! did use a resurrection stone, but barely needed it"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-16,man you have no idea how this helped me with gna and the berserk king thank you man you keep doing what youre doing
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,"there's an item axe pommel maybe that makes you heal with every hit with the axe, as long as your permafrost is full, but you also take more damage. there are items that increase the rate at which you build permafrost, so maybe that's a viable build as well. i personally pefer last second dodgeparry glass cannon"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"i'm not very good at this game, played it on the easiest difficulty from start to finish, but thanks to this build i managed to kill gn and all the berserkers including king hrlf on my first try and got the platinum trohpy. thanks a lot."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-22,"top 10 bosses will kill you easily, they got so hard and you can't regenerate faster than they cup away your life in 3 or 4 hits"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-16,bro i just want to thank you so much for this video. i just beat gn and now i gotta try this with the berserker king. you really helped me out. thank you so much dude.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,"thank you so so much!! i wasnt able to defeat gn and king hrolf kraki. so many attemps, i tried everything, just unbelievable... but with this build, i didn't even have to use the resurrection stone. i've finally found inner peace. have a wonderful day!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-02,thank you for this video!!!! i was unable to beat both gna and king of beserkers before this build. beat them both within 10 minutes.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,"try the svartalfheim set of enchantments, you'll melt through enemies with this build bc it's based on your defense"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-09,just beat gna with this build on give me no mercy build...i had tried all other builds earlier but was not able to defeat gna....it truly makes kratos nearly invincible thank you for your valuable inputs
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,i've been using the niavellir armor that makes stun never decrease and health boost on stun grabs. and a mod for the blades that deals greatly increased stun on the l2r1 attack which also makes you basically invisible once the blade hits and the animation starts most enemies get full stun from 1 or 2 attacks and most stagger after each attack just repeat until you can stun grab and repeat. not as fancy as this and a bit repetitive but so far pretty effective
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-10,amazing build i try this and i can say i truly feel like a god of war now.... thank you brother!!!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-11,"really good looking armor, cant wait to get thissounds like a fun zombie build"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-07-31,dude! thank you for this build. i could not kill the king berzerker dude until i went this route. thanks again!!! subbed up!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-22,"thank you so much! just the armor alone gave me the boost i needed paired it with a lot of realm shift stuff. after a lot of trial and error with other builds i destroyed gna on my first try with this build! the armor makes her attacks a bit more forgiving. the fight was far from perfect, i got hit several times and still pulled through. about to take on the berserker king, wish me luck!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-14,"one thing i would add to this, the niflheim enchantments, increase damage based on your defense while above 75 health, i have 550 defense with a similar build and it does sooo much damage, on top of always healing and being above that 75"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,as a person that this is their first gow game ever. perfect and thank you! subscribed.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-30,u really cant die with this build. incredible work putting this together.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-04,"just wanted to send a thank you your way. it took a bit of tweaking, and i still had to memorize movement patterns, but your work on this build allowed me to secure the platinum. i feel the balance in this game is a bit wonky regarding difficulty and damage dealttaken, but gear setup makes a huge difference and with this build and a little bit of skillpractice i was able to faceroll my way through it. cheers!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-02,you could just use the one where you roll twice to get rid of all status effects and that allows you 3 slots for a set
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-09,thank you!! i struggled and i struggled. and i struggled some more against gna and the berseker king. tried your build. beat gna on the second attempt. still was a close one for me since i didn't quite have everything maxed. then worked on maxing the rest before going back to king hrolf. kicked his ass badly on the first attempt. now i just have the crucible left and got the platinum
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-16,"looks like the build i try e.g for the spear i use the one that give you rage after a r3 kill because it have 40 def and 29 hp  you need rage anyway so it fits realy good this 3  eir's armament poison protector bright eyed emeblem are the enchantmens i dont have in my set, i use 3 nilfheim or 3 svartalheim because it increase your def and other statts even more and with that much def both skills are just perfect also because you get more statts you can switch some small things if you want"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-02,used this build and beat the berserker king in one try. thank you for posting this.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-26,"206 to activate that mystical heirloom relic, on the ps4, equip it and then simply hold l1 and press circle. i got stuck wondering why the statue was not waking up."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-16,dude this build be really op.. i beat the stupid king and gna with it.. on the first tries too!! thank you sooo much!!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-14,"thanks for this great build tutorial, but i dont have all the enchantments that you use and i cant find online where they are, would you please show us, where one can get them. i am using this build now but its incomplete yet but loving it so far"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-15,"thanks for posting this, used a similar build, mainly swapping valor for fury and its corresponding enchantment, to finally defeat valkyrie queen gna. and will probably use it to defeat the berserker king as well"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-14,ive killed the valkyrie queen gna and the king using the armor from trolls mixed with realm shifting constant healing in general and healing on attacks i can never get below 85 of my health lol.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-28,indestructible build guide  you can't die! king hrolf kraki hold my bifrst.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-18,nice build. i honestly used lundas all the way through the game and punched everything to death whilst poisoning them. barely used the weapons
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,"had no idea you could even fight those but recognized them from the first game, hell yeah thanks bro"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,can you in the future show where the different items can be found?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-01,this build got me through king hrolf and gna. thanks.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-26,"wow! this build made gna almost as easy as other enemies. a bit longer to defeat because of the lack of attack power, but so much easier because you can now take so many hits. definitely recommended!!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-15,"just wanna give a shout out to you! this build is by far my favorite to use, it just feels so strong and makes me really feel like the god of war! just and indestructible rampage from start to finish!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,can you make a build that does the most damage?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-12,bro you are a genius. this helped me a lot to take down berserker. thank you so much and cheers.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,"hey guys, here's a god like setup. all you have to do is complete 99  of the game first"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-23,absolutely love this build man. made a few little changes to it myself with the amulet enchantments and something else so i can use the seal of runic storm alongside this build because i absolutely love that enchantment. great job though man
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-27,i was having trouble with a couple of the bosses. this build helped me defeat them. thank you!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-19,"thanks bro for that, easy kill for the king with that set, was struggeling a lot with that yesterday, now thanks to you i have platinum trophy, cheers mate"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-05,"thanks for the build. i had been stuck on king berserker for awhile and had almost all the pieces already, just needed the armor. used your build and killed the king first try. didnt even come close to dying."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-11,"thank you so much, i'm returning to the game after months of not playing to get into ng. i was never able to beat gna or the berserker king. just downed the king without using a rune stone. the fight lasted quite a bit longer because i wasn't constantly trying to poison him, but thanks again for the build. on to gna"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-29,thanks! this build finally help me beat berserker king n gna. you have no idea how many times i rage quit before using this built
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-11,mate!! this was the exact build that i was looking for. finally i was able to get rid of gna using your build. next up is the berserker king for my platinum trophy.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,"thank you so much for this build! i struggled with king hrlf so much. i tried like 3 other builds and nothing was working. could barely get him down to half health. i copied this one exactly and beat him on the first attempt with it. then i found gn and beat her in one attempt. this build is crazy good, thank you so much!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-03,finally beat berserker king after about 40 tries when i switch to this build. much appreciated!!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-03-11,"seriously, this is the only reason so was able to beat gna. thank you!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-06,thanks you so much. this allowed me to beat the berserker king and valkyrie queen. you rock
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-16,"thank you so much for this informative video. i only had gna left to obtain the platinum, and i gave up since i couldn't take her down no matter what i did. then i found your video last night, and i took her down after 2 attempts first attempt, my remote got stuck on r2, and she killed me. on attempt 2, i finally took her down. thanks to this video, i finally got my platinum"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-29,"2 years after uploading and this build saved me! not sure if you still check updates on this vid, but it was a lifesaver. thanks!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-27,"something worth noting about the lifesteal is it heals you per hit and doesn't matter how strong the attack is, so it's much more effective to immediately use a rapid hitting attack or better yet something that does tick damage. with a runic attack that does constant damage you can often heal for more than they hit you for with your armor's ability."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-30,thank you for this. i suck do much at the game even on the lowest difficulty that this made my endgame a little easier.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-28,been working on this for like 23 days finally got everything in this build i am literally op this will help so much in new game plus
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-03,i was finally able to beat the berserker king and gna with this build! you're a life saver!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-30,"this build is awesome. yes, the strength level goes down significantly but i literally just beat the berserker king using this build and got my platinum trophy. thanks man!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-07-17,"bro you are the best. i went from spending a month and still not being able to defeat the berserker king, to being able to beat the berserker king first try and gn with only one resurrection stone."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-09,233 i like how it completely recked my fellow mists of helheim
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-02,"this build finally allowed me to beat gna, although i did get my ass handed to me the first attempt with it, even with a resurrection stone. the three toughest bosses in the game for me to defeat were the annoying dude from asgard heimdahl?, the berserker king, and gna. these were the ones for me that took multiple attempts and consulting strategybuild guides to defeat."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-18,wow thanks a lot! that's epic!! i'll have to discuss this during my live show on my channel.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-07-15,"thank you thank you thank you! i watched so many videos  tried so many builds, whod of thought not dying would of worked!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-03-14,i legit died 100 times trying to kill the berserker king in ng. this build finally did the trick! thank you!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-06,"thanks for this, i've been really struggling with those berserker fights."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-07-04,alas even with that build that bloody valkyrie still kicked my ass
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-26,thank you very much for your excellent guide. it really works well and helped me finally defeat king hrolf to achieve the platinum trophy. keep up the good work.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-12,this build is amazing. it really work!! even on gmgow difficulty without the surtr's waist armor. and gear level 8. thank you!!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,this is by far my favorite build. i'm currently using a build like this but with a few tweaks. defense is very important in this game especially with how kratos takes damage
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-14,it took a long time to beat the berserker king but i finally beat him thanks to you!!! if i can like this video a thousand times i would.

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-05,kratos is voiced by hoot i think having hoot as the voice actor for kratos would be fitting
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-06,kratos has muscles honed through centuries of fighting and vigorous spartan training at an early age mimir has wits so intimidating that even gods fear his every move r6s recruit gun go brrr

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-03-26,i like the detail of mimir not looking for the enemys just the indicator mans putting as little effort as he can and i like that guys just a head after all cant expect him to care that much
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-09,i was not expecting that it got me good
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-16,"me your kratos character is pretty good, but the tattoos on the wrong side"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-07-08,lmao kratos treating recruit better than his own child

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-15,i really like how you can hear the claps when kratos is padding the little recruit on the head
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-08-23,rare artifact.may accidentally shoot the owner.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-05,recruit gets the praise he so rightfully deserves.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-02,bro replaced mimir
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-08-16,"picks up recruit, hugs them i've only had recruit for an hour, but if anything were to happen to them, i'd kill everyone in this room and then myself."

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-06,there needs to be a recruit weapon charm that looks like that. there could be one attacker charm and one defense charm
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-05,so simple but sooo good!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-10,
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-06-26,that would be amazing if they would actually add that
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-18,"we need this, i mean there is a new update soon"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-17,the little one should replace atreus
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-07-01,you know youve played too much god of war when you know exactly where that chest is
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-16,"just sitting here, patiently waiting for the recruit plush to come out"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-02-21,recruit is so goofy and the good job little one got me so hard
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-05,well at least now you can focus forward
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,kratos clapping cheeks wholesomely!!!!!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-04,bro kratos is as wide as the short i cant!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,even recruit ain't dumb enough to shoot kratos.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-25,"mimir can be smart, polite, loyal announcer. he is best ally."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-03-11,the best video i have seen in my entire life

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-09-27,recruit is the cutest thing to ever exist
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-15,woulda been real nice to have him in the game
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-30,its so wholesome how he said good job little one
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-02-11,i love that hoot is voice acting in these videos
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-03-28,recruit and little krieger would be good buddies
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-08,"isso fez meu dia melhor, obrigado"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-26,they way they looked at each other
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-08-20,bro showed more love to recruit as soon as they met than his own son xd
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-10,when he said good job little one i lough so hard
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-14,the way he scratched the cheek like it's a pupppy!!!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-03-02,i love the teamkill reference
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-27,"truly a great team, kratos the front, mimir the eyes to call out the enemy, and recruit to put down the foe so kratos doesnt have to change focus"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-04,good job little one greatest thing ive ever ever heard kratos say
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-06,may accdentally shoot the owner
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-14,the crossover we didnt know we needed
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,i love the good job little one it's so good
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-08-13,"love how the recruit's face was like, not now, im locked in."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-08-16,heimdall is the perfect example of imperfection imo. he was told how gifted he was so he kept growing and ego instead of training with his ability. if he was trained and got his emotions straight he mightve given kratos one of his hardest battle considering how overpowered his ability is
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-02-06,man i love that shot of baldur clapping as he walks away.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-15,we all knew kratos was number 1 we just wanted to see the other 14
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-10-15,wait till atreuss mom shows up
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-06-11,you disnt forget the sisters of fate. you are really honoured.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-03-28,i love how kratos went from beating up giants like cronos to these bite sized enemies
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-15,i think hades and poseidon stronger than baldur
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-04-07,"3000 worlds,and not a single worthy foe kratos martis"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-07-03,"i think ares is underrated, he could trap almost all the characters in the list in his galaxy pocket dimension, where he tortures them psycologically, he could trap them and release them only when he desires, he released kratos just to finish him up."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-20,"this list is almost perfect, but where mah boi atlas at? the strongest titan who needed both hades and poseidon to defeat him."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-25,"faye fought with thor and struck blows with so much force that when he fought kratos he said this feels familiar she then fought kratos, earned his respect, got married and had a child named boy"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-02-15,young zeus was something else.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-09-16,the power of hope in last one was so perfect
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-19,finally a good list.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-04-19,cronos in the corner
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-20,nothing beats the power of simply being a father to your kid
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-02-03,"bro the hope is just mental power to be able to continue, it is something like infinite will"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-20,this is one of the best edits ive ever seen ngl
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-10-12,sindri is so underrated he should be number 1
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-02-03,what will you do now father  kratos
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-08-20,"niimitz, amazing video keep it up dude"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-09-20,bro did heimdall dirty
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-08-14,you are sleeping on thanatos. kratos used full 100 power to kill him. imagine if some god would kill atreus with cold blood. kratos was pretty much not holding back at all and it was biggest rage of all time
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-14,this song in my opinion is that it fits so good for kratos
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-17,"missing chronos, gaia, atlas, garm, and jormungandr. should be a top 20."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-10-07,possidon if you know. you know
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-20,good list but i think the real tr should be in top 15 as the old god of war
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-30,"alomost perfect except that ares,posieden and hades are stronger than baldur"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-04-04,that fight against charon
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-04,i can make mention of one thing kratos would never forsake and that is destruction. he brings it everywhere with him.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-03,that kinda answered food theorys question of how long could you live in grocery store
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-07-01,boat captain slams
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-25,love this edit
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-25,accidentlally the hardest fucking reel ive ever seen
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-11,perfect edit
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-05,"niimitz, i cant stop watching your videos!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-03-28,you underestimate athena. she's more powerful than ares and the sisters of fate. even the fears in pandora's box don't affect her
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-02-04,our kratos is most powerful.can't defeat
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-07-16,perfect list
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-07-30,damn an actually great list although i'd put hades over baldur
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-04-25,that transition from thor to thanatos was so clean
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-08-10,"very nice editing, something that is rare nowadays"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-09-09,everyone always sleeping on how powerful ares really was
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-22,"you miss tyr, after the match kratos write in his notebook that tyr was one of most strongest opponents that he ever face"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-04-18,the ending is so cool!!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-29,the fact that poseidon and apollo did nothing but received the most horrible deaths
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-29,sindri in the corner
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-10-07,sindri be like  then who killed odin?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-02-06,didn't thor literally kill kratos just to make him keep fighting?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-18,great video
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-23,kratos... who have defeated all the others
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-06-14,i would heimdall a bit higher but aside from that i agree
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-08-07,nice list
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-29,this song suits so well
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-04-12,wait till the world serpent comes
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-11-18,love this video so much it's so cold
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-03-19,"fave should be one in the list, she was giving thor a hard time"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,the song was personal
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-16,one of my favorite edits evee
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-06-24,thanatos being underrated again
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-07,charon laughs in corner...
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-29,the intro of the short reminds me of the time kratos made a flute for his daughter before she died
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-07,the brother killer remains firm
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-21,epic music
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-26,the hercules boss fight was dope.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-10-15,goat list but correct me if i am wrong but shouldnt jrmungandr be on here
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-09-04,"i personally would put heimdall and baldur behind freya and athena. freya and athena are the most powerful goddesses of their pantheons. so powerful that even the god kings odin and zeus have fears and insecurities about their existence. zeus tried to prevent athena from being born and odin had to trick and manipulate freya into having her powers bound. freya is definitely in the top 3 most powerful of the norse gods in the gow games. athena, probably the top 5 of greek gow gods. i'm not too smart on mythology, but i think athena was always more of a diplomatic, smarter, less hot headed counterpart of ares. i'm not really sure how she compares to hades or poseidon tbh. for me the top 5 overall is 1  kratos power of hope 2  thanatos 3  zeus 4  odin 5  tie between freya, athena, thor, poseidon, ares and hades. if those 6 fought, it really could go either way. ares, thor and hades are really strength, power and durability based, and freya, athena and poseidon are very speed, agility, stamina and iqbattle iq based. and i think thanatos is very powerful cuz it took a near prime kratos to be in an unimaginably enraged state to kill him, far angrier than he was when fighting zeus or odin."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-04,hades and poseidon are sooooo underrated
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-02,i miss this games
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-08-03,"kratos killed his family in a fit of rage, slaughtered everything in his path, climbed out of hell on several occasions, killed the god of war and took his place, destroyed the entire greek pantheon. faye good boi"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-08-10,if they ever get around to a movie series based off of the games when they get to the norse stuff they should try and get eddie hall to play thor.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-17,world snake
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-05,"actually poseidon is stronger than baldur , ares , hades because when he was in his shield ,kratos said  true fighters don't hide poseidon  .... it was gaia who punched him and helped kratos to kill him"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-09,"alternative title, top vicitms of kratos."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-06-12,chaos the first primordial negs kratos poh  chaos appeared in the primordial war scene. the red primordial was chaos
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-24,atreus fully trained
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-03-02,w edit
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-08-24,odin is underrated tbh
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-09,charon who just dropped kratos like subway sandwich wrapper..
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-19,kratos gonna get the medallions
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-08-28,can you give name of song?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-03,faye is the legend we will remember u 4ever
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-11,heimdall thought kratos could never touch him. rewind back to the god who also thought kratos couldnt touch him
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-13,where did you find this version of this song
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-28,best transition heimdall
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-07-07,and only 3 of them are still allive xp
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-13,ngl i thought jrmungandr would be on their
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-07,finally someone shows respect to poseidon
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-09-05,sindri left the chat
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-31,imo i think ares is underratee cuz he gave kratos a hard fight. plus his abilities are pretty strong
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-14,really god of war is the best franchise
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-07-03,1.kratos 2.zeus 3.odin 4.thor 5.ares 6.hades
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-07-01,mon top 1 kratos et ragnarok 2 zeus 3 odin 4 poseidon et hades. 5 surs du dessin. 6 thor 7 baldur 8 atlas 9 jormundan 10 kronos 11 gaia 12 ares 13 heimdall 14 hercule 15 thanatos
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-03-27,everyone laughing until odin with mask shows up
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-03-21,thor at 7 is crazy
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-06-26,honourable mention goes to boi.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-02,ares  zeus  kratos legends
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-08-02,zeus kratos without the power of the plot
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-18,"does anyone think tyr after playing the valhalla dlc, has a spot on this list ?"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-04-12,nice bruh
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-03,"sindri's anger was really a reflection of his own guilt that he denied brok an afterlife. such a brutal and tragic ending for his character, but one that fit the events of the story"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-09,"it's easy to figure out what happened to the mask. the rift is a time portal. when loki threw the mask in, it arrived in midgard in 1994 where it was found by a guy called stanley ipkiss. they even made a movie about that."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,"when it comes to sindris story arc, thats how life sometimes turns out. very realistic arc even if its not a happy one"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-10-09,"faye originally found the mask making the connection to atreus. explaining all her knowledge on everything and events to come, also her price for using it was a slow sickness death instead of an eye like odin. she destroyed it and scattered its pieces. remember baldur was actually looking for faye in the first game, probably because odin knew she had the mask at one point. faye brought kratos to the norse world by using the mask, because he was the only one who could change the fate of their world. just a fun theory i came up with."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,"at the very end with sindri he just seemed, broken, not even angry anymore, just so incredibly sad."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,the biggest question it didn't answer is why the hell they thought its a good idea to have atreus fetch quest berries and flowers for 3 hours riding a pig.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"broks death may have been painful and sad af. but sindris grief hurt almost the same to see. such a kind, funny, caring and clean person change to be exactly the opposite. he was so nice and now he is dark and bitter. hel, he even killed some civilians and didnt give af, and sweer sindri wouldnt even do that to a draugur"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-02-19,"the mask actually travels through the rift and ends up in the hands of one stanley ipkiss, thus unfolding the events of the 1994 cult classic starring jim carrey."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-02,"seeing sindris dark side after broks death was genius, we never seen his side like that"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-04,kratos got to scandinavia on his journey to get rid of the blades of chaos as it was cursed and was stuck with kratos on his deathless misery. a comic book was released after the 2018 game by dark comics explaining his year long journey where he treads through deserts and savannahs looking for the deepest ocean to throw his blades. the comic contains ton more characters and interactions and also hints the egyptian connection where future games may take place ! hope this helps
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,"i've said this elsewhere, but my theory about the mask and the rift is that it relates to creation itself and the higher plane that athena supposedly ascended to after her death."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-08,400 there's an encounter with ratatoskar asking kratos who tends to the world tree back home and he tells him there's no such thing in greece then he ask him then how could one travel from one place to another and kratos answers on foot or by sea then the squirell replies good god man no wonder you left that implies that he got there by sea on a boat
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-11,"i just did this yesterday and it hit hard. i lost my older brother in march and i miss him so much. when mimir finally solves the riddle and says hole. it's because he recognized there is a hole in sindri's life and heart that will always be there. i got choked up and no game has ever had that affect on me. great game great performances, i still miss my big brother chris"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,"i think sindri's story is complete. he's hurt and purposeless, but he triesis becoming less angry, as shown at brok's funeral he doesn't lash out at kratos, just looks at him almost crying, but it's an improvement from being hateful. his story ark shows that, as most of the game already shown, revenge will take its toll on people, and will bring death upon people around you. another victim of kratos' crusade, albeit not an intentional one."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,there was a comic that did explain how kratos got to scandinavia and one of the boat conversations krato gives a straight up answer saying  i walked. i sailed  when mimir ask how he got there. edit correction that conversation was with ratatoskr not mimir.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-12,sindri is a prime example that not everyone gets a happy ending. they did a really good job of showing through atreus and sindri that taking peoples kindness for granted intentional or otherwise has consequences. i feel like sindris story getting a stereotypical happy ending with closure with atreus would just make every point they were trying to make with the situation completely moot
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-16,"i think angrboda blew the horn. she's a giant who speaks their language, and she was probably telling the serpent to let atreusloki know of ironwood. she knew he would seek answers on his quest, and who better to safely transfer the message, than someone of the same family, who is also of a generally foreign tongue."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,"420 at the end you can see the mural from kratos, and there you can see him in a boat on the first panel sailing from greek buildings to norse buildings. i also believe that at the end ratatoskr asks him how he is able to travel without the world tree, between realms, and kratos says that he could travel by land and sea."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,kratos was given a boat by the few surviving lesser members of the greek pantheon when they asked him to leave. he sailed for a very long time and then wandered scandinavia for much longer after before meeting faye.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-01-08,detail i noticed about sindri that i haven't seen mentioned. sindri wore gloves all the time. once brok died he's seen forging without gloves. he's forging with his bare hands.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-07,"i'm pretty sure in number 3 kratos already told ratatoskr that he sailed to scandinavia from greece. also in the press conference of the gow 4, it was already mentioned the concept on how kratos arrived in scandinavia is that the land of gods are like kingdoms where in the gow universe, you can walk, fly, or sail to another land country and that land have its own gods or mythology since in the gow universe all gods and mythologies exist in their land"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"man, while sindri's reaction at the end of the game is totally justified and heart wrenching in and of itself... when mimir finally gets brok's riddle after he disappears, it just takes that sadness to a whole new level."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,odin said the champion of the jotunar would be able to see it with the mask. but we learned later in the game that the champion of the jotunar is actually kratos. i think the rift will play a part in any god of war game here on out. because they basically spoon fed us that kratos is the one who will learn the important shit.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-31,the person who blew the horn was baldur he specifically says i knew calling the big guy would bring you two out
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,odin isn't the only one seeking answers
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-01,horn was definitely blown by an older time travelling atreus on some sort of giant saving mission which we may see in an atreus spin off game later down the line.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-11,"3. midgard is sort of scandinavia, just like how greece in the older games were... well... greece. due to the powers of the norse mythology, yggdrassil connects into other planes that make up the other norse realms, while midgard is rooted in the real world. kratos simply walked from greece to scandinavia, just like how once mimir simply left britain albaalbion and journeyed there as well. it is why midgard is the human realm while the other realms were inhabited exclusively by other beings until someone discovered how to realm travel."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-19,"reading seeing the sindri footage and reading comments about it makes me tear up. it's been months since i got the platinum for ragnark, but i haven't been able to move on from gow as a whole ever since. it doesn't help that i recently played through gow iii four times, but what ragnark did was cement the importance of the franchise in my heart. no story has ever affected me as much as this one has. since ragnark, it has been a constant thing for me, to think about slowly healing from all the anger and grief i have felt over the majority of my life i grew up in a broken, abusive family. and i also constantly think about wanting to be like current kratos  more patient, more forgiving, more considerate, more kind towards others. i can't praise the collective story of god of war enough. words fail me, i can't express how much it's all moved me."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,i truly believe that rift has something to do with athenas higher existence same shades of green
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,"how kratos traveled to scandinavia was answered when ratatoskr asked him if he has an world tree from where he came,and how he traveled,and he answered he traveled by boat"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-30,i would like to see how the actual series of events unfolded on the day faye and thor fought in the valley. how the crater formed how the frozen thunder formed. the way the spirits reffered to the fight got me intrigued. this could be a great dlc story.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-09,"330 i think the whole point of that is that it is supposed to not be answered. kratos said that knowledge comes with a price and atreus understood that, so he refused to acquire that knowledge and left everyone hanging."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-17,"at the end of the game, when kratos sees a second jotnar sanctuary behind the one angrboda shows to kratos and atreus, you can see in the first panel greece in flames and then kratos on a boat, so he most most likely fled greece by sea and happened to reach northern europe. not much info on the travel, but it's better than anything."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-11,"4. the dragons were canonically freed and it is referenced in ragnark, although very briefly while in vanaheim. mimir mentions they were former dwarves that were turned into dragons, while the ones in vanaheim were real dragons and thus less approachable. the dwarven king mentioned in side quests of the first game used parts of these dragons to create his armor."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-03,the rift was simply a item of temptation my personal theory is that when the mask is assembled and worn you get sucked in and get all knowledge but cannot leave and the mask was just used for those to drive people who give in to temptation
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-03-20,"150 it was baldur who blew the horn, he revealed it shortly before final fight. baldur said that he knew, that hurting big snake will help him find kratos and atreus"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-02,"in terms of how he reached scandinavia, there is a comic book that was created that basically showed that kratos sailed across the seas. the comic book shows that he crossed a desert also which looks like egypt in which he saved the local village people from a deadly creature. he then left this area and continued to travel until he reached scandinavia."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,"i did feel the story with the mask and rift was underwhelming, as we follow atreus to obtain the mask pieces only for him to destroy the mask, so that odin would not see the knowledge he seeked within the rift. that along with faye and sindri is what i hope will be explained in a future god of war game."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-11,"kratos shouting faye. the subtitle hey, bye"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-30,the god of war book describes how he travels between mythologies in more detail
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-09,"the most impactful thing about sindris storyline for me is, that we could see how he disappeared twice. once at sindris house and another time at the funeral. before broks death the dwarves were always playful with how they suddenly appeared or disappeared in all the different places. it was their biggest secret at least for me. but now after broks death, sindri doesnt care about it anymore, he just does it very unceremoniously."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-27,i didnt expect my heart to break like it did over brok and sindri. the music and the acting were incomparable to anything.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-04-08,the biggest question is will mimir get a body??
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-05,"sindris grief is so painful, but so realistic. im glad they included it, as sad as it was, because it shows a real struggle many people genuinely face. sometimes a person can only handle losing so much before they have nothing left to lose and theyre left empty and broken. all sindri has left is regret because he has denied his brother an afterlife. the people he thought he could trust would turn their back on him, like brok did in the old game and like atreus did when he left to asgard. hes so used to betrayal, and thats why he blames everyone else too when brok dies. the only reason he helped in ragnarok is because his hatred for odin, his brothers killer, was greater than his resentment for everyone else. i really hope he gets a redemption arc, but i also wouldnt be surprised if he doesnt get that. dudes been through a lot of shit."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,i was really hoping you'd go over the fact about odin and kratos had a conversation about godhood. odin points out that kratos doesn't know anything about being a god because he's never been worshiped. how odin came to this conclusion is way beyond me because all of his spartan brothers and sisters loved and worshiped him after he killed aries.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-01,"there's a comic showing how kratos left greece, went to egypt, helped and then ended up in midgard. they reference a few points from the comic. made more sense about the blades of chaos and why kratos still has them."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-07-08,loki definitely has a mask in the mythology thats where the whole plot line for the movie the mask and son of the mask came from in the early 2000s
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-04,seeing how many questions are left unanswered makes me so excited for any future games
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-11,"2. my personal belief is that the mask is a reference to the mask's mask of loki and was made by a future atreus before it is sent back in time by accident or by design. other than that, i do not believe it has a special connection to him in the game, it's just his innate godly powers of language that helps him decipher the scripts on it."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,not linking the mask and the rift to athena was the biggest missed opportunity in this game. the story that they couldve been crafted around that couldve have been so epic. the mask and rift even glows the same color as athena. odin seeks what lies beyond. athena literally reached the beyond in the previous trilogy.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-22,"he traveled by boat to scandinavia, he said it in the game during a audio on the boat while rowing"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-25,"i always thought it was baldur that called the serpent while kratos took atreus to freya. balder was still searching for the two of them at the time. before the final battle, balder mentions that harming the big snake would bring the two out of hiding. as for how kratos got to midgar, i suspect the creators intend that to be the story of another hand held game like ascendant was and a crappy idea if you ask me. on fey's death, i believe she willed herself to die believing she was the last of the giants and knew the prophecy that said her son would continue her work. this is the same fate that the giants met in jotunheim where fey's ashes were spread. the giants left their corpses behind. whether fey's spirit is in a marble will probably not be answered."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-22,"if atreus is seeking giants then he may just be headed into celtic mythology, or even egyptian mythology. but i feel like celtic mythos blends better with norse since theyre related, and in real history the vikings came to the uk in search for a new homeland with better farming lands."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,"theres a really beautiful detail about sindris story that breaks my heart. raebs lament, which plays during broks funeral, is essentially a revised version of the huldra brothers theme from gow2018. it now signifies and honors broks death, but in a way it marks the death of sindri too, or at least the version of sindri weve known and loved. hes a permanently changed man and i wouldnt be at all shocked if we see him further down the line."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-10-27,"kratos, how is it that you came to these lands? i walked"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-23,i believe faye moved on of her own accord. meaning she had the ability to decide when she died. not so much as suicide but more like moving on. knowing that it must happen to begin kratos and atreuss great journey.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-25,i think the mask is the same mask that jim carrey used in the mask movie. it might have travelled through time and he ended up finding it. basically the movie takes place after ragnarok
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,"something i don't understand is why when loki searches the mask piece at the wrong place in helheim it still glows, and the effect only disappears when they release the haunt"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-06-03,brilliant performance from adam harrington playing as sindri. that scene with him and loki at the shop still gets me.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,"a little note for the third question spoilers, of course  at the end of the game, where kratos see his last prophecy as a savior and a rebuilder instead of a monster and killer, on the very first panel of that mural you can see kratos traveling via boat, alone. that's how he travelled. we can say that's how he left greece because on the second panel you can see him with his son scattering faye ashes in jotunheim, after that his fight with thor, thus granting us a chronological order to the mural.  it is also asked by ratatoskr to kratos how he would have traveled in his homeland if there was not a world tree. kratos answers by saying on foot or by sea. search on youtube for god of war ragnarok ratatoskr ask kratos how he left greece by manugames92"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,that mask looks eerily similar to the mask's mask. the movie son of mask2005 also had him fight against loki with his own version of the mask.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-25,"as much as i would love to see sindri find purpose again, sometimes these kind of arcs just....aren't happy ones. he lost everything near and dear to him. and it further displays the consistent themes of vengeance, grief and the price of war that the games love to show. he deserves to be happy, but at the same time.....that isn't how it always works. and i think the game ending on this note makes it feel more grounded in reality instead of just a solely happy feelgood ending."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-23,"the question on how kratos got to the land of the norse, is answered in the comic series god of war fallen god"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,you can't just play that clip of sindri... i'm not prepared
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"i think that travel between pantheons is going to feature very heavily soon, and we don't unlock the secret to it until the post game. namely, tyr. he was known to have travelled and visited many different gods, and with him being freed in the post game for real this time, it seems likely that he will be the key to expanding the world of gow."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,"i like the fact that we dont know who blew the horn. it makes it even more unsettling. as for the mask, i agree with freya. it was just a distraction."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-05,"the freed dragons also raises an issue i had with the final ragnarok war. although there were a few elves flying around, it felt very much like it was just kratos vs. asgard. it would have been so much nicer if we saw hordes of the realms flocking through the gates rather than just having the gates destroyed by the laser cannons. the freed dragons could have also appeared here in a sequence, maybe to save kratos and repay the favours."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-04,"i always assumed the horn was baldur calling jormie. he was travelling round chatting to important people's for info, like mimir at the top of the mountain."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-25,"if i'm not mistaken, i'm pretty sure kratos briefly told mimir how he got to scandinavia from greece. he did it via ship, i think they discuss a bit while they tell each other's stories while rowing around when exploring the realms."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-04,"part of me felt like at least visually the mask was a nod to the jim carey movie since the mask in the movie the mask was supposed to be loki's and they even look similar. does that mean gow and the mask are in the same universe? i'm going to guess with like 99 certainty that's a hard no, but i felt like someone in that studio was having some fun when designing it."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-10-21,"223 for the mask, i think atreus breaks the mask at the end is bcz he knows what the mask is, rather what it said. early on in the game atreus says there is wiring on the mask but couldn't read it in its entirety bcz the mask was broken. with all the mask pieces being put back together he'd know what it said. likely telling him what the mask says and likely what it was made for. which is likely why he broke it and released it into the rift. he had the answer odin wanted so badly. i believe the knowledge atreus felt from the rift had something to do with his parents. a. knowledge of the giants and their magic, how far they could, and may have, gone. or what they could, and may have, done. as the giants tried to escape the genocide that odin and thor were bringing upon them. whereas, we find out all the giants weren't slaughtered, they all may have not been placed into stones. atreus may have learned this and he made sure odin nor anyone could ever find them. and he probably knows how to find them which is why he and angraboda set out to find them at the end of the game. or b. the rift tells how kratos ended up here. either way, the rift was a way out of here norse mythos and he made sure there was no way for odin nor any aesier to escape through the rift"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-20,"i feel like they could've talked more about faye and the history. like why didn't thor react to the axe? and brok's death was so hard to watch, he was one of my favorites."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-08,"if you play one of the side missions closer to the end of the game there is a dialogue while youre in a boat with atreaus where he says he wants to travel. and kratos says if you do so make sure its to somewhere. have a destination. i think that was slight foreshadowing that the game will be moved elsewhere. maybe to find the other giants, because angreboda said theyre nowhere in the 9 realms"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-25,1. sindri's story arc may very well be complete he lost his brother because of atreus's actions it's entirely possible he might not forgive him 2. personally i like the idea that faye died of natural causes it's nice to think that kratos was able to spend time with his family without some outside force coming in to take it away
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-25,"115 as mimir said that horn was for calling the world serpent, and baldur later says right before his final fight he used the world serpent to lure kratos and atreus out of hiding. so obviously it was baldur"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,"i always assumed that it was baldur, who blew the horn as his plan was to harm the big snake so a to bring kratos and atreus out into the open"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-01,i understand sindri. the death of my brother broke me. this is the 2nd time brok has died. he kept his brother alive but with only 3 soul parts.. but his brother was still alive. the 2nd time he couldn't save him.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-13,ima a grown ass man with tattoos all over the place but fuck did i cry at the end at broks funeral. i didnt have a dad as well so seeing kratos trust atreus and showing him love just got me teary eyed. my girl had to give me a hug and i was trying to hold it in but she walked in as i was finishing the game
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-05,"i have not read them myself, though i have it on good authority that both kratos travels from greece and faye's death are somewhat explained in the god of war novels. the latter i believe grew ill and died as a result of that illness. i doubt either point will be fully fleshed out in another game, though a casual mention wouldn't go a miss."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-15,i hope there's an expansion or dlc for a mission to recover brok's remaining soul fragments. seeing sindri like that at the end was a total gut punch.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,they said that he just traveled their. also they made a webcomic before 2018 gow. where he had traveled to egypt on his journey after gow3. so the world's all seem geographically connected in some way since he didn't use magic to get from one to another.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-21,to grieve deeply is to love fully... man that made me shed tears
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-04,"there is no mention of a mask belonging to loki in the original norse mythos, but the mask of loki is a thing in the mask franchise of dark horse comics."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-25,"sindri made mjolnir, which sent the serpent back in time. it seems likely that the only way sindri could save brok would be to go back in time or create something that sends atreus back in time to fix it and that could address who blew the horn, what happened to faye and nearly everything else."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-30,the kratos going to the norse mythology has been answered in a comic he just walked their
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-07,sindri's breakdown is so real and understandable and i feel so bad for all of them. kratos and brok's ever growing friendship and respect for each other especially with the spear. while atreus and sidri's kind of brotherly friendship was so awesome too see. brok's death never feels forced or pointless and actually is a major driving force for everyone. genuinely incredible story telling.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,"i know we definitely havent seen the last of these characters. hearing cory say some of the questions are for future games , makes me think they have a plan . i feel like the next game will be a spinoff ."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-18,i think the rift is where the giants are andor where they get their fortunes from. thats why loki had such a connection to it and why odin was forbidden from seeing what was in it.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,"this game was full of pop culture references. nobody remembers the mask with jim carrey, it was loki's. the rift, imo, was a play on doctor who and there are soo many others."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"i always just assumed the horn call from the first game was baldur calling the world serpent for information on kratos. as for how kratos got to the norse mythology, i presume it's just regular old travel. after all, tyr visited many lands with other mythologies too, and the aesir were aware of kratos past. so i assume they all exist simultaneously, however avoid crossing into each other's territory."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-04,"about the horn, theres a theory i came up. maybe someone else already talked about it but i didnt see anyone do it. so basically angrboda collected the giants souls in marbles. what if she wanted to talk to jormungandr and ask him whether he wanted to hide in a marble. however, jormungandr refused because his hatred towards thor was so great that he really wanted to fight and kill him in ragnarok"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,those dream sequences had some information faye mentioned they fought when they first met implying he was still rather hostile after arriving in scandinavia
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-11,"for kratos changing mythologies, there's a comic that takes place between gow 3 and 4, it shows kratos started wandering after greece fell. he first went to egypt where gods and destiny kept coming after him, so he continued to wander. he didn't stop wandering until faye found him which is when he made it to scandinavian."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-02,"i would like to see kratos in a throne as the new allfather but a peaceful one, atreus as an adult and the god of the giants, a new female thor and freya as the queen of the norse pantheon along aside kratos, not as his wife precisely but as his partner. then i would like to see them going explore other pantheons, like that mural from the 2018 game showed."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,407 they do explain how kratos left greece at the end of the game on the secret shrine....he took a boat
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-04,i expected more from faye's story but as far as sindri goes...that's just how it is. i think his story is complete. he'll now just bury himself in his work.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-01,"sindri is a bittersweet ending ontop of the beautiful endings of faye and the 2, kratos and artreus, kratos's life as a god of war and the end of ragnarok"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,"i assumed they left a lot of these questions unanswered on purpose, the horn and the rift will likely be answered in a future installment and sindris arc will be fulfilled later down the line"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-16,he did answer how he got there. he said he left his home lands and just kept going and eventually crossed faye.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-24,faye did say something about kratos leaving her behind because hes immortal and shes a mortal. i kind of got the vibe she was sick or maybe she saw a tablet of future
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,can't wait to finally experience what being a calm and reasonable person feels like
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-08,"seeing how atreus is confident and calm in front of fenrir, is a giant evolution of the character."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"i'm happy for kratos. all this time he has always fought alone, but now he has his son with him."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-08-01,"after all those years of pain and suffering, he has someone that has his back. man, i feel so glad for kratos."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,cant wait to try to say boy every time kratos says it
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-12,"i love the fact that we are seeing atreus growing, even his voice sounds more mature."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"at this point, ive grown up with kratos from my own childhood to now having a son of my own. absolutely cannot wait to play this."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-08-02,"when you are at your weakest, and fear and doubt are a burden too heavy to bear. remember this you are not alone. kratos  atreus"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,i love how confident and calm atreus looks in the last shot.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,you are not alone chills just hearing that
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,it is honestly amazing how kratos has evolved over the years. the father son aspect really adds another layer that was needed for the character as well as the shift in mythology.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-24,kratos has one of the best character developments among the game characters. and glad to see mimir in the game again. the tales he told on the boat are really interesting.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,this trailer just came out today and ive already watched it 20 times. this is going to be a great game
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,cant wait to hear boy again.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,let's go! can't wait to play it!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-12,this small clip is better than the entirety of thor love and thunder.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,this game really makes you feel like a responsible and loving parent.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"fenrir father? why are you shooting me with arrows, father?!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,oh man that father!! sounded so genuine. great voice acting
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-12-11,"when you are at your weakest, when the burden is heavy to bear remember you are not alone kratos and atreus"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"see how atreus is confident and calm in front of fenrir, a giant evolution of the character"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"i went back to hear the line remember this, you are not alone just to hear them say it together and just noticed fenrir chills"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,hyped! going to be awesome!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-11,man...when i tell you this is going to be spectacular. the fatherson adventure i never had right on a big screen again

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,i love how father and son also implies to atreus and fenrir!!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-15,i have a great deal of emotional attachment for this franchise. i have been through a lot on a personal level and these games have been with me all the way. at this point i have a lot of painful memories attached to this wonderful series and playing this will most likely bring them back but at the same time they were the best times i ever had. i will still play it and try to relive those happy times.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"kratos saying remember this you are not alone actually has a lot more meaning if you think about it, coming out of the ghost of sparta's mouth"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"when you are at your weakest. and fear and doubt, are a burden to heavy to bear, remember this, you are not alone."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,atreus is really becoming his own warrior. u can see kratos training has really been paying off hes out here handling himself like a real man. cant wait to see where he goes.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-21,they really played us with this trailer with fenrir. i think that made it so what actually happened in the game was a lot more unexpected
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,lets gooooooooooo!!!!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,i'm so glad we got a new dad of boy game.... it's so great to see how much atreus has grown in this trailer...
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,i can't get over that darkcold vibe of ragnark. this game is gonna be something else.

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-13,"from missing his shot in the 2018 gow cinematic trailer, to accurately shooting two hel walkers in this trailer, atreus has grown up a lot."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,this gave me chills. seeing fenrir was so dope. ragnorak is here

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-02-10,i actually cried beating this game. it was such an adventure  something i wish i could relive. top 5 goat for me
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"love how atreus strides onscreen and then stands side by side with kratos. he may not be as old, experienced etc as kratos, but in what matters to them, they are equals"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"this is such a badass game! if this doesn't get you fired up, nothing will!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,finally father an son bonding the video game is finally coming out soon! can't wait!

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"ive lost track on how many times i watched this. theyre words are too epic, the bond of father and son has become stronger, i feel im gonna let off many different emotions during my play through. i also kinda believe its a perfect release date, the game is set around fimbulwinter and november is part of winter."

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,i haven't been this excited for a game trailer in ages. full body chills!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,celebrating my one year anniversary of having my ps5 with this game
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"can't wait to experience this masterpiece, hyped"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-18,this 30 seconds trailer is still better than the 2 hours length of thor love and thunder film
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,love the fact that theyre hyping up how much more helpful atreus is gonna be in combat
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,this is literally my most anticipated game ever!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,from the cruel warrior to the responsible father i love how the franchise turned into hope it wins game of the year
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-15,definitely more character development in a cinematic trailer than a full fledged movie of star wars.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,mjolnir will make another fine addition to my collection
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"my most anticipated game of the year, cant wait to play this masterpiece"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"this made my day, i cant wait to play this masterpiece of a game"

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,"such an awesome game. being a father myself, i loved the dynamic between the two. cant wait."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,i am so hyped for this game!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-12,this will go down as one of the greatest trailers in history
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,atfirst atreus listened to his father's wisdom and now he is completing his father's sentences. he has come a long way
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"like kratos said keep your expectations low boy, and you'll never be disappointed. so did i an now im gifted with this trailer. do as kratos says and you'll never be disappointed."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,kratos never gets old.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-08-23,"coming back here after 1 month, who else?"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"i'm heading to the er terrified of the result for a surgery. not gonna lie, hearing christopher judge say 'you're not alone' and this game's official release date had me happy sobbing. thank you."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,i literally get goosebumps when i saw that huge creature. finally we get a release date. can't wait!!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-09,having to go through atreus' teenage mood swings is gonna be a roller coaster
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-08-10,019 the small details where kratos recalls his axe and the snow around it flurries away  that is what matters.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,what perfect timing to release this game right before winter!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"grandfather, father and child. what a lovely moment"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,i can just watch this all day again and again.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-11-26,"boy did the nerf fenrir, in the original north mythology he was a beast"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,kratos character development one of the best in gaming history idc
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,best gaming franchise currently. excited to play it.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"both trailers about the games so far are incredible, i honestly can't wait so badly want to play right now. i'm also really happy the release date was provided!!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-18,words cannot describe how excited i am
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,"atreus now looks so badass, kratos now being a calm and a reasonable person. i doubt he'll call his son boi again."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,ragnarok is going to be absolutely insane this is only a 30 second clip and it looks nuts already
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,i was waiting for this! this game is going to be amazing.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-10,seeing little atreus all grown up gives me chills
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-09,"one of the best games ever made, santa monica great work"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,i think i want a audiobook with the kratos motivating speeches and how to apply practices about stoicism in your life. it will be awessome!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-07,ive been waiting for too long
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,this is going to be freaking awsome! i can't wait to preorder the game.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2022-07-06,super hyped to dive deep into another and final masterpiece by santa monica studio
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-24,"go to httpsexpressvpn.comlazerzz and find out how you can get 3 months of expressvpn free! ultimately, i don't hate this game, i actually really do appreciate lots of it, and in a general consumer sense i'd say i had a good time with it, it concluded well and was maybe they best they could've done under the circumstances... but that's my totally uncritical take, if a take is all you're looking for. if you're looking for a real deep dive into what this game did and didn't do on a very critical level then join me for this video. timestamps in the description."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-03,the part at the start that states it's getting harder to critique each year because people make franchises their entire personality is painfully true and can be seen in these very comments.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-09-22,"ragnarok felt... anticlamactic. before i felt it was because the war itself was so small and short, but your video made these feelings make more sense the story had no room to breathe, so i was rushed all the way until the end only to realize... that was it? i was being trained to expect story beat after story beat being beaten into my head with no subtlety, even within the optional side content, that finally hitting the end left it feeling empty."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-28,my main issue with the game is that kratos never really is in any danger from the prophecy that has been announced since 2018.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-04,this is the best god of war ragnarok critique i've seen. you explained why i was disapointed with the game so much better than i ever could
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-08-21,"i hate how when you kill heimdall, the game threats it like you are a monster, young kratos is back, the killer of gods but is so stupid, heimdall attacks first, threats atreus and rejects with violence kratos mercy, they had to kill him, just like baldur"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-12,"my biggest issue is the norse pantheon being such a downgrade of antagonist compared to the greek gods. took only two games for kratos to deal with this mid pantheon of gods, but the action choreography was smooth though. the fight with zeus was way more grand compared to the odin fight"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-06-03,"watching this is painful, because it makes me think of how amazing a wellexecuted trilogy would have been."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-02-07,"god of war needs a directors cut! i would pay 100 for it to be as it planned to be. dont change the gamplay. change the story and add some important stuff.. it probably never happen, though one can only wonder how awesome it could be"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-07-24,"this was a great watch. while i disagree with some points, i think this video conceptually really hits the nail on the head. while playing this game it felt off and rushed despite it taking me 40 hours to 100. it was at war with itself and you described a lot of why it felt that way and articulated the points great."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-23,"it makes so much sense that it was meant to be a trilogy. i played god of war ragnarok right after i finished god of war 2018 and also felt like there was too much going on compared to how streamlined the first game was. while ragnarok had some really great moments, it sad to think that we missed out on what could have been a masterpiece of a trilogy. anyway, really great analysis, definitely looking forward to watching more of your critique videos!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-09-10,"after finishing the game for the first time, i just felt empty. id been waiting for this game for 4 years and it just didnt sit right with me."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-18,"12530 under no circumstance would kratos ever kill freya. he would easily let himself be killed than unnecessarily kill, especially reflecting on his past. replacing freyas death for heimdalla death is unnecessary and out of character."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-09-03,it's a shame this game gets worse the more you think about it. imagine if it was a fully fleshed trilogy.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-26,"let me just say dude. straight up, first things first. why does it feel so much like a marvel movie holy s"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-24,ironwood was like pulling teeth to get through and shouldnt have been glossed over so quickly
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-04,i personally liked gow2018 better in my opinion. it just seemed so much bigger and the story was excellent. ragnarok was good but not as good as the one before it.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-26,the decision to shrink the story to two games rather than the originally planned trilogy really hurt this game
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-10-27,"freya hey kratos, want a glass of water? kratos water...i crossed over water before i killed my own family!!!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-24,this will be a good comments section
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-06-18,"my main issue with gow is that the norse gods just don't come across as gods compared with the greek ones but at most demigods, even freya and odin who display the highest levels of power don't seem like gods but more like sorcerers."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-09-10,"the poor pacing and lack of logic with the characters in ragnarok was an insult to 2018, the writers really couldnt be bothered anymore and just wrote a marvel conclusion.. even the thor fights were meh in comparison to the baldur fights"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-14,the most frustrating game ive ever played
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-08-08,"my favorite part of kratos' journey was not the end, but the part where atreus yells at him you never wanted to do this with me and kratos said and yet i'm still here. is deeper than they may have meant"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-09-12,"the reception of this game just truly shocks me. the entire planet claims that it's a timeless masterpiece, a flawless sequel, the 2022 goty, the best sony game and so on, yet everywhere i look, the player base agrees on lots of issues. we hated the ironwood chapter, the minibosses were overused, recycled and disappointing, the pacing is off, and these are just the top examples. so if that many of us found these problems serious, why are people still having this 1010 discussion online? i just don't get it. it's a solid game but people are so blinded by hype it physically hurts sometimes."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-11,"i agree with a lot of points in this video, but one thing i dont see too many people bring up is how miserable actually traversing the world is. people usually complain about the slow transitions where you need to crawl under or through something, and those are awful, but theres also the incredibly slow and restrictive climbing and super narrow paths. with how twisty and mazelike the levels can be, especially in vanaheim and the applecore, these issues are only exasperated. slowly clambering your way around the environment feels so much worse when you realize you accidentally went the wrong way and need to backtrack through it all again. to be fair, gow 2018 had many of these issues too, but it was made less painful there due to much better pacing and less obtuse design."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-09-19,the freya and kratos conversation in the first vanaheim visit where they just try to out trauma dump the other is unintentionally so funny
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-03-09,just play them back to back and its painfully obvious how much better the first one is on a direction level.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-27,"as i was playing vanaheim, i actually got really invested with the dialogue between freya and kratos. as a player, we likely feel how atreus feels about her as he desperately wants to set things right. he even goes alone to visit her, knowing well that it puts him into danger. kratos knows she's important to him. then we get to the vanaheim section. kratos and freya must work together and tensions are very high at first. freya is still full of emotion and could snap at any moment. kratos, knowing what's going on with her and owing a great debt to her for saving his son, starts to explain his past to her. as a player, we of course know all this, but freya was genuinely surprised by some of things he says. as i ventured further into vanaheim, tension was lessening as both characters are opening up. i thought it was well done. it wouldn't make sense if she decided to kill kratos as suggested in this video. atreus' reaction or lack thereof to her being at sindri's house was very disappointing though. just acknowledged in a throwaway line while in asgard."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-01,"the point you made about side quests at 2730 and throughout part 5 are points i highly disagree with, the side quests in ragnark also add to the story, theres even a line of dialogue in aelfihiem where mimir points out that kratos is doing all of these side activities as a way to spend more time with atreus while he can before his prophesied death. kratos as well as the player know that this cant last forever, kratos and atreus will be separated somehow, so kratos wants to spend time with atreus doing what he enjoys, helping others and exploring realms, which is exactly what the side content is. you as a player are rewarded with both loot, but also seeing the relationship these three have grown to have, while it still lasts."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-06,"too many modern games prioritize their extremely mid storiescharacters.... i play games because i just want to have fun, that should be the foundation every game is built upon. games like doom 2016 and from's titles actually understand this. where's the crazy, insane action and spectacle, where's the gore, where's the war in this game literally called god of war"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-26,"also, another issue with your video i wanted to add was that you really mixup what subtext and disclosure is. kratos openly discussing his trauma and past with freya is a direct result of what he feels he owes her. she saved atreus from an incurable illness and so, in his new role as a guardian figure, he feels he can disclose his past. its a huge mark of his progress as a person and should not go understated."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-04,i personally wouldn't call it a disaster but i 100 agree that this game was no where near as good as it should have been imo. even now nearly 5 months later i'm still trying to understand why i don't love this game like i expected myself to like gow 2018
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-22,"i knew something was wrong with this game when i realised that whole joutunheim part that brought the story to a screeching stop took me longer to get through than the big finale both games were leading up to. i'm sorry but i didn't give a shit about angrboda and her stupid grandma in the gow disney edition section. if they really wanted to condense 3 games into 2 i don't understand at all why this particular part took up such a huge amount of time when it really could have been about 15 minutes long. also doesn't help that angrboda herself is a dumbass character that tells atreus he can't tell kratos about jotunheim but then randomly appears all jovially when thor and one of odin's ravens are literally meters away while atreus is out on a mission with them but that's a rant for another day. anyway, game is okay, not a masterpiece at all."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-24,i knew he didn't like it but calling it a disaster was unexpected  i will enjoy this video
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-10,i felt like i was going crazy that this game was no way near as good as everyone kept telling me.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-05-30,"2622 actually, i dont have to imagine it. thats literally what rise of skywalker tried to do, and even people who liked either of the other sequel films hated it."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-26,"i realized about a week after i played the game that for most of it i was just going along with it because it was the new gow and i needed to play it. i wasn't really interested in where the story was going most of the time and was only really hooked in at the first and last 3 hours. it's disappointing because i don't think the core game play systems are bad by anymeans, it's just that the characters felt like they were in a filler episode of tv 80 percent of the time. this game didn't leave me with any strong feelings, not love, not hate, not admiration, nothing."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-26,"its just sad that they finished it like this, 2018 gow was so good while ragnarok just feels like an afterthought"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-29,"about the horn i think there's a huge plot hole. there are a total of two occasions on which mimir converses with jrmungandr. the first conversation takes place right before searching for the chisel. the second conversation takes place before searching for mimir's missing eye. the horn gets blown between those two conversations. why in hel yes, pun intended didn't mimir ask jrmungandr who blew the horn on their second conversation??? that would've been the perfect opportunity!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-08-10,"the reason why ragnark strayed so much was because the developers got together and said nothing is true, everything is permitted and made the game"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-25,"whats funny is that i originally started playing gow because when i bought playstation plus a couple years ago i had the chance to play gow 2018, but before i dove into that game i wanted to go in depth and learn about kratoss backstory. funnily enough it was mostly to also find out where he got his axe from little did i know. loved the first three games when i played it, but when i went over to play gow 2018 idk what the heck happened but i wasnt intrigued by the gameplay. so i never played the game. however when i got my ps5 and could choose a free game, i reluctantly chose ragnarok. ragnarok turned out to be the game that got me obsessed with the story and the character and now ive played every game except ascension and i appreciate the character and the games more than ever. so for me gow ragnarok will always be my favorite. so yea. still laugh at the thought that i played the whole franchise before 2018 just to find out where he got the axe from. lol"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-28,this game got worse as it aged in my head. the gameplay is incredible. the story is the worst of the series and its not even close.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-10-26,"would have been a better ending if kartos said, its god of war time then that ine song form transformers plays and it fades ti credits"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-18,"it makes so much sense that this was at first intended to be a trillogy the norse trillogy we could have called it if they had split the first half into gow fimbulvetur and focused on thor as the rival to kratos , with atreus  kratos spliting, then would have made gow ragnark propper with atreus  odin being the main conflict , then father  son reconcile! i enjoyed it in the end but it feels so compressed . great feature length critique man, kudos"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-01,listening to james talk about ragnarok's handling of prophecy like he's a half insane scientist is an actual privilege
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-22,"ill finish this video later, but after finishing the ironwood section and even just the atreus sections in general, i will never complain about playing as miles or mary jane in spiderman again. at least those got to the point quickly."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-12,ragnarok battle 45 minutes ironwoods two hours
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-05,personally i liked the game. i think it mainly comes down to different interpretations of the game itself and it themes. like kratos telling freya about his past was to me just him finally finding closure between the ending of 2018 and the start of ragnarok and being open with other people. like freya saved atrues so he trusts her implicitly. to me it makes sense.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-06,"this always happens when an industry reaches a point of stagnation , consumers overvalue products. the beauty of mathematics proves this happens with stocks but i didn't think i would see thr same exact phenomenon in the industry i love"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-10-18,"okay at this point i'm post sponsor segment. i can't help but notice that you've become incredibly bitter over the course of the video. most of your criticism comes across as you have a narrative you want to push, so you're only considering how to frame the events in the game in the most negative light. atreus sweeping why freya is at the house under the rug can make sense in a multitude of ways. the most straightforward one being that he doesn't want to imagine what kratos and freya might have been doing. other reason might be that he doesn't think the reason why is nearly as important as the fact that she is at the house and is helping themkratos is to him. you're really hating on brok for some reason, you say he has no empathy, but that's clearly not true. even in the first game he asks about his brother, initially in roundabout ways. afterwards he becomes more direct, asking if he's eating well at least. in addition he has some of the wittiest remarks in the game, add to that his witty insults and you've got an endearing character. don't know why you are so dismissive of him. on to the champion bit, they clearly do imply who the actual champion is. it's kratos, the character is depicted with the draupnir spear, not arrows. atreus mistook them as arrows, probably because he wanted to be the champion of the jotnarr. kratos doesn't want to be the champion, but he becomes it anyway. not just of the jotnarr, but of all the realms. you go on and on about the champion bit, claiming they should constantly reinforce it. it really isn't all that important in the grand narrative of the story. it's just a title. it's the actions that kratos takes that matter. it's what makes him the champion of the jotnarr and what drives the plot and story forward. i assume this is what you mean by focus, considering the amount of time you spent criticising this minor part of the story. if this is the amount of focus you demand of the story, then i can only say i'm glad they are not as focused as you want them to be, in the way that you want them to be. the mimir bit, it's about what the character feels about a wrong they committed in the past, and telling that to someone they not only trust, but value and admire. he's telling kratos this because he regrets it and because he doesn't want kratos to think lesser of him. he wants kratos to understand he is no longer that wilful youthful idiot. you contrast that with a 2018 clip saying that you can never be free from your chains and that is what kratos implies. except it isn't, kratos clearly implies  if you can really even call it that, as it is quite a direct statement  that he is no longer bound by the chains athena used on him. in other words he is free, he might still be a monster, but one no longer bound by his monstrous past. he has freed himself from his chains and is now actively working to become a better person and father. it's kinda ironic that you harp on and on, but completely misinterpret the actual subtext. the freya bit, this could have been better. it could have also been worse. what we got was actually pretty damn good. the irony for me is that the story beat you came up with was what i expected them to do. but instead they went the redemption route, showing that even freya can change her nature. which is in theme with the rest of the story. you are right though. the acting is phenomenal. freya and kratos gradually start trusting one another more and more. it's clear from their dialogue and their tone, especially on freya's side. it's not nearly as abrupt as you make it out to be. and now you're full on contradicting your earlier point. saying the game never overtly says what you want it to say, it only implies. 12836 meaning that if the game is blatant it's bad, but if they're subtle a thing you claim is always better, it isn't btw it's also bad. at this point it's clear you've really soured on the game for some reason, but it has become less and less clear throughout this video. you never seem to address the problems you have with the game in more than a very shallow framing. it seems to be mostly empty, vapid arguments one after the other. atreus has become awkward. yes he has, it's part of growing up. he's trying to find himself, find who he is, how he is and is trying to fit in. his attempts at humour might fall flat, but did you expect him interacting with mimir on a daily basis for years to have zero effect on his character? freya says dwarven magic makes no sense, because the dwarven magic system is completely alien to her. it doesn't map onto her vanir magic in any way shape or form. it isn't her trying to be funny. angrboda being a socially awkward recluse makes complete sense, she literally is. she doesn't have anyone to interact with other than the animals around her. and animals aren't exactly know for their stellar conversational skills. the odin mob boss statement is fairly accurate, that seems to be exactly what they were going for. it also makes sense with his interactions with thor and the rest of his family. he sees them all as tools. but he's distinctly different from what we normally get from such characters. he's far more of a narcissist. he doesn't care about his family other than their capacity as tools. we get that right at the beginning of the game. you will not get look how they massacred my boy out of him. he is a subversion of the standard trope, but i don't know why you think they're trying to be funny with him. they're trying to show he will and can manipulate everyone around him to get what he wants, as that is the only thing he cares about. he's only funny and witty to the extend that it furthers his goal. once you've been around a group of people long enough it's completely normal to quip back and forth. i'd at least expect you to understand bants mate."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-07-18,what i absolutely didnt like about this game is the dialogue and this unnecessary mcu humor
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-06-30,"idk if you mentioned this in the video because i'm still watching it but one of the major issues i have with this game are the dialogues. the use of modern slangs  language in this game breaks immersion. like the use of modern dialogues are not at all consistent with the timeline. in the greek gow games there were spartans  olympians  oracles etc. the norse saga takes place only a few years after the end of gow 3. the timeline of all these gow games can be anywhere between 300 bc to 5th century. so when odin uses words like my ex when referring to freya  disgrunted former employee for mimir  atreus uses words like whatever it breaks immersion. this is supposed to be a mythological world based thousands of years ago. wtf are those dialogues man, those 2 are the ones i can remember from top of my head, there are way more dialogues like that. you should look into it  make a separate video if you have to. this is a writing crime bruh especially in such a big game series like gow. gow 2018 also suffered from this but my god ragnarok took it to another level. what next they will use gen z slangs like l bozo gigachad rizz ok boomer simp etc?"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-12-12,"the only thing i really couldnt stand about this game was the war. all game long we hear kratos refusing to take his son to war and by the time it happens its like a 15 min segment with scripted events. imagine if when thor vs the snake not even gonna attempt to spell his name came crashing down and opening up diffrent paths for you traverse to odin. it felt so rushed when they had an endless possibly with it but they went the most boring and safest route imo. they could have made it so much better,forced us to witness the death around us have kratos take charge and push the front line while we move over to loki and have him do something complete different on a diffrent part of the battle then they come together towards a second or third stage of the odin fight showing kratos that his son truly is strong enough to go on his own. i really liked this game i played it 56 times but everytime i get to what was lead of the whole story it was a huge letdown."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-24,"you hit the nail right in the fucking head dude. every time i tell someone why i dont like ragnarok, they always assume im just a hater or that i dont appreciate good storytelling. but this vid explains why better than i ever could, so ima always reference your vid whenever some asks me about ragnarok."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-30,"about an hour in, and honestly the beginning was really great and hit all the notes of why ragnarok has its issues but then we got to the part about fate and messaging and im sitting here like did we play the same game? it was obvious to me in the beginning that the messaging was fate and prophecy doesnt exist, the choices you make and who you are as a person decides what the future is the norns could not predict everything. even in the scene with them they say things like kratos holds the urge to groan he fails. and when they were told that he killed bauldr to protect freya, they didnt see that coming either, just dismissed it as so what he feels guilty about it now so should we give him a crown?. also, the inclusion of the final mural where faye had rewrote kratos ending gives supporting evidence tha faye is actively trying to change kratos path, hence the dream sequences. and the conclusion of that section. you can do that apparently, its just that simple. is it though? we just watched the characters go through exactly line by line of the prophecy up until the very very very last 10minutes of the game after 30hours in 2018 and 45hours in this game. was it actually that simple to rewrite fate? we see them try multiple times. avoiding bauldrs death, avoiding killing heindall, avoiding ragnarok it all fails time and time and time again. it wasnt until they finally made a decision to change who they are at the core. that the ending changed ever so slightly odin instead of kratos in artreuss arms but i wouldnt call changing your core personality an easy feat. sidenote, not all the internal shrines were the real truth about the characters they were just more in depth explanations with more details about the events that happen and might happen. only groas painting i believe have a different ending because groa had to lie to odin. the shrines are available to all jotnars, that includes angrboda and all the other giants who have escaped the realms that may one day want to know what really happened. not just its just for artreusloki the character plot of kratos not doing anything is valid, but you also have to remember his core belief he doesnt want his son to go to war. thats why he does nothing and is reactive. he is doing the bare minimum without losing his son because his son has already snuck out without his knowledge. even early in the game mimir advises him that hey if you dont stop holding youre son back, youre gonna lose him. he is terrified of losing his family again. while there are a lot of points this critique makes are very valid. i feel like you are so obsessed with the this shouldve been two game, not one concept that you are almost finding extra reasons from what is happening behind the scenes at the studio that you forgot to actually sit and listen to the story being told. was it crammed? yes, but the story is definitely not as disastrous and broken as you claimed it to be edit wow, maybe the reason why its so critical is because not a full playthrough was done. comment about freyrs just being accepted that they like him there well there was a whole entire story arc in alfheim with mimir and freya that told why he is revered there. guess that was missed"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-08-22,13215 this part is explained in multiple side quests. freyr once teleported into alfiem into their magic water or whatever and everyone thought he was the chosen one among for the elves. thats why both sides of elves love freyr. but yeah reducing something as important and as big a plot point as uniting two warring factions to a few lines of dialogue is really dumb.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-09-01,started off defensively as if youd offend fans. but really your complaint is that there wasnt more god of war. this is something we can all agree on!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-04-05,it's chekov's armory wall but he's excomunicadoed
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-06,i enjoyed 2018 way more. i couldnt even bring myself to finish ragnarok. edit i think it comes down to that i had a clear goal in 2018. i didnt feel any purpose in ragnarok. it just felt like i was jumping around between realms for the hell of it.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-28,joseph anderson will either be very angry or very impressed that you managed to beat him to the chase! im glad at least you were both on the same page with how you felt
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-01,"i played gow 2018 first then ragnarok when it came out last year. in february of this year i went back to the classic trilogy and instantly fell in love with them, the music, the gameplay, the energy and the low key story are all amazing, honestly they blew the new stuff out of the water imo and i played the new stuff first. so no nostalgia or bias. im surprised the new games are as highly rated as they are, there good dont get me wrong, but not game of the year or 1010 timeless masterpiece good."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-09,"for as much as i did still enjoy the game the first time around, i did finish with a feeling that something was off and it's good to see you put it into perspective. hell gow has been my favorite series since childhood and i bought a ps5 just for this, but at the end there was a feeling of what could've been. for something as catalytic as ragnarok, maybe i was expecting more, something like gow 3. not necessarily that violent kratos and tone, but still. it's a long game yet it really does feel off, rushed, despite the polished mechanics other than the ui downgrade. for as much was setup in 2018 and this norse world, it didn't feel like we got to experience all of it, and now the saga is over? it's hard to see where they're going next but hopefully they don't commit this same mistake again."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-26,"a great game needs critique. no game is perfect. i love ragnarok, but we can always strive to be better. critique is a step in that direction. i hope he tears it down, so the next game in the series can have some discussion for the developers to look at and see how they can improve."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-13,i hate playing as atreus and will never do so again
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-06,the title is hyperbolic but he does makes some really good points in the video. i too walked away from ragnarok feeling a bit cheated and so it's nice to see someone express in words the issues i had with the game and introduce me to things i missed that they don't like about the game
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-06-17,"calling gowr a disaster is flat out wrong. an analysis critique means you are actively trying to find a flaw in what you are criticizing and analyzing. overall good video and while i do agree that there are things in the game that arent as good as other parts of the game specifically ironwood but its easy to find a flaw in any game as there will never be a game that is completely perfect. it definitely is a good game and i think your expectations were kinda skewed after gow2018. its obvious gowr was going to be more of gow2018 due to it being a sequel with not many or any major changes. exploration, combat, the way the story is made, all of it was always going to be similar. i dont know what you were expecting with gowr but i dont think calling any game that was contending for goty a disaster is any good way to for people to see your point. it was kinda a hard watch due to the title of the vide cause im already going in with the impression that you will have unrealistic expectaions that are extremely nitpicky and that detracts from what your trying to say"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-18,"just beat this for the first time. im immensely disappointed, but i still enjoy the game. just not the game i wanted after 2018, and it doesnt feel like a natural continuation of that story. individual character interactions feel mostly well written and acted, but the plot itself just isnt executed well. it feels like they tried to cram two games into one. if this game had been about fimbulwinter with freya and potentially thor acting as primary antagonists while fleshing out the pantheon of gods, and subtly building to certain threads hinted at in 2018, ending at the point where brok dies, and freya is made a reluctant ally, it would have been ace. ragnarok itself, and the joining of the realms needed its own 20  30 hours of run the 40 minutes of it we got was well done, but not enough."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-24,i already know i'm not going to agree with this lmao but james always explains his takes well so i will watch in its entirety and comment for the algorithm. get that youtube money!
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-04,"i agree that the game was rushed and condensed but i disagree with your take on what should happen to freya. she only made her choice to die so that her son could live. now that he's gone there is no reason for her to die despite maybe feeling like she partly wants to. but her joining forces with kratos she slowly began to see reason instead of only rage. she understands, begrudgingly, that her son was evil and that kratos had only good intentions when saving her life. so then she starts to turn her focus and rage into wanting to stop odin start ragnarock and she definitely understands that kratos would be a great ally or tool to that end. her dying would be pointless and make freyr even more so."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-05,"the biggest issue for me was that the combat was just a bit of a slog. it felt good, and it looked good, but it just took so long, especially on any higher difficulty and especially especially against any moderately highlevel enemy or boss."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-27,"one huge issue with the game that cannot be explained away or justified in any way, is the extremely lackluster final act. how did they screw up the titular event so badly? i was giving the game a significant amount of benefit of the doubt up until ragnarok. it was at that point that any goodwill i had towards the narrative dissipated, and it became obvious to me that development of the game must have been a mess in a lot of ways. if i was a project manager or a producer responsible for this game, it would be a nobrainer to me that ragnarok itself must be the one part of the game that is knocked out of the park above all else. instead, it's easily the most disappointing part of the experience, and actually makes the rest of the game worse. it makes the universe feel incredibly small, considering we only see 2 norse gods during ragnarok, who were already major parts of the plot, which makes it feel like the norse pantheon was basically just like 8 people with an army of einherjar. there's some throwaway lines about lesser aesir, and some of the other members of the pantheon are described in stories told be mimir, but it really doesn't justify making it so that barely any of the norse pantheon has screen time. if we compare the amount of gods shown in the norse games to the original trilogy, it's not even comparable. the norse games absolutely should have been a trilogy, they should have actually made an effort to represent the entirety of the norse mythos, and they damn well should have made the event of ragnarok something more than 45ish minutes of weak spectacle. as it stands, we get to the end of ragnarok and all i could think was that's it? they were more interested in telling a personal story about kratos and boy than actually giving us an interesting story about an outsider finding his way into norse mythology. atreus being loki was a horrible decision that deprived us of running up against what most people would consider the most interesting norse deity, thereby even further shortening the already short list of aesir we see. at least i had plenty of fun with the combat, but i really don't have any desire to do another playthrough and suffer through the disappointing plot again. the focus of the series used to be bringing mythos to life and using it as a fun vessel for spectacle and gameplay. the focus has now shifted to an intimate father, son story that the devs will sacrifice everything else for the sake of, which is pretty disappointing, and even that intimate plot feels rushed because they were so insistent they tell this story in 2 games."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-20,"when the release date of the game was announced i counted the days to finally being able to play it. while playing i enjoyed everything about it. often i spend minutes just standing on specific locations and enjoying the beauty of the surroundings. for example the view right after climbing the wall with atreus. that was something i did not do with 2018. the fighting system and the possibilities to change your settings and controls got improved. i got myself the platinum trophy. i totally get the point in the video that the story might feel rushed, but for me that was not that much of an issue. the whole ragnarok event in the game actually felt a bit anticlimatic for me. like that's it? but other than that i thoroughly enjoyed it and i absolutely can't wait for ng to finally launch so i can play it again and try gmgow difficulty for the first time."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-18,"my pov on this is pretty clear to me that there are parts that would fit amazingly in a second gamegod of war fimbulwinter the search of tyr, the visit to jotunhein, the reconcialition of kratos and freya, the scar of thor caused by the axe  jormungandr poison and the atreusloki turning his back to kratos and moving to asgard as ending of the game, reinforcing the prophecy scene where atreus leaves for odin and kratos fighting heimdall, with the draupnir spear saga, and getting the gjalarhorn, which would end the game. for a third game, the true god of war ragnarok, there would be the visit to several realms, such as alfheim, svartalfheim, helheim. for the end, a better version of surtr and her wife forgot her name, where surtr convinces her to let him being the ragnarok, but kratos and freyia facing her in a fight after she loses the control, but regains her trust as an allied in the end. atreus would be having his saga with the mask and the occasional visits to jotunheim, faye visions as kratos had and a fight with vidar, the god of vengeance, as a request of sif by the murd3r of modi. after vidar beats off atreus, he visits kratos and the folks and changed sides again, then kratos k1lls vidar with cruelty for beating his son. the plot of brok's death would be more or less the same, leading to a more grandious ragnarok."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-25,i still think cyberpunk 2077 is bad even after all the updates. so i understand.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-05-05,"i love the game but your points were spot on. especially on the aesir gods and how the 2018 aesir wouldn't fit in. as soon as i saw odin i said hmm....really? then he and all of the other aesir spoke. most annoying of them all being thrud. why do they talk like that?! does odin run a small struggling personal injury law office on the side? is thrud having popularity issues at the all father of asgard high school?! uhh, midgard boys are so weird. really? that's level of effort you put into writing the aesir dialogue and banter?"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-11-27,"you know what this video made me think cory realized it would take way too long to tell the full story and decided to make it one game rather than 2 then realized literally all of these points you brought up, decided he couldnt do anything about it, and removed himself from the situation. i think thats incredibly unfair with the critique of the exploration, i completely understand what youre saying but honestly i didnt care. the exploration was much more interesting gameplay wise and side quest wise than 2018 in my opinion"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-11,am i crazy or does this game feel extremely and unnecessarily drawn out?
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-29,recently played this and felt the exact samewatched charlies video and left as soon as he said ragnarok has some of the best writing in gaming  i genuinely feel like an alien in todays modern entertainment schlop that seemingly everyone creams over yet i find mediocre at best. we live in strange times folks.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-15,"killing kratos with a 20 year timeskip is a much better idea than what they came up with. the biggest thing where you can see chunks missing is the fact that atreus practicly has no relationship with thor, or a fatherson relationship with odin. there's just no time for that and it really feels like a miss because of this."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-26,"i will say, i feel like there are some parts in here where the point is missed. although you made some points, there are some areas of depth that are lacking. 1. atreus is a child. it makes perfect sense for him to have gone to asgard to see odin because he thought he had all the answers. his character is one that tends to get ahead of himself also shown when he released garm and this is another example of that. he was fixated on his goal to find out who he was supposed to be, this was a part of that. 2. prophecy works in juxtaposition with 2018. where in that game they went on their journey only to find out it was prophesied at the end, here they know what the end entails and have to decide how far they want to go down this path. this hold weight, as there are several pieces of dialogue around inevitability, and is used in a nice way to tie back to greek mythology about people trying to subvert their destiny only for it to come true anyway. 3. you implied a couple times that kratos does not feel that close to mimir. that is simply not true, as in the journal he writes that he has not considered many people a brother but he does mimir. 4. it makes sense for kratos to open up to freya. he never saw her as an enemy which is why he never tried to kill her. you mentioned that he only saved her from baldur so his son would not see it but whats not entirely true. she saved his sons life, he did not want her killed. 5. freyr has a light and dark elf, a traveller, and a dwarf in his camp. they united because they really like me works because its implied he has that gift. this is told not only through this, but also through what freya says of the leader he could have been had he chosen to. 6. kratos absolutely wants to help people. he writes favorably about people in journals when he can and there are a few missions where characters to do expect him to take up the task but he does because he feels its important particularly when helping the spirit father find his son. 7. the allstars tournament reference is an easter egg. its just an easter egg 8. about the combat.. yes he is brutally killing things. you included a clip in this very video where athena says you will always be a monster and he says i know but i will be your mister no longer. its also incredibly apparent that kratos will do whatever it takes to get the job doneprotect who he loves. there are so points i agree with in this video, like how it needed to be 3 games to tell a full story and how some parts were left unanswered. i almost do agree with the tedium of the crater as i found myself running around aimlessly although i find it interesting that you didnt mention the hidden parts only accessible by boat, since you liked that in 2018. i think its obvious from my essay that i liked this game lol, but i also analyzed it and these are just some of the things i found differently"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-18,"for me, the game kinda fell apart at ragnarok itself, it felt quite rushed and anticlimactic which left a sour taste in the mouth towards the game as a whole. though whenever someone even slightly critiques the game, the horde of fanboys will eat them alive without even considering their opinion."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-02-19,"i finally put this game down after a couple months and a few final days bashing my head against the wall in valhalla, trying to unlock the rond of obliteration. dumbest challenge i've ever attempted in a game. mastery difficulty feels straight up broken, like the enemy animations are lying to you about when to dodge or parry. oh, yeah, anyway...i hated the story. 2018 was pretty good, even if it was a big chain of mcguffin chases needed to propel the characters to the next emotional beat. but this game was a mess in so many ways. i honestly don't think i could retell it with any detail. i'd just have to summarize it as atreus keeps doing stuff and kratos is along for the ride until he kills thor and odin to save everybody. the big shocking moment with odin being tyr all along made no damn sense. i don't understand the point of atreus' soul marbles and him saying goodbye to kratos by running off the screen at the end. so many emotional moments feel forced now, with characters constantly sharing each others wisdom as if it's a contest to see who is the most mentally stable. the modern, human way these gods and goddesses are portrayed doesn't really work for me, like freya talking about how much odin being an abusive husband affected her. it just doesn't land when she's literally one of the most powerful beings in that world. i dunno, i could go on and on. the writing just wasn't that good."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-07-09,"ragnarok ruined mimir. hes extremely annoying in this game, when in gow2018 he was the most likable character!"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-03-06,"tldr the traversal is incredibly unsatisfying, the enemies feel like too little, the map is a chore to walk around, the mask plot was shitty, boring, came out of nowhere and nothing happend cause they get rid of it anyways, no more backstory about baldur and dozens of loose ends from the previous games story."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-03,"in 2018, the only mistake i found was how did baldur leave hel past the bridge of the damned. who would even go past there to search?"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-01-31,"i just replayed this for the first time these past couple of weeks. on new game  and just did the main story, no side quests. and while i'm starting to come around on this video, i do just have 1 thing to say.... ironwood fucking suuuuccckkkksssss dude omfg i did not care about angroboda or the fucking yak or her stupid grandma or anything. that section of the game just neverrrrrrr ends i couldn't believe my eyes when they had me skipping fucking rocks. worse than every single mj mission in spiderman 1 and 2 goodness gracious."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-10-02,"i think the main problem is the story feels rushed, especially at the end"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-26,"this video explains everything i feel about ragnarok. id play 2018 for hours at a time because it was fun and exciting, i couldnt wait to see what happens next. when i play ragnarok i play just to get through to the next mission and finish the game."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-17,1957 they shouldve maintained that momentum after the first 2 hours of the game. for example dont just have thor fly away after kratos punches him give us an more of the fight more stakes. have thor destroy the lavinathon axe. dont let freya give up so easily bring her back early. build on it.
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-01-05,"i just finished the game and my biggest problem is how wrong it feels to explore compared to 2018. having to put aside the prophecized death of kratos to go free a big chained up river monster thing or atreus asking to go explore right before you meet the ragnarok troops? i literally didnt do any side quests while playing the main story because i felt like it would completely ruin the immersion. it makes so much more sense exploring after the end of the game, but then you cant do it with the actual person you want to do the exploration with atreus and youre stuck with a freya whos friendship didnt even feel earned"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2025-03-02,"i don't get it. the original trilogy is amazing, because each director bought in something unique. jeff was the guy who set up everything, and made sure we understand, that angry man was actually very complex, and at the very end of his wits. cory showed us what happens, when you rip away the only thing that angry man had left. what happens, when a man has been stripped of everything. and finally, stig showed us, that there is hope, even when you lose everything, and there are still things worth fighting for, even if at the end, you will still lose everything. my point is, why couldn't cory just let someone else finish his story, like jeff did? why couldn't he allow people to continue his vision with their own flavour? he claimed to be more mature, but this is so insanely childish, especially considering, that god of war isn't his children to begin with. it was jeff's, who handed it over to him. he should understand the feeling of passing the torch. hell, he already done it before. it's just so freaking weird to me"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-07-16,"i kind of wish the time travel aspect would have been more prominent. have kratos actually die more or less because of atreus and then atreus goes with jrmungandr back in time, but like waaay back hence the boy seems familiar to him makes more sense than a 5 second encounter. atreus then spends a long time trying to figure out how to save kratos, his travels and search for knowledge take him to many different realms and he eventually becomes tyr. the god atreus is obsessed with, is in fact himself. odin fears tyr because tyr has great knowledge of future events, because he lived them as atreus. the game could then replay some of the key events but altered in a way that causes odin to die instead of kratos, so atreus ultimately saves his father. atreus as the real tyr would have a better reason to remain away from the main characters as opposed to just being in a different prison. atreustyr would only be able to influnce events indirectly, in much the same way that faye did in the first game, which is a neat continuation of that concept. this also links in with real inconsistencies in norse mythology with tyr possibly being worshipped earlier than odin, some scholars believe that tyr has been adopted into the norse mythos from an earlier now lost religion."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-02-26,"really interesting video. an intriguing title since i played through the whole game once at launch and haven't touched it since. having thoroughly enjoyed it i was surprised to find myself nodding in agreement with a lot of the criticisms laid out and, while i still consider it a good experience for me, it was surprising just how many flaws i'd either missed entirely or overlooked. regardless of your intention not necessarily being to convince anyone of anything, really thought provoking analysis for me and an excellent piece of work"

Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-06-29,it should have been a trilogy to set the big scale of what ragnarok feels and to develop better the villains and explote better each realm and the north pantheon
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-06-26,"this is one of the games where you have all the hype playing it for the first time but once you beat it the first time, the second run doesn't really have it anymore, that's exactly what happen to me in the first one too, i beat that game once and no matter how much i try to play it again for the new game plus, it's just wasn't there anymore, my heart feels empty playing it the second time, like i said this game is a beat it once kind of game.."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2024-12-26,"i never really understood why i didnt have the urge to complete all the side content in ragnarok. i was told that it was worth it and i definitely should go back and do it, i just never had the will to do it. i remember at points in the story where i had the thought that i should slow down and maybe clear some stuff but had more of an urge to continue with the story which wasnt really that satisfying in the end. i also remember naturally wanting to complete all the side content in gow and actually wanting to 100 complete the game because of how good the side content and exploration was. in ragnarok, i actually liked the alfheim desert because it was the first bit of side content exploration i did. but once i got to vanaheim, i skipped through most of it and never came back. same with midgard. everything felt so much more tedious. i finally understand why"
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-07-18,"i hated what they did to the norse pantheon, as a kid i was a huge mythology nerd so i loved the stories of the norse gods that i read in some edas. odin? he is the villain, he has no honor, he is a scheming, squallid wimp who is humilliated all the time and meets a pathetic death. thor? depressed alcoholic, very similar to marvel's thor. tr, god of war? nah dude, let's just turn him into a pacifist who practices taichi to relax lol. jrmmund and fenrir? they're not worldending threats, they're good guys and serve no purpose other than eye candy. baldur, god of light? annoying one dimmentional asshole meant to be unlikable so the player won't feel bad when it's time to kill him off, same for heimdall freya is his soccer mom now. ragnark? never actually happens... the other godesses do nothing but give exposition and whyne. no accents or idioms either, everyone speaks like a modern day californian. it's like they hated the norse myths and just wanted to humuiliate it's legends and icons."
Action,God of War Ragnarok,2023-04-16,"the ghost of sparta doesnt make sense for this duo game. first i noticed it when kratos says kraots you know my past? thor yeah that ghost of sparta crap kraots then you know what im cable of but thor never mentions or insults kraots for killing his own family and thors sons or how he killed his father or destroyed his homeland. the ghost of sparta is classic campfire tale in gow where a hubris main character through his killing and pillaging ironically killed and pillaged his own family as he did his enemies and is forced to wear the literally ashes of his family s and haunts the land of sparta . what version does thor know? just a godkiller? does it not mention the reason why he killed all those gods? but thats could a little thing but odin couldve used to manipulate arteus which they didnt. when he says god does your homeland not have metaphor or did they? odin clearly states the greek world is gone, they know this but do they not mention how it happened? kraots is known as a god killerdirectly said by odin in tyr form and is the last greek left. does that not link? odin couldve used the fact kratos killed his previous family m,killed his father,every god in his way and destroyed his pantheon . it couldve scared arteus and seen his father in a different way and create a real conflict than the classic animated lier revealled trope. sure what i proposed is a classic movie misunderstanding trope but id argue its a lot more reasonable. so odin doesnt know or any the greek games just that its gone?in fact arteus never finds out about kratos first family and no character knows why kraots is white . this also made me think back in god of war 2018 what was freya going to say. after baldurs death freya says does he know? as if to ruin the image of his father to arteus but he doesnt mention the big thing of him killing his family. what we she going to say? what does the norse mythology know of the ghost of sparta? it seems they only mention the greek times in a time they need. like how its cool thor mentions the ghost of sparta but due to the story in gow1 being so well thats not just it. the ghost of sparta isnt just a name but a story itself so just to mention it off handed doesnt work like did thor not read the story or get debriefed by odin and only remembered the name. i just think that this couldve been a perfect story drama but kraots is trying to preach about telling the truth to arteus realises that he shouldve told about his past to arteus but he didnt and odin uses it make his own narrative and kraots unknowning being hypocritical. also it can be seen that kraots past finally catches up to him, not physically but just in words its self. also i just wanted to mention why in gow2018 is kraots killing his father a way bigger deal than him willling his last child and wife. in all fairness zeus came after kraots and in fear tries to kill kraots and the gods outcast him and even before this kraots asks to kill himslef in gow1 but the gods deny it and make him the god of war. this is much more egregious than kratos literally killing his innocent family. sure arteus and kraots are a father and son like kraots and zeus but imagine young arteus finds out his father whos constantly angry and arteus makes him mad killed his old family in a blind rage. it would be irrational to realistically think kraots would ever kill arteus but arteus is impressionable and would be both shocked and the fact even older and matured in gowr kraots never told him which would make him scared and disheartened. this couldve been a great moment but glossed over probably and how it seems like that they just didnt think about it much or at all."
