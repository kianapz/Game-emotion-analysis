This game was what I thought every game was gonna be when I was a kid seeing the leaps and bounds the N64 made"
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"You know when you get to the first proper camp out of the mountains, and Dutch makes that empassioned speech about sticking with him, and that they're a family, etc?

Well, a couple of days later, if you go down the hill a little bit (the opposite side of the hill where you go fishing with Jack), you can find a broken down wagon and a couple of barrels in some trees. 

There's a note there, with Dutch's speech, written with notations and things like ""need to appeal to family"" scrawled in the sides

Unless you know about it I think it's very unlikely you'd stumble across it, you can't get down the hill that way and there's no path, but it's a great detail... you think the speech is empassioned from the heart, he's making it up off the top of his head but no, he thought for days how to perfectly manipulate everyone"
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,One of my favorites is your horse getting agitated and moving it's head away if you light up a smoke too close to it.

1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"okay that is super awesome, didn't know that. 

Years later and we're STILL learning about little details."
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"I finished it on PS5 and got the Platinum some time ago so I hadn't played it in a while.

Got a new PC and I got it on there to have a play around with a few mods recently. I'm only at Horseshoe Overlook and I've already found a detail I've never seen before in 100's of hours of playing.

There's junk tucked away in a bush to the south of the camp where they moved all the crap out before the gang moved in. In amongst them is a discarded note from Dutch practicing a speech he gives. So he must have been hiding away here from the rest of the camp while he did so.

Gives you early insight into how his mind works and that half his quotes are lifted from that Evelyn Miller book he reads and won't stop going on about."
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"RDR 2 came out in 2018 and I‚Äôve yet to play a game that‚Äôs had a better, more detailed, and just fun to play in open world. Many times during that game I‚Äôd just be riding my horse at night, moon beaming down on me, listening to the animals. It‚Äôs incredible."
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"Looking forward to the garbage article tomorrow ""gamer finds unbelievably small detail in game that's been out for years!!!!!"""
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"I wonder if that was intentional or a bug lol.  It could be that the state isn't set the same as drinking multiple alcoholic drinks, so when you consume 1 it overwrites the level of drunkenness.

Either way that's a fun detail."
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,Years later and this game never fails to stun me...the game devs were lightyears ahead of the rest.
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"I have a mod installed called, ""So You Lost Your Hat"" which makes it so your hat doesn't despawn after getting knocked off unless you re-equip it from your horse, and it adds an icon on the map so you can find it again. 

After Arthur wakes up outside Valentine, I saw that his hat was still in Valentine, in the pig pens--he must have gotten it knocked off while goofing off in the pens during the night. Thought that was really funny. Made for a great walk of shame to go retrieve it."
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"This isn't a yt reaction video, this is a fun detail but not exactly ""UNBELIEVABLE""."
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,One of the many reasons Rockstar is the GOAT developer. RDR 2 has set the open world bar so damn high that only GTA VI has a chance to even come close.
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,That's a wild little detail! Rockstar really nails those small touches.
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"Truth is the best cure for withdrawal symptoms is to administer the substance you suffering withdrawals from ‚ôªÔ∏è

Edited to add: you‚Äôd be incredibly shocked at just how well some alcoholics can actually function when majority would be in hospital if not unconscious or dead from the same amounts"
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,Rockstar‚Äôs attention to detail is insane. The real question is: What‚Äôs the tiniest detail you‚Äôve noticed in RDR2 that blew your mind? :)
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"Now try it with different things. Food. Smokes. Health/stamina/dead eye potions. 

If it happens for all then I think it's simply interrupting the code for continuing the effects from the mission. Like ""okay player is playing, back to normal"" IDK."
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,Mist be that Guarma Rum
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"I find that eating greasy food, drinking a Pepsi or a Coke (no diet shit), taking a Tylenol, taking a nap, THEN hair of the dog is the way to go. 

Waking up hungover and ready to puke and immediately drinking booze again? No thanks."
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,Cool detail. Clickbait YouTube video head ass title though

1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"Just want to add my own fave drinking tips:

1. Before you go to bed drink a full glass of water.

2. In the morning have a bag of salt and vinegar chips first thing.

This always made things easier for me..."

1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"Hair the dog works. The key is to ramp down. To get wrecked the night before and wake up with a hangover, use hair of the dog. But make sure that hair of the dog day is also free. That way you can progressively ramp down throughout the day as to not deal with a hangover as much.¬†


Also don't drink in excess. And drink plenty of water."
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,Probably not very surprising but the smoke plumes from smoke stacks change with the wind direction. You can check your scent trail and the smoke direction and it lines up. Thought that was a cool detail
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,Little hair of the dog never hurt anybody!
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,I told my husband to try this exact thing when he played RDR2 some years back and the same thing happened for him lol. Love it!
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-05,"I would bet the mission just gives you an effect, and drinking a bottle after basically resets the effect or (stacks??)."

1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,The fact they had someone work on such small stuff like that is simply incredible. Like your horse's balls shrinking when it's snowing out because he's too cold.

1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,Is a small part of a hangover not alcohol withdrawal? Makes sense that a little more would ease some of the pain if so.

1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,I think this game is amazing but I always run out of steam around the 2nd act and have never completed it. Is there a way to mod it so it has fast travel from menu?

Drinking alcohol against hangover does nothing but make you drunk again


So being drunk you dont notice the hangover but its obv still there"
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,that feels more like a glitch or bug than intentional
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,RDR2 is as close we can get to real life inside a game!
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"This game has great detail, and is totally overrated in terms of gaming enjoyment. I'll play RDR one again before I ever think about loading up the gorgeous looking sequel."
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"That game is an unbelievable pile of crap. üí©

Here‚Äôs why:

ALL THE REASONS WHY RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2 IS A FUCKING WASTE OF TIME

Movement & Controls
* Moving your character feels like pushing a refrigerator through a swamp - Arthur Morgan has the turning radius of a cruise ship and the responsiveness of a dead sloth
* Basic actions like turning around or stepping over a rock become epic battles with the controls that make you want to THROW YOUR CONTROLLER OUT THE WINDOW
* The control scheme was clearly designed by someone who‚Äôs never held a controller before - who the FUCK uses X to accelerate AND maintain speed, but then switches to R1 + Square for stopping?
* Even simple tasks like picking up items require you to stand in EXACTLY the right spot or Arthur just stares at them like he‚Äôs never seen a can of beans before

Graphics & Visibility
* HDR implementation makes everything look like it was filmed through a dirty window
* Daytime scenes have all the visual excitement of lukewarm oatmeal
* Nighttime is literally unplayable unless you enjoy stumbling around in pitch darkness
* Everything has this weird vaseline-smeared look that‚Äôs supposed to be ‚Äúatmospheric‚Äù but just makes it look like you need glasses
* The color palette consists of brown, slightly different brown, and mud

Gameplay Mechanics
* Every single animation has to play out IN FULL, because heaven forbid you might want to actually PLAY THE GAME instead of watching Arthur skin a rabbit for the 500th time
* Looting takes forever because apparently Arthur needs to carefully examine every drawer like he‚Äôs conducting a crime scene investigation
* The bounty system is broken - sneeze in the wrong direction and suddenly the entire state‚Äôs law enforcement is after you
* Horse riding mechanics are needlessly complicated and will give you repetitive strain injury from all the button mashing
* Hunting missions are exercises in tedium that make watching paint dry seem exciting

UI & Menu Design
* The menu system is a labyrinth of poor design choices
* Item selection wheel is more frustrating than helpful
* Having to maintain weapons and clean them constantly is just busy work
* The camp donation system is pointless busy work that adds nothing to the gameplay

Pacing Issues
* The opening chapter moves slower than continental drift
* Story missions are padded out with unnecessary travel time
* Simple tasks take FOREVER because everything has to be ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù
* Fast travel system is deliberately inconvenient because ‚Äúimmersion‚Äù
* Even the frikkin CUTSCENES drag on forever with no option to skip

Miscellaneous Annoyances
* Your horse randomly crashes into trees like it‚Äôs magnetically attracted to them
* The wanted system triggers if you look at an NPC the wrong way
* Having to manually pick up every single item individually is pure torture
* The game forces you to walk slower than a snail in certain areas because ‚Äúatmosphere‚Äù
* Auto-save system is unreliable and will always fail you when you need it most

Core Game Design Problems
* The entire game prioritizes ‚Äúrealism‚Äù over actually being fun to play
* Every system seems designed to waste as much of your time as possible
* The game can‚Äôt decide if it wants to be a simulation or an action game and fails at both
* Basic quality-of-life features are missing because ‚Äúthat wouldn‚Äôt be realistic‚Äù
* The whole experience feels like it was designed by people who hate the concept of fun

Online Component
* Don‚Äôt even get me started on the online mode
* Microtransactions everywhere because of course there are
* Grinding is even worse than the single player
* Connection issues make everything even more frustrating than it already was
* Basically everything wrong with the single player but now with lag"
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"God, I‚Äôll never not love Arthur. The choo choo is just perfection"
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"Besides budget constraints, what prevents other studios emulating the success of RDR2?"
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"I know that Grand Theft Auto can be annoying with its monetization, but it's almost a guarantee that GTA Vl will have an insane amount of small details. Pretty sure that's why the development time has been so long."

Granted, having the wrong creative/game director can also easily be the ruin of a game. But in terms of Rockstar, they really just had proven systems that fans liked, and the cashcow that is GTA:Online that allowed them to have 1500+ developers working on it over the course of 8+ years.

There really are hardly any studios that have both those resources and time for game releases, and it matters a ton."
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"Decades of perfecting a really good game engine and having the right people working on the game.


Rockstar is also (or was?) owned by the guys directing the game, similar to a company like From software. It's not a board of directors at Ubisoft telling other people what to do and following s formula."
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"An autistic attention to detail, essentially.

The horse balls shrink when the air around them gets cold. Like, other studios would look at something like that, if a developer said 'I want artists, modellers, and coders to spend today modelling horse testicles that shrink based on how cold the area they are in' they'd get told to gtfo. It would seem frivolous, or like, the dev's kink coming to the surface or whatever.

Counting the bullets he's loading into the magazine? That's a LOT of extra coding for something 99% of people will never even notice. When you've got tech crunch and games releasing half finished already, spending coding hours, animating hours, and art hours on that kind of thing just isn't in the budget, time wise or money wise. 

Look at the gameplay for the new ass creed game. You can see swords clipping through hats. You think they're gonna spend time to animate, code, etc, the balls of the horse shrinking when you go up a mountain when they got shit like THAT going on? 

You basically need a leadership and coder/artist base that are mentally ill to spend day in and day out coding and modelling the tiniest of things like that. Either the leadership has to be that obsessive, or the coders themselves have to be that obsessive. Preferably both!

Either the leadership tells the entire team 'work on turning the pages of the book! Work on every single illustration having a different look if it's drawn by Arthur or by old wolffacebite!' or the artists themselves have to come to the leadership and say 'we need to do this for immersion sake' and the leadership says 'that's an acceptable use of your time. Do it'.

Most leadership these days is more interested in milking money out of customers, tbh."
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"Priorities, really. As neat as those details are, they aren't necessary for a good game. For RDR2, it was all part of this grand simulation of western life. The details add to the immersion. A lot of other games really don't need that level of detail, and wasting time on those details would inevitably take resources away from more important areas of the game."
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"Most devs don't have a team dedicated to continously crank out content to make money whilst simultaneously have a big enough team to work on the same game for close to a decade. It's either the on or the other, not both at the same time. 

This requires a ridiculous budget and a sharp vision, and also not being told by investors what to do when to do it. 

Rockstar has all this going for them combined with an incredible will to commit to their vision, so there is a reason why they have the sales numbers they do. Cus nobody really does it like them"
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"Their upper managements only wanting money and nothing more: if you tell them the effort done to RDR2, they'd consider it a waste of time instead of milking the franchise fast - with microtransaction if possible."
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,Because not everyone is willing to spend and extra 5 years of production to do loads of tiny details.

You need great team of programmers and designers and team leaders to implement new features fast and efficiently enough. Top skill specialists. And also tons of time.¬†
Top skill specialists costs a lot of money, multiply that by¬† large time requirement, you get absolutely astounding budgets."
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"Well, putting in more content or improve the clunky gameplay instead would've been fine, too. But I'm happy I have this for 50 hours and an Elder Scrolls or Fallout or whatever to spend hundreds of hours in."
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"I still don‚Äôt think it will be nearly as detailed as RDR2. There‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ a lot less stuff in RDR. GTA games need to have so many different cars, buildings, city infrastructure, guns ect. I‚Äôm sure it will be impressive, but maybe not as detail rich as RDR2 is"
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"> Pretty sure that's why the development time has been so long.

Yeah, this is a weird one as the game always knows how many bullets remain, and use that value to determine the animation to load bullets and the voice lines like you mentioned.

There's nothing remotely difficult about coding such a feature.

Even something like the horse testicles shrinking is simple as doing a size morph on an asset based on where the horse is located.

That's a feature that any skilled programmer could put in place very quickly.

They probably spent more time talking and laughing about horse testicles than it actually took to implement."

They acted like it was a bombshell reveal that no, you don't always wake up sober."

I think one of the best studio‚Äôs right now is CD PR Red, and even they dropped the ball with Cyberpunk BIG time on release.

Plus, RDR2 objectively is one of the best games of the past decade, so the standard is extremely high if that‚Äôs your bar.

In reality, your brain knows where you want to go and makes adjustments to get there. In the game, you're marionetting Arthur who cannot make speedy minute adjustments or stop on a dime.

So it's just a weird downside of making it look nice at the expense of controllability. It's sort of like strafing. A person will virtually never sidestep more than a couple steps and it'll never be fast like sprinting. You can kind of horse gallop like a kid, maybe.

I had some roommates in college (small town college, mind you), who drove home drunk about mile and a half away.

1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"Man that's a whole lot of assumptions and projections you're doing there. 

I'm a definite non-alcoholic person who drinks maybe twice a month and never to excess, I don't even particularly like drinking but I'll do it socially every once in a while. However I have lived a varied life and been in situations where I was hungover and had a beer, and it's pretty remarkable how well it works, it lightens the hangover by like 75%. 

But no you're the only one who's right, every other person who's ever experienced a weird bodily phenomenon and commented on it must be an alcoholic in denial."

1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-06,"Nah, GTA V absolutely killed the story. GTA IV is only interesting to one section of immigrant group of people whereas GTA V has chaotic, selfish and trying to be cool guys all playable and with a very competent storyline where they all combine well. It had just enough immaturity in it that attracted both men and little kids.

GTA 6 will probably remain close enough and it should be like that, GTA series by itself isn't meant to be a serious thing and if you go fully into serious story arc then you're undermining the game. RDR2 and other games can remain their way to tell a really good story, it is probably the best game of all time but it isn't appreciated by anywhere near the same amount of people. If GTA makes them another billions then they can make another great game like RDR2 without feeling bad about it."
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"I agree that the GTA 5 story is downright worse than GTA 4. Maybe it's nostalgia, but to me it feels like GTA 4 had a lot more care put into actually telling an interesting story.

That said, i'm not sure if that downgrade is because of a shift to multiplayer. Maybe they abandoned DLC in favour of online stuff, but the singleplayer mode was probably finished years before online even came out.  
They obviously could have bet on the success of online, but i'm not sure.

That said, with rdr2 they could have released 30$ singleplayer DLC and it would have sold like toiletpaper in 2020, yet instead they decided to kill the online mode with the shittiest monetization options possible.

We'll see with GTA 6. I honestly have little hope and fully expect the singleplayer experience to suck, but hey, maybe they'll surprise us and actually learned a few lessons from RDR2."

Your body breaks the alcohol down into sugars, and the hangover is basically withdrawal symptoms, so giving it what it's looking for temporarily relieves the effects.

1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"One of the theories on wikipedia:

>In the second, hangovers are partly attributed to methanol metabolism.[17][18] Levels of methanol, present as a congener in alcohol, have been correlated with severity of hangover[19][20] and methanol metabolism to the highly toxic formate via formaldehyde[21] coincides with the rate of appearance of hangover symptoms.[22] As both ethanol and methanol are metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase ‚Äì and this enzyme has a greater binding affinity for ethanol than for methanol[23] ‚Äì drinking more of the former effectively prevents (or delays) the metabolism of the latter.

If I understand the theory correctly, you feel less shitty because the ethanol in the drink gets in the way of your body metabolizing the methanol that makes you feel shitty. You delay the process of metabolizing the methanol and spread it out over time, rather than all at once which gives you the hungover feeling. It does this because of our metabolizing enzyme more readily binding to ethanol than methanol."

You get a hangover from drinking too much and not prepping ahead. If you drink lots of water, have quite a bit of food before/during drinking and know when to stop, the hangover will be severely dampened, if not entirely negated.

The only way your argument makes sense, if that follow-up shot on a terrible hangover day is a **regular** occurrence, meaning you'd have to **regularly** be hungover in the first place. At that point alcoholic tendencies are already there, the tiny bit of alcohol on top isn't the tipping point here.

You're not ""risking alcohol addiction""; the only scenario in which that would make any sense is when you're already addicted to alcohol.

You're just borderline fearmongering."
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"I never felt it was button mashy. My biggest gripe with the controls is that I'd frequently interact with NPC's when I didn't mean to, sometimes causing a needless brawl and bounty after having to ""defend"" myself."
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,Do you really think getting in the habit of drinking more alcohol when you feel bad (because of drinking too much in the first place) doesn‚Äôt raise the chances of alcohol becoming a problem for you?
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"I don‚Äôt care about your opinion, I‚Äôm just saying it for the people who‚Äôre smart enough to understand doubling down on alcohol after a binge isn‚Äôt a good idea. Rest assured, you don‚Äôt count among them."
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,I'd say drinking too much in the first place is the root cause.
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-07,Seems like you‚Äôre really concerned about the people drinking? I think you should be more concerned with your own behavior here now.
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"I agree it‚Äôs the root cause, but when the binge has happened anyway, don‚Äôt you think drinking again compounds the risk?"
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,Not really no.
1ih98v3,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"Maybe you‚Äôre on your way to alcoholism then.

Just kidding, let‚Äôs agree to disagree!"

Are you the giant behind the rock wall?"

1ilev2d,2025-02-09,2025-02-09,"I got The Dark Tower Vibes immediately,  but I also never played Red Dead, and I am a huge fan of The Dark Tower series. Looks awesome!"
1ilev2d,2025-02-09,2025-02-09,It reminds me of Roland from The Dark Tower.

1ilev2d,2025-02-09,2025-02-09,Dude that looks pretty awesome! I like it! But I have a question. Did you paint that in Harry Potter's bed room? That ceiling is so low.
1ilev2d,2025-02-09,2025-02-09,"I mean that's awesome, but nothing in it specifically says ""this is RD2"", to me.

A cowboy on a horse does not = RD2.

You could pull a any painting of a western theme from any point or any artist and say the same thing. 

Still, great work though"
1ilev2d,2025-02-09,2025-02-09,"Mark Maggiori is getting close to $100k per painting for a similar scene and color palette, albeit with much higher detail. Keep perfecting your craft and there would seem to be a decent market for it if earning a living is your goal."

1ilev2d,2025-02-09,2025-02-09,"Love that the horizon is not in the middle. Placing it lower creates such a powerful sense of scale to the scenery and how, even when desolate, the wild countryside can swallow a man"

The USA has brilliant and amazing places to visit for inspiration. Some of the most amazing sites I‚Äôve witnessed have been Mt Saint Helens, Bryce, Zion, Mt Denali, Mt Rainer, Glacier Park, Yellowstone, The Enchantments, Gettysburg, etc.

And you‚Äôre getting inspiration from a video game?!?!?

Sorry, but get outside. See the world. There‚Äôs a big one out there that‚Äôs much better than one in front of a monitor."

While they will never top nature, I've often been struck by how often games like RDR2 generate beautiful and evocative scenes."

1ilev2d,2025-02-09,2025-02-09,"Yo this is seriously impressive work! As someone who's sunk way too many hours into RDR2 (probably should've spent more time being productive tbh), you really captured that specific feeling you get when you're just taking in those epic views in-game. You know those moments when ur just sitting on your horse on some cliff edge, watching the sunset, and everything just hits different?The way you handled those color transitions in the sky is actually insane - that orange-to-purple gradient gives me strong memories of those long rides through New Hanover. And positioning that silhouette on the outcrop? That's just \*chef's kiss\* perfect composition right there. It's giving me major Arthur Morgan vibes...Quick question - how long did this take you to complete? The attention to detail, especially in those canyon walls and the way the light plays off them, looks like it must've been pretty time intensive. Also, if you're selling prints, drop a link because this would look absolutely fire in my apartment. Been looking for some statement pieces that aren't the typical mass-produced stuff you see everywhere in NYC.The whole thing just radiates that perfect mix of gaming culture and legitimate artistic talent. Like this isn't just fan art, it's a legit piece that stands on its own merits while still paying perfect homage to the source material. Mad respect."
1ilev2d,2025-02-09,2025-02-09,"Im feeling RDR from this but not RDR 2. Very talented though, my man"
1ilev2d,2025-02-09,2025-02-09,"Its nice but i agree with the others,it could be from any western media ever produced.
There is no RDR flair to seperate it from others.
I mean no ofdense to your art.
Peace."

1ilev2d,2025-02-09,2025-02-09,"So many le redditors in here thinking ""I painted an rdr2 inspired piece"" means ""I painted a frame from the game.""

What is it about this site that brings this unnecessary bitchiness out in people? lol"
1ilev2d,2025-02-09,2025-02-09,"He said it was inspired by rdr2, so it's inspired by rdr2"

1ilev2d,2025-02-09,2025-02-10,Yup!
1ilev2d,2025-02-09,2025-02-10,This one took about 25 hours :)
1ilev2d,2025-02-09,2025-02-10,Thank you üòä I put a lot of thought into that actually so thanks for noticing!
1ilev2d,2025-02-09,2025-02-10,Thank you! Haha I actually spent a lot of my early painting years mostly just painting Skyrim fan art so yeah that makes sense why my rocks look like that nowadays too üòÇ

1ilev2d,2025-02-09,2025-02-09,"Rockstar games have become horrible in that aspect, but do NOT let it sour your experience. The real game is past chapter 3 or so when most of the world opens up to you. The exploration and views are fucking breathtaking and the interactions you can have with people are wonderfully written. You will have to deal with that ‚Äúdo this mini-game-thing for this mission and then never see the gameplay aspect again‚Äù stuff that they love to fill their games with, but beyond that it‚Äôs truly a masterpiece."
1ilev2d,2025-02-09,2025-02-09,A house with higher ceilings is my main goal right now actually üòÇ
1ilev2d,2025-02-09,2025-02-09,"Downvote all you want but rdr2 didn‚Äôt take place in this terrain, lol"

1ilev2d,2025-02-09,2025-02-09,I have a weird hoodie üòÇ it has an inner zipper that keeps the whole thing tight and then an outer zipper on the front that zips up the whole thing.

1ilev2d,2025-02-09,2025-02-09,"Kinda off topic, but is that a drop ceiling with the nicer tiles? I've been thinking of upgrading our drop ceiling tiles and those look amazing.
Edit: Amazing painting by the way."
1ilev2d,2025-02-09,2025-02-09,Nice work. Is the scene an actual location in the game?
1ilev2d,2025-02-09,2025-02-09,Maybe he's just 9 ft fall
1ilev2d,2025-02-09,2025-02-09,you did this?

1ilev2d,2025-02-09,2025-02-09,Yeah that's what I mean. RDR is specific while the painting looks just like any vague Western.
1ilev2d,2025-02-09,2025-02-09,Yeah it was super easy to install :)
1ilev2d,2025-02-09,2025-02-10,We ripped out the drop ceiling and just painted everything black. Looks clean and you get that extra foot or so of ceiling back.
1ilev2d,2025-02-09,2025-02-09,"No it‚Äôs a scene I made up, but I was just going for general rdr2 vibes :)"
1ilev2d,2025-02-09,2025-02-09,I still post everywhere üòÇ anything to get eyes on my art. I do conventions full time nowadays!
1ilev2d,2025-02-09,2025-02-09,OP clearly said RDR inspired.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"It should a crime we never got any single player DLC or any worthwhile content for RDO. 

No undead nightmare 2, no Mexico RDO expansion. I played RDO for a good few months and remember how disappointed I was with one of the Halloween updates was literally just ""defend the town from the spooky mist monsters""

Shame on Rockstar"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Why is it peaking currently? Was there a major update? I played online for a while after beating the story but it just could not keep me engaged. Love the game and would return if significant content dropped.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"lol I started playing again this past week, but not because it was on sale. 

Just beat the first one on the Switch and decided to start the second over again. PC graphics after coming from the Switch is always such a euphoric high."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I want an RDR 1 remake for PC & modern consoles.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I know melee combat has never been Rockstar's strength but I've always hoped for a game akin to a RDR2 but in a medieval setting with knights and castles. Their worlds and level to detail and immersion has been on another level.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I have a bias but it is (imo) the greatest game ever

E: I call it my number zero game‚Ä¶ still waiting for a game to surpass it in my eyes. 2077 is the closest I‚Äôve come tbh"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I‚Äôll probably always be a fan of Rockstar Games, but I will never forgive them for abandoning RDR 2 and completely ignoring a possible Undead Nightmare 2."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Black Friday sale maybe
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I literally started another play through after getting bored with Starfield. RDR2 still has me in awe of how beautiful and alive the scenery is, all these years later."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Really taking my time with this game but it is just incredible. It has what I like to call ""unnecessary"" amounts of detail. Stuff they could have left out and the game would still be a 10/10 but they put it in anyway."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Masterpiece. I have hopes with GTA VI in part because of RDR2 was great.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,The best single player game I‚Äôve ever played. And the biggest missed opportunity to bring it home with the multiplayer. Very frustrating because the mechanics are there.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Still the best game world I have ever played. Rockstar need to bring out a ps5 patch
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Four? Wasn't it released in October 2018, making it 5 years old?"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,This is one of the best games ever
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Because it went on deep sale. Most people don't want to pay $60, much less $70 for games. Especially ports. People are getting tired of it and more and more are waiting."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Question: What is Steam Player Count for an solo story based game ? The amount of people that have it downloaded ? Or that are playing it atm ? Or that purchased it ?
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I happened to start playing again this week. It‚Äôs my comfort game and it‚Äôs always nice to hop in for a chapter every few months
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,just rename this subreddit r/steamchartsonly and be done with it
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Quite possibly the best game ever
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"What could be bringing people back??

For me, the stale, repetitive combat of Starfield made me think about red dead. Loaded it up for the first time in years and I‚Äôm having the time of my life. I had a bunch of treasure maps stacked up, so I went and found all the treasure stashes, hunting game as I was riding around and selling it to butchers. Got a pretty large amount of money that I blew in the iciest outfit I‚Äôve ever seen in the game. Maroon dungarees, a maroon snake skin vest, a yellow tailed formal jacket, steel spectacles and a huge, fuzzy yellow hat that always makes me stand out at the poker table.

And the combat. My god is it tight. I was super into GTA V Online for years which has a similar combat system but the repeaters and bolt action rifles add an entirely different layer. And guys will rush you and try to tackle you. You can throw them off and shove them to the ground and shoot them as they‚Äôre getting up. If you hit a guy in the kneecap he falls tonthe ground, gets up and tries to limp to cover. Like all the NPCs have brains. 

Also horseback combat is awesome. If you fire off shots at a guy on horseback he will lean in his saddle to put the body of the horse between you and him. If you put a few bullets in the horse sometimes it will buck the guy off and take off. And if you hit the horse in the head it drops and sends the rider tumbeling into the dirt. And when you have a strong bond with your horse, brushing it and feeding it regularly, you tet horse skills that allow you to DRIFT your horse. If I‚Äôm riding and a group of assailants ride up behind me I sweeve the horse around, and start firing. You can also have your horse trot sideways. 

And the writing and voice acting! Every little mission has an awesome cutscene. I just went to go help a sherriff in some small town help aprehend someone and he says

‚ÄúFolks round here ain‚Äôt particularly keen on‚Ä¶ civilization. But if I have to string up 9 out of 10 of them, those that remain will live in peace. Entertained‚Ä¶ by public executions.‚Äù 

That is poetry"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Still no 60fps on current gen consoles‚Ä¶ I would fucking pay 70$ for that even though I bought it on pc when I got it.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Certainly not because of online updates.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Only 4 years? I actually for the first time feel like it‚Äôs been longer than that.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,I would argue that people are replaying because of improved hardware capabilities
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Why? Online is buggier than ever, and single player performace has degraded ever since the Naturalist update."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Well never get any updates üò≠ I quit 3 years ago, went back for Thanksgiving as I was in the mood to hunt turkey and play again after a while. I ran into 3 bugs that have been there since I quit. Terrible on rockstar"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,well... I guess that partially destroys the narrative that Red Dead Online is dead.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Probably because of the current sale on Steam
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Put about 72 hours into Starfield. I‚Äôm back in Red Dead 2. Was hoping the immersion Starbore would be on par and would provide years of aimlessly wondering the Galaxy like RD2 (the world).
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I‚Äôm starting to think Bots are causing Steam number inflations. This has happened to many games recently. It‚Äôs Sus
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Great game. Horrible company. 

I feel for the devs."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,and the online still sucks
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I‚Äôve tried three times to get through this game. I objectively see its merits, but I can‚Äôt make it more than ten hours or so before falling off."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Ive had it for years, finally have PC specs to play it full Ultra. Only reason I waited"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,I finally have a PC capable of playing it so I'll be trying it soon.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,I hate the game. Cool ragdolls tho.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Crazy because the game is such a snoozefest. Must be the online.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I used to love the game until the fanboys ruined it. No game is good because ‚ÄúRDr2 better‚Äù. Anyone who says anything less than it being their #1 game hates it. And they STILL WHINE ABOUT IT LOSING GOTY 5 YEARS LATER!!!

And the ‚Äúthey abandoned this game‚Äù because they didn‚Äôt give monthly dlc. Because apparently it‚Äôs wrong for a game to not get more content squeezed out of it than just letting it be a complete product.

The fans make me despise this game now."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Tired of seeing these type of topics for every game
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I really want to play it again but every time I boot it up on ps5 I immediately get turned off by the fps.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"As the father of a toddler, I‚Äôve been happy go contribute to the player count the last month by booting the game up on my Steam deck and falling asleep while riding my horse. 

I‚Äôm at 194 hours of play time and I‚Äôm almost in Valentine!"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,They can‚Äôt milk it like GTA so why bother
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Was there a sale maybe? You are so gullible
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I found the story boring and tedious, every time I try and play this game I end up wandering around on my horse just doing random things. The attention to detail is something astonishing though I'll give it that."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Rockstar is such a shady company now. No one should be supporting rdr2 or GTAV until they fix themselves
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Five years bro
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I just re-installed it lastnight. Played it on release on Xbox - this time around playing on PC with mods maxed out.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Was it free??
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"It‚Äôs only 4 years old?!

Dang. Thought it was more."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"An absolute gem of a game on a nice PC setup. I love replaying it every now and again. üëç‚Äç

I bought the game on Rockstar Launcher when it came out."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I just picked it up on steam deck and its fucking awesome
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,That‚Äôs funny I just bought it on Steam
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Coincidentally just finished the main story and working through the epilogue. They remade the upper half of the RDR1 but the content is so bare bones. Really wish they added more in a DLC.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,67% off and I finally have a PC powerful enough to do it justice. It looks gorgeous with Nvidia DLSS.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I redownloaded it on my Series X this week, and quickly fell back in love with it. It‚Äôs making me very excited for GTA VI. If it transfers over just a couple of really cool features the game will be amazing.

Also, Rockstar I am begging you please add a 60fps toggle"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,I was one of em! Woo!
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I haven't even touched it yet, guess I will now haha"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Ya I got mine for 15 last sale like year ago hella good choice
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Love the game but man is getting through that first snow chapter a slog.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Canis Canem Edit 2
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"My first playthrough was on an Xbox One s, my second playthrough has been over several years starting on PC starting with my 2070super, now I'm finishing up the campaign with a 4090 and an ultra wide, just a 21:9 va panel. But damn this game is so gorgeous. I probably added to that player count and I play so randomly! Finally got RDR1 for switch on the way so finishing up rdr2 story a second time finally lol."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Is this game still good to play on a PS4?
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,I've owned this game for over two years and still haven't started it yet.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"This kind of articles are getting annoying

Love the game tho"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Cheaters everywhere
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"So weird. Haven't really played it since it came out, but I downloaded it couple days ago to start playing once I finish Lords of the Fallen. I wonder why the sudden influx, and why I'm part of it. Was there a recent advertisement I subconsciously saw or something?"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I‚Äôm finally working on finishing it 4 years later, got to 62% last night üòÇ"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,The lack of undead nightmare campaign was criminal. I just don‚Äôt understand.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,RedM maybe? Thinking about giving that a try if I ever eliminate my current backlog.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Yuuup I bought it with the steam autumn sale going on. Just beat it last night with the high 
honor ending and nearly cried"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"It's a really cool game, and you can tell there is so much work put into it, I don't think there is any other game with this kind of realism and detail.

I haven't finished it though, I will see if I can pick it up again at some point. Even though I liked the game, I did find it a little boring some times, specially the missions, which seemed very ""on rails"".

In my opinion, the best open world gameplay is Metal Gear Solid V. It gives the player a lot of agency, a lot of ways of doing the mission and tools to use. In comparison, Rockstar games are very linear.

But they are great games, and I bet that GTA 6 is going to be huge."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"If they would have kept updating red dead online like they do GTA I‚Äôd still be playing. My friends and I fuckin loved it but the online is so barren and devoid of good content, you literally run out of things to do.  They never gave it any love at all, so you end up rich and with every gun and all you can do is shitty repeatable missions"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,I'm on PS5 but just started my 4th playthrough. It's too good
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,I wish it had RDR1‚Äôs online mode. So many activities in the original.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"If I've never played either, would people recommend I just hop straight into 2? Or play the remaster of the first? 

Was the remaster even any good? I feel like I didn't see anything about it except everyone angry when it was announced since it wasn't a full remake."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,I have over 600 hours in it. Not ashamed. It's a beautiful game and probably one of my top 5.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,So when is red dead redemption 3 ?
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Yeah I picked it up for 30 bucks the other day for Black Friday on Steam
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Damn
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,This was their last good game
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,It's a shame the online mode got abandoned. I survived 2020 by being a cowboy with my homie in the mountains. Some backs were definitely broken
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,True GOTY winner
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,4? Why do I think it's actually 5 already?
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Absolutely loved this game on release. Probably my favorite game of all time up with the original Max Payne and GTA 4. I can‚Äôt read the full article right now but I assume it‚Äôs player count is regarding the single player portion of the game? 

I‚Äôve since moved to PC and been out of the loop - I‚Äôm aware the multiplayer service got cancelled but is it still worth playing? I‚Äôm thinking of picking it up on Steam as I never played it on PC but I‚Äôm just curious what the state of online play is currently like for those who wish to explore the map and do side missions."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Such a solid game. Top 10 story, probably the best I've seen for a AAA game. Every bit of the game feels incredible - other than Act 1/tutorial which is a slog when you replay.

The online sucked, but I don't care about/see the point of multiplayer in a game like this anyway."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I wish they gave a shit about their servers being hacked. To be fair sometimes it's a funny hack, but most are game-ruining."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Replaying it currently - going with a criminal Arthur this time instead of the hero. 

Thinking about trying out some Red Dead RP as well soon as I've been watching Middleditch play and it's been amazing."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Is it really a good game? Never played it
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,A fucking crime they did not continue with online or any DLC. A CRIME. Arrest that man!
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Has it been enhanced for PS5/Xbox Series?
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"And yet it has the worst online and no dlc for the singleplayer, absolutely insane"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Honestly I should put it in my new X series. I haven‚Äôt played it since I got the new console and I bet it looks even more amazing than it already did. Super fun game too.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Oh damn
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Sorry starfield
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Because this game is the benchmark of graphics imo. I've been trying to find a nicer looking game and nothing. Alan wake 2 was a disappointment. Still good, but not red dead level. The ONLY game I think competes is plague requiem then cyberpunk in 3rd with maxed settings and Ray tracing."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,that's show how great this game was
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"RP Servers are likely a big factor. Some of the special features added are insane. I played on one and you could pick a profession, build a camp, buy a house, furnish it, etc. I'm not a big fan of the RP aspect, I just like to do my thing and I hate forced PVP with people cause like, I'm not there to fulfil people's bandit fantasies and waste my time tied up for them. If PVE enemies do it fine, but I'm not someone's dog toy. Outside of that though I'll answer if someone engages in RP. But like 50% only RP'd to follow rules, most of the time it'd be OOC anyways just talking about the game or mechanics. But yeah, RP servers on GTA and RDO are pretty nuts."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,And we‚Äôll never get another major update.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Reddit i need youre help

I shared my dlc with my other  account on ps4 but it doesnt show the option to install addons do i have it or i did something wrong?"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Who cares?
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I tried this with a VR mod, and wow! I loved it before VR, but the immersion along with a machine that's capable of high-end graphics is amazing."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,I still smoke up and play RDO. Lots of fun
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,I just got it on steam yesterday after finishing it in Xbox. Such a good game!
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-28,"I just bought the game 2 days ago since I got a new PC that can run just about anything.  I saw tons of people saying the game was a must play and is beautiful.  I THINK I tried it previously but felt it was too slow but all I remember is a train.  I don't remember the snow and stuff that I started out in this time.

I was getting a lot of crashes but switching to DX12 seems to have resolved issue."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,They can‚Äôt milk it like GTA so why bother
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"They had some many options for a DLC release. Charles in Canada, Mexico, Sadie after things fell apart. It‚Äôs a damn shame we never got anything after an amazing story"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"My bar is pretty low. Just update it for modern consoles. Please please please, 60fps patch"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,And they've done eff-all to address hacking / griefing / etc on the RDR2 multiplayer. Just like GTA V multiplayer on PC.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Not every game needs extras

Rockstar delivered an amazing, full experience with RDR2"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"First, I think the champion of RDO left with Dan Houser.  The goal seemed to be a narrative driven experience and it got left unfinished when he left R*.

Second, I don‚Äôt think people give enough credit for what is online.  The progression is slower, sure, but once you start the roles, specifically bounty hunting, there‚Äôs a lot of content there.  

I get it, it‚Äôs a shame it never got as fleshed out as GTAO.  It needed the time and money sinks that GTAO offers, and they‚Äôre just not there."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Or a next gen update
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I mean I don‚Äôt blame them, they can make a billion dollars a year off barely changing a decade old game. Obviously would be cooler if they did, but as a business why would they"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Shame on Rockstar for making a game worthy of the ages lol
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"""Shame on Rockstar"" for delivering a long, high quality, complete story? The entitlement of some gamers."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Maybe because the base game is filled to the brim with content as it is. Not every game needs DLC
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Not really. It would have been nice but it‚Äôs so dramatic to call it ‚Äúa shame‚Äù. They created one of the best video games of all time. That‚Äôs enough for me to not go crying that they didn‚Äôt do more.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I totally disagree. That game is huge and lengthy, and the epilogue is essentially a DLC that came free at launch. Some of you gamers need to pick your battles."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Shame on rockstar lmfao like they owe you anything
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"What a weird take. It's fine to like it so much you wish there was more content, but to say ""Shame on Rockstar""? Why are they obligated to add DLC? The game is absolutely overflowing with content, why can that not be good enough for a game these days?"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,">It should a crime we never got any single player DLC or any worthwhile content for RDO or GTAV SP\*

I was looking forward to more Liberty city stories style of stuff.. but nope shark cards for all."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Came here to say exactly this. Imagine all that could have been.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26, Of everything needs constant DLC and updates. Gamers like you are why live service games are he norm now.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Yup it was the same sorry for GTA5 aside from all the online stuff they added.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Agreed 100%. When we received the DLC for Witcher 3, both of which were awesome, I thought that would have been a great template for RDR2.

Anyway, back to my fourth 'read' of Chapter 4."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"The whole thing was a disappointment for me

But I suppose my expectations were too high"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Became all about that GOLD
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"No current gen rerelease or patch
No 60 fps option"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"A friend of mine convinced me to play RDO with him a couple years after release saying it was actually fun now, and I lasted about 3 hours doing bounties before I told him to never ask me to play that again. Easily one of the most boring gaming experiences I ever had. Single player was phenomenal though."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Expect exactly the same with GTA VI.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Agreed, so sad there was no undead nightmare 2, the first is in my top 3 of dlc easy"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,And they just released the same exact recycled halloween event for the 3rd year in a row
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I still think RDO is worth it for a few hundred hours for those who want to further immerse themselves in the world of RDR2. Still, I agree that Rockstar massively dropped the ball. It could have been so much more."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"It's such a shame. There is so much groundwork done (Artwork, Map, ""Engine') which just begs to be used for more content. Can't imagine that cost perfomance of developing such an addon is soo bad."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,they had a whole copy of the first game hidden down the bottom of the map and made no use of it whatsoever
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Now RDO is just infested by bullshit modders
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Rockstar themselves said their focus are on their cashcows GTA 6 and GTA Online. No reason for them to risk anything anymore.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,RDO is great. I love just chilling doing stuff. Always try to help people out. So disappointed they never really put any effort into it.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I remember the map opening up AGAIN at the very end of the game, revealing the map from RDR1 (I think), the whole map! And yet, absolutely nothing to do within it. Nothing.

Such a waste."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Maybe they working in UN2, Mexico RDO, and Tahiti RDO"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"That Halloween scene was truly disappointing. There are so many pathways that Rockstar can go down on, but yes, just like one of the other comments noted, no milking potential, no party."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Hence why as a singleplayer gamer I'm not hyped for GTA 6. They abondoned both, GTA 5 and RDR when it comes to updating SP content, but spent years doing that for online. At this point, I'll be happy if GTA 6 comes with a sp at all"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Dude it makes no sense! I loved the DLC in red dead 1. So shocked they never dropped any DLCS. Instead they put so much effort into online which had its moments.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,I get a fatal error trying to launch rdr 2 and I hate it cause I can't even get it to load up
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Agreed. Just horrible how they did not make RDO bigger and badder in every way. Such wasted potential.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I personally don't think it should've got a dlc but simply added more for John Marston to do, as for RDO I agree."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I'm still mad there was no mexico. It was mapped and everything, we just couldn't have it."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I completely understand why we didn‚Äôt get any story DLC though. RDR2 was a complete story and adding anything more would have taken away from the experience. 

RDO just didn‚Äôt catch like GTAO did and it‚Äôs understandable why. I think even R* was surprised by how successful GTAO still continued to be so they shifted all thier efforts to that instead. 

The only thing I want from RDR2 is a next gen patch. That game is timeless and this shows more players want to replay this game before GTA VI releases."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Bruh you ever played GTA V
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Yeah shame on Rockstar for making a massive amazing single player game because they didn't add more after the fact. /s

The entitlement from people like you is insane."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-28,I mean they made probably the greatest single player game ever. I‚Äôm not gonna fault them for not adding more. I defined got my moneys worth and sum. Let‚Äôs not be dramatic
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-28,Not having an Undead Nightmare 2 equivalent of expansion pack is indeed a crime.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-28,"Double edged sword, people want a complete experience without having to pay for additional content, but flipside if game is great people want more haha. I hope baldurs Gate 3 does DLCs but would not be surprised or angry if they go the red dead route.

I think gta 5 had no expansion either?"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"The article says it's mainly because of a sale on the game. Makes it about $15 lol, which is so so worth it for this masterpiece."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,We crave the plains of New Hanover.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I have no idea why but I recently reinstalled it on my PS5 like last week and have been putting some hours in lately. Its not Steam related like the article but it is coincidental as fuck.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Holiday sales aside, I was itching to play it again just because GTA6 is firing my chimp brain neurons right now for all Rockstar games."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Steam sale
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Another reason might be that ALL current gen cards can run this game at 1080p high, back in 2018 you needed a high end card. Maybe most people said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll buy it when I can run it‚Äù"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Huge discount on Steam sale. If anyone hasn‚Äôt tried it and is even remotely interested now is a great time to buy and try.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs on sale
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,On sale on steam so a lot of people either picking it up or replaying it like me on Steamdeck after having played it on PS4
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I would guess that it's a couple of factors. 

Firstly the steam fall sale. 

Second would be the fact that in the US it's been a holiday week(end), so people have had the extra time to sit around and play games."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,There was a sale. I'm finally getting to play it because of that.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,I'm assuming it was because of the autumn sale on Steam.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"its finally on sale, ive been waiting for ages to get it on sale and apparently so have a lot of other people lol"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"In addition to the sale I believe the game was temporarily exclusive to epic when it came out. So the ""peak"" player count is the peak steam count which is likely lower than the overall peak if you were to include epic numbers"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"It's on sale currently but the Red dead roleplay community (rdr nopixel, wildrp etc) are constantly growing in popularity aswell"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,">  PC graphics after coming from the Switch is always such a euphoric high.

like fast forwarding 10 years into the future lol"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,RDR1 remake in RDR2 graphics and gameplay. I would sell my soul.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Remade with the horse and gun system from RDR2 and retconned to have Arthur‚Äôs story mentioned in it. Would absolutely love it.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I want a red dead revolver remake
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Same brother same.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"IIRC, Rockstar is working on a new medieval IP."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Honestly, the mud and dirt details alone is enough for me to want a medieval game from rockstar. 

Rdr2 felt like my character and even horse belonged in that world. And a large part of it was the mud physics and the slow build up of grim and dirt."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Kingdom Come Deliverance is a solid medieval RPG I‚Äôve played through twice, but it‚Äôs not for everyone. Your character (Henry) is just some random dude at the start of the game, so he doesn‚Äôt know how to do jack dick. You have to put some effort into learning how to do everything from shooting arrows to riding. Because it‚Äôs the 1400s no one knows how to read, and that includes you. I really enjoyed it, y‚Äôought to check it out if you‚Äôre into the time period"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Without spoilers, what makes it so good?  Is it purely a story thing? I‚Äôm assuming the action/combat is classic rockstar style. 

This is one of those games I bought once upon a time and never got around to playing. Just recently got a 3080 and 4K monitor so I‚Äôm thinking about firing it up."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,100% correct
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Mine too üí™
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Agreed. Greatest game ever created and it‚Äôs not even close in my opinion. It‚Äôs just such a beautiful game. It‚Äôs just beautiful to play. Can‚Äôt say enough good things about it
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"> 2077 is the closest I‚Äôve come tbh

That's crazy lmao. Cyberpunk does not come anywhere close to RDR2."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,You've lost me at 2077
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Personally I've never had a single greatest ever game, just a top \~5.

But RDR2 is definitely one of the best stories in a game ever. It's up there with the stories of Fable 1, and Cyberpunk 2077."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,[removed]
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Kingdome Come: Deliverance is almost as good, especially once you consider it was made by an indie studio. The overall open world and interactivity of RDR2 is better, but I think KCD does a better job of making your character feel like a part of that world."

The gameplay in Zelda makes it my favorite game (just before RDR2)"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"My only complaint is RDR2 kinda cribs a bit too much from the first game.

A lot of the emotional beats the game had, I saw coming a mile away. Because the first game did it.

IDK, I guess you could argue people would've been mad if they didn't include it.

I'm talking about stuff like those emotional scenes where it plays music with a singer. RDR1 did that. RDR2 did it too...and it wasn't as special the second time around, to me."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Hopefully GTA 6 turns out to be like rdr2 and not gta 5.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Yes i am playing RDR2 for the first time right now and it reminded me again why i still love Rockstar Games. I can't wait for the GTA VI Trailer.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Online version was badly designed
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,It came to pc in 2020 IIRC
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Any game it's for the number of people actively playing
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Same haha, i played chapter 1 and never went back to the game a few months ago but just hot a new monitor and GPU and cant put the game down haha."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,People looks like shareholders. I don't understand being so proud about player counts.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,">Also horseback combat is awesome

Are you high?

Because of their insane decision to make your horse turn in whatever direction you are looking mounted combat is literally impossible without the ""freeze time to turn around before your horse notices and rides off a cliff"" spell.

It's hard to say which part of RDR2 is the worst part but that's go to be very high on the list.

> I was riding around and selling it too butchers 

Strange; I would have thought that an enjoyer of tedious pointless busy work would love Bethesda games.

> Got a pretty large amount of money

Yes, I too prefer my games to be as unimmersive as possible because I totally get this super rich dude constantly whining about how poor he is."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-30,Same
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,I had to stop my original playthrough because the world kept stuttering when i would be riding around. Finally continued where i left off over thanksgiving because i bought my series x eariler this year.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,It went on sale and the single player campaign is still one of the best ever made
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Online has been abandoned
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Online is pretty rough on PC unless you‚Äôre in a private server. Lots of hackers and people who gang up to grief solo players.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Online is definitely still dead
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Read dead online is super dead lmao. People are playing it for the single player
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I am the same. It looks fantastic! I love all the interactions with NPCs and watching them go about their lives is better in this game than any other. The gameplay is just not that good.

I also didn't play the first which I am told is not necessary but I never got into the group's characters so I feel like it would have helped."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,You‚Äôre kinda the other side of the same coin with this mentality my guy. Just like what you like. If you hate something now because it‚Äôs popular you‚Äôre just as cringey as the fanboys. You really need to disconnect your belief system from comments on the internet. Do some soul searching. Much love my guy take care of yourself
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Yes, and not just that‚Ä¶ do people forget most players are doing RP servers? While sure you can say that‚Äôs a plus of the game, I kinda find it a little weird to say ‚Äúit‚Äôs playing the game‚Äù when it‚Äôs something entirely different and coded with different mechanics."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"it takes a while to get going, but I'd honestly try and stick with it. It's an incredibly moving and well written story, it just needs time to breathe."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Felt the same way, stuck with it, and now I consider it possibly the best story game of all time. Like you said the detail is crazy - and it‚Äôs already 5 years old."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Just like Lord said, try to get through some of the boring patches. You won't regret it."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Same. I got like 5 hours in and was bored to death.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Everybody talks like it's so realistic and there's so much attention to detail, but how is it that I can be out in the woods and kill 3 or 4 guys then become Wanted even if there were no living witnesses?  Did one of those dudes call the police with their cell phone or some shit?  Don't even get me started on the infinite spawns until you pay off your bounty.  

That shit was so immersion-breaking and ""gamey"" to me that I couldn't bring myself to keep playing."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,4 years on PC 5 years on console if i remember correctly.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,It‚Äôll take you 3 hours of grind to get to the open world btw
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Yeah I even bought it too for some reason.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"probably late 2020s at the earliest, I could see mid 2030s or it not even happening."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Probably the best single player story ever made if you're into that sort of thing
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I know. But it had so much potential, I remember playing RDR1 had so much fun with the different game modes, unlocking skins and steeds.

It doesn't give me hope for GTA 6 to be anything but a 5 hour single player tutorial to get you ready for GTA Online 2: Credit Card edition."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I wonder why? You could fit as much content in RDR2 as in Gta, extra heists, different breeds of horses, safe houses etc."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"They could have though. They just didnt try. 

More jobs, wheres my stickup man/robber job? 

Duelist job? 

They could have added stupid shit too. Flaming horses, unicorns? 

An alien pistol that shoots lasers? 

It was ripe, they just didnt try"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Put a chain gun on a horse then make a wagon that turns into a boat.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Thats the thing, Rockstar extremely easily could, its just they released a horrendously and laughably buggy and broken online mode with a screwed up economy and no content and did a surprised Pikachu face when it wasn't a legal money printer like GTAO

What many people forget also is that GTA 5 online wasn't anything spectacular at launch either, the updates were largely more cars, clothing and contact missions, its not until around the Heists update it became like it is today both for content and profit"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Release RDO with no content

Do NOTHING to the game but add boring jobs no one wants to do and I almost fell asleep doing multiple times

Abandon the game ""just for GTA VI"", redo the same season pass for 2-3 years

Come back after 5-6 years, be surprised no one is playing RDO

Abandon it again for lack of players.

Its like business guys like wasting money on purpose"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I bet it was more Take Two and the guy who wants to charge gamers by the hour.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,They could easily.  Red dead RP would be so dope too
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,ding ding ding. This is the real reason it never got content.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"The thing is if they did undead nightmare RDO they could have. Weaponized carriages, zombie sieges, armoured trains for safe traversal, they just didn‚Äôt make the effort ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"The love of the game? 

*bwahahahaha!*

I‚Äôm sorry I couldn‚Äôt hold it in"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Because there should be more value to a game than just how much you can milk it, but these mother fuckers don‚Äôt give a shit."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I mean you can't milk a cow you don't touch. Maybe if they did it might bring the milk drinkers. 

(I really went with that metaphor)"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Yes they absolutely could wtf lmao
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Why can‚Äôt they? RDOnline?
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,But GTA didn't get sp dlc so that doesnt make sense to say.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Pretty much it.

RDO entered beta and then launched with too few features and a half-baked Gold Bar/RDO$ dual currency system all while R* had no real handle on the in-game economy. 

Players were acquiring more cash, through hunting and through no particular bug/exploit, than they‚Äôd ever be able to spend in mere hours. 

Then there was the obvious creative limitation in there only being so many ways to reskin horses and the cowboy aesthetic for the gold currency. 

If there is one guarantee, GTA6 will have its online economy tested, locked in and locked down before launching. If only to not repeat RDO‚Äôs spectacular fail."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"They probably can, just too much to do it in two places at once"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"But like, 99.9% games can't be milked like GTA V, and yet they are still making PROFIT. 
  
It's like, ""omg, we're only gonna make a billion profit from this game, GG go next guys"" 
  
I understand that big companies need more money, shareholder stuff, etc, but making a few at least smaller content packed dlc would almost 100% made some profit. 
  
Low reward, yes, but also a low risk. Can't believe that such a huge company can't afford some quick ""side gig"" for quick cash."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,I can't imagine how much they are going to milk the shit out of GTA VI when it comes out.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,But why couldn‚Äôt they? Doesn‚Äôt make sense to me how good it could‚Äôve been and they needn‚Äôt worry about cannibalizing their GTA market.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,That's on Rockstar though they had plenty of opportunities to make it an awesome online game. All the right basic was there but they didn't do anything at all with it except recolor story clothes and nerf the pay out of everything without giving players anything worth while to do. Gta online in 2013 was worse IMO than Rdo on release by far. But they have worked on it continuously for years before it became the monster it is now.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Get ready for GTAVI.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Not for a lack of trying though, fucking gold bars."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,They could they just don't even realize it.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Why can‚Äôt they? I‚Äôm genuinely curious. I bought the game when it came out and while I loved it, it felt endlessly filled with chores and tasks for the sake of realism. As acclaimed as it is I never found a balance between it having enough content for relatively casual play - Skyrim being the pinnacle for this in my opinion, where I could jump in and randomly quest until my time ran out."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"That‚Äôs the thing though, if they took the time to make RD2O actually enjoyable, with multiple ways to play the game, loads of activities to do with other players, it very likely could have been as profitable as GTA.  They gave up on it though."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"This. For some reason, a lot of people have trouble comprehending this fact."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Genuine question, so forgive me if dumb, but why can't they? In it's current state with content, I agree. But why couldn't they add similar levels of content like GTA online, to milk purchases?"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I would've loved a Sadie/Charles DLC where we see what they got up to, or at least get to see them react to the news of John's fate in RDR1"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,At this stage I find it absolutely baffling that they haven‚Äôt done it yet. Even if they charged ¬£10 for the update they‚Äôd make a small killing off of it.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Ahhh one of the many benefits to PC, not having to wait for 60, 120 fps patches."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Honestly, I‚Äôd buy it again if they updated with 60fps."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Which is exactly why I stopped playing RDO. It just wasn't worth the frustration anymore
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"the hacking is the worst, in GTAO i feel like you met mostly friendly hackers who just fucked around and it led to some funny moments. Mind you, there were plenty of hackers who just ruined the game, but mostly the hackers gave money or would teleport in ur vehicle and make it fly or something. The last several times I tried RDO I just got bombarded by chinese cowboys sending lighting onto anyone who dares enter a major town like Valentine. I just got bullied and these were just the worst hackers who just wanna kill you and your horse and make ur life in game miserable. At least in GTAO I felt I had a good chance of a hacker just looking to fuck around and do silly shit. And again, I've had my fair share of hackers who wanted to make my life hell, but there was always a chance they were just gonna be silly. RDRO is straight rage hackers whose only mission is to make your time a living hell."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,[deleted]
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Personally, there's someone beautiful about it being a single contained experience. I'm kind of glad they didn't cheapen it with overdoing the online and dlc. 

That's just me though, i know people would love more RDR2. I wouldnt hate it either, but I'm not mad it doesn't exist"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,It‚Äôs a great game but I would love an undead nightmare 2 :(
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Eh but why even have RDRO if you are going to make it such a boring experience.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,I don‚Äôt need DLC but a next gen console update would‚Äôve been nice since it already came to PC
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Huh? It‚Äôs not an amazing, full experience when Online is blatantly unfinished. If that was their intention they shouldn‚Äôt have added an online mode in the first place. It wasn‚Äôt some bold artistic decision to cut DLC and abandon online, you‚Äôre just praising lazy profit driven practices."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Yeah, the roles were fun. But it all just kinda lead nowhere. Like I maxed out bounty hunter and a few other roles and just kinda realized it was a checklist, I already had the outfits I wanted, the horse, I could buy some cosmetic upgrades for my cabin but if felt pointless without endgame content to keep me engaged outside of hunting griefers with my explosive bow and arrow"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"> First, I think the champion of RDO left with Dan Houser. 

People literally said the exact same thing when Leslie Benzies left after GTA V. ""rdr2 will be shit because leslie benzies made the games good!!!"".

Then we got RDR2. 

RDR2 also wasn't written just by Dan Houser. There are 2 other **head writers** that wrote it who are still at Rockstar + Sam Houser."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Nah, they suck. Every single role is repetitive and once you've done them all twice, you've experienced everything they had to offer. Not to mention rockstar's horrible system of rewarding you more for the longer a mission takes, incentivizing sitting with a bounty target outside the mission completion area until the timer is almost 0 before turning it in to maximize profit. Every aspect of RDO was a boring, pointless grind."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"The interesting thing is, I'm sure RDR2 online still makes an absolute killing. It's just not at the baffling levels of GTAO, which is probably partially due to the lack of development."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I understand too. But I also want more content for the games I enjoy. It's not like they wouldn't make money off it
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Yeah I called EA Rockstar and Ubisoft and told them to do that. Who did you find out?

I didn't say ""every game needs DLC and updates"" but if a game does well, especially as well as RDR2 did, it should get more content to breathe life into a post-launch game. Either that or give modders free reign with a functional toolkit."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I picked it up for $20 two days ago and haven't played anything else lol


When you say masterpiece, you are not exaggerating. I'm in awe of this game every few minutes. I hadn't played it yet, but with gta 6 on the horizon I wanted to know what a modern Rockstar game looks like and... holy shit."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,I‚Äôm guessing everyone is trying to ride the oil barrel into the wagon shop just to see it kaboom.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,[deleted]
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,A steal is an understatement. Probably the best game I‚Äôve ever played.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,I heard the game is super long so i never have the time to commit to it. Maybe this holiday season I can get some time
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"A lot of us who bought it on sale probably also already had it so we really didn't feel like paying full price. Now I can play it on my steam deck or on my main gaming PC at high resolution and framerates. So there's a reason for people like me to want the game, but it had to be at a reduced price since I alread paid full price for it."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"You‚Äôre saying ‚Äúso so‚Äù like average or ‚Äúso, so‚Äù good?"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,They could honestly package both games together then and make it so right after RDR2 prologue Rdr1 starts
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Please just the graphics, not the gameplay, the first rdr was great, and felt nice, the second one is just slow as hell like arthur is wearing lead shoes or something. Couldn't get passed how tedious it felt to do anything."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"No, release it as it is with qol changes."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,The original deserves a remake.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Grande Theft Equine
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Great story, tackles an era not many games do these days but handles the setting well. Missions are pretty interesting and gunplay feels good personally.

Lots of fun side activities like hunting and fishing 

One of the most immersive open worlds with lots of side missions and things to explore. It‚Äôs one of the few games I would recommend not fast travelling so you can see the world. It‚Äôs also one of the games where riding a horse is just a lot of fun.

It‚Äôs one of the only games in the last few years I have replayed THRICE

It is however not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea. Story can be slow, definitely at the beginning"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"It's a technical marvel. Looks incredible. So much to see and do. A great story with memorable characters and moments of highs and lows. Fun gameplay.

Easily the best game I've ever played."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"the story is in my opinion ui there with all the best stories told in media in general. 

on a gameplay perspective, the open world is the best i‚Äôve experienced. i‚Äôve owned the game 4 years now and clocked some 200h in and i still find new random encounters somewhere on the map. oh and it‚Äôs also beautiful."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Fantastic well-written narrative, complex and compelling characters, incredibly rich and detailed world, strong atmosphere and immersive gameplay, interesting side content with engaging smaller stories. 

It‚Äôs an almost perfect game. 

It‚Äôs two weakest points are that the commitment to immersive animations sometimes makes the controls feel sluggish and the combat is a little brain dead and not very engaging once you have it down pat, though it can be fairly cinematic at times. 

Literally everything else in the game is about as high quality as you could expect."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I kinda dislike single player games, they bore me to death. Except for Phantom Liberty,Cyberpunk seemed really bland for me, in spite of the good reviews the story has. 

But RDR2, holy shit. It makes you really feel like in a Western Movie where you get to decide the plot,so much to do, amazingly good graphics. If you want to do only main story you can do main story, if you want to roam around lasso a guy and feed him to an alligator, YOU CAN DO THAT. Best Game i ever played."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"The story is without a doubt the best in any videogame ever made. It's not just random lore like you get in other games. It's a story filled with emotion and regret. I don't want to give anything away, but that alone puts this game in a category of its own.

On top of that, it's incredibly immersive. You can hold conversations with many people in your camp. You can sit by the campfire and drink some whiskey and sing campfire songs. You can play some blackjack, or dominos, or Texas holdem, or go hunting or fishing. You can interact and have conversations with anyone in the game, but especially your camp and it feels very real. You just feel like you're there, and it's breathtaking.

It's also just a really fun game. You go on missions with your gang and there's gunfights, sneaking around and robbing stage coaches. It's a blast."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"In the same way people mention movies like Godfather or Shawshank as masterpieces of the cinema, RDR2 is a masterpiece of the videogame medium."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I'm gonna get down voted to oblivion, but I'll offer a counter point to all of these people claiming it's a masterpiece -- it's easily the most disappointing media I've ever experienced. 

The game is an exercise in patience. *Everything* about the game is tedious. Flipping through a physical catalogue to buy a new gun was neat for 20 seconds and infuriating beyond that. Skinning a deer was cool the first time and maddening after that.

The game is beautiful and incredible at building a lived-in world, but I had zero *fun* playing it at any point. 

I honestly rate the game a 4/10. I don't know how they managed to make Cowboy-Outlaw Simulator so boring."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"It‚Äôs a world/atmosphere thing üíØ 

Story goes too hard as well"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"The AI interaction is fucking phenomenal. There's a lot of random events, and a lot of side quests you can do. I love how customizable your character can be and it really is immersive. You can either be a good person or a bad person, and depending where you are on the spectrum can change the cut scenes a bit. There's more to this but its just such a good game."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I am one of those people who usually skip cut scenes in games because I don't care about story that much, but RDR2 I was fully invested, the story is really good and the characters are as well.

I am a bit of a perfectionist at heart also, and the attention to detail in that game is just *amazing*. It's all the little things, you know? 

The other things that that drew me into it was the wild west setting, the activities & side missions that were actually fun to do and didn't feel like a chore, the mechanics and the gunplay, the graphics and the art style were top notch for it's release time and still are. The world actually feels alive and lived in. NPCs aren't just standing around awkwardly like they are in a bethesda game, things just have this natural feel to them that I just haven't seen any other game replicate to the same level. 

I don't think I will ever enjoy a game more that I enjoyed RDR2. There was just *so much stuff* to do"
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I love RDR2 but the action/combat is its weakest point imo.

Its like GTA with way less toys to play with since theres no cars, bikes,  jetskis, planes, helis, tanks, etc.. and the weapon variety is smaller too. Even if there was just 1 car in GTA it would still be more fun to drive around the world than just... riding a horse... which gets old really fast when you open up the map and start to have to travel really long distances.

...And GTA is already a game that people talk about having kinda basic combat.

And then on top of that you add the fact that the game has basically a ""McCree ult"" type of system that with consumables is basically spammable and you dont even need to aim your weapons really, your just freezing time and tagging enemies..."

184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,I loved the game for mainly one reason: very very lively and immersive open world.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"The game feels extremely realistic and immersive. Like easily the most immersive game I‚Äôve played. You can hunt pretty much anything, the horse riding is cool, the way guns handle is also really really cool. You can point your gun in the air and shoot to scare people off, it‚Äôs just so cool."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,It comes pretty close in terms of compelling characters and storytelling and graphics.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,I also have a bias there but it is so immersive in the sense of roleplaying
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Yeah I was about to upvote him until I read that part. CP2077 is such a shallow game with such a generic story compared to RDR2. CP2077 is absolutely beautiful to look at, but that's the only compliment I can give it."

184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Love it. Ya the game dropped right when my first kid was born so I played damn near the whole game with my son sleeping on my chest so always brings back good memories
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,What even was the last update? Last thing I can remember is them nerfing gold daily streak bonuses.  That was right after I burnt out/was too bothered by the increased TAA blur.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"It‚Äôs not cuz it‚Äôs popular, rather their mentality around it drove me away. Popularity just means more voices saying it, but it‚Äôs the message that pushed me away.

Its things like them being happy Elden Ring won GOTY solely because GOW Ragnorok lost. Most people I saw happy it won said ‚ÄúElden Ring avenged RDR2‚Äù. 

A guy who made RDR2 content was black listed from the fandom because he said he preferred John to Arthur. People loved him, but the moment he said that BAM now he‚Äôs reviled and seen as shit to them. Over a preference.

Weekly I‚Äôll still see posts with thousands of upvotes/comments/likes over how RDr2 deserved to win GOTY. And most of it boils down to how GOW sucks. A man posted a video this year about it with thousands of views and most comments about how GOW is trash. I prefer RDR2 but calling GOW trash is wrong.

They constantly whine about how the game was ‚Äúabandoned‚Äù because they don‚Äôt give constant content updates for single player. According to them if a game isn‚Äôt games as a service, it‚Äôs abandoned and thus the company hates it. 

They called Rockstar thieves because they ‚Äúpromised‚Äù and RDR1 remake this year. If you dared to point out they didn‚Äôt, you‚Äôre a hater who just likes COD and Fortnite. 

They called a man stupid because he felt sad over the death of his grandpa. Why? Because he claimed it was the death that hit him hardest‚Ä¶.not Arthur Morgan. So yep, the fandom thinks feeling sadder over the death of someone in real life is wrong because only Arthur is the saddest death you can experience. It was thousands not just one guy.

It‚Äôs not just ‚Äúpopularity‚Äù, popularity is only the amount of voices saying it. It‚Äôs what the voices are saying that pushes me away. I loved the game but the fans see it as the second coming of Christ borderline unironically. So yeah, I don‚Äôt see it as that, and they think I‚Äôm some Fortnite kid who‚Äôs too dumb to live as a result. Maybe to you I‚Äôm weak but I‚Äôd rather not be in a fandom that insults me over an opinion that simple."

184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,RDR2 was still an amazing single player story. At its core GTA is still a story. They will never fully get away from that mainly because they would be terrified to not make the money and would be even more terrified that they would lose their goodwill. As it stands they can put out above average games and get superb payback. That‚Äôs their bar. They will always at least reach above average.

184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I'm absolutely fine with the experience and no clue why you are so adamant about it.

The same with GTA 5. I never played online and just adding dlcs is annoying anyway.

After not playing for a bit you get back into it but forgot half of it and start at the end to continue again.story was told all good."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"This right here. I have very little faith in these companies anymore. RDO could have been amazing. I thought they for sure were going to do some big train robbery stuff and just in general keep adding into the atmosphere. But they just dropped it. I guess the metrics on people buying stuff was not great, but in reality they didn't have much to buy.

Not sure what they wanted us to do."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-28,I think you‚Äôre getting a little pessimistic about it when it doesn‚Äôt really warrant it so much. They have no history of skimping on the single player main game for the sake of online yet. They could have easily done it for RDR2 and they went way beyond what they had to for it. I wouldn‚Äôt worry so much. No SP dlc is a bummer but it‚Äôs okay. There‚Äôs other games out there.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Carriages that can carry canoes/boats, prototype car and bicycle (only works on solid streets like saint denis), gliding airplane, ranching, menial jobs as seen in SP."

People just like cars/planes more than horses.

Also customizing a car‚Äôs body/paint/lights is more personal than changing a horse‚Äôs hair color and saddle.

People are more willing to bring out the credit card for a flashy sports car or military helicopter than the next horse breed or carriage."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"> I wonder why?

Because Rockstar don't work like that anymore, and historically, DLC's have never made them enough profit to want to continue making them. Everyone claims ""i would buy a gta/rdr dlc!!!"" but then only 10% of people who bought GTA IV and RDR1 actually bought EFLC and Undead Nightmare.

Businesses are tired of having to actually work for money. The new business model is to find ways to get people to give you money for essentially nothing. 

It used to be you'd make a game, get a ton of sales, make a new game, get a ton of sales.

Then it became make a game, get a ton of sales, release a DLC with reused assets, get a decent bump of sales, release another DLC, get another bump in sales, then make another new game.

Now it's release a half-finished game at full price and then drip-feed the game up to 100% for another $200 worth of sales, and then continue to sell low effort shit like skins forever."

I can vividly remember playing with a couple friends of mine once and ending up getting into a scrap with at least five Chinese hackers who chased us back to our camp and then had the nerve to call us pussies while machine-gunning explosive arrows and dynamite at us.

But then there was the harmless invisible one who spawned a handful of chests in our camp which instantaneously respawned when opened and gave us a shitload of gold and money and some collectibles. 

And then the one who built a whole floating dance floor accessible by a staircase just outside of Valentine and played very loud music through his open mic, and just sat there with his buddies, not actively bothering anyone.

It's always an experience, that's for sure."

184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,You‚Äôre wrong in so many ways. That games still worth >$15 easily. Graphics and gameplay hold up and you get an absurd amount of hours from it.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Well to be fair the game did come out on consoles a year prior. I typically buy pc if it‚Äôs a choice between both but I bought the console version.

184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"> Missions are pretty interesting

That's one of my biggest gripes with it, tbh.  
90% of missions boil down to  
1)  Follow gang member to location having brief conversation.  If you put on cinematic camera you don't even need to steer.  
2)  Start sneaking in area.  Eventually gun fight is inevitable and shoot your way through the rest of the area.  
3)  Escape with a running gun fight, either on wagon or horse back.  Once or twice boat.

That mother fucker came out of the bush, pinned me to the ground and started mauling the fuck out of me before I managed to get my knife in it's throat. It was visceral as fuck.

I did play the first one a long time ago and I remember those aspects of the game not bothering me too much. I‚Äôll have to see how I feel about them in this day and age though as I‚Äôve grown less patient."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Honestly I agree. Multiple times I‚Äôve tried to play it and everything is just so boring. If the gunplay was at least fun maybe I‚Äôd be into it, but something like Hunt Showdown does the 1800 style weapons so much better."

184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Their single-player campaigns consistently deliver exceptional quality. While I didn't care for the tonal shift between GTA IV and GTA V, I must acknowledge that GTA V offers a robust and lengthy single-player experience. It's worth noting that GTA IV had a fantastic, lengthy campaign, and Rockstar followed it up with two excellent, decent-length DLC campaigns. Red Dead Redemption also featured ""Undead Nightmare"" in addition to its main campaign. It's not that people are criticizing the quality of Rockstar's single-player experiences; rather, they've shifted away from creating additional DLC expansions as they used to. Instead, they release the single-player campaign as is. It's still excellent, but it's no longer the primary focus of their post-launch development efforts. While we've only had Red Dead Redemption 2 since GTA V, and that's not enough to definitively predict their future approach. However, it seems that if the multiplayer aspect of their games doesn't achieve the revenue levels of GTA V, Rockstar may discontinue support for that game. This is unfortunate because it means players miss out on both the extra single-player DLC experiences and the extended multiplayer support that was traded off for in GTA V, resulting in an overall less compelling product compared to the studio's previous works, despite the exceptional quality of the single-player content that remains."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,You can make a game 900 hours long with a massive open world and nothing but radiant quests. *cough cough* starfield.

184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,I think it'd be equally ridiculous to assume that GTA 6 isn't created from the ground up with multi-player in mind. There may still be a good single player experience for some people. But there's billions just sitting on the table for them in multi-player.

Like the random encounters. Many of them will just play out if you ride by. Some of them will rope you in. Some, you can interact in what is a very normal manner.

All of it is painstakingly scripted to feel like the characters have a natural reaction to your actions. And it doesn't feel gamey. Usually, the decisions you make are on the fly and with normal controls.

It's also a game I enjoy just getting on my horse, Clip-clop, and riding into the mountains to hunt."

184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,The two DLC single-player for GTA IV are so underrated. Its a shame that so much focus is put on multiplayer; what makes these games compelling is the single-player.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"GTA IV had a good campaign? That's news to me; I remember it being critically panned when it came out. Most of the story missions were boring, especially anything with Roman (Hey cousin, let's go bowling!). Also, Roman in general is just annoying, and is a shallow character with little redeeming qualities.

Also, there's the narrative dissonance of Nico, where in cutscenes he's this brooding anti-war scarred veteran, but in gameplay it's typical GTA zaniness where you're mowing down Innocents by the dozens while running from an army of cops.

The game was good, because the driving and the guns and the sandbox elements. The story just got in the way."

184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"The issue wth RDR  is that's it's very cool, but you can't really monetize it because it wouldn't fit the theme. You could maybe do a farm, a horse with a cool saddle and a few guns and then you're pretty much done. You can't tie spoilers or rockets to a horse and you don't have things like expensive yachts or planes you could buy, so it's very hard to make people spend real money in RDR so that's why they stopped developing for it.

GTA6 on the other hand, the sky is basically the limit. So yeah, multiplayer is definitely going to be a big part of GTA6. It will be interesting to see how they plan to migrate current GTA5 online players to GTA6 online, because I assume they want everybody in one version."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Were they though? The lack of any Singleplayer DLC to RDR2 and the fact that they only focused on the multiplayer kind of proves them right imo.

That's where you're wrong.  People like me are why you freeloaders continue to get content because I will buy the occasional skin, I will pay for the expansion packs and I typically pay full price for games because I want to play them right away.  You obviously were not apart of the PC gaming scene in the 90's when you got a game on a disc and that's all you got, no fixes, no extra content, nothing.  You people literal want things for free and cry when you have to pay extra for actual improvements to content.  You have issues with how a game is running, refund it, every platform allows it, don't cry about it after you've spent 100's of hours in game and doesn't perform as well as brand new releases.

Fallacy after fallacy after fallacy. You responded to a post full of actual information with nothing but fallacies. It's hilarious when the best someone has is completely ignoring the actual topic and just going on rants full of ad hominems. 

Sure though, pretend people that spend $60-$70 for games must be freeloaders that want everything for free. Keep pretending anyone that disagrees with you must not have been gaming as long as you too, surely that is a valid point that is relevant to the discussion and adds merit to your argument. Yup, everyone that disagrees with you must just be a crybaby, that is a valid argument. Keep pretending the straw man you made up about someone playing 100 hours and then wanting a refund exists, it makes your point much stronger."

184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Now you know why that sell it at a higher price.

184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"But if no one, sorry, relatively few people, are buying it at $60 then it's not really worth $60. I agree it's a great game and was definitely worth full value when it came out, but it was a smash hit, everyone played it when it was new. The only people left to buy it are the people who thought it was overpriced for whatever reason. Don't really like cowboys. Don't really like third person games. Whatever. Suddenly the game hits $15 and all those people are willing to part with the money.

Fair market price."
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I don't know if sales were definitely poor but I'd point to the massive uptake of the sale price (and them offering it at such a low price) as proof they could have been better.
184jkar,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,But if it's not selling at the higher price you aren't making any money. So you might as well make some money by selling it at a lower price.

Those problems immediately gone once I built my desktop and loaded up those games. I bet a lot if people are having those problems now because they're stuck with very old hardware because of the chip shortage."

sogeik,2022-02-09,2022-02-09,I never realised growing up that the only way I was able to watch Who Framed Roger Rabbit was the VHS taped we recorded when it was on TV. Which was heavily edited. This line was not included in the TV edited version. It wasn't until I saw the full version as an adult that I realised this line was even in it. The edited version also didn't show the cartoon shoe being put into the dip. I'm glad I never saw that as a child. It's disturbing enough as an adult.

Other characters in RDR2 like Micah, have weird stretchy, bendy limbs as if they're characters from Nightmare Before Christmas. Others have wild hair, like Dutch having mullet that seems to want to escape and women with super saiyan pony tails. You can see them in some of my Crazy Naked Cowboy Arthur playthroughs (that aren't done yet) lol!

sogeik,2022-02-09,2022-02-09,"Sure? But OPs system that wrath_of_grunge just described is still 'weak' by modern standards. I had something similar.

Then i upgraded from that recently. I had an i3-8100 (about the same performance as OPs i7-3770 but with less power usage) and a GTX 760. I upgraded that to a GTX 1660 first. And then a year later upped the processor to an i7-9700K.

You don't have to upgrade everything at once, or pick the most expensive bits to start with... 

in fact, when i got the setup with the i3-8100 it was part of a complete overhaul and that was the literal cheapest processor available for the motherboard I got whilst still being much better than what I had before (AMD Phenom II X4 965) and the GTX 760 itself had been kept going for almost 10 years before i moved on (it had started to fail)."

Obviously, in actuality they were just treating a symptom, not actually curing the disease, but they didn't know that. They had no medical testing back then, everything was based on the visible symptoms and if the patient reported feeling better. Well the coughing is a lot less and the patient claims to feel fucking great so... and honestly since there wouldn't be a cure until we discovered antibiotics it was usually a death sentence, might as well start doing all the opioids/opiates... you're waiting for a disease to slowly kill you, might as well enjoy yourself while you wait."

To just forget all of it, can give wonder to that game again.

But I also really want to replay MB: Warband again with no memories.

After completing every mission, you can choose, which side you'll play good or evil (spider man or venom). And also, it has great ending with big fucking venom with 5 heads, which is so fucking cool. When i was about 7 it was just blow my mind. Very recommended if you dont know, what to play, but dont want to play for too long. And Spider Man Unlimited is also great for me maybe because it gives me a lot of nostalgia. Its Subway Surf type game, but with great story and atmosphere.

qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Was looking for bioshock cant believe you‚Äôre the first to say it. Also bloodborne nice
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,I would say dark souls would love to get fucked by the Taurus demon for 3 days straight again.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"Same.

Best way I can think to sum it up is that it is the only game I played (and continued playing) sheerly out of curiosity. There was no direction other than ‚Äúexplore this universe.‚Äù
I went in to it not knowing what to expect at all other than the death loop. I explored for explorations sake, I discovered relics of an ancient civilization, talked with fellow astronauts, vibed to the music, and enjoyed the dynamic planets and the universe. 


>!It wasn‚Äôt until several hours in that I slowly, very slowly, started to realize there was an overarching puzzle to solve. That all the little bits of information I had unearthed were connected. And that‚Äôs when I began connecting dots, trial and error to do the right thing in the right order until, eventually, the puzzle was solved. The developers did a masterful job of gently guiding you through progress without holding your hand or even in some cases without you knowing you were making progress at all. I‚Äôll likely never experience another game like it. Even if there was a sequel, or similar games out there, I would now know there was a mystery to be solved and my exploration would be for the sake of solving that puzzle!<

The only way to fully enjoy it the same way would be if I was completely unaware again."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"finally, i see the correct answer."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Why is this game so good?
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"I really wanted to like this game but just couldnt get into it and stopped after about 3 hrs, did i just not give it a good enough chance?"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,It's between that and the first Bioshock for me.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"Finally, the true answer."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,[deleted]
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,I wanted to like this game but >!I can‚Äôt stand the timed death/reset mechanic. I don‚Äôt particularly enjoy repeating exactly what I‚Äôd just done for half an hour because I didn‚Äôt quite reach or figure out what I was supposed to the first time. That collapsed planet that‚Äôs essentially just a network of jump quests over a black hole was infuriating. It‚Äôs supposed to be casual and yet I felt like I was being punished for sucking at. Me constantly needing 3 or 4 tries to get anything done made the game too repetitive for me to enjoy it anymore.!<
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"It's refreshing to play a walking simulator  unburdened by gameplay or story.
Here there and come back rinse and repeat"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Underrated choice
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"The only problem with this choice is that I'd also need to erase my memory of the more recent games that would ruin my Oblivion experience.

I absolutely believe that Oblivion was superior to Skyrim, especially for its time, but Skyrim has too many quality of life improvements that would make it too hard to go back to Oblivion. Same reason I couldn't enjoy Morrowind: I played Oblivion first and it's just so much *nicer* to play that Morrowind just felt like a downgrade."

qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"This. I‚Äôll never forget that feeling of not knowing what‚Äôs out there and being so intrigued and excited to discover each new mechanic in the game. Granted, it was 2011 and there wasn‚Äôt much you *could* do, but it still felt so endless."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,mods?

qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"Bioshock for sure. It was the first game I played in HD, and sometimes I would get jumped by splicers because I was just staring out of the windows at a whale swimming through the city."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"Just recently played and beat the first Bioshock. Absolutely loved that game. But I‚Äôll be entirely honest, I kinda hurt myself early by playing on the second hardest difficulty.

Basically spent the entire game panicking and paranoid at every second. Still really loved the scenery and story though. It just wasn‚Äôt my main focus."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,HOLLOW KNIGHT!
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Bioshock
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"Hell yeah BioShock was brilliant! I would have loved an open world/sandbox version based on Rapture during its prime. Even another trilogy as a citizen before, during and after the Fall, starting a rebellion or joining Fontaine etc being there as everything turned to chaos would be fucken brilliant game!!

I was really disappointed with what they did with number 3, should have been a different game/story"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"Yeah hands down for me. Will there ever be a game that can give me the same feelings as ME, I wonder?"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,man i didnt buy this series cus i heard lots of bad things about it. but now you got me tempting to pull the trigger
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Respect
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,Did it age well? I‚Äôve never played the series but I see it on steam
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"man i just wanna hear ""the very model of a scientist Salarian"" for the first time again  
is that too much to ask?"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"Recently, playing through the legendary edition on series X Really cemented the games in their complete form as one of the best experiences that you can possible have in gaming."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,I actually downloaded portal 2 ages ago. Like 2011 or 2012 but I never had a pc that could run it. I recently spent 4gs building an editing suite desktop for myself and I just downloaded it from my library. Can‚Äôt wait to play it.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Same here!
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"This, 100% this"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"I've never played the single player missions (I did the co-op, but I understand this is different).

What is the best way to play this now? I have a Xbox Series X, and a PC..."

qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,I‚Äôd need remove my memory of all the games so I can properly fall in love with Ds1 again.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"In my case Demons' Souls, but yes.

Hell, let's just wipe the entire series, okay? Okay. Good talk."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,the entire trilogy or the 1?
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"was looking for this, and hard agree the DLCs i thought were super well-written and fun to play. if blood & wine was a movie, regis would take home an oscar."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,The only game that your start cuz butt and finish it deeply depressed
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Ending e is just a rollercoaster of emotions
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,There it is. >! although I don‚Äôt want to ball my eyes out again over devola and popola !<
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,Exactly this!
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,That final credit ending had a weirdly deep impact on me.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"I would erase this game from my memory, but not to play it again. Just to forget it. It might be my most hated game ever"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,This 1000 times... Would love to have it captivate me like it did back in 97.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,I still have my FFVII save files on a PS1 memory card from the 90s in a fake-book safe that contains my most precious items. Best game ever without a doubt.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Lol I've never played half-life 2 so I still have yet to experience it for the first time
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Skyrim was the first time I felt my days of running around with sticks as a kid come back to me lol. I‚Äôd absolutely do this in a heartbeat
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,">wasted so much time looking at the scenario that sometimes got a few shots

What does this mean?"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,HL2 series
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"Prey 2017, one of the most criminally underrated games in recent years"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,I also choose Skyrim but after Beyond Skyrim: Cyrodiil releases so I can experience that without knowing it too
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Or you could just ask max?
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,that ep 3 ending......
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"Was about to say this.

This game fucked me up."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"one of the best games out there, gonna install it right away"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Absolutely stunning title.  I got my mom on it as her first videogame after portal 2 and now after clearing it she's doing it with my nephew
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"Same, I had unfortionatly watched rather far in  a lets play of the game before I played it and I really wish I hadn't. Still one of my favorite games I have played it through multiple times, but nothiung was the same as the first."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"Play the Below Zero, it's also cool"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Yep after you get to know the place it isn‚Äôt the same. That first play through was magic.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"That's funny, it's one of the few games I wish I could get a time refund on. I wish I had never played it."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"I loved botw it's so unique,  you can even recreate a bit of the 1st play experience if you play with pro ui and no fast travel since with pro ui there's no minimap so you just explore (or get lost looking for things)"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,I loved it too
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Or age of calamity
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,This
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"definitely not! I hated this game at first because I had no idea what to do, so Id kill a few skeletons then quit. My quests pointed towards nothing and didn't lead me to actually playing the game at all. Only after 3 years of owning the game did I pick it up again because of a dunkey video seeing him being in a desert did I google botw desert, start actually doing the side stuff like making alliances with the 4 kingdoms, only after seeing him reflect beams with the shield did I know how to do that. This game sucks for beginners to Zelda games, sucks for people who are beginners to ""strand"" type games that are devoid of life almost everywhere. I go 5 steps in Skyrim and I find a quest and something to do, same in Outer Worlds, same in Witcher. This game was a massive L before you figure out the game, even then, its just good, its not amazing."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,This will be my second option
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Absolutely. That's the one.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,I had to scroll waaay to far to find this‚Ä¶ Borderlands‚Ä¶. Pfffh
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Hollow knight
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"Good choice, my second choice, first is reserved for Little Big Planet"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,BL3 was a real bummer
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,I never understood the Borderlands love. I like the story and lore but it seems like you just fight the same enemies every time.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,This! Finally
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Have you played Sekiro? Freaking beautiful game.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"Visited my friend outta town to find he had a PS5 and Ghosts of Tsushima (i have an xbox and have been dying to play it), needless to say he's an awesome friend and spent a lot of the weekend watching me play."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,Yeah same
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,Same
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"IX especially. That game was so magical. Over the Hill, Village of Dali and A Song from Her Memory are ingrained in my soul."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"I couldn't agree more! But if I had to choose one it would be VII, not because it's the cult favourite, but because I never played it... and I know all the spoilers, and want to experience it without the knowledge I have now."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"I‚Äôve played since the original Final Fantasy on NES, every game up to and including FFX was excellent.  However, FFIII holds a special nostalgic place in my heart, then FFVII, and then the rest are all equally close.  Sadly, I feel the art and story of the past is not reflected similarly in the more recent games.  Excellent choice friends!"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Hopefully they just remake them all
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,You'd have to re-learn the move set of all the Valkyries though..

qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,I'm currently playing Judgment. Such a great story.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Oh to feel the shear terror of that first encounter with a cliffracer again. Or to feel the anguish of dying when that first scrib gets lucky with its paralyse twice in a row.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,The only acceptable answer
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"The first metal gear solid was the first game to give me that feeling. The idea that you could combine great writing, acting, music, and visual art all in an immersive interactive experience was mind blowing to me. And games are still coming out today that blow my mind with how much they've elevated the medium. 

Hellblade in particular, I think, took games as an art to a whole new level. The way it combines sound design, visuals, and gameplay with storytelling is unparalleled. I've never been more immersed in a game before."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,I loved it too. Thought the story was great and the combat was so good.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"I'd give anything to experience what I felt when I first walked into the bunker and heard about the origin of the Horizon Zero Dawn program. Just hearing how intricate everything was and hearing about how the robots took over, how everything the formed."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"What‚Äôs special about the story telling in it?

Edit: Just asking a question, not attacking. An explanation instead of a downvote would be helpful"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"HZD is so underrated storywise. Both the mainstory and frozen wild story just blew my mind the creativity and discovery of why and how the extinction happened and how we survived it. A+ on the story, A- on the combat, B+ on gameplay overall"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,Both of the last of us games are so good
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,I still stand by the notion that titanfall 2 had the greatest level variety and creativity.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"And hearing ""Is it someone new?"""
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"I played the demo for Bioshock 1 like 20 times because I was so hyped, probably played the actual game like 5-7 times. That bathysphere ride still gives me goose bumps when the curtain rolls up and Andrew Ryan says Rapture.

Absolutely incredible game. I‚Äôm generally terrified of playing anything remotely scary but Bioshock was just such an incredible experience that I couldn‚Äôt stop playing."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"My wife knows I never did drugs or smoked or drank a lot, by my life was largely off the rails in my early 20s from addiction..... to fuckin WoW."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Yep. This. Especially with a healthy handful of the top mods.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Suuuper tiny inaccuracy! Deltarune isn't a sequel. It's more of an alternate universe kinda thing. Just a little thing!
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Deltarune has a very good chance of surpassing Undertale if the other chapters are just as good as chapter 2.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"To be honest, I stopped gaming for like 2 years straight because of my educational carrier and lost my interest on playing them. Until, one of my friend told me to try this game while we were in summer break, the story, character and the atmosphere of the game completely blew my mind. It helped me to find my interest on gaming again. Thus, RDR2 will always hold a special place in my mind."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,I‚Äôm 100% with you. There are very few games that I think have a better story but I don‚Äôt think any of them have gameplay that‚Äôs as fun and there‚Äôs definitely no better open world that I‚Äôve ever experienced. (Not to mention the graphics)
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Every playthrough feels so new even though I know what‚Äôs going to happen.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"It‚Äôs just such a pity about the tedious gameplay.

I got tired of watching the same long animations over and over again and stopped playing."

Shut up, I'm not crying, you're crying!"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"I felt it dragged on tbh. I couldn‚Äôt finish it and got like halfway through chapter 6, but I was just waiting for it to be over and forcing myself to play all through the last 1.5-2.5 chapters so I realized I didn‚Äôt care enough to grind to the finish"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,I finally saw someone talking about Sekiro
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Bloodborne is reason enough to get a PS4
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"Was playing it the other day , so upset we never got that sequel."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Definitely!
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,I never expected to see Tf2 here and I never would have thought of it in this context but man you're 100% right.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Pick different skills! It's a pretty different approach to thinks if you're a different person!
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"Oh yeah, breath of the wild is auch a good game. But is honestly the best for the first time completely blind"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"I wish i could finish Hollow Knight. I want to finish it all by myself without any help but I can't seem to find where I need to go next. So it's collecting dust. On the subject, have you tried Ender Lilies?"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"I bought a NS to play this game, and have no regard at all. Amazing game."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,I have never played. Is it good?
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Except for the one with that fucken batmobile. I want to remember that one so I don‚Äôt play it again.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Scrolled along way to find this one
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"Damn that's terrible, sorry for your loss. Your friend sounded like an awesome person"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,If you haven't played the Stardew Valley Expanded mod you are truly missing out. It stays true to the writing style of the game and adds tons of content and characters.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,You meant 1-3 right?
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"I think the vast majority of the MMO community wants to experience the golden age again, I miss the lich king days..."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Out of those 3 I'd have to chose Titanfall 2
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"That would be an interesting one. I knew the spoilers from 2, I'd love to know what it would be like going totally blind. Amazing game."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"Same, its one of the best"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Guess you're waiting for elden ring as well?
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,I love this game
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,BT-7274 will alway be in my heart
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,yes
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Hardest side quest was getting a couple Perfect Moose pelts
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"True but the existing side quests were really good. They had a very wide range from mysterious (Francis Sinclair) to ridiculous (Charles Chatenay) to wholesome (Charlotte Belfour) to sad (Hamish Sinclair). Of course there were some stupid ones like finding dinosaur bones and exotics that even I couldn't be bothered to finish (and I've already had 4 playthroughs, RDR2 is my favourite game of all time) but the majority are really good.            
Also there are some really brilliant hidden gems in the form of random npc encounters (the white dots on the map) that are better than some side quests I've seen in many games."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"When knowing things is progression any detail is a spoiler. 

The comment above is correct, if you haven't played The Outer Wilds go do so now."

qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,I‚Äôve tried to replay RuneScape multiple times since they released RuneScape ‚Äú3‚Äù. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever love it as much as 3rd grade me playing OSRS sadly
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,Scrolled for 5 minutes trying to find runescape haha. I knew I wasn‚Äôt getting let down ;)
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"Ah! A fellow chicken chaser.  The one failure of that game was that you couldn‚Äôt replay the arena, or that it didn‚Äôt have an endgame arena that you could continue challenging at higher and higher levels.  That was my one wish for that game looking back."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,My favorite of the trilogy.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,That game is masterpiece
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"Same game but for different reasons, erase it from my memory so I don't have to experience that awful pathetic excuse for a game."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,But how will r/gaming survive without its daily same r/askreddit post? Especially with the most consistent answers every day that it is posted?
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"Rdr 2 is a prequel to rdr 1, so I think not"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"I'm literally playing my first walk through of ME Legendary Edition. I never got past of the Matriarch Benezia missions in the original ME1 years ago. Just last week I finished it (in the Legendary Edition) and already have 45 hours on ME1 alone, and just started ME2."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"It's going to be the entire mass effect trilogy for me. I'm actually thinking to reinstall it again and play it all over again.  I want to be best buds with Garrus again and just complete everything once more. Sadly I've made some Renegade choices throughout the games, but I've been thinking to go full paragon this time."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"Mine is definitely the Mass Effect trilogy, except I just want to erase it from memory. I'll pass on the second go round."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,I just started ME1. Been amazing so far. KOTOR vibes
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,Yes this is the correct answer
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,I would give anything to play this game again with no memory of it. Truly the most unique and special journey I‚Äôve ever had in a video game.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"If anyone here loves space as much as me but doesn't know about this game and wants a good explanation as to why it is so highly regarded, without any spoilers (which is extremely important, as the game focuses entirely on knowledge and can be finished in minutes with spoilers)

I recommend watching this extraordinary speech from NerdCubed which captured my experience with the game really well [https://youtu.be/dkA5a8ov8Dw?t=1641](https://youtu.be/dkA5a8ov8Dw?t=1641)"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"Its the best game i have ever played and i scencerly advise you try it out without looking into it

And to actually answer. the game combines everyting you love in a game, music, atmosphere ,storry, gameplay and makes an orchestra that pleases every sensory organ you have and several others you dont even know you have"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"It's easy to play, has interesting environments, sweet physics, good music, it doesn't force you to do anything..to name a few.
I bought it because it got some GOTY award and was praised in local gaming magazine. One of the best games I've played for sure, very pleasant surprise."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"I'd say try to go back.. No distractions, read all of the dialogue (specifically the texts on the walls)  immerse yourself in the universe and into the music... I tried playing it once before and refunded it.  Then I went back a year later, really sat down and tried to listen to what it was telling me.  and then I was hooked. I wanted to know every mystery.  every puzzle. every reason behind things... And if you don't like solving mysteries or doing escape rooms, you won't like the game.  But if that interests you, I highly implore you to give it a try and just give it your full attention"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Thats because outer wilds is not a puzzle game its a storry and exploration game
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"If you're running into the same problem over and over, why not approach it from a different angle? The planet is gradually falling apart - why not wait until there's a big enough hole to just land your ship near where you want to be? Heck, there may even be a whole different route from a place you didn't expect. 

Or, if there's a particular thing that you want to see but can't get to wait until it's collapsed into the... thing and then take a look at it where it ends up."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"I wouldn‚Äôt call the game a walking simulator, and certainly not without story or gameplay."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,When I first got Oblivion on the 360 I got rrod straight away. Had to wait ages to play it.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"I still play Oblivion over Skyrim to this day. I liked Skyrim too, but I have more than double the hours in Oblivion."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"I dont know, playing Minecraft then searching for a farm and seeing purple links would be scary"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,You spelled dick wrong lmao
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"It's also added a bunch of content with updates since I've last played. I don't think lack of content to ""spice things up"" is the issue, more so it's just the core experience of having to, well, mine and craft things (see what I did there? :p), that got old."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"The environment was gorgeous, even on older gen consoles. I was the perfect adolescent age too where I could stay up until 2-3am during the summer and keep playing as I wanted to know what happened in the story.

*""Would you kindly...""*"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"Some games are worth playing on ""normal"" to enjoy the story on your first playthrough. Bummer your experience took you out of the game too much"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,AYYYYYYY!!
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"Bad things? Maybe you're confusing Andromeda which really had very little to do with the original trilogy. Its honestly amazing, one of the most rich and interesting stories out there. Its as close as you can get reading a good sci Fi novel because the lore is so rich and well thought out. Every single thing in those games has backstory to explore and the vast majority of it is interesting as hell."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"In my opinion it‚Äôs the greatest game trilogy of all time and nothing anyone can say can convince me otherwise. If you like games with strong characters, rich lore and good replayability this one‚Äôs for you."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"What bad things have you heard? It's my favorite series of all time, but it's got flaws just like anything else. 

The Legendary Edition includes all the DLC, so I'd recommend picking that up if you're thinking of getting into the series."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"For the most part you mainly play it for the story, while the combat mechanics became progressively better with each title. It aged well enough.

If you do play Mass Effect 1, you don't actually need to go 100% completionist on every possible secondary world to explore. You're not missing out if you decide to skip a bunch. Just keep to the side missions you stumble across or are assigned!"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,Play Portal 1st though
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,And getting invaded 52 times as soon as you cross the bridges to the bonfire Solaire sits at until you finally can reach the boss.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"I remembering searching up how to get Havel's armor, and seeing anor londo for the first time, was goddamn amazing to me."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,Making it past the archers several hours later.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"First time you gaze upton Beauclaire. The complete change in scenery, ambiance, and the music. Just perfection."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,And the music fucking slaps
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"I just finished the D ending this weekend and its been living in my head rent free ever since. I still need to go back to do ending C to trigger ending E, but I'm depressed enough already that IDK if I can handle any more emotional weight atm. Need to play a filler game for a bit before going back to finish up some trophies/ go through the rest of the endings."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,I played Neir on 360 after playing Automata on PC and when I first encountered D&P I just started balling... my wife had no idea what was going on and I couldnt tell her without major spoilers.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"That's nice, gamer."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"I'm so deeply sad that I had to scroll so far to get to this...

Also, hate me for it IDC. FF9 is a very close 2nd"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"You won't regret. Pump the graphic quality to the maximum, and still nowadays it is a view to behold."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"I loved how the scenarios were made, checking the art, or as something else works, and suddenly some enemies would pop out and shoot me before I get to see them, as I was not looking at the right direction."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"And if you do, build a base ON the lillypads. Where you can:

* Watch storms
* Ride the whales (walk up to them and interact) as they breach
* Set down penglings and they stay on the lillypads as pets."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,I need to try this. Do you recommend doing this on master mode?
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Sounds like someone has never heard of the term exploring
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Yes i know
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"I thought it was good, awesome gameplay, story though could def have been scrapped and the game would have been  better"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"They did an incredible job creating a lot of the characters. All had an incredible combo of low brow humor, charisma, and over the topness. Cell-shading style was unique ish for the time, improved gunplay over the predecessor and ""unique"" gunplay against other fps games."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,IX is so damned good.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"The Aerith/Aeris death...it stirred emotion as strong as any movie or other game I've ever seen.  In that moment, I looked at my TV and swore Sephiroth would die."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,FFII and FFIII are two of my top three games. All of the twist of FF2 were just incredible and the way FFIII changed to be my first open world rpg after the world gets destroyed was so completely fantastic to me. Right there with ya!
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"That was half the fun. Painful, but fun."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"""That's where you're wrong kiddo"" lol ya I just never fought them... I came for the story not to beat everything"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,I got fucked for a looooong time by them before I realized the shield could be used to parry.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"Are you saying the originals are better, or being sarcastic saying that I am being unoriginal in saying this?"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"Yeah, sometimes you can only experience something once."

qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"Absolute favorite of the series and a game I've spent probably the most time on, aside from World of Warcraft....which for me would be another game I'd love to go back and experience again in 2004."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,I'll check It out!
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"Also discovering how human civilization was restarted back to the ""stone age"" is just mesmerising"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"its hard to describe.. Without spoilers: in simple terms, you discover a mysterious world, its mysterious background as well as the mysterious background of the main protagonist. its so engaging, I had a hard time putting it away. The protagonist is an awesome female character, who is well written as well."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,True
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,We have all been there. But I'm no quitter so play classic wow now at 34! üòÇ
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Yes exactly. Can you please recommend me some good mods?
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"Oh I know, perhaps sequel to Undertale isn't the correct wording but more like the sequel in the Undertale series, that's how it's described on Steam"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"RDR2 hands down is the best game I ever played, the story, the characters are just something else."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,I tried to play through as a truly bad Arthur but it hurt my heart to do so.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"My hate is the number of enemies in missions. If the game was more punishing mechanics wise and had a somewhat realistic retaliation I'd love it even more. But it's hard when you kill what would seem like armies of police and gang members, wave after wave.

Probably is my favorite game, but the amount of enemies ruins the missions for me"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Probably a blessing though. It's memory can  ever be tainted.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,buy the map
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Only the most amazing game in history
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,he was pretty baller. Thanks for the kind words :)
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,I count Andromeda with 4 and want to be disappointed as such.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"I played vanilla wow as a mage and our guild got stuck on nefarian.  When the expansion came out and all our work and gear and effort was erased by lvl 63 blues I quit.  Missed out on burning crusade.  Couldn‚Äôt hold out, built a warrior tank and led a guild through lunch king.  Literally the most fun I‚Äôve ever had in my life with a group of like minded people.  The. Cataclysm came out and I was done again.  Got sick of the ‚Äúdailies‚Äù grind and quit again.  

Dailies?  I mean really?  The fun was exploring and adventuring, not doing the same shit every day.

But yeah.  Wrath of the lich king was golden age for sure for me.  Some say burning crusade, but man.  So good.  I watch asmongold now and it‚Äôs just an unrecognizable game.  Flying mounts used to be special, now it‚Äôs just an avalanche of skins and no content."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"I avoided everything about this game before it came out. I loved the first game. It was such a fucking roller coaster of emotions, and I loved every minute of it."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-11,"The 4 hours it consumed were beautiful, I‚Äôd love to redo it again."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,A true fellow of culture
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"Games great ; fun gunplay , interesting characters gorgeous world. Sorry you didn‚Äôt like it , accept it and move on."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"So to clarify, you stopped ME1 after the Benezia mission and started ME2? If so, the best parts of ME1 are still ahead of you. I'd advise you to go back to ME1. I'd be glad to offer advice, if you require any."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"Oh buddy, ME2 (before legendary edition came out) was easily my favorite. Now with LE, ME3 is coming in close now with all the DLC in there"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,ME 2 is the best one. The ME series are some of my favorite games of all time.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,If you haven't tried it the DLC is very good
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"Now imagine if that amnesia infused replay was in VR.

I finished my first play through in vr and then tried desktop and felt it was a lesser experience, especially flying the ship.

Im just saying if you crave that feeling you had first time maybe replay in vr would be good enough."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"Yeah, I heard, I‚Äôve been playing it and have a decent chunk of clues and have fully cleared the water planet. Explored the exploding planet. Explored the hourglass planet and got eaten by the angler.

I‚Äôm just curious why people think it‚Äôs so good? Like I enjoy using the information to get more information but so far I‚Äôm not having the best experience."

qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,Portal 1 is super short too
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,I beat Portal a while back. A friend lent me his copy of the Orange Box for console.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"Totally! Blood & Wine felt like a whole new game. But, in term of ambiance, music, etc, Heart of Stone was on another level imo. Gaunter O'dimm was probably one of the most memorable villain in gaming history. And the boss fights we're amazing (The Caretaker was creepy af). All in all, the game was almost perfect, just wished the Eredin boss fight would have been harder."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,Might I suggest a light hearted game like the last of us
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"I got this game during quarantine because the gameplay looked cool and I didn't know anything about and got hit with the best game/story I've played, I also cried during the credits"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"Meh, it‚Äôs more about me than the game. You can always stop a game you aren‚Äôt enjoying. Idk why I pushed myself through something I wasn‚Äôt enjoying"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,So sorry if dumb: is there controller support?
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Do you mean scenery?
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"Yes, it is undoubtedly the best part about the game. BOTW was my first Zelda game, and the reason I fell in love with it was the feeling I got when exploring and figuring out new things. 

I feel like most people nowadays are too used to games which tell you every single thing you need to do and put no emphasis on exploring and figuring stuff out. Most games are literally just full of missions which tell you to go from point A to point B."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,But do you know random person I met online
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,It wasn't a terrible game. I guess it suffered from high expectations from BL2. I also agree that the writing and story (a strong part of 2) was just terrible in 3. The game benefited from just skipping the story. The ending and credits scene was maybe one of the worst I've ever seen.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"Play 0, I feel like that‚Äôll be the smoothest transition for you"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,Just do heroin
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Fair enough.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"Same, I just couldn't do it."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"Since chapter 6 is literally a redemption arc since you're able to do stuff that dramatically increases your honor, I played the game as low honor arthur and in chapter 6, I redeemed him to max high honor. I don't think i have the heart to fully play the game as low honor and get the low honor ending."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,">	it's hard when you kill what would seem like armies of police and gang members, wave after wave.

It also makes zero sense in the context of the game. The fact that droves of dudes can get news instantly that you‚Äôre wanted makes no sense"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Oof. I LOVED 1-3. Replayed at least 5 times. Couldn‚Äôt even finish Andromeda lol so idek how bad it truly is
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,Have you played part 2?
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,I worded my post incorrectly. In my first playthrough like 4 years I go I only got to the Benezia missions with the Rachni. I got 45 hours on ME1 in the Legendary Edition. I'll edit my post.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"Regardless of favourites, if I had to pick only one to forget that would be ME1. Easily the most mysterious of the 3 and the conversations you have on >!Virmire and Ilos !< are easily some of the most mind-blowing parts of the games. ME1 might be the oldest one, it might be the least developed in terms of gameplay, but you can't beat the sense of wonder and mystery that comes with it."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"I'm playing it now, and I'm almost too scared to continue. I don't know what it is about it, but I get this immense sense of dread! haha."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"There's more to explore here.

&#x200B;

For me, it's the big reveals that you come across. Since simply knowing what's happening is progression I don't want to ruin anything, but there are a few things that you learn that recontextualize everything you think you know a couple of times."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"In terms of gameplay, I like how everything you need to beat the game is accessible from the first loop.  There isn't any grinding or stat progression needed to advance the plot.  Progression is gated solely by the player's knowledge of the world.


In terms of narrative, the bread crumbs left can be experienced in any order and still make sense/lead somewhere which make it a truly accomplished piece of writing.  The ability to feel and understand the motivations of characters you have never even seen  before or interacted with directly is honestly is mind blowing to me.


In terms of level design, the open world is so rich and compact that every inch has purpose and narrative.  Everything is exactly as big as it needs to be, and nothing is padded or superfluous.  As mentioned, every piece of that level is open to the player but gated behind actual knowledge of how to progress, which is really unique.  You don't have to be a lvl 12 Hearthian to progress through Dark Bramble or find the red key.  Instead you need to explore the rules of Dark Bramble / Giants Deep / Hourglass Twins in order to explore them fully.

I also had a tough time at first figuring out why people loved it so, and I don't think I have the same emotional attachment to it that a lot have.  But on a technical level?  Chef kiss."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"This game just does everything right imo.  The exploration and the desire to discover is just overwhelming.  The game always introduces something to me that makes me want to go find out what, where, how and why.  And the story, is one that relates very hard to real life and that feeling of ""existential crisis"".. but you don't really get that story until you get to the end of the game.  The satisfying feeling of the combination of music, mechanics, beautiful scenery and a well written, deep and thought provoking story just makes this game truly a masterpiece in my eyes.  You really just have to dive in.  No distractions, no music or podcasts.. Give it your full attention, absorb every noise and every word you read and let it take you and tell you the story its trying to tell.. It'll make you think about your life, your purpose and your existence as a whole"
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"Its hard to explain withput talking about the game but talking about it takes the fun out of it. So here is the short version every location has a  music so perfecly tailoredto it very mechanic is so fleshed out and every secret hidden so well yet so easy to acces once you know how or where to look it makes every chanlange much more enjoyable without raising any of the difficulties and when you put all the puzzle peaces together ypu are rewarded with somthing so beatifull you cant describe it yet want to talk about it.

This is what outer wilds means to me and i cannot envision life without this game"

qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,Bro I had actual nightmares on Herobrine when I was little. Him an Rattman from Portal 2 made it very hard to be in dark places.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,Oh yeah HoS is no slouch. It's a triumph in narrative. B&W was just different though. It was like going to Hawaii in the middle of winter. I could feel the warm sunlight and smell the rich air.
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,That‚Äôs fine. No need to be rude about it in a thread where someone is celebrating it though.

qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"Yeah. Sorry if my comment was worded poorly. I played and loved part 1, so I avoided anything about part 2 before it came out. Part 2 was the emotional roller coaster that I loved every minute of. I think I liked it even better than the first."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,"Fear stops progress. Do not be afraid of the unknown or the inevitable, accept it, because if you dont, you'll miss all the good things there is about life.  This DLC is made to make you fearful to continue, but you'll learn that it has its reason for it and you'll learn to love that reason"

qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-09,"Oh, it's fine!

Yeah, same for me. I actually had trouble sleeping from playing the 2nd one. Not due to it being scary or anything, but due to me constantly thinking about the game (I played it over 1 week, and I usually played it for a few hours before going to bed).

I've never had a game challenge my morals and make me think that much. Loved every second of it, and now I wait for Part 3. Hope it's as good, and without making the devs crunch to push it out in time."
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,I don‚Äôt even know if this game but your comment alone makes me want to play it
qq4zaj,2021-11-09,2021-11-10,Alright... you got me to continue...

95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"When he pulls the guy up from the cliff the side quest (activity, whatever) says ""Man from Blackwater"" so we know that there will be some overlap with the original map from RDR.

Looks like a ton of diversity though so either they made the map much bigger, or they've really dialed up the different biomes to 11.

EDIT: It's *possible* Blackwater will be in the game, but this does give more credit to the leaked map from a few months ago, yes. "

95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,I am still excited but jesus christ I hope the chores and camp maintenance aspect is not too overdone.  There are definitely some games where things like that can definitely take you out of it and just be grueling to get through.  I am very worried about that

95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"In many years time, I will be in a moonlit wooden hut on a mountainside. The warm crackling fire, sitting at the end of a king-sized bed, illuminates the warm rug. The mattress is plump, raised to the right level. The sheets are thick, filled with soft feathers. A window gives a view of the idyllic scenery. A blanket of snow to match the blanket of feathers. A gazelle prances in the distance.
My wife, my gorgeous redheaded wife, perfect figure, hair as red as wine and a gaze as intoxicating. She is as nude as the day she is born and just as messy. I have her across the bed, legs splayed out. Her womanhood bared to take my might trunk. For many hours we entwine, always rough, always sweaty. Finally with a quiver of the leg, my Aphrodite falls back, too exhausted to carry on despite her peak physical condition. I myself, of course, am still fully erect, but give her the moment to catch her breath. I hand her a diamond bottle of pure river water and she gratefully takes a sip to hydrate.
Between breaths, she leans in and whispers to me, ""Darling, I don't think I've ever seen your dick harder than it is right now.""
I turn to her, look deep into her eyes, and respond.
""It's still not as hard as it was the first time I saw the first Red Dead Redemption 2 gameplay trailer.""

Though the repeated mentions of pristine wilderness untouched by civilization and complete absence of any mention what so ever of any of the Native peoples has me concerned.

95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,"Do Rockstar realize what they've done! nobody getting any love or contact in October not even grandmothersÔªø

"
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,I want it on PC.
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Looks great i just need a pc port
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,I really hope they eventually release this on PC 
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Not pictured: all the micro-transactions 
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,It's more beautiful than I could of imagined!
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"As a PC gamer im crying rn :/ why the fuck you do what you do Rockstar WHHHYYYY

People who has PS/Xbox well enjoy motherfuckers"
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,I WANT TO PLAY AS A FUCKING VIKING
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"PC release better be a *worth to wait* thing, or I'll riot."
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Still no word on a PC version?
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Will we get PC release aswell?
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"Looks awesome, however I will not be buying it if it's not on PC. I still haven't wrapped my head around the fact that such talented developers don't take advantage of their gorgeous games."
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,PC option...when?!
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"So this is just a crazy idea but imagine if at the end of the game, after you have been through heaven and hell with Arthur and the gang, there is a time skip. The screen fades out of blackness to reveal John Marsten at his farm and it turns out that a full remake of the original is also on there. However this time, you're not as happy about going after his old gang and you share his emotions of remorse. That would would be pretty cool."
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Pc pls
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,See you on PC in 2023....

95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,I wonder how long they're going to put off the announcement of the 'shark card' equivalent? 
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"Hyped for the game, but they could not have picked a worse voice to narrate that video"
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"Releasing on XBOX and PS4, Rockstar why do you hate PC???????"
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Please release this for pc 
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"Well to be perfectly honest, in my humble opinion, of course without offending anyone who thinks differently from my point of view, but also by looking into this matter in a different perspective and without being condemning of one's view's and by trying to make it objectified, and by considering each and every one's valid opinion, I honestly believe that I completely forgot what I was going to say."
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Release on PC you shit dicks.
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"i want this game...but im going to wait for a few months until after all the DLC comes out, followed by the ""ultimate edition"", followed by the ""gold something edition"", followed by whatever.  then the price drops by 30%.  I've learned my lesson after 2017 and 2018.  "
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,what about us pc gamers? :(
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,PC tho? 
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Looks great. A lot of neat little touches that really can help the game in the long run.
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"I don't want to know the story, but I really want to watch this!"
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,I know where my money is going. 
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,The world looks amazing but the next gameplay video will be the one that sells me on it (missions and activities). I didn't like how empty GTAV's world felt. I feel like R* should take some tips from Yakuza; much smaller world but packed full of stuff to do. This seems to be heading that way so far.
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Fuck this literally gave me goosebumps haven't been this excited for a tile in a long long time. 
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Are those Skyrim style climb anything horses?
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"I can't wait for no singleplayer DLC/Expansions and lots of Buffalo Cards or however they will call it.

Game looks damn promising, but sadly it's Rockstar that is handling this."
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Ooooooh excited!!! But the horses doesn‚Äôt look as fluid as the first one... anyone else think they seem a bit rigid/stuff/like a badger? üòä
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"Duuude! I gotta say I'm impressed, looking forward to playing it. Anyone else getting a Westworld vibe from this? :)"

95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"I'm super excited for this and also hoping I can push my luck and hope for Undead Nightmare 2. Maybe less zombies and more mythical creatures / general horror quests. 

**Update**: This video was my *Shut Up and Take My Money!* moment. Just pre-ordered the Ultimate Edition. I might take the release date off work as well...two days on the weekend is not enough! "
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"This looks like GOTY material Rockstar always puts 110% into getting every detail right and this game looks amazing the world looks beautiful and the new interaction system looks great, making Arthur as good or as bad as you want to be. The gang system looks like it‚Äôll be fun to interact and play Cards or drink with your Pals. I‚Äôm sooo hyped for this game."
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Was that Steven Ogg?
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,I mean I was pumped for this game before I watched this and now I just can't wait. I was gonna pick up Spiderman but between a baby and a job I only have time for one game and this is it! 
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"Wonder if they‚Äôre going to have zombie game play for this Red Dead, the first one was really cool. "
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Everything looks so sick but then the fighting animations come off as cartoony imo.
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"Whoa, there's kids in this game! Must be a first for R rated Rockstar games."
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,I‚Äôm so ready to sink an insane amount of hours into this immediately after sinking countless hours into Spider-Man
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"I'm gonna be real upset if this doesn't come to PC. It probably will, but I'll be upset if it doesn't"
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"I hope the [Strange Man](http://reddead.wikia.com/wiki/I_Know_You) and other supernatural oddities are included. I grew up in the SW, plenty of folklore and scaries to be had in the lonesome deserts."
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"Why is everyone being so nasty to each other because of the stupid, played out pc vs. console shtick? Why aren't pc players allowed to be frustrated about a cool looking game taking a little longer to be playable to them? These are middle school levels of name calling and clique forming, it's so dumb like can we just play games and be done with it"
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Okay. I‚Äôll buy it for the SP but I‚Äôm not touching MP
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"Hey Arthur, let's go bowling"
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,I can't wait to not play this on PC!
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Please let this game have an Undead Nightmare DLC

That doesn't seem right."
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Anyone here still playing Red Dead 1 multiplayer on PS3? I've been wanting to buy a PS3 just for this but not sure if anyone plays. Let a homie know what up ‚úä

95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Spending money at saloons?  Whores confirmed.
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,i just went from 6 to midnight.

95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Cool they made a Westworld game 
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Peddle this game so that my stockesssse goes up 
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Did anyone else notice the moose at 4:50? It looks like he runs down the cliff face. 
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,RDR 2 and Spider-Man are my two top games for 2018
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,This looks so badass. I really hope an expansive MP mode is integrated in
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,The definition of **pre-order**. Yee-hawwww!
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,This looks great. Im not sure how successful character development will be. It seems like RDR1 was centered on that. Im not sold on Arthur. Hope he isnt bland.
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,5:25 Drifting horse style 
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Red Dead 1 is life. I still have a copy. I cant wait for this game
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Well. This has just been pre-ordered! Thoroughly enjoyed the last one. Looking forward to this one even more now. 
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"When the guy was telling the story about the sheriff wanting to hang him just for stealing a chicken I immediately thought of Skyrim lmao

But seriously this game looks incredible, here's hoping that it lives up to it (and that I'm still playing games when it comes up)."
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Can they please just fucking release the game on PC at the same time. Like... this is torture. 
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"Imma beat it twice. 

Once as a good guy.

Once as a bad guy. "
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,I‚Äôm fully torqued 
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Looks good. Too bad it's not coming out on PC as I don't have a console :(
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,FUUUUUUUUCK I can't wait.  RDR was pretty much the only game I played besides BF4.  I can't wait to go back.
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,All hype but no one is talking about the amount of microtransactions that's going to be in this game. It looks great but i refuse to buy any buy to play games anymore. Count me out
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Still hard to believe the first game is nearing 10 years old
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Is this an actual trailer? Cause if it is it‚Äôs the weirdest one I‚Äôve ever seen with the voiceover and everything
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Good bye social life
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Fucking noice.
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,From my Spectrum 48k to here has been quite a journey.
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"I have just one question
..
..

......  Pc when?"
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"I can hear my ps4 fan going crazy already. 
Can‚Äôt wait!"
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,All fun and games until a gang member starts sending smoke signals asking to go bowling.
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"Ya know, outside of GTA 4/5 an rdr to an extent, I've never really been super impressed with their graphics. I mean they've never been bad but they've never been a big selling point with me. That said, the graphics and animations in this game might be the best I've ever seen in a game. The reload animation in particular look amazing. I cannot wait to get my hands on it. That said, if the story is short and we never get dlc for single player, I might never buy another R* game. I know it's hyperbolic, but this is the first time we're getting a rockstar game after the success of GTA online. I played GTA 5s story a few months ago for the second time, and I really enjoyed. It was better than any single moment I had online. Plus it was pretty long. Rdr was similarly long and I finished it in 2 days because I played it non stop for 2 days. But it never felt short. I'm just worried but hopefully I'm wrong. "
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Mind fuckin blown. I'm so hyped. It looks amazing.
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"My horrible memory is telling me this won't be released for PC. Is that true?

If so that's disappointing. I loved the original on my ps3, but I can't afford a ps4 or Xbox whatever."
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,My original Xbone will explode trying to run this game
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,If Satan isn't there i'm not gunna play
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Can you get fat? Man that would be awesome. 
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Fave game of all time is RDR so i'm gonna fucking nut playing this
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Never knew a video about hardened criminals would make me so hard.
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"I just hope that theres another awesome outfit to grind for like ""The Legend of the West"". The black suit paired with the black face mask made me feel like a total bad-ass."
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"Fucking hell, right in the wallet. I was so not going to buy a PS4 just for this game."
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"Ooh boy, I can't wait for it to be released on PC!"
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,I guarantee I spend more time hunting and fishing than playing missions.
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"Looks fantastically detailed. If its challenging enough, simply surviving in that world would be plenty of fun."
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Does it have multiplayer this year? I wasn‚Äôt going to get this but this game looks amazing. 
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,I'm going black hat. 
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Smells like ejaculate in this thread.
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Don‚Äôt know if I can wait for pc! Ps4 pro purchase incoming! Lol
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,They actually talked about story aspect of the game and not the online stuff. Super duper glad. I have some hope now. Please don't disappoint rockstar.
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Am I alone in feeling like the physics seem too similar to GTAV and a little dated? Still gunna play it tho
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"I kept wondering how well my PC would handle it the whole time, until I came to a realization.."
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,This game won‚Äôt be complete until the Undead Nightmare DLC drops.
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,You had me at horse testicles.
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,I love the format Rockstar uses to showcase gameplay
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,"John Marston at - [2:00](https://youtu.be/Dw_oH5oiUSE?t=2m00s), [2:33](https://youtu.be/Dw_oH5oiUSE?t=2m33s)-[2:39](https://youtu.be/Dw_oH5oiUSE?t=2m39s) (in hat/suspenders), and [2:24](https://youtu.be/Dw_oH5oiUSE?t=2m24s)-[2:31](https://youtu.be/Dw_oH5oiUSE?t=2m31s) (right) maybe since not clear.

Also since Arthur has dead eye aiming maybe he, in fact, teaches it to Marston during the course of the game?"
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,Can I still go bowling with my cousin? 
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,will yuo be be able to sex with prostitutes in the game 
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,Was anybody else fully torqued the entire time?
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,Have a friend who did a voice for the last Red Dead that came out.  He wasn't even asked to come to this one. But now I see why. Its a prequel probably set in a whole other part of the country. His character wouldnt be here. Cant wait to meet the new crazy folks of the old west
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,"Weird choice for narration, but definitely informative. The tone just felt off. "
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,How far into gtav release did they announce the pc port?
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,This is gonna be good 
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,"Max Payne 3 weapon wielding system, YAY!"
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,"Beautiful. No wonder Rockstar was holding out on a game for so long, their work is really paid off. It's always a cataclysmic event when they release a game. I'm ready."
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,fuck yeah. PC please lol
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-11,Incredible!
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-11,Any word on native Americans? I realize it was a genocide and a difficult subject but they were an important part of the American expansion and history their story needs to be told!
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,And this won't be released on PC because why? 
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Why are cutscenes and scripted parts considered gameplay?
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"Looks gorgeous, unfortunately how Rockstar handled GTA Online and their broken promises (new single player DLC never materialised) I won‚Äôt be buying this one.

Rockstar are arguably worse than EA as far as micro transactions go, and their earnings reports show this. Yet people don‚Äôt talk about it. New items online are so exorbitantly prices you either have to grind for days, or weeks to earn the money to buy something ... or else buy shark cards. And if you don‚Äôt buy some of these things you‚Äôre at a significant disadvantage in free roam and an easy target (not fun at all). "
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Looks awesome but I'm not a fan of the video narration.

95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"Please be good! Please be good!

I'm worried about camp management. I know some people love that sort of thing but I don't want to come back from holding up a stagecoach just to spend an hour doling out resources and upgrading camp elements to make things more efficient. "
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Awesome. My buddy Curzon Dobell is one of the gang members. So great to hear his voice! (He plays the old man at 2:24).
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"As much as I'm excited for this game, and it does look great, if any other company pulled half the shit that Rockstar do, there'd be a fucking uproar. "
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"I don't believe these trailers one bit. Yea the content will be in the game, but how complete the trailers look is bullshit. There is no pop-in, low poly assets in the distance, or anything to make me believe this is running on real hardware. I hope I'm wrong, but everything just looked way to smooth and complete to be real time. I have a decent PC with a 1070 and i58600 and running open world games with ultra settings, one still sees the cracks and optimization tricks. This is ps4 and Xbox, no way. Even madden swaps in low poly character for real-time gameplay and then switches to higher quality models between plays during cinematic camera angles, and that's a sports game, not an open world game."
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Hopeful it comes to PC.

95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"File this under controversial, but I'm not that impressed.

 It's.... Yet another open world game. With some incremental tweaks and prettier graphics, so what? Everyone is so hyped when you know you're just gonna be playing the same exact format as every other open world game ever created? Gopher/Fetch quests, side missions for cash, weapons or upgrades to riding or shooting skill, some assassination quests, some rival gangs, some hunting and a main quest line. Sprinkle in some mini games and bam. You're done. Same old same old."
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"Can't believe they left out the microtransactions! Probably saving that for the second video. 

Little disappointed to hear that it sounds like we're going down the route of only having a few weapons at a time. Sure, it's more realistic, but I've always preferred the walking armory approach that let's you switch up on the fly."
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"For the PC people. This game will come to PC R* ""accidently"" slipped it through a dev. Think of it as GTA V part 2. Their selling scheme was solid, ""we release first for consoles, then we work in a higher res for PC and release it a year from now."" 

By doing this they keep the title alive and appearing not only on steam front page, but on mostly if not all gaming articles. A bunch of people buy it, some buy again to play in ultra and life goes on.

95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,What sucks is that there will never be single player DLC and instead the online component will get boring dlc after boring dlc that basically force you to buy this game's shark card equivalent to get the new content.
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"Fuck Rockstar. They're using the same tactic that they used with GTA V. Releasing as console exclusive, then two years down the line they'll release for PC in the hopes that console gamers will double dip and rebuy the game for PC. What a scummy company. "
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,I'm excited for the game but the commentary is cringy af.

95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Hope they have a PC version.
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,So it's not coming to PC I'm guessing?
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Only upset. Its not on pc.

95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,No PC version means they aren't getting my money. I don't understand with all the success that GTA5 had on PC (and how much money Rockstar made) they won't release a PC version. Maybe they will later after the console releases? But if that was the plan I don't know why they wouldn't announce it at least.

95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"The horseback combat looks reasonably responsive, but I'm still concerned the moment you hop off the horse, it is going to 'play' like GTAIV/V. I don't trust DMA/North to ship a game so much as an animation test anymore, so which studio is developing this?"

95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Really wish we'd see an MMORPG with this level of world detail sometime in my lifetime. This game looks gorgeous even though it'll likely get dumbed down before release. 
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,It's criminal how they aren't releasing this on PC. I don't want to have to buy a playstation just for this game
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,I think that my dream game is a pirate game similar to black flag but made by rockstar. Their attention to detail is always something else. 
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Fishing! I'm sold.
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Jesus the map looks amazing. This is getting me hyped but I'm afraid they'll fuck up multiplayer like they did GTO
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"I‚Äôm not watching a single thing about this game, I‚Äôm just trusting Rockstar and buying it day 1. Rockstar is the only company i fully trust."

95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,So no PC then? 
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,I just hope that they don‚Äôt sacrifice the length of single player for multi player in this like in GTAV. I also hope there‚Äôs no big always need to be online requirements or huge day one patches. I live in the boonies and my interns options are basically nonexistent

95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"The last one had different biomes too, didn't it? Mountains, a swamp area, deserts south of the river. Clearly this map will be much larger and the biomes look *a lot* more immersive."
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"In the first game, the world definitely never felt small, so I imagine even if this isn't as big as say, Los Santos, it'll still feel on par with the first game."

I remember playing Shenmue for the first time and spending ages just staring at the items on store shelves mind blown by the amount of detail they had. I'll probably be doing a lot of that in this game too.
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Does this mean you can only carry one dead animal at a time? Carry capacity is already a mechanic I don't love in open world games. Maybe you can trade them in for more money to compensate?
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"Finally/hopefully, a realistic game where you can't store a crossbow, sniper rifle, fishing pole, and four grenades in your back pocket and still sprint at full speed."

95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"I always said this was how personal vehicles should work in GTAO. Limited weapon selection similar to the older games, unless you could get to your car or a safehouse to swap out. Give you a reason to stay close to and protect your personal vehicle. "
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,I thought that since Red Dead takes place in the GTA universe that there aren't any real life historical figures?

95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,That stood out to me too. A small detail but games rarely get horses right. Having different types of horse that are suited for different jobs is great too. Makes me think that there must be a gameplay reason. Can't wait.

People often take for granted how amazing their games actually are from a technical standpoint."
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Liar's Dice was so good!
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"They'll have to have two seperate forms of online currency then. The one you can buy with real money *i.e. Shark cards*, and then one you can earn in game. Then only let you use the one in game for poker and other gambling. 

That's the reason I'm pretty sure that there is no casino in GTA online, lot's of issues with gambling in a game where you are potentially using real money. 

But still I don't know how that would work honestly. Maybe make the real cash ingame money only be for cosmetic stuff? Dunno, but curious to see how it's handled. Since I'm on PC, I'll be last to the table to play this beautiful looking game."

So it looks like perhaps no Mexico in this one "
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"Was the leaked map from a year ago debunked? I believe that map showed Blackwater and Tall Trees and that area, but then ventured farther north and east. And John tells Bonnie that he‚Äôs never been to New Austin, and that the gang always meant to get down there but things came up. Or something along those lines. Implying that New Austin and west of that won‚Äôt be in the game. "
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"It's probably just a  reference for the sake of world building. Just like how Libery City, Vice City, and London are mentioned in GTA 5"
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"From the XBOX store description.

>America, 1899. The end of the wild west era has begun as lawmen hunt down the last remaining outlaw gangs. Those who will not surrender or succumb are killed. After a robbery goes badly wrong in the western town of Blackwater, Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde gang are forced to flee. With federal agents and the best bounty hunters in the nation massing on their heels, the gang must rob, steal and fight their way across the rugged heartland of America in order to survive. As deepening internal divisions threaten to tear the gang apart, Arthur must make a choice between his own ideals and loyalty to the gang who raised him. From the creators of Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption, Red Dead Redemption 2 is an epic tale of life in America at the dawn of the modern age."

95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Is this the greatest year for fishing in video games??
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Rockstar has always had excellent gameplay trailers with a soothing narrator. The first red dead gameplay trailers were very similar and man does it work to get you hyped. 
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"I just hope making this trailer wasn't ""too"" hard for them. Sometimes you can make something look better than it is with a lot of nicely timed edits and effects. Other times, this stuff just writes itself... It would definitely appear to be the latter."
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"""Arthur, there's a camp that needs your help. I'll mark it on your map."""
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,They've said you can choose to not do Hunting or upkeep missions with your gang but they will treat you differently than if you took care of them. Which is really cool to me. It actually gives weight to the more mundane side quests. 
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"Watch the other ign video where they discuss their demo at Rockstar studios. The IGN guys asked about this and the response they got was that the game is not a maintenance sim where you constantly have to grind to keep the camp functioning. They explained its more like a bonus; the more you contribute to the camp the more you get out of it (side missions, morale, etc TBD). You can leave the camp for days at a time and it won‚Äôt fall apart without you."
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,They said it's not mandatory. You do it if you want to but the game will not force you to do it. If you don't though some gang members can start being cranky and whatnot.

95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"1. The game will look even better WHEN it comes to PC, they're gonna up the quality of it etc, just look at GTA V. 
2. Money"
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"They're not missing out. It's a tactic that Rockstar have been doing for ages and gamers ALWAYS fall for it. They'll release it on the PC last because the more time they take perfecting it ie planning MP for microtransactions the greater the chances of gamers buying it on multiple consoles that they own alongside their PC's.

I double dipped back iirc when GTAV released and purchased it on the PS3 and later on the PC. I know folks that bought it on the 360, the PS3 and later the PS4. Rockstar are absolute geniuses at milking gamers and we fall for it every...single....time.

I don't plan to purchase it until I'm clear the single player element is sound and not built with microtransactions in mind."

It's doubling their profits.

I bought GTA on the 360, and almost bought it on PC too, but Rockstar cut off transferring characters. How many people did buy the game on multiple platforms though? If I were to guess, I'd say a lot more than a million. $60 a pop, so even if it was only 1 million, that's $60 million dollars. "

Just another first person shooter. You shoot your way through different kinds of corridors full of half-high walls. You get some new weapons, maybe a section where you get to drive a vehicle. Team based multiplayer tacked on. You're done. Soooo original. Bleh, who cares.

Just another top down RTS. You mine some resources, build up a base, choose some upgrades, make an army and destroy the other base. Watch a little cut scene and the ndo it again. You're done. Soooo original. Bleh, who cares.

95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,The IGN thing said you could skin the animals and sell their pelts or take in the entire animal and sell the meat and pelt.  So its more rewarding to take in the entire deer.  It will also rot in the sun and the way the animal was killed affects the ability to sell the meat and the price for it.

95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Others above mentioned that larger pulling horses will likely be more useful for carrying more stuff for you since all your items seem to be physically in the world. Can probably load up a wagon with game from hunting and need a stronger horse to pull more. I'm sure there will be other reasons as well but that one makes sense.

The fact of the matter is GTA games need bigger maps because you can get in a fucking jet and fly across the map. The fastest you go in Red Dead is on a horse or a slow train so the map doesn't need to be that big."

95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,My favorite was Assassin's Creed: Black Flag which required 2 Humpback Whale skins to make a pistol holster.
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,I'd probably enjoy it if hunting is more realistic both in the hunt and in the reward. Someone else mentioned that the way you kill it affects the value of the carcass. This would make that perfect heart shot that much more satisfying. 
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Agreed. An actual deer can easily yield 20 lbs of meat for a younger doe and upwards of 100 lbs for a mature buck. And that's just the meat.

Unlimited bombs, projectiles, freezing enemies to get a triple damage bonus on your next attack, sneak strikes, heck even throwing boulders at them. It eventually got the the point where I had more weapons than I knew what to do with. "
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,not sure about an actual npc saying it but once you play as jack the final newspaper that you can buy does mention that WW1 just started in Europe
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"Doesn't he say, ""War in Europe declared! Experts say it'll be over by Christmas!"" or am I imagining that? "
95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Europe not being at war is a very recent development in all fairness.

95x63k,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"Equines have a fascinating history by themselves and in relation to us with domestication. Most of the animals that we work with instead of hunt are carnivores, as they have to guts to work through situations with us instead of running away like prey. Horses are an exception.

Sure, they're still going to freak out about a plastic bag now and then, or the log that's been in the same place in that pasture for two years that they suddenly noticed. But they also have the intelligence to push through their instincts to run and bond with us in a way that most prey animals are unable. Think about they - they hunt with us with dogs, whose ancestor absolutely terrorized them and still do in the wild. It's kind of crazy that we have such a relationship with a prey animal. It speaks to their intelligence. 

I like horses. "

9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,that one took me a moment. ok.. 3 moments.  haha.
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,The PC one also has really limiting game play mechanics. I really can't control where I go and where I look and what I do. Just an absolute garbage port for the PC 
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,We missed a lot this year.
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"I got 9 comments down before I got it. I honestly thought the video control bar was just an oversight and actually tried looking for the differences, cursing the low resolution under my breath...

Not the sharpest light bulb."
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,You'll be laughing in the other side of your face when I'm enjoying my horse testicles in 8k.
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"pissed about this one.

Not because it won't be coming to PC, I can only assume there's emulators for that. I'm more pissed because you just *know* they're going to turn it around 2 years after release and put it on PC, just to get some poor suckers to buy it on console before their platform of choice

EDIT: I was mistaken about there being functional emulators for the XB1 and PS4"
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Took me a second
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,It‚Äôs lonely at the top.

9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Good one :)

But I'm betting PC version will come eventually - and because of the shit they pulled with GTA, I won't be buying PS4 version. No rush, plenty of other games to play until then."
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,They're still trying to find ways to cripple the graphics on the PC version
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Please don't bully us like this. We are butt hurt enough! 
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,This is very good 
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,At least i wont be tempted with Horse DLC that will cost more then an actual horse at the time. Inflation not included. 
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,It should be ported to the pc in a year or so after the release. Especially if T2 implements GTA V type shark cards into the MP. 
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Ow... Well played

honestly, im over it and im gunna pass up on this game and every other rockstar game from now on until they stop being greedy slime balls.

Not even the sales for the last Assassins Creed, FarCry5 or Watchdogs games made me want to still buy it.

I could easily afford them and would be a prime customer but often the price or need for buying the super enhanced edition is a turnoff for me.

This will be the same for red dead 2 if the wait is unreasonable long. "

9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,there wont be emulators current gen consoles until waaaaayyyy after the inevitable PC release
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,How do you assume there are emulators for PS4/Xbox1?
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,that's why we still haven't gotten the first one to pc yet? 
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Emulators? LOL. Bro, most people still have issues running their PS2 emulators. "
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"> there‚Äôs emulators

Come on."

9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Must have been a tough decision not to buy the PC version.
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Although they said they won‚Äôt they still will
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,It‚Äôs not releasing on PC; best they can do is watch YouTube videos of it (hence the video controls bar in the PC image is the joke).
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Switch doesn‚Äôt even have YouTube.
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,A whopping 0p
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,A repost on r/gaming ? No way!
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,The repost is truly cross platform.
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Video bar is the hint.

The quality bar on this sub is so low is not even funny, it‚Äôs a parody of itself."
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a YouTube video of game footage. Subtle dig at PC gamers.

Pc as of yet won‚Äôt, so they can only watch, (hence the YouTube bar at the bottom)"
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I dont have a console
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,No console here.  
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,No console here. I had to borrow one from a friend just to play spider-man
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"They say it won't be released at all on PC, but it's Rockstar so it will probably come much later"
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Nope, if ever."
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,That it‚Äôs not coming out on PC so you can only watch videos of it. 
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,That Red Dead Redemption 2 isn‚Äôt available on PC and PC gamers would have to watch gameplay videos on YouTube in order to see the game.
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Knowing Rockstar, they will try to make people triple-dip somehow, like they did with GTA5."
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,It‚Äôs not releasing on PC; best they can do is watch YouTube videos of it (hence the video controls bar in the PC image is the joke).
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Both
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Yes, completely fine."

9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Last one is a youtube video. The game isn‚Äôt coming on PC. That‚Äôs the joke
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Since its not coming to PC, us PC players will only be able to experiences via videos, a la youtube."
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"it hasn‚Äôt been announced on PC, so PC players will have to settle with watching gameplay on YouTube"
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,We haven't beaten this joke to death already with Bethesda games? Lol
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Thats too damn long to wait.
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,It's funny that this game will probably be on mobile in the future. I'm sure GTAIV will be on mobile within 5-8 years.
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,But only 1 out of 2 balls getting censored.

9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,As far as I‚Äôm aware it hasn‚Äôt been confirmed for PC (yet) so the joke is that PC ‚Äògameplay‚Äô will be watching footage on YouTube 
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,It will. But after theyve sold the max amount of copies possible on console first hoping to double dip on sales 
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Rockstar would rather you buy it on console, and then again 4 years later on pc."
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"They said they aren't making it on pc. The thought is they are gonna wait till after the game is out on console then announce the pc version because it'll double their sales. Lots of pc games will buy it on console, then rebuy it on pc. They did this with GTA 5 as well."
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Correct. Mind, they said the same thing about GTA V on pc, look where we are today!"
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"I believe they will do the same thing as they did with GTA 5.
New consoles will likely release late next year or early 2020, which means they will release a new version for those consoles, and will throw in a version for PC. They earn ridiculous amounts of money this way."
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,ouch

9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"It won‚Äôt be released on PC, so PC gamers will just have to watch others play it"
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Really? I thought rockstar with their DLC stuff was pretty frowned on.

I mean the amount of actual ingame money it even costs for stuff. "
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,You should post that on r/showerthoughts lol
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,probably because nobody forced them to buy the same game multiple times and the buying ingame cars with real mone is not the main aspect of the game. I play GTA V for the single player experience and I got that. Everything else is optional.
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I agree but they're in no way as bullshit as EA. Fifa ultimate team is downright unfair if you dont pay money and the star wars game was a load of bollocks 
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Rockstar does consistently release top quality games, whereas EA just spews out recycled garbage on top of their heinous microtransaction policies."

Why the fuck is /r/gaming acting like Cyberpunk is the last game they'll ever have to purchase.  It's going to be great (I hope) but it's not like it'll have eleventy billion hours of amazing gameplay.  "

9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"> And if you're an indie fan, there's no better place to be. 

That's one of the greatest pros for having a gaming PC. I never bought an indie title for any console, the PC can be cheaper (on sales) and at least you store them without worrying for years to come.

But I really don't understand why RDR wasn't ported for PC. GTAV has but why not RDR?

9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,First one hasn't come to PC because it's a miracle it works on console in the first place. Just Google red dead redemption development nightmares etc. Too lazy to link source. But basically they would literally have to remake the game from scratch for PC not just update some graphics here and there and rockstar ain't about that life

I don't have any doubts about RDR2's quality, but I won't die if I don't play it right away .. and besides, let's be blunt: the PC version will be superior, so that's one more reason to wait."
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Just like they did with GTA.

RDR was them being stupid with their code. GTA5 was them being greedy.

They will push the game to PC just to double/triple dip people, T2 will make sure of that."

9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"I may be mistaken, but rockstar confirmed that it was not coming to PC in an interview recently right?

It doesnt make any sense why they wont bring it to pc. GTA 5 sold very well and there is a strong demand for it. "
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Considering how long it took them to release GTA5 for PC, I fully expect they‚Äôll milk all the console sales before releasing the actual polished game with online mode."
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"It will come out on pc, I will wait for it and pay 30 bucks for the game a year after release."
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"It has been confirmed that it is **not** coming to PC actually. Now, 'confirmed' meaning that they have said it will never come to PC but that's exactly what they'd say if it were going to come to PC later and they wanted people to buy on multiple platforms. Still, RDR never did so /shrug."
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,And on the next gen of whatever when they release it again for consoles.
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,100% there's gonna be 'nuggets of gold' microtransactions or some bullshit like the shark cards.

9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"I feel like I'm the only person who gets Rockstar's DLC method.

In most games, DLC packs cost money. If you don't have the DLC packs, you can get bent because you aren't getting the content.

In GTAV, *all the DLC is free, all 34 packs, large and small.* It's supported by people who buy Shark Cards. If you wanna pay for the DLC, pay for some shark cards. If you don't want to pay for anything beyond the base purchase and get all your DLC for free, then don't pay for the shark cards - and grind your cash *by playing the game*.

I'm not sure which message we're sending them - a lot of people bought the shark cards, but a lot of people bitch about getting the DLC for free *because* of those Shark Card customers.

I guess the message we send them is ""give me shit for easy and free or fuck you"", because that's all I can get out of this."

On ps3 in the other hand console is using completely different architecture which has to be emulated on pc for games to work. Emulating device based on different architecture takes massive amounts of calculating power.

(Edit:) before you kick me over for wrong terms; x86 isn't exactly architecture, but kind of the way how components talk to each other. In ps3 you would have to emulate way for software to communicate with different hardware. Think of it like translating this text to China manually. It's slow and hard. That's why emulation is so hard and resource consuming."

9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,have you ever played gtav online? rockstar is one of the biggest offenders of greediness ever. 
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"You might see it this way because there is no anger being posted online about it, at least not in any actual volume.  You might also see it this way because maybe you don't play it, or maybe you don't buy shark cards.


There is a lot to be said about EA and while this might seem like a defense of EA, it isn't at all.  Before their Battlefront game was even released someone crunched the numbers and listed the amount it would cost to get every item in the game, not every earned item you might get mind you, just if you decided to open your wallet and get everything without playing a single minute first, just keep buying until you got it all.  Then that number got plastered everywhere as a travesty, even though everyone knew that was not, in any universe, realistic.

I've come across (only a few) posts/articles about the cost of every item in GTAO and they did the math in regards to shark cards, it's almost identical. But no one cares, because who would be stupid enough to buy everything... right?  They only do that in EA games obviously. The stupid people play EA, the smart ones play GTAO and gambling, greed,  predatory practices and 'bad for the children' only means gambling, greed,  predatory practices and 'bad for the children' when it's EA.

Then, if someone does feel the need to actually talk about Rockstar, the argument in favor of shifts to ""but you can make money easy in GTAO, so it's cool""  But yet, you can do the exact same thing in EA games...you can earn the crap.  That amount I mentioned earlier, the calculation done, again, that was for all items possible, before you played even a minute, nothing was actually locked behind a dollar sign.  If you played a few weeks to a few months, which most people who actually care about a online multiplayer game do, they'd have almost everything they wanted. They did a calculation on that as well, but it was ignored. A reasonable, most people will do that number, was ignored.

Inevitably the argument (goalpost) will move yet again and someone will say ""but you're getting an advantage with money! Pay2Win!!!""  Hmm, be me, start GTAO, have no in game money, little time to grind, see all the pretty fast cars and large boats, that many have played the game to get, sometimes endlessly grinding, pull out wallet, spend 1000.00, have everything in game.  Sound a bit familiar?

Everyone seems to forget that getting a slightly better gun doesn't make someone a better player and good players aren't killed by newbs with a thick wallet. You think I am going to beat Shroud in a one on one because my gun doesn't overheat as fast anymore? Not a chance.

Again, this is not a defense of EA, (fuck them) it sounds like it, but it's for a purpose, and it's not even a rip on Rockstar as I don't really give a fuck, my point is you see it this way because it's not EA and for no other valid reason.  Any game which has items or mechanics to purchase will real live money is no different than what EA does, not more, or less, evil.  No extra firecrackers up the ass.

That all said, is there really a difference between bad behavior and egregious behavior?  Do we really let the bad one slide simply because someone else is worse?

If someone robs a store and someone else robs a bank, do we forget about the first guy and give him a pass?

Maybe this is the ""why"", the reason companies continue doing this, they just let EA take the bad rap and keep adding this crap to their games.  At least they are not ""as bad as EA""."
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Honestly feel like its because rockstar doesn't dog fuck single player and put all money and talent in to online.

9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"No, rockstar turned the entire model of gta online into this horrible massive grind, just to frustrate you into buying cash, which they make ridiculously expensive.  It literally costs $100 to buy one thing in the game ($100 buys 8 mil in gta cash.  The DeLorean costs almost 6 mil before you upgrade it, and you need to buy a truck to upgrade it with which costs around 2 million.  So really you still have to grind a little for that one thing....)"

9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"It's not exactly what you wanted but you can play the PS3 version on PC (not an emulator), you can just subscribe to PlayStation Now for one month and play RDR there.

\----------------------------------------------

EDIT:

1. You don't need a PS3
2. I personally never had any problems with this service, just very minor input lag for few seconds every 10minutes or so.
3. If the service is not good enough or it's not worth your time and money, then you can wait few years for the PS3 emulator to catch up (They're making amazing progress so far) and play RDR at 4k with 60fps.
4. There are also few PS4 games like bloodborne you can play as well
5. There may be a 7 day trial for you to try out (varies on location and whether or not you used this service before on PS4)"

9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"I haven't played GTA Online since they nerfed the race payout a few years back. It was already a grind, they just made it more so. Not interested in investing hours of doing the same thing every night to pat myself on the back about affording an in game item.

Edit: However, loading up GTA Online for the first time after completing the single players was one of the most exciting things I've done in a game in a decade. I never bought any DLC and truly got my moneys worth between the single player and the few months I pumped in to online."
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I always hated the fact that the prices of things in GTA weren't realistic or at least close to it. I don't mind paying 20k for a car but when you're asking for 5k for a t-shirt with a logo on it... come on now. That shit adds up. 
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Gone are the days of video games being a hobby, my friend, It's moreso a luxury now. I know what you mean though, it seems the development cycle of today is make a game, give cut content as DLC, begin development on a _new_ game. Rinse and repeat. It's hard as fuck to find games that are constantly updated throughout its life-cycle.

My advice? Find a nice community in a game you like and settle in for the long haul. I've been with Warframe for about 2 years now and it's great, the games great, the price is (completely non-existent actually), the people are great, _everything_ is great."
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Eh, I loved the story, but thought the combat was super boring. which is a similarly rare opinion around here "
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"I honestly only played about an hour of it and never picked it up again. I'm sure the story and world is great, but the rolling simulator style combat and the clunkiness of movement just put me off. Maybe it's just me but the way he moves feels so incredibly unresponsive. You move your joystick the opposite direction and his movement animation takes what feels like forever to turn and face the direction you want to go."

9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"so I was hesitant about the ps now service after reading what people had to say about it, but I ended up having like $23 in my PlayStation wallet from however many years ago I added funds for some ps vita games... so I decided I'd subscribe for a month just to see how it was. 

gotta say, I'm pleasantly surprised with it. my internet connection is pretty middle of the road and I haven't had any issues with lag or skipping around on the stream which was my main concern. I just plugged my dad's extra ps4 controller into my usb slot and everything was good to go. I'm currently about 1/4 of the way through the last of us, which has been on the top of my list of games I'd like to play ever since it came out on ps3.

the only issue I've had so far is the stream not working well on full screen, but all I had to do was minimize and then manually drag the window back to fullsize and for some reason that works fine.

anyway, if you're on the fence about it and have a decent hardwired connection I'd say go for it. at least give the 7 day free trial a go to see if it works well enough for you."
9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Yes. PS Now is Sony's streaming gaming service. You can play via a PC.

9kdih9,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"its one of those game streaming services.  just look up ""PS now"" their library is limited so it isn't all playstation games, and the input lag/stutter made it unplayable for me, but if you have a great internet connection and semi-good PC i suppose its worth looking into.  it is subscription based, mind you, so it is up to you whether you think it is worth it.  they have a free trial tho."

9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,These posts are cringe
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,I can't tell the difference between this one and the real thing.
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Why does everything anyone ever do have to be on reddit? Well done, you made a gift. You want our thoughts? Well, I think it's cute and all that but who the fuck cares."
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Whoever gets anything handmade and doesnt like it is dead inside.
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,i preordered one of the uncharted games for my friend and put the pre order ticket in an nba live 09 game box with Tony Parker. probably a 6 year old title at the time. his face was priceless upon unwrapping
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-07,"I don'5 think he'll like to know that his gf is an attention whore, but... Maybe y9u give good suckin' so it's all right"
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Pre-ordering a game in 2018 is like when my mom heard i liked building stuff with lego so she bought me a hammer. JK it's lovely.

9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"You spelled Playstation wrong.

Jk. It's an amazing way to give him an unreleased game. You put effort in it, instead of just give him a little code on a paper :) "

I know she isn't too interested in videogames or PCs, but that gift meant a lot to me. All this to say that this is an excellent gift with a perfect personal touch to it. I hope he appreciates it as much as I cherish my own experience :)"
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,I'd keep that over the actual one.
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Holy shit he is going to love you for this.
The game is great, but what matters most is the thought, time and creativity in drawing the cover.

Good job"

9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"That's a great gift! I was wondering, how did you trick him to not buy it for himself already?"
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,What's inside?
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Shame he has a PS4

9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,You should order a poster to go with it :)
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Now put the first game in there they won‚Äôt complain 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Calling it now. He‚Äôs going to propose. 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Personally if my girlfriend did that for me I‚Äôd love it. I think it‚Äôs positively adorable!

9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"I don't really play this game. But that is not the point. The point is that you could just buy him the game and tell him that is his gift. But instead you invest your effort and time to make a cover of the game as a way to show him your dedication and love. Wonderful, you are really caring. Good luck!"
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,If he doesn't marry you hes wrong

9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Maybe outline the figures with a real thin felt tip pen 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Jealous of you nails and creativity!  Really though, such a good idea, my bf would love this!"

9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,I read the first half of that sentence and was about to scour the web for early releases ... then I read the rest and the context made sense.
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Honestly, I would just be happy that my girlfriend put that much effort into a gift. As far as I‚Äôm concerned you went above and beyond and did a pretty amazing job to boot."
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,He needs to wife you
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"""I know it's not perfect""..draws it perfect anyways"
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Since it's from you just getting that case which you made will most likely mean a lot to him 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"These are the best types of gifts. The time, effort, coordination, attention to detail all fueled by emotions. You poured a little bit of who you are into this and I'm absolutely certain he will love it. "
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Wow, that's truly awesome. I'm sure he'll love it."

"
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,This is like 10 times lovelier than simply offering him the game. I hope he will keep this drawing like a very precious gift. 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"So many comments so you prob won‚Äôt reply. BUT, will you please do that Shrek idea and record it? I really need a laugh lmao."
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Ps happy cake day!
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,I‚Äôm quite impressed. Good job on the cover. I‚Äôd be thrilled to get it and know that I was getting the game when it comes out. 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Then you are for real the best girlfriend there is!

9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,I'd make a realistic cover but put a hand drawn disc inside. 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Now that you made it to the first page he will see it and expect it, there will be no surprise... good job though..."
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"If it doesn‚Äôt have the game in it then he will break up with you. One must not play with a mans emotions like that. Getting his hopes up because of the cover but being scammed with the contents. RDR2 is the most hyped game right now, choose your battles wisely."
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Pinky nail? 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Where's the horse balls?! 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Why don't you just tell him that you are about to break up with him?

He'll spend more time playing a game than spending it with you
Think about what you'r doing. ,"

9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Now please draw me a PC version case.
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Very thoughtful and well done gift! Did you also make some videogame blurb on the back? Maybe put some birthday greetings on it in Western speak?
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,He's gonna be pretty disappointed when that paper cd inside doesn't work.
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,are we not gonna talk about how fabulous OP's nails look?
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Honestly gifts like this are lost on people a lot of the time. This is really sweet and I know if I were him and I were excited for this game I would really appreciate this. 

This is a definite ‚Äúgood job‚Äù from me, the (unofficial) authority on good jobs."
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,No

9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Don't know about the cover, but you sure are perfect!!!
Your boyfriend is definitely lucky!"
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,My ex hated gaming. Wouldn't ever gift me anything remotely game related. Didn't even let me talk about it. When two opposites attract right? Anyways nicely done!

9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Fuck yeah he will love it. Not to be a psycho-analyst but stop second guessing yourself. Your gift is endearing and exactly what he wants. If I had a girlfriend who gave me this as a gift I would know that she truly understood me. Just sayin. Good job.

Nice drawling though :)"
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"I've done something similar but kind of the reverse. I bought my girlfriend a video game wrapped it in white wrapping paper and drew the worst off-brand game I could create. I think I titled it ""left 2 die"" for the PZ3 it was complete with rating and even some details on the back of the cover. I have little to no artistic skill so my drawing looked atrocious especially when compared to this one. But we both got a good laugh out of it so I think it was worth it. "
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Yea thats nice! I did something similar to some pirate game when i was little and broke the original cover paper.
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"To be honest, i think he's going to keep the cover and when the game releases he will just put the cd in the drawn cover and throw the origional away xD, btw you did a pretty good job on that drawing, how much time went into it?? "
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Screw red dead redemption...where do we get more of you?! That's awesome.

9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"I did the same thing when I was dating my husband!! Fallout 4, pip boy edition!  He LOVED it! I'm sure your guy will too!"
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,I would cry 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,[deleted]
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,It‚Äôs so cute. He‚Äôll love it. 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,That there is some marriage material
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Your nails remind me of the Buffalo Braves for some reason lol
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"It's really about the effort here because he should understand it's not out yet, actually my parents did a similar thing when I got my dog they got me a stuffed dog with a little tag that had a date on it that was the day I could go pick out my own dog bc the shelter wasn't open on my birthday.       
P.S. love your nails"
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,It looks great and the aspect could be like it's the real cover in a retro style! I'd personally love it <3
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,That art makes me think of the great emu war idk why. 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Thoughtful as hell. I'd love it. 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,More than what my wife does for me on my birthday. So I think he'll like it just fine.
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"I have a work friend who I buy her favourite ice cream cake on her birthday every year. She gets a ‚Äúwork cake‚Äù too, but says she loves her bday because she knows I‚Äôll get her an ice cream cake. Effort means a lot to many. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll appreciate the thought and effort you put into his gift."
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Nobody here knows your boyfriend or his particular tastes and preferences. You do. Why don't you ask you if you think he'll like it. That would probably work best.

Alternatively you could just admit you're posting something you made and you'd like people to compliment you and your work.

Having said that: It's pretty well done. Nice thoughtful gift with some real effort put into it."
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,This is so sweet I got a damn cavity. 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Ahah, thats awesome!

If you wanted to go the extra mile you could have made it a reversible cover and put something silly on the other side, that'd be the coolest

I hope the gift goes over well c:"
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,That‚Äôs really nice of you. Also damn girl you have perfect hands 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,That's so sweet
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"If I had a girlfriend that had made shit like this for me, I'd be the happiest boy in the world.  My ex was an artist and never made anything for me, so yeah.  He'd better be happy with it."
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Now this is a gift that keeps on giving. 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Haha thats amazing
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Does it double as his birthday card? It'd be cute if it did :)

9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Birthday present that are made always mean much more to me that a bought gift.. this shows you have thought about him and done something really nice for him... good luck
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,This was mighty rad of you. I think it came out great.
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,this is great and all but dang you got it for the wrong console
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"He's a lucky guy to have you put enough effort in to do something like that! That's a super cool way of saying ""I pre-ordered something for you""! "

9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,He's a lucky man

9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,You seem like a really nice girlfriend. And a talented artist!
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Looks like you should display it on the refrigerator 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,How do you type with those nails?
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,why didn‚Äôt you do it digitally?

9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,That‚Äôs More than perfect.and I hope I‚Äôll have a that girlfriend.
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"My favorite gifts from my wife are things like this where she put in the time and effort to give me something unique or cool. One year for Father‚Äôs Day she and the kids gave me a this big beer bucket and it was filled with my favorite beer, candy, and snacks. It was awesome. "
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,All gifts are good dont worry
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,This is awesome. I hope he decides to replace the legit cover with that. I would. 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Xbone would have been better.
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,He'll love it. I always see cool things like this that gfs do for their bfs. I wish my bf played video games so that I could be crafty. 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Happy engagement!

9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Put a scorpion inside the box so he could have the real cowboy's boot experience.
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Very cool Kanye

9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Awarded BEST girlfriend 10/10
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"That is amaizing. My girlfriend is an amaizing artist, and incredibly cool...however, I wish she would think of doing something like this for me, because she knows how much I love vids. It's not her fault, she simply wouldn't think of getting me a game unless I personally asked for it, but I wish she did. Still love her though."
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Tell him that you got 60k people upvoted this
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,This is super awesome.  :)  Good on you :)
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Whenever hand drawn box art gets posted here, it always makes me hope that I run into a case like that in the wild. I'd be in heaven if reversible box art were hand drawn like this, just enough detail to get the idea of what's being presented. Minimalist style really gets my motor revving"
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,That depends on how much he loves you... You're about to find out.
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"If wasnt planning on marrying you, he will be now."
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,He better like it.
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"I would cherish that case forever, even more than the game itself if my significant other made it for me. "
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Crayon or colored pencil?
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,He better put a ring on it gurrrrl
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"I did the same thing for Arkham Origins - not only was the game only OK, but the cover is just a big Batman head, with half his face, and half full of villains. Mine looks like a big scraggle of garbage and trash. Yours is cool! The minimalist style works for me."
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,looks like shit
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Awesome job!

9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Omg you are so sweet! The fact that you even thought of doing this makes you an absolutely amazing partner! And of course he will like it because it‚Äôs you who is doing it! I will be amazingly lucky if my future boyfriend is as sweet and kind as you xx
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Looks traced
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"When I bought used games from Gamestop in those generic cases as a kid, I would always take hours trying to draw the cover."
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"If you cared about him, you‚Äôd have bought him a PS4 Red Dead bundle. "
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Whoah, my bday is in a couple days."
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,That's really good! Also happy cake day!
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,that's a good amount of effort you put into the picture! good girlfriend :-)
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Your nails scare me D:
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Now that is dedication 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Hell that should be an official cover!
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,I'd sure like another PSU for my xbox 360... Might even sell it then! Trade 4 PS4 with extra ‚Ç¨‚Ç¨ from my side. 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,I wanted to say it's bad (as a joke of course) but it's to good!
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,If my girlfriend put that much thought into my dumb birthday she would be hugged until my next 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,He damn well better.
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,That's definitely better than what my girlfriend would probably do 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,It was a great effort and meant from the heart. That's all that matters
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,It was a great effort and meant from the heart. That's all that matters
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Thats a awsome idea lol 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Do you have any friends that would date me and buy me Red Dead Redemption 2?
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"If anyone close to me did this I would be happy as could be, I couldn't complain. Not only would I be getting a game, I would also be getting a hand drawn picture which I would probably put over the official game cover."
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"I wish I had a girlfriend like that lol!
"
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Looks awesome 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,If he don‚Äôt like that then you need a different boyfriend 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,He likely is more interested in fucking your throat so try that
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,if he likes rockstar games he will love this sh?it
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,I love seeing these birthday /anniversary gifts people make. It's very well done! Anything custom is worth more than anything bought off a shelf. I'm sure he'll love it.
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Needs more googly eyes 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"I would instantly propose, Even more so if it had shrek"
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,What a clever and cute way of revealing a gift. I‚Äôm sure he will love it!!
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Adorable!! What a great girlfriend 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Put a different game in there with a note that says ""To tide you over til release day"""
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,It would be funny if she was like I got you that reddead game you were talking about and puts the first game cover in ü§£
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-05,"Way better than I could have done, and I‚Äôm beyond impressed you did it with those nails. Super thoughtful 

Edit: and Happy Birthday!! What did he get you? "
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-05,You should put in a disc of Red Dead Revolver (the one before RDR1). Should be compatible with Xbox One
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-05,"He'll love it! Also he'll think you got the game early and made your own cover as another special gift, and be disappointed upon opening it to no new game, but understanding that the game isn't out yet and you couldn't possibly have it yet.

Overall, confused but loving and thankful. "
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-05,Go to pornhub and download a copy of Red Head Redemption 2 to put inside
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-05,"I‚Äôm dumping my girl as soon as I get my hands on RD2, so much wasted time going to the mall and going on hikes... Goodluck"

9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-05,"My wife did this for me all through the years when we were dating. My cards are final fantasy, Zelda, world of Warcraft based. I saved them all. The fact that a woman can spend her time and effort to create something for her man, even its imperfections are perfection. I love every one of them she has made for me and I applaud you for the effort you put into this. I thought my wife was a diamond in the rough, I guess your man is just as lucky!"
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-06,My ex did something similar for my birthday when fallout 4 was coming out though she printed the cover and a picture frame for it.
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-11,"If he doesn‚Äôt like it, we‚Äôre dating now. "
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-21,Nice.

9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-26,It really is the thought that counts. I would be very happy with someone who put in that much effort for me. He should be happy.
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-11-01,Wow can you marry me?
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-11-08,That's beautiful. 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-11-16,marry this waman
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-12-05,"I like the idea of creating a custom cover, makes something like buying a video game a bit more personal. "
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-12-06,Seems legit

9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"I bet that, when the game does come out, this is where the disc will really end up. Unless you do the digital version, then I don't know."
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Yeah you're wrong - it is actually perfect.
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,I would love it :D gj
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Which edition did you get him? Standard, special or ultimate?"

9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,You are a good girlfriend 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Suddenly you find out he already preordered it that would suck...
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Its a nice cover indeed, but you dont preorder games. "
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Wish I had a girlfriend that thoughtful. Hell, I just wish I had a Girlfriend üòÇ"

9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,I would flip the hell out if my GF did all that.  She used to draw elaborate Pokemon on her letters to me; handmade stuff always shows you care and that's what matters.  Aces in my book : )

9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,shit psot
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"LIAR!!! That games not even out yet. This person is LYING FOR KARMA!!!!

CRAYON LIAR!!! Some of these colors aren't even out yet. This person is a CRAYON LIAR!!! They are crayon lying for karma and DMed pics or something. CRAYON LIAR!"

9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,I think he'll pretend to like it but wish it was something he could use right away
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,I think you should wait for the game release and only then buy a real game.
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,PS4 numbah one
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Looks good
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,[removed]
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Not bad but I think u shud use a sharply an outline the contours to make it pop out an maybe add another layer of color to make it look less washed out. 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Should be the inside cover?
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,oh fuck off you cunt
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Well he‚Äôll probably be puzzled at first until you tell him you pre ordered it for him and are gonna gift it to him and then he‚Äôll most likely ask you to marry him so I only have one question for you.... [are you ready?]
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,I liked it better than the original.
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,You seem like the sweetest girlfriend! Good job!
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Haha nice! He will definitely love it!
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Heeey thats really good
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,I would be fucking flabbergasted 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"I would take this gift instead of any other expensive gifts you could‚Äôve given. If you show that you put thought and effort into his gift, no way in hell he wouldn‚Äôt appreciate it"
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,You the real MVP 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Good job! That's very sweet!
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,You win!
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"The boy should marry you.
On a side note tho this is really sweet I‚Äôm 200% sure he‚Äôll like it"
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"This is adorable. He's going to love it. If not, reddit is gonna tear him a new one. "
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Looks really awesome! Great work! 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Dont hand him a empty box early, that will just make the wait worse!!! It doesnt matter how good you are with crayons!!!"
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,No. 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Honestly very impressive how well you recreated it. I really hope he shows his appreciation for this because this is awesome.
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,What a stupid question. 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Well if I were him I'd totally put that cover on the case for the actual game when I get it.

Hand-made stuff is always such a nice gesture.
Gotta ask though- did you do the back as well? It would be the perfect spot to write a Happy Birthday message or explain that you got him a pre-order ot something in the same style as a back cover listing off features."
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Why didn't you just print a cover off ??
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,What a thoughtful thing to do. 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Blatant fucking advertising.
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"u/datsraycists mentioned about putting a Shrek CD in the case.

Additionally, I would print a small leaflet with the text ""scan this QR code for a special surprise ;)"" and the QR code should be a Rickroll."
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"I think that this man has both Red Dead Redemption 2 and a girlfriend. I guess jealousy is the emotion at the forefront of my mind?

&#x200B;

It's nice tho"
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"No
"
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Dont reply to this 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,You stole his karma
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Break up with him and take me. Pls.

You bring amazing thoughtful surprises and I got all the tendies you could ever want. Now that‚Äôs on the table, sorry to ruin your birthday in advance, now-thoughtful-chick‚Äôs ex bf, I‚Äôll be taking that game and the beautiful drawing and ya girl. 

In all seriousness, that‚Äôs a great surprise. This game looks awesome. I‚Äôm not really much of a gamer, but this looks like next level stuff that will probably resurrect my inner gamer and I‚Äôll get those feels I haven‚Äôt had for a game since Zelda Ocarina of Time. Good job."
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"I saw a comment about how you were together since you were 16, how old are you right now, because I‚Äôm wondering if life long relationships can happen from such a young age (I‚Äôm 16 and scared of starting a relationship because I don‚Äôt want to hurt a girl if I end up breaking up). Thanks for replying and your boyfriend is a lucky man. "
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Congratulations on getting married! :p
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,You are a goddamn legend and a catch.  (It would probably be a good idea if you didn't look at his browser history for the next couple months cause his ass best be RING SHOPPING.)
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"If he doesn't like it, Reddit does.

Welcome to my feed/front page xD"
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Yep, this is pretty romantic. Great effort!"
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Ok now this is epic
"
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Some one is ring on the finger worthy 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,You are an awesome gf. Wish my wife did shit like this for me.
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"If he doesn‚Äôt replace the cover insert of the actual game with this, he‚Äôs not a keeper. "
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,That's the cutest fucking thing I've seen all year! What a lucky guy. 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,You are amazing! One million points to House of Kelly Christine! 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,You're a keeper! Sure he will appreciate. Kudos to all girlfriends like you.
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"You‚Äôre a good woman and he‚Äôs a lucky man.

Awesome gift!"
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"1. Love the nails.
2. If that gift doesn't make him smile, nothing will.
3. Should frame it and hang it somewhere after.  Too cool! Genuine thought out gift.  I love it and you should definitely put a little gag gift in there of some sort...maybe the soundtrack to the first or something."
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Let him bang your best friend...much better gift.
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,No I think he might actually break up with you if you give him this. You draw like a 3 year old with parkinsons. How did you ever graduate from kindergarten. Also you spelt xbox wrong. 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,My fianc√© leaves me little hand written notes and I appreciate every one of them. So I‚Äôm damn sure he‚Äôll love this. 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Not exactly 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Such a sweet gift. I'm sure he'd appreciate it a lot :)
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Thats So evil. 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"My wife gave me the same surprise, she printed out the receipt and handed it over to me casually!! Totally blew my mind!! "
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,The red dead vengeful eight.
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,That is such an adorable idea!
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Off topic I like your nails a lot! Very pretty
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,There better be an actual preorder of the game in there 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,its awesome 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,I fuckin‚Äô love it and it‚Äôs adorable. great job! :D
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,You're a keeper op!
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,That's awesome and a perfect post for your cake day! :D
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Bitter sweet. 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,10000% 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Sugoi
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,I see you got him the eu version. Very nice 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,I woulda payed extra for an alternate cover like that!
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,It is very good and plus it is the effort that counts. I sincerely wish he likes it.
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Haooy cake day OP,  anyway that looks amazing "
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the thought that counts‚Äù
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Get ready for a marriage proposal!!!
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Expect a ring from him very soon.
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Thanks!
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Perfect! I did the same for a friend with GTA5. It was such an early pre-order though I had to make up the box art and story blurb for the back.

My theory that Tommy and CJ were in it was wrong."
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,That's showbiz baby 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,He‚Äôll appreciate the effort I‚Äôm sure :)
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Very sweet.
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,You just proposed.! Hope he says yes!
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Are you serious that is so adorable! He's going to love it!

Edit: Happy Cake Day OP!"
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"I‚Äôm sure with those nails, he wouldn‚Äôt mind some head/back scratches. "
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,11/10. 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Effort is more important than a gift - The fact someone spend time thinking about me is insane
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"I'd rather a funny gift over anything, to be honest. If I needed something, I could always get it myself. Something that's more memorable is a lot better because you can't just go and buy it."
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,what is that green on top of that? 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,If he really is your bf then it shouldn't matter
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Honestly, that‚Äôs so cute and creative haha there‚Äôs no way he won‚Äôt absolutely love this. "
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,This is amazing. 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Really awesome . At least you get what he's into
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,That's awesome hes for sure gonna love it!
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,10/10 would order this version..
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Leave him and marry me.

On a serious note, beyond thoughtful, his stoke should be nothing short of grandiose. "
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Love you for that 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,That looks great!
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Awesome girlfriend being awesome!
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,That's super sweet. That's all I wanted to say :) 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Heel love it
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"If my girlfriend is giving me that, I'll marry her immediately.. Unfortunately, I don't have a girlfriend yet!"
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Nails on point
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"I wish I had someone like you in my life, it's beautiful and if he doesn't like it he doesn't deserve you "
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,You're definitely getting the good sex for this!
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,What a fantastic girlfriend :-D
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,u/kellychristine happy cake day to you!
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Puke Rainbows
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,He'll love it
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,This is great 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Wife material right here. Get you someone that puts this much thought and love behind their actions and you'll live happily ever after 

Edit: it's a two way street, not just give and not just take."
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,This is pretty legit! I'm sure he'll be thrilled!
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Yea that's amazing. My girlfriend does cute stuff like this from time to time and it makes all the difference. Good job!
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Definitely a cool girlfriend, great gift, & sweet drawing cover, but you do realize starting 10/26-? you will not see him do anything but play that game.  "
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,I think he has the best gf ever
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,would u like to be my gf lol
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Your boyfriend is a lucky man. 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,That man needs to wife you. 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Amazing! Such a good idea!
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"If I get together (also LDR, like OP) with the person I'm trying for, I'll do something similar, awesome idea! "
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Plot twist: There's a download pre order code inside
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,That's so cool!
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Unrelated but i like your nails. Also, you‚Äôre a talented artist. :)"
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"This is how a birthday present is done. The time, thought, and effort put into this make THIS a memorable birthday for sure. I guarantee the fact that you had him in mind with such a gift means more that getting the game.
P.S.: It may not be ""perfect"", but you did a damn fine job on the art work. 15/10 for best B-Day gift. Good on ya!

Edit: I never got a reply....üòî"
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,You might as well go ahead and put a goodbye letter in there as well cause once the game release he gone. 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,10/10 my new plan 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Shrek is Love, Shrek is Life. "
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Remember to start singing Smashmouth loudly to him as he opens it. 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Jokes on you that‚Äôs an even better gift 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,That‚Äôs my comment of the week
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,The world really is gonna roll him
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,I need to tell my sister about this idea for her boyfriend. Though I think he'd like it even more with Shrek in it lol.
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Shrek is love
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Put a copy of [Oregon Trail](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oregon_Trail_(1971_video_game)) in it.
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Somebody once told me
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Shrek is love
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"An old friend recently got married, our friend group has always been much into gaming, and in our youth played a lot of World of Warcraft.

As a part of his wedding gift we bought him the new WoW expansion - ""The Battle for Azeroth"" and replaced the CD inside with Brokeback Mountain. Hilarious roller coaster of emotions and laughs from both parties followed! "
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Hopefully he feels the same! 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Same!
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Ugh I know. :((
We‚Äôre long distance already so it‚Äôs cool. "

9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,But do you at least get to scramble her eggs?? 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Oh my 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Mine stopped putting the bacon in the shape of my age when I turned 50.
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Maybe that‚Äôs cause you call it _a egg_
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Can I offer you an egg in this trying time?
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Haha, not one egg. Bless. Let me know closer to the time and I'll post you a cooked egg, anyway you like."
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Can I offer you an egg in these trying times? 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,I really wanted pancakes for my birthday breakfast :(. They're not hard to make and I asked for them in advance.  Wife wouldn't do it.  I got up and made them instead.  She had no problem eating them.  Sigh.
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"I bet she would but she doesn't know that is important to you. 

Im Sure you will prove me wrong but a big factor in bad relationships is lack of effective 
communication"
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Nothing better than having two copies of the same game!
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,How sweet!
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,That‚Äôs so kind. Thank you very much 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Here‚Äôs hoping!

Edit: downvotes? "

9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Ugh. Take your up vote.
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,I did! Thank you! 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Yay!

9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Yeah, just feels like self approval. Like obviously it's not bad, do you really need all of Reddit to pat you on the back and say good job?"

9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Better yet put a copy or the Shrek bootleg in there, from the people who have seen Shrek; that'll make for one interesting experience!"
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"afterwards when you get the gaem, swap the discs. so when he opens the new one, its going to have shrek in it and the old one will have RDR2 in it, just tk fuck with him"
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Even better: tell him you preordered it. Then, when you receive it, give him this same case with the disc of https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1663668/. Film him, and imho keep the video for you. Then give him the real disc."

9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"I'm very intorverted and I hate large parties. My cousin, who grew up impoverished, approached my mom saying that I would LOVE a surprise party with a limo ride to a casino. 

I was surprised but not happy about it because it was all of her friends. I guess my mom doesn't know me that well. I had to ride in this limo with a BUNCH of StINKY boys and I couldn't get into the casino because she stole my"" 21 years old"" crown and my ID wasn't renewed. 

Maybe it was my fault. I should have expected a *surprise* party and got a new ID... 

Fun facts: 
She fucked, or fooled around with, 3 guys that night

One of the guys was a distant cousin... not by marriage. 

I never had more than a beer

I cleaned up everything after the night was over because I was up helping her cope with whoreness

She now calls me spoiled because I didn't appreciate what my mom did for *me*"

Problem being, I totally forgot which one; might tweet at him just to ask and see."
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,It seems you stirred up the pervos.
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,These replies are just sad.

9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"I used to have something similar, also thinking she was the love of my life. 2 year LDR and then we finally started to live together and 6 months ago we ended right before 4th anniversary. My Opnion: Being at distance is way different than actually being close, I hope it works out for you though :) "
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,That's great! My wife and I fell in love at 16... 22 years ago. 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Aw, so cute! I met my boyfriend online in high school and he moved across the country for me after graduation, 2 years later. We‚Äôve been together in person for 5 years now. It‚Äôs sooo worth the wait and occasional sadness ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,Oof. I'm sorry to hear that dude. :(
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"girl speaking here(lol) wanted to share your pain. I feel its worse when it's someone you met first online rather than in person. I was in an ldr for 4 years with a dude and things started crumbling when he suggested opening the relationship and I got carried away. It was also my first year of uni so of course things got out of hand. 

Me and the boyf did meet bi annually and for the most part it was good, even staying around for a couple of months. But when you're away from them, you build up a persona of what they're like in your mind and you're always a little let down when you're together. And that's what ended mine, the fact that I felt more comfortable with people at uni than whenever I was with him.

I feel that the best thing to do in these situations is to have a month long holiday with them. But in really sorry you had to go through all the hassle of moving only to find out it wasn't going to work out. :( "
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Sorry to hear that, shit happens. Gladly we have seen every corner of our best and worse before making the decision of living together, and I hope things go well :)"

9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,There are 2 (troll?) replies with about 200 down votes and 10 comments complaining about them. Typical Reddit comment section.
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"Long distance relationship for 3 and a half years and now we've been living together for 2 years and just bought a house together. Everyone's different, but if you love them it's always worth the chance :)"
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,"On the flip side of this response: my wife and I went to high school together and didn't get together until the summer after she graduated college. The first year of our relationship was long distance enough that we could only go see the other person if we carved an entire weekend out of our schedules. She moved back for a new position closer to where she grew up, lived together for a while, married last month :)"
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,I just got one for the first time and I freaked out like a little kid 
9l97pd,2018-10-04,2018-10-04,I love my gift. Can‚Äôt wait to open it and act surprised. You should have told me to ignore reddit for a while babe! I still appreciate it a lot.

z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,So like wtf actually happened to red? Everyone thought he was uncle cause of the glove but i doubt thats the case.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,#AINT YA NEVER SEEN A MAN IN A BARREL AFORE???
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Not quite, Red Dead Redemption is a successor not a sequel."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Not quite. Revolver is treated as ""folk lore"" in RDR1. IIRC, in RDR1 you can sit by a campfire with a couple of NPC's and they'll be talking about Revolver like it's a legend almost."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Hoo boy, let me tell you about the numbering the Kingdom Hearts series. It starts with KH3 being the 13th game in the series."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,I think anyone who's played them all would disagree
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,And GTA V is really GTA VII. what's your point?
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,John Marston is that you!!
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"GTA V 'online' is the sequel to them all...  I assume \~90% players picked John as their great, great, granddad."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Shout out to my dad who was the actor who did the motion capture for Red. Unfortunately he isn‚Äôt very good at video games so he never got to play through this whole game. (Same with GTA Vice City, he mo-capped/voiced 8 total characters but couldn‚Äôt play well enough to actually GET TO his parts). They even named a main villain in RDRev after my Dad during production!"
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Red Dead Revolver came out in 2004, when I was 13. For whatever reason, I always loved this one the most of the 3 Red Dead games that have come out. I think the arcade style shooting and the villains in the game were very well done. Loved the ""Battle Royale"" scene as well. I'm 31 years old now and I can confidently say this was one of the best Playstation 2 games I've ever played."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Everyone knows that Gun was RDR before RDR
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Red Dead 3: Redemption 2 makes RD3R2


Sounds like a robot from Star Wars rather than a cowboy videogame"
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Since I'm here, does anyone remember the game Gun? Western PS2 game that I got this mixed up with."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,I loved this game! Would probably be clunky as hell to play now though.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Revolver is in another ""universe/timeline"". Otherwise you  almost had it OP, Read dead 2 is actually red dead 1"
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Only us OGs really know.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Let‚Äôs see two games end with redemption and one ends with revolver.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,The bullets for that revolver are some long skinny mfers
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Also originally a capcom game until rockstar bought the rights and studio and rebranded it.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Fun fact: 1/4th of Revolver was backwards compatible on the Xbox 360. It was advertised as being playable, but it had an unavoidable crash that happened when trying to defeat Bad Bessie, meaning the game was unbeatable."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,It's on xbox backwards compatability and it looks amazing on series x
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Dan Houser said Revolver is in its own universe so can't be a sequel if Redemption and Revolver aren't in the same universe
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Not really, I do like the theory that uncle is red tho"

z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth is gonna have the same problem.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"I honestly don't think anyone even counts that game. Kinda like the original GTA. Sure, it's there, but has nothing to do with anything."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Real ones remember GUN. 

I still remember when I picked up the peacemaker."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Yeah, but, Red Dead Revolver doesn‚Äôt have the redeeming qualities."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"I don‚Äôt count Revolver. It was a Capcom game that Rockstar jumped in and finished midway through, and as a result it feels more like a Capcom game"
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,I remember being disappointed it was named RDR2.  I was hoping for Red Dead Retribution or Revolution.  RDR2 is a great game tho.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Can't wait for Super Mario Bros 4
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"It's actually not, red dead redemption has a complete different title but it's number 2 in the red dead series. There's 3 red dead's but 2 red dead redemption's"
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Gun on the 360 was incredible for me as a kid! I still remember the 8 barrel shotgun you got at the end for beating the boss.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Red Dead Revolver is actually the second in the series, the first was titled Red Dead I fondly remember watching my father play through when I was young, we rented the first one on Xbox and my father enjoyed it and seeked out revolver which was easier to find and much better

Redemption and Redemption 2 are linked to the story but aren't direct sequels in any manor"
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,What about Red Dead Reloaded? Wasn‚Äôt that the actual sequel to Red Dead Revolver?
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,XRP?
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Amazing game, one of my favorites, it was the first game I had in a real console. My father bought for himself when I was 7 and it was the only game we had for a long time, but that didn't matter. We enjoyed the story and my dad always played with me and help me with the levels I couldn't complete by myself. We loved to play duels and the 2 player mode with my older siblings too, although my father always won haha.
I know nobody asked me but I just remembered this game (I'm now 25) and how much I loved playing it with my father, eventually as the years passed by, my father started having problem with his visions so we stopped playing, but at the same time I was 13 and rarely played with the ps2 
It's always been a dream of my to show my father the new read dead on a ps4 just to see his reaction (he loves cowboy stuff), but alas I can't afford a ps4 rn"
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Does anyone else remember Outlaws on PC? I think it was a Lucasarts game. I remember watching my dad play it as well and it scared the shit out of me.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Man I loved this game when I was younger! I‚Äôd love it even more if they ever made a remake.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Also RDR2 isn‚Äôt the same as R2D2, no matter how many times I read it, I read it as R2D2."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,I‚Äôm gonna make mincemeat outta you.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,PC port when
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,And it started out as a Capcom game before Rockstar bought the game concept. This isn't a joke.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Doesn‚Äôt rdr 2 technically come before rdr?
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"No it isn't. You wouldn't call Metal Gear Survive, Metal Gear Solid 6, same as you don't call Red Dead Redemption Red Dead Revolver 2.

Different universes"
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,One of my favorites PS 2 games.  Now i want to play it again!
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Duel time was fantastic.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-27,Just a reminder Red Dead Redemption 2 is the sequel to Red Dead redemption 1. So it's named accordingly.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-27,remake intensified!
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,This game is so epic! Nostalgia hittin‚Äô rn
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,RDR2 is on sale right now for $20 on the Xbox store. I think it's time to buy.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"No it isn't, Red Dead Revolver ain't canon to Red Dead Redemption"
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Red dead revolver isn't canon. Red dead redemption is just the successor.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Technically, no. Red Dead Redemption isn't a direct continuation of Revolver. It's more like a successor to the series.  


I remember losing my shit when Rockstar called it RDR2 but eventually calmed down and realized any sort of tag-name isn't as catchy. Calling it 3 would stir confusion and in reality Revolver just serves as like an 'Inspiration' if anything.  


People tend to forget this, but Rockstar actively divides their games in universes. For Grand Theft Auto you've got the 3D and Cinematic Universes. The 3D Universe contains of titles like GTA 3, Vice City, and San Andreas (+ a few more I'm forgetting) while the Cinematic Universe is currently GTA 4 + GTA 5).  


So with that logic, RDR2 *should* be 3 but Rockstar doesn't consider Revolver part of the universe. At best it's basically just turned into a folktale in the universe of RDR."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"The names are Red Dead Revolver, Red Dead Redemption and Red Dead Redemption 2. 
it‚Äôs not rocket science or a talking point in any way."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Incorrect. Revolver happens in the same part of the world, but in a different game universe. Red Harlow is treated as nothing more than a myth in RDR1 with a couple Easter Eggs referencing him. Revolver isn‚Äôt canon to Redemption, and isn‚Äôt considered part of the Redemption series by Rockstar. Redemption was basically a spiritual successor and was certainly inspired by Revolvers story and game play, but they are separate stories."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,No.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,What an obvious and pointless reminder.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Actually the full title is Red Dead Redemption 2: Revolver 3: Port of Call New Orleans
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,This is not historically accurate.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Not really Red Dead Redemption is a spiritual successor of Red Dead Revolver
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Except it‚Äôs not, nice try though"
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Spiritual successor not a sequel
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,No it isn't
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"I remember when I was a kid and didn't understand the difference between consoles and generations, my friend had a Xbox 360 while I had a PS2, I used to hang out in his house and he played Red Dead Redemption, I asked my parents to buy the game cause I wanted to play it too and they brought me Red Dead Revolver, I was so sad it wasn't the same"
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,OP is making shit up lmao
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Red dead 2 is a prequel tho, so technically red dead 1 is red dead 3 and red dead revolver is red dead 1.."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"No it isn't.

Red Dead Revolver and the Red Dead Redemption Series are two separate things.

silly thing to say"
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Misconception

Revolver is a standalone game, and the RDR saga is a spiritual successor."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,My grandpa would always misspeak and call rdr red dead revolver. Thought it was just a mistake on his part but apparently it was a real thing.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Red Dead Redemption 3 should take place like in the 1920s or whatever.  But its just a book that Jack Marston is writing.  Which he is also narrating the story.  The book takes place in Revolver's time.  Essentially a sequel, prequel, or remake.  Good way to do another Revolver game."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Technically true, Read Dead 2 and Red Dead Redemption 2 are two different things"
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Almost as confusing as goat simulator 3
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Is worth to play?
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Ok. So?
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"it's literally called Red Dead Redemption 2

so no"
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,so in that case gun from Activision is the REAL first red dead
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Uncle looks great there.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,I've never played red dead revolver
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,It still annoys me that the sequel is a prequel with a 2 in the title
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Red Dead Revolver, Red Dead 2, Red Dead 1"
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Eh, more like a spinoff. I don't think they even make reference to Revolver. They could have at least put the legendary revolver in the game"
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Battlefield be like: 

*You guys go in some kind of numerical order?*"
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Yes!! Fuck the naysayers cuz they don‚Äôt mean a thing cuz this what style we bring
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Nope.

For example: There was ""Call Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare"" and then you got ""Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2"". Different series.

I'm talking about the old ones, btw."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Will forever remain a hipster game...nostalgic youtubers and collectors...
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"I played the shit out of Red Dead Redemption and Red Dead Redemption 2 so when I found Red Dead Revolver on the PS4 store I bought it. I lasted about 20 minutes playing it, it is absurdly dated and the gameplay is pretty bad. I'm so glad they made the sequels closer to GTA3 style gameplay."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,I don‚Äôt think so. Just because its Red Dead doesnt mean it‚Äôs Red Dead
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Remember what they took from us...

Red dead Revenge"
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,So RDR2 is actually Red Dead 3 Redemption 2 or RD3R2
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Still the biggest fuckup in modern gaming history to not name RDR2 something better.  


Red Dead Revenge.  
Red Dead Resurrection.  
Red Dead Retaliation.  
Red Dead Retribution.  
Red Dead Requiem."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,I didn‚Äôt even know!
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,ACKKTUALLY nobody cares
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"People here are missing the point that you can't call Red Dead Redemption 2 ""Red Dead 2"" because it's in fact not the 2nd Red Dead game."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,I just realised by seeing the scars of this man that it's John Marston on the cover
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Funfact: Uncle from RdR2 & 1 is the main protagonist of RD:Revolver.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Red Dead Revolver is more of a spiritual successor then a sequel
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Gun is the first one, and the Red Dead games are the knock offs. Lol"
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,I remember you could play as an indian.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,O just same shit different package
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,RDR goated game don‚Äôt @ me
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,The multiplayer in this was so much fun
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,And God of War 4 is like 9th
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,RDR is basically a reboot it doesn't have a whole lot in common with that first game besides being westren theme'd. The first one was definitely great game for it's time though but more along the lines of a linear tradition shooter rather than expansive open world game.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"They were going to call it Red Dead Revolver: Redemption but some people thought it was a joke. 
[Hardy har har](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YWn04N3M7z0)"
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Not quite but quite, but no for real even though it‚Äôs not Red Is still mentioned in both and you can play as him in online on rdr1. Also found a npc model named Red Harlow in a trainer on PC not sure if it was suppose to be him or not."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,no that's clash of clans : cowboys edition
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,The big iron on his hiiiiiiiip
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Dsmn i miss playing red dead revolver. So much fun
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Loved the showdown sequences.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Always thought Red Dead Retribution would have been a cool title that kept the style going
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Okay what does that make Modern Warfare 2?
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,I remember playing split screen multi-player on this with my buddies for hours
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Revolver is one of the earliest memories I have playing it with my biological father. Still one of my favorite games of all time
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,A remaster if this would be amazing!
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"This is like saying Pulp Fiction is the third Kill Bill movie. Kill Bill is real within Kill Bill but outside of Kill Bill (Pulp Fiction) it's just a television series. The same is true of Revolver, except they had folk legends/stories back in Redemption's day instead of television."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Now do Modern Warfare series‚Ä¶
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Well no shit
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Had that on ps2
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"And Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is actually 3, the second Xenoblade Chronicles is X."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Why am I being reminded of this?
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Forgot about this game and I loved it.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Or red dead redemption is red dead redemption because that's what it is called.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Isn‚Äôt it Red Dead Revolver
Red Dead Redemption
And Red Dead Redemption 2 

It‚Äôs the second Red Dead Redemption"
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Randy Travis?
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Bro wtf I didn‚Äôt even know this game came out. I feel like I missed an important part of my childhood.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Pig Josh was my favorite bad guy from that game.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,El Tejon!
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,This game is elite
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,You mean like how Jedi Academy is actually Dark Forces 4: Jedi Academy?
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Red Dead Redemption 2: First blood part 3:Third blood
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,I was obsessed with this and Gun. What an era for legit western games.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"I will say I liked the quick draw minigame in Revolver. 

The final enemy in that tournament was damn hard to I remember. Me and my cousin planned out where to place the shots for the best chance of beating the guy."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,So the three way multiplayer shootouts in revolver were the best. If you went too fast and missed your gun your guy would just stare at his empty hand while everyone else blasted away at you.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Thanks, I desperately needed this reminder."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Also, this was originally a Gunsmoke reboot contract from Capcom, but they dropped the idea and Rockstar went on alone."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,I love piG Josh
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,THE FIRST ONE IS HANDS DOWN THE BEST GAME AND THE FUCKING MP WAS AMAZING!!!!
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Me when I spread misinformation

The devs have directly stated that revolver takes place in a different universe"
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Also don't forget that Red Dead Revolver was originally being developed by Capcom.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,I scalped everything at age 8
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,I was obsessed with that game when I was little
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Is it a good game? Should I try it? I played both RDD and RDD2 and loved them
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,I LOVED this game. Idc what you say.. this was the best red dead.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Then, GTA V should actually be GTA XIII"
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,This post gave me lumbago
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Such a classic
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Who asked?
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"3D Universe Red Dead and HD Universe Red Dead
Which fits nicely with the references the HD universe has to the 3D one, further supporting Revolver as a legend more than anything"
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,The music in this is dope. Trip hop western.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Imma looking at a dead man!!!
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Poker was one of the best game modes I've ever played
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,YIPPE AY YAY!
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,My friend Matt ate a raw egg to get out of school for a week to play this game. This game was a damn good time as a 7th grader. Man life was smooth sailing back then
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"The only thing I remember from this game is one of the characters say's ""I'm gonna kill you and use you to wipe ma be-hind"" when you pick him in multiplayer."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,But how can I play Revolver?
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"See I played GUN, but never got the chance to play this one."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Literally me seeing a big spider
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Playing red dead revolver caused me to sleep on red dead redemption
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,That‚Äôs BS like saying metal gear solid is actually metal gear 3 because there were 2 metal gears before
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,I loved them both
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Lies
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Also a little unknow fact about the series is that it was once owned by Capcom. https://www.denofgeek.com/games/red-dead-revolver-capcom/#:~:text=Rockstar%20Games%20then%20acquired%20the,team%20at%20once."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,I mean not really. If I remember right Revolver was a goofy arcade shooter with clowns and stuff rebuilt off a failed Capcom project. I would consider Redemption a rebrand/reboot. Which now that I think about it makes the title of the game even more fitting.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Red Dead 3: Red Dead Redemption 2

z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Loved this game.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"I enjoyed the first one when I rented it, but it was rough. GUN was better."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,This has been known for at least 4 years
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,And Gun was better in every way.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,It'd be sick if Jack Marston eventually becomes the outlaw Red in the alternate universe that is RD2. Like a nickname put on wanted posters or something. Idk.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Was not a fan of this game personally. I always though Gun was a way better game that came out around the same time.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"I'm legitimately disappointed the third one won't called something else with an R.

Revenge, Rampage, Rising, Revolution, Renegade, Ransom, Rince Repeat..


I get the Redemption II is also about someone redeeming themselves from being a baddie to a more morally grey/goodish  person but still.

THEME naming dangit"
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Hahaha 

Ooralee"
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Why is gta vice city and san andreas not named gta 4 and 5 then?
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Okay, now number the Rambos"
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,JUST ONE MORE SCORE
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,What about Ps2 game GUN? It's kinda similar. Maybe they are related?
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Just a reminder that Soul Calibur is actually Soul Blade 2.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,A CLASSIC
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Sure but Red Dead Redemption is still Red Dead Redemption 1 and Red Dead Redemption 2 is still Red Dead Redemption 2.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,WHAT ARE YOU DOIN TO MY PAWTS AND PANS
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,We know bru

z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Anyone remember the western game on the SNES? It was also an arcade game before that. You could play 2 player, scrolling shooter with some jumping involved. Loved that game so much!"

z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,I remember hoping that they were going to call it Red Dead Retribution just to keep the naming convention going
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Not the most confusingly titled series, at least."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Just picked rdr2 on Thursday and love it
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Wouldn‚Äôt it be the third as red dead 2 is the prequel
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,The best one too.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"TNT, why couldn't it be bacon and beans"
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Kind of? I am not sure they are within the same canon, but if they are, red dead revolver is still its own thing, and red dead redemption is another.

Kind of like with monster hunter and monster hunter stories.

Monster hunter world is monster hunter 5, as it is the next installment in the mainline franchise, and the baseline for 5th gen, monster hunter stories is not a continuation of the mainline saga, so when it got a sequel it was correctly called Monster Hunter Stories 2.

In the same vein, RD revolver is very different from Red dead redemption, so they might be part of the same Intellectual Property, but not the same line of games as RD redemption is not a sequel. RDR2 is a sequel in the sense that it is the next installment of the same series as Red Dead Redemption. (though not chronically, it is a prequel in that sense)"
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Great Game!!
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Fun game but Gun was much better
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Anyone remember Gun?
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Yes the forgotten game
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"I like to think that the story of Red Dead Revolver actually happened in the universe. But the telling and way it‚Äôs played out in the actual game is an exaggeration to some extent of the events. Kind of like the old penny Wild West books with artwork of the time that had real characters in it like Wild Bill, Jesse James, etc but often bolstered their actual actions or took some artistic liberty for more publicity. This is why Red Dead Revolver has a more cinematic and stylized vision especially in its artwork, graphics, and gameplay. And the other two are more gritty and real westerns following outlaws and the downfall of the Wild West.

This is shown further in Red Dead Redemption. As around a few campfires there‚Äôs Easter eggs of people sharing stories about Red Harlow and how he avenged his parents deaths. But how he‚Äôs since faded into memory and no one has seen or heard from him in decades. Almost like an old tall tale."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"*Chuckles *  so that would make ""red dead redemption 2"" into ""red dead 2 2""?"
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Red Dead Redemption, the Pre-Sequel"
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Got this game in my original Xbox collection, still need to give it a try sometime"
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Metal Gear Solid V is actually Metal Gear 13
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,That's why I was a little upset that they didn't keep up with the naming scheme. They called it that instead of something like Red Dead Retribution or Red Dead Revolution or something. Wasted potential.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"i remember playing this when i was young, it was incredibly challenging lol"

z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Yeah but they are entirely different games, the only vague similarity between them is the dead eye mechanic that you use to shoot stuff.

Redemption in no way continues any narrative threads from Revolver."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,And Red Dead Redemption 2 is the 3rd part
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Not a super great game lol.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,No.

His name is Red, his family is Dead and he has a Revolver.

Also loved Revolver. I missed all the very out there, thematic villains you fough like Pig Josh and that fire guy."

z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-27,Red dead redemption was absolutely bonkers to me and my friends when we were younger.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-27,And since red dead redemption II is really a prequel does that mean it‚Äôs actually a Red Dead Revolver Remake?
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-27,I finished this game this year! Not bad actually.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-27,"I honestly hate how Red dead redemption 2 is called ""2"" despite being a canonical prequel. They should have stuck with the tradition of ""R"" word subtitles. 
Maybe they could have called RDR2 Red dead resolution, or Red dead reconciliation, or something."

z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-27,"red dead redemption is red dead redemption, and red dead revolver is red dead revolver. there is no red dead, the red dead part was just borrowed to make a separate game with a similar premise and red dead revolver is merely referenced in rdr2 as folklore."

z534ey,2022-11-26,2023-02-09,Played this at the same time as Strangers Wrath and have very odd crossover memories of both games.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Rockstar have confirmed it‚Äôs a different universe. The characters in Red Dead Redemption are *aware* of Red Harlow, and the events of Revolver, but only as a fictional folk tale. 

Like Paul Bunyan. A folk legend. 

Basically Rockstar liked the concept in Red Dead Revolver but wanted to redo it all into a better and more immersive storytelling arc. 

However I think Uncle *is* an Easter egg, a reference to Red Harlow but not implicitly him. Just someone who could be Red if you squint hard enough and ignore the terminal lumbago."

EDIT: (apparently, I completely misunderstood everything.  That is my mistake)"
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Which would make sense from a storytelling standpoint in that era i feel. Feels like a good way to canonize and distance yourself from something at the same time
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"I think it was in some of the in-game RDR1 newspapers, too."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,So that‚Äôs why Red can jump 10 feet into the air
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,There's also some details relating to Uncle that indicate he is possibly the protagonist from Revolver.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Jack talks to John about him too
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,I like to think it's the same Javier he just changed his last name as a cover up.

z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,I enjoyed 1 and 2 when they came out and KH3 robbed me of any joy to be had.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Can't even count how many times the number 13 comes up in KH.  Such a coincidence that 13 comes up every time. I get it, you need that many vessels for darkness,  for Xehanort. But when the first game, back at 2002, zooms into the 13th letter of the alphabet,  with all of the other references following,  you would think it was all planned from the start."

GTA 1, GTA 2, GTA London 1969, GTA 3 (4), Vice city (5), San Andreas (6), Liberty City stories (7). Vice city stories (8), GTA IV (9), The Lost and Damned (10), The Ballard of Gay Tony (11), Chinatown wars (12), GTA V (13)."

z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Gun is the more racist RDR haha. You thought it's bad in RDR? Well, there is always something worse. Pretty fun gameplay though. 

Although Gun (Nov 2005) did come after RDR (May 2004)."

z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Gun was really good! Really the only western game to compare to the Red Dead franchise.

z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,It was a launch title for the 360 as well
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Gun was awesome

z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Well and the fact that revolver is a sequel to Red Dead
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,They all end with revolvers in some form
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Three games start with Red Dead.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"To be fair the actual first one was just titled red dead, revolver was the sequel, also Redemption wasn't intended as a sequel so much as a successor but they are all linked"

z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Did they fix it ever?
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,If you put your console to the lowest visual setting it works fine with zero issues. Maybe 720p but I forgot if that worked.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,There‚Äôs a digital version of ‚ÄúRed Dead Revolver‚Äù available for the Xbox 360. I might be wrong but I think this version was created last year alongside the Xbox One version. I haven‚Äôt played the 360 digital version yet but I would be curious to see if it too has the Bad Bessie crash.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,I've never heard that universe consistency is required for sequels.  That means GTAIV isn't a sequel to GTAIII.  And Final Fantasy VII isn't a sequel to Final Fantasy VI.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Op is wrong but not for this reason. It‚Äôs simply because they dont share the same name lol, that‚Äôs pretty much the only requirement for a ‚Äú1,2,3‚Äù sequel title"

But Red Dead 3 which was previously Red Dead 2 is actually Red Dead 2 because it's set between Red Dead 1 which was previously Revolver and Red Dead 2 which was previously Redemption 1. See? Simple.

z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,And revolver has a whole different vibe to it. Its much more fantasy based with alot of like old west style monsters and stuff in what look like nightmares. I haven't played the game but this is what I hear from those that have.

The bugs in multiplayer were the real treat though. Lassoing somebody as Holstein Hal in certain situations would bug out so the lasso would always follow them even after they died. In the duel mode there was a way to glitch the guy with the casket on his back to turn so only the casket faced the enemy and they couldn‚Äôt hit you lol."

z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Technically it's not as aside from location names nothing is the same over from the GTA 3/VC/SA trilogy, GTA 4 is a reboot of the franchise."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"> How is GTA 4 a sequel to GTA 3

It isn't.

3D universe is separate from HD universe."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"The same way that GTA4 isn't GTA6 because GTA: Vice City and San Andreas exist. GTA Chinatown Wars came after that, which also isn't GTA: 5."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"A sequel happens in the same universe as its predecessor. Red Dead Revolver is part of the same *series of games* as Redemption and Redemption 2, but since it's set in a separate universe, it's not a sequel or prequel."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Because the devs said so, mostly."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-27,Or how MWF2 (2022) is actually COD 17: MWF5 ?
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"its just numbering. like how Fast 9 would be Fast 10 if they counted Hobbs & Shaw, but they count Tokyo Drift (which is also a Fast&Furious Presents). Or how Far Cry Primal wasnt far cry 5."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"RDR and Revolver were made the same people. GTA 4 and 3 were  also made by the *same* people.

Edit: I was so wrong and fixed the mistake"
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,and Redemption came after Revolver...
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Successor. Revolver came out in 2004, Redemption came out in 2010."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"no, successor. rdr came out after and basically just built off the concept of revolver"
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"They are pointing out that while it came after, it wasn't part of the same series."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,i mean he's not. thats just a popular Joke theory. He doesn't have the scars  that Red harlow has. he doesn't have Reds iconic Red Glove hiding his Scorpion Shaped Scar he got in the beginning of Revolver. etc. The only Proof that theory has is that Uncle said he was called the One shot kid in his youth and that their heads are a similar shape.

z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,The Metal Gear series is fairly straightforward by comparison‚Ä¶then again most series are compared to Kingdom Hearts
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Metal Gear is really simple, the only thing is that 3 and 5 are prequels to the Were you play as the antagonist of the NES games."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Yeah, like the most I can say is that they sure did stitch up most of those dangling plot threads. But 2 felt like it had so much more to it than 3, and that‚Äôs not even counting Final Mix."

z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"London 1969, 1961, Lost and Damned and Ballad of Gay Tony are expansions. Didn't really count LCS, VCS and Chinatown Wars because of their portable nature."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"This is the least true of them all. Dark Souls 1, 2, and 3 take place in the same universe, Demons Souls, Bloodborne and Elden Ring are all completely separate entities. Otherwise you should have said the Elden Ring is King's Field 9 or Metal Wolf Chaos 7."

Red Dead Revolver, on the other hand, was very colorful and had memorable missions."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,I think the RDR here is mentioning Redemption

z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"No, although it turns out someone did actually find a workaround for it and you can find it on Game FAQs. For some reason, the game crashes if Bessie gets too close to the player.


Backwards compatibility on the 360 had these little bugs because it wasn't authentic comparability and all original Xbox games were basically being emulated with software. For some reason, Xbox never updated/fixed it for Red Dead: Revolver."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,So Bad Bessie was such a bad bitch that the Xbox 360 couldn't process her up close and crashed? Lmao
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Final Fantasy VII isn't a sequel to Final Fantasy VI. This is why X-2 was such a big deal when it came out; it was the first sequel.

Patriots were behind all the events but turns out Big Boss was one of the founders but he kills Zero. Meanwhile Fox, Foxhound, Xof, Diamond Dogs and Militaries Sans Frontieres were founded and destroyed. Also Snake (younger one but also known as Old Snake) has 2 brothers.

Do you only count the professional/NT versions, consumer versions only, or both? Are windows 3.1 and 98 SE counted as different versions than 3.0 and 98? What about the OEM only updated versions of 95 and 98? Where does Windows for Workgroups fit in? Do you even count windows 7&8? They're actually versions 6.1 and 6.2. What about the server versions?"

Doesn‚Äôt that mean 5 is GTA 14 then?"
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,Doesn‚Äôt matter. The expansions were still sold separately on disc as standalone games to GTA IV. And the portable games are still fully fledged titles with their own stories and contributions to them r respective lores.

z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"I experienced this multiple times and thought the disc I bought was bad lmao. I never really looked into it and had no idea it was due to this. I remember playing and thinking why does it keep crashing as soon as she approaches me?

Nevertheless, I was determined to find a way to finish this level. I decided to try and keep distance from her and camp behind a rock the entire fight, only peeking out to fire at her when she moves from cover. Eventually I noticed after some time her pathing it seems would sometimes bug out and she would get stuck in this weird loop where I could get off damage and could eventually win like that lol."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-27,I think that means Pig Josh is a bad bitch too. He used to crash the game‚Ä¶

Lots of slow mo dead eye stuff and fun boss fights that had quirks. Like I think one guy you had to shoot his guns out of his hand instead of just shooting him. And the hint was like ‚Äúembarrass‚Äù John the dumbass. And you just shoot his gun out of his hands a couple times till he gives up. One guy you had to shoot in like‚Ä¶ every joint and then the head. And you were running around a bunch of hedges and stuff. I remeber there being a bunch of cool shit and had a pvp mode that was like a free for all. 

I recall a flare rifle that would cause the target to be bombarded by cannons and as a kid that shit was fucking tight."
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-27,"I don't remember a monster specifically, but there was absolutely some supernatural shit.

z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"It's not. OP is full of shit. It was never marketed as a reboot at any stage. Plus a reboot typically would mean starting from 1 again. It's a sequel, clear as a sequel could be."

z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,yeah thats what it is in my head too. Honestly in my head canon the Game red dead revolver itself isn't  the actual event that transpired. But the Heavily altered Legend Spred by word of mouth.

z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Yeah, Bad Bessie is clearly designed with the idea that the player will be in her boss arena (so to speak). The problem is that most of the time she'll move towards you and crash the game, but AI pathing bugs are the saviour of same of Revolver's more unfair bosses like Pig Josh.


The difficulty progression is off, though. Pig Josh and Perry feel harder. Even the duel on the way up to Bessie is harder to beat than Bessie herself."

z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,So like a Call of Juarez: Gunslinger-style story?
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,I agree on all counts. 2.5 will always be the gameplay peak for me
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"Then you messed up and didn‚Äôt look deep enough. I also think the attraction rides and a couple other features are bad. 

The good thing is you can turn them off. You know what else? It makes the game better. It essentially turns the game back to KHII. At its core it‚Äôs still the same stuff.

On top of that, their DLC added a critical mode which is the hardest critical version of any KH game I‚Äôve played. I ended up having to turn on some of the extra attacks because the game was so hard I had to rely on literally every tool available. 


I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs the best in the series but it‚Äôs better than a lot of people give credit for simply because they didn‚Äôt get into it like the previous titles. I think it took me like 4 attempts before I committed to beating the game.

The best part for me are the mods. Custom finishers? Rolling animations? Keyblade attacks?"

z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"I never said the FF games were reboots, I just don't consider those games sequels, just like for Spiderman. It's not the exact same characters nor the same story. The major beats are there (dead parents, New York, Aunt May, Spider powers), but the stories are pretty varied from each other. Especially as theyre from different creative teams. Every Spiderman film and game series exists as if the prior ones never happened. They aren't connected or sequels of them. I don't consider Nolan's Batman films a sequel to Burton's Batman films. They just both exist separately. It's like baking a cake. Just because 3 people all have a recipe for a chocolate cake doesn't mean they'll turn out all be the same."

z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,You're strengthening my point that spider man are reboots. FF isn't the same in that it's not within even the same universe at times. But it can still be a sequel in that it is the next in a series. Just like call of duty or  need for speed. Core mechanics are there but not really the same story relation.
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"I highly recommend it. You can rebattle any of the 13 organization members, including Roxas, at any time, and theyre MUCH harder than before

Like, so much harder they punk sephiroth"
z534ey,2022-11-26,2022-11-26,"That is EXACTLY where I stopped twice. I love the setting but also agree that the level is drawn out.

My main gripe is the story being an on rails Disney experience with less original settings sprinkled in which it looks like we will see change with KH4.

Honestly I think that KH3 has the best boss battles and best ‚Äúendworld‚Äù setting. There are definitely a lot of pros to it‚Äôs existing cons."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"When the guy kicked in the door, I for sure would have shot him. "
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I'm hoping they've improved (tightened) the controls/movement in FPP view. In GTA V the player movement felt very floaty in FPP view. It felt like a tacked on feature because all the fancy inertial TPP animations just didn't translate well into FPP.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Reminds of Call of Juarez. Is that what that game is called? I honestly cant remember.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Bethesda's Skyrim: Westworld is looking good. I can't wait to dive in. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Fuck. Yes.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I‚Äôm going to pretend I‚Äôm William Munny from Missouri 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I saw a thing that this game is going to be over 100 gigs? Can anyone confirm this? 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,this and cyberpunk 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Is it me or you can‚Äôt aim down the sights ?
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"The first person mode in GTA V didn't feel right. I think these games have to be made to be a first-person in order for it to actually work well...idk, hopefully this one is different."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,[removed]
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,It's pretty sweet
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,First look at auto-aim improvement.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"I was really not expecting this for some reason. When they showed it in the trailer I felt like they just dropped a huge reveal. Or maybe it is, I don't know. But it's super cool!"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"This just makes me want a modern Outlaws.   Still one of the absolute best sound track ever to grace a game.

9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"How solid should the first person mode be? Will it be a legit way to play the game or will it be to awkward and unnatural, like Skyrim‚Äôs third person mode?"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,You could have posted a higher quality gif can barely see what it looks like in this.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,[deleted]
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Omg please make this VR compatible on PC.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Meh...I prefer 3rd person I like to look at my character that's just my opinion tho. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,im really about to buy a console just to play this game
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,60 FOV Yikes
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,More fov pwease 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Goddamn this game looks good 



The only thing that disappoints me is it seems like they went with the gta 5 style rag doll physics rather than gta 4 or the original red deads which felt like a downgrade to me but it‚Äôll still be great regardless "
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,[deleted]
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"I'm totally going to have to buy a new PS4 hard drive to play this game, aren't I?

Shit."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"I see a shadow, but what about legs? "
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Now they just need to let us use a wider FOV. It worked perfectly fine at 90 in gta but I needed to use mods to do that. Why? 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,Holy shit PC crybabies about mouse and keyboard. Give it a rest. Everything doesn‚Äôt have to be your way to be fun. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I love the size of the characters.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"No lie, this perked me right up, enough to crack a smile."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Lets hope it doesn't control in first person like in GTA
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"I have never pre-ordered a game in my life and I'm 31 years old but I pre-ordered this one. The original was one of the best video games ever made hands down. I wish PS4 was backwards compatible! Everything I've seen so far has given me such hope, I really hope Rockstar doesn't turn this into a Grand Theft Auto V type of thing and just get back to making quality story-based games."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Laughs in console...
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,The jumpcut from riding horseback to kicking in the door made me think he was riding his horse into the store for a second
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"When I saw the previews for this game, I thought ""sure, I'll definitely Redbox this or borrow from a friend when they are done""

after learning about first person and seeing it in action here, I think I'm probably going to buy it"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"I really don‚Äôt like first person in GTA. It doesn‚Äôt feel or look quite right. When I‚Äôm turning, I feel like I‚Äôm stuck in place and just getting spun around. With FPS like CoD, I can look any direction and move that way but with GTA, I have to turn to a certain point then I can begin moving forward. Anyone else hate it?"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,god i fucking hope the controls are better than the mess that was GTA first person
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,No way this runs at 60fps on regular PlayStation 4s
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,Sure hope they don‚Äôt allow auto aim in multiplayer. Completely ruined any pvp aspect in Rdr and GTA
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,[deleted]
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,The horse at the beginning gave me Kingdom Come Deliverance flashbacks. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,[deleted]
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Must feel good to release nice looking trailer and then some retard makes the shittiest gif out of it and shares on reddit.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,This looks fucking incredible.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,But can I look down iron sights...? 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Damn i really need to get my Xbox out and finish the first.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"I don‚Äôt know why, but *this* sold me on preordering."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Looks a lot better that GTA first person mode. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Not gonna lie. I wouldn‚Äôt miss first person if it wasn‚Äôt added. The controls feel way to clunky and the FOV don‚Äôt feel right. Though the settings can be changed there does not seem to be a sweet spot. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Think it‚Äôll have a 4K 30 or 1080 60 options on 1x or pro? 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I sure can‚Äôt wait to play this on my new Pc I naught just for this game!
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,needs FOV slider that goes to 115 or something by the looks of it.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Is it just me or is this all scripted, like not a person playing? The camera wasn't moving in a natural fashion. "
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Huh, didnt realize this game came out in 2000. Those graphics were slightly ahead of their time"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Hard to make opinion on potato pixels
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Console aiming, looks like a robot."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,This is too smooth. Not gonna believe it until the game officially comes out.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I appreciate it but this is one game where I'll play in 3rd person. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"The shotgun? shots at the beginning felt really weak, like there was minimum kickback"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Can't wait to use this for 5 minutes then go back to 3rd person.

  
Also, No Ironsights? Really?"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Holy 240p graphics pass
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Call of Juarez anyone? 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Hurry up and pc release
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,3rd person 4 lyfe
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Can't wait to play it... In two years or so.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"The framerate really isn't too good, but I hope that's just a poor gif. "
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"100% gonna be the same as GTA V's from the looks of it

AKA - tank controls"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Aimbot. No one is that accurate on horseback
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Ow, my balls. What is this feeling? Oh yeah, 102 GB wait time üòñ"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Urrrgghhhhh autoaim
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I guess everyone forgot Red Dead Revolver was a 1st person shooter 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"The resolution is really low, is this gameplay from the console version?"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Can‚Äôt wait to not be able to play this on PC
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,30fps
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,The smoke coming out of the barrels is very impressive.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I'm pretty salty that this won't be allowed on pc  :(
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Good god the auto aim is atrocious.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Looks super choppy.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Put. It. On. PC. You. Bastards. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Crappy FPS checks out, console"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,This will no doubt be as bad as GTA V‚Äôs and I will immediately switch back to 3rd person.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Imagine this on PC...
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Debating waiting for PC 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,aaah that sweet 30FPS
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Am I the only one who's really not excited for it?
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Let me know when there‚Äôs PC perspective 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"I can't imagine myself ever wanting to play this game in 1st person.

The way you look (beard growth, bloody clothes, mud, etc) plays a huge part in how people treat you in the game.  I want to see my character."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Damn 30fps?
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Can‚Äôt wait for barely 30fps and medium settings on console..
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,#*cries in 144fps*
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,lol that console aiming
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Why cant this be on the PC ffs
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Will this be on PC?
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,so it's an fps game that's not out for pc but consoles? who is the genious behind this?
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"105Gb looks quite reasonable now, doesn‚Äôt it?"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Need a PC version of the game please!
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Looks like it'll run great on PC in 2 years.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,my personal opinion but i don't really care until its on PC.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I want this game on pc so fucking badly
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,[deleted]
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Memories of Oblivion.... 1st person mode while on horse back........ Awww fuck yes..... I missed that in Skyrim. Thank you Rockstar for giving us the full immersion experience.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,The gif was really jerky - is that just the standard console FPS or is my internet having problems? 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Looks at that stellar 20 FPS. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Bummer it isn‚Äôt on PC. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Loving that buttery smooth console 12 fps.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Too bad it‚Äôs played using a controller and not on pc with mouse.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Rip pc players. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,(2fps)
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I can't wait for my shitty console to try and run this masterpiece
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I Can't wait to play this game! 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I am so fucking excited. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Holy shit
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Looks good ‚ò∫
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Looks so cool. Can't wait to play it !
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,If the first person mode plays like a fine tuned fps game then playing the game will become extremely frustrating to me.  ONLY because I would not be able to make my mind up which I preferred more.  Id probably end up switching views every 5 mins. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Omg I‚Äôm so glad they are doing this.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Picked up the first one. I should be able to finish it before release of 2, right? 3 weeks should be plenty."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Sick. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Kewl
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Who else forgot that GTA V had first person
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Hopefully it won't turn where you're looking when you strafe like that GTAV crap
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Can you play the entire game like this?
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I WANT TO PLAY YOU!!!
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"I need to buy either a PlayStation or an Xbox. Which one should I get? Haven‚Äôt bought a new console in years. 

I‚Äôm leaning PlayStation because of Uncharted. But I heard Xbox has better 4K?

I think I‚Äôll mostly use it for a few single player games and maybe watching Netflix/Plex. Any recommendations?"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Show me dem detailed testicles
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Excuse me while i shed tears of joy
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,So the engine is an upgraded version of GTA 5's?
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,This transported me back to an early 90s arcade. So awesome
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Fuck, this is coming out mid semester in my senior year of college. May my grades have mercy on me."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I want this on PC so badly...
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Imagine how good this game would look on a PC.
"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Bf1 meets GTA meets 200 years ago
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,We really need videos with sound posted for things like this. Not a shitty gif. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,No aiming required.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Looks like western cyberpunk 2077 gameplay
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Why would you ever turn a corner while reloading?!
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,There‚Äôs first person mode??? Oh mama
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"This is something I have always had a problem with games that have transitions from exterior to interior settings. Why is it that the person is blinded when we go from outside to inside transition? This 3 seconds of blindness kills the immersion.

Does anyone else feel this way? Do i need to stand outside for 30 minutes then run inside with a stopwatch to judge how long stay blind?"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"seems that the AI sucks balls. AI, the big elephant on gaming"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Maybe im wrong but this looks really clunky and tacked on.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,First look at auto aim on Red Dead Redemption.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,So now we can watch horse testes up close? 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,VR mode for PS5? 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Is it wrong of me to say it looks like a battlefield game to me? Like the graphics quality reminds me of it
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Man, that tiny little aiming reticle for the sawed off shotgun....  That's a bit weird."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"This game will probably not come on the PC, I'm fine with that.

Hope this game is good, for my brothers sake! (Console boy)"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Well this changes everything! I am not a fan of 3rd person shooters at ALL!! I might actually play this title. After a year or two and once it goes on sale, of course!"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,J.J. Abrams did the lighting. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,This is a thing!?
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Meh, not my cup of tea."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"I don't know why I was surprised, for some reason it never occurred to me that first person might be in rdr 2"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,if i get any more hype for this game i‚Äôm going to have a heart attack 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Worst part of being a lefty shooter, when I play first person shooting games it feels incredibly awkward."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"C'mon, PSVR mode!"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Im moist!!
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Look like quicktime events minus the visible graphics for it.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,When do you think this will translate to VR?
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,awesomee
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Doesn't looks anything different from GTA V's FPP mode. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"I don't wanna do my whole first play through the game in first person, but since it's releasing with the mode, I kinda wanna."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I honestly don‚Äôt really like it
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,My penis has never been harder in my life.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Looks like it plays somewhat awkwardly, similar to GTA V. Super cool, but that's the feeling it gave me."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Anyone remembers the game Outlaws? Childhood memories! 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Imagine how well first person mode would play on a GODDAMN PC. For fucks sake Rockstar. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,imagine this in first person with a mouse and keyboard?
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Fuck, the impact of bullets and the ragdoll animations look like the same downgraded bullshit as was in GTA V.

Red Dead Redemption looked so much better when shooting people. Hopefully it gets better. "
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"I can‚Äôt wait to aim down the sights of a Spencer rifle






SPENCER OR RIOT"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Really hope they fine-tuned the input latency while in FP mode. In GTA, even with acceleration all the way down and sensitivity all the way up, there‚Äôs just a hair of a delay between input and response that just gives it a sluggish feeling.

Might just be me, but I don‚Äôt feel that in any other FPS games"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Have always hated first person, no idea why it's such a big thing for people."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I'm so excited. I've already put in my request to take off of work for this game. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Thanks, I hate it."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Why is everything so dark?
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I so badly want this game to go PC
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Looks amazing. 

I wonder how dead eye will look in first person "
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Oh fuck I need it
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Looks pretty good, even though I know I will play it in TPS mode.

Also the muzzle flashes follow the guns, that's not how muzzle flashes work"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I can wait for my PS4 to melt trying to play this!
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I‚Äôm just want to know if they‚Äôll have first person bowling. Maybe have a cousin to join you also. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Needs more frames.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Giddy up cowpoke
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Now I want it on PC even more.. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Full playthrough in 1st or third person first? 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,This is how it should be.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Can't wait! 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Reminds me Outlaws.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,so western fallout?
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,West world
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Poker would be the only thing I'd do in first person. I want to be immersed when I'm losing my $0.49.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Cannot wait! 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,HE LEAD WITH THE GUN
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I‚Äôm hoping it isn‚Äôt choppy like it was on GTA V for console.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I‚Äôm just hoping this gets ported to PC...
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"I‚Äôm probably still gonna play this game in 3rd person, but I really hope they improved the first person mechanics for this game. GTA V‚Äôs first person mode felt so unresponsive and floaty. "
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Has r* ever released a bad game? Controversial yes, but bad?"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,30 fps and controller movement ruin this.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"What do you think the ""Shark Cards"" will be called in RDR2? Horseshoe Cards? Gunslinger Cards? Maybe Ranger Cards."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,*PC players cry in 160 FPS *
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Is my base PS4 even going to run this? 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Almost perfect timing on their part, shoulda released it a couple months ago to coincide with West World being released.  Not the same I know, but I imagine it would still spike interest in western themed media! "
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Any word on if this can be toggled in game or menu only? 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Amazing job
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Looks really grainy, and is this like at 20FPS or something?

Wonder if you can freely switch modes, or if you'll have to buy 1,000 Coyote cards to roll for the chance to unlock the action. "
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Skyrim but with Western guns
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,So hyped!!!
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Dude you know I‚Äôm playing this freakin game 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,But the only thing I'm worried about is.. Will they add things like flying horses or horses carrying a gun? Like they did stupid things with GTA after the release which made it bad. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"I've never played over watch but I've seen enough memes to know the characters. So in this game I'm just gonna run around with my revolver using deadaim and saying ""It's high noon"" I'm sure it'll get boring after the 50th time... But I kinda doubt that. Game looks amazing. "
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"""He led with the gun""!!!"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Can we watch the realistic horse junk shrinkage in first person? 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Man that auto aim looks great
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,YEEE-HA!
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,this is it chief
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,But can you see your feet?
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I cant wait for this i dont need to see anymore!
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Please just let us disable auto-aim.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Anybody have any apprehension about playing after watching westworld?
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Please put the entire game in VR mode! Please???? C‚Äômon man. You can do it.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I want to play this on PC so badly. But I can't :/
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,anyone else just not gonna use 1st person?
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Reminds me way too much of Fistful of Frags. Anyone?
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Can‚Äôt wait to play this.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Can't wait to play this game in a few years when I might have money to buy the console and the game used.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,i think it would be cool if we could own a pet dog for hunting or as a attack dog.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,.. C-Call of... Juarez?? 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Hopefully it's not as clunky as first person mode from GTAV.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"What is the subreddit for this game? Plus, is this coming out fur pc?"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I hope it is less clunky then the first person in GTA.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Wow.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,GTA V: A Western Story
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"how disappointing, I thought it would be a scene of the horse balls shrinking"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,VR when?
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I thought I was watching Battlefield 1 for a second
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,It‚Äôs like Mount and Blade :0
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"For the first time, this game has caught my eye.  
I may just pick it up once it comes to PC eventually."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Damn fistful of frags got an update 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,[deleted]
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Utterly sold.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Not gonna lie, I was expecting this to be a shitpost about being able to get a closer look at horse testicles."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I thought this was Hunt Showdown at first 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I cant wait to play this on PC!
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Not enough horse balls tbh
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I will never leave home again.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Meh
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"God, I hope there's an Easter egg of a Deluxo in a barn somewhere."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Personally, I won't be playing in first person - mainly because the FOV is too low and I get motion sick - but MAN... I'm happy for those who were hoping for a first person mode. It looks cool, and I didn't really expect to see it in this game. "
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Booo
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,So I guess I'll be playing all of the single player at least twice. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Still prefer third person significantly over first person... First person always feels so artificial. They always make it turn so smoothly... and when it doesn't turn smoothly, it feels weird, because you're used to it turning smoothly. People don't turn like that!"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,meh
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Rockstar first person always felt like a, I dunno, gimmick rather legit play style, at least in GTA5. It never felt as snappy or reactive as normal FPS. I can kinda tell it's this way from the videos. It's playable, sure, but it's not as easy or fluid as 3rd. "
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,i feel like Red Dead is going to have the best Battle Royale mode we have ever seen
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Reminds me of Outlaw from the old LucasArts days
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,ok looks like a fps
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,I will be getting this game 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,I am playing this game in first person mode exclusively. Wow...
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,I am for sure playing like this 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,it was nice of Rockstar to let these other developers eat at the kiddie table these past 5 years. it's time
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,Please make it VR
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,Well thank goodness they won't be releasing this on P.C. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,"Ahhh good old Mad Dog McCree

&#x200B;"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,Auto aim? 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,anyone else feel like the recoil for the rifle should've been a bit stronger?
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,Where did this footage come from ?
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,Should i get ps vr for this?
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,"Hope this is as good as outlaws
""Where are you marshal?""

""Your outnumbered""
"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,Hooray! 1st person horseballs!
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,"Not coming to PC for literally no valid reason, dead game "
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,First person but no PC LOL gg rockstar
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,Yup that‚Äôs how I‚Äôm playing it
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,Hot damn take my money!
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,"jesus what is this shitty quality and FPS?

if you're going to try advertise a game at least use a non 480p gif lol"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,"So what do you guys think? Will this control like shit, but have crazy auto-aim to compensate like GTA? "
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,cool
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,Its gonna be like in gta v... Seems cool that its there but its unplayable because rockstar cant manage propper fps movement. Just stick with third person rockstar! Youre quite good at that
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,Oh...Ew
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,I think i like 3rd person better 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,All internet providers are gonna go crazy on the 26th.. 105GB LOL
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,"Still got that garbage FOV i see, smh"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,"I feel like such a minority being someone who invariably prefers third person. Gaming community seems to gush over the ""immersion"" that 1PP apparently offers but I just feel like a disembodied head with a weapon sticking out my chest. Getting so actually look at the beautifully designed and crafted character is a bonus too."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,Nut 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,"I did not even know there was going to be first person, that's awesome."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,I wasn't going to buy this game but now i might think about it for like 2 years while waiting for PC version.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,Its such a shame its going to be on garbage consoles and not pc.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,im so conflicted which way to play someone tell me 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-08,Oh boy Westwood simulator. Hope we can visit a brothel 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,If you guys like this vibe check out Hunt: showdown
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Gah, even more frustrating that this isn't coming to PC for me, now.  It'd look so awesome in first person mode at a higher frame rate.  :("
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I think I'll be waiting on the chance of a PC release than getting it on PS4 slim. Controller aiming would kill a good amount of fun for me :/
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Definitely coming to PC.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,That frame rate shouldn‚Äôt be acceptable anymore. If there‚Äôs not a 60fps mode on the PS4 pro I‚Äôll wait for the unlikely pc release. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Even on an average quality gif you can tell the graphics on this will be insane
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"I play PC almost exclusively. But I might need to get a newer gen console for this. My og ps4 might not be quite the experience I want... Ps4 pro or fancy xbone? I'm leaning ps4...

Edit: if you people could stop downvoting literally every comment that isn't deepthroating a console, that'd be great. Legitimately looking for a recommendation on a console upgrade. "
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,What brick was the filmed on and where can I get it?
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,aw hell this is going to make me go buy a damned console 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Im so hard
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,They can put shrinking balls in but shooting from a horse is that stable? Okay.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Great that it‚Äôs first person, sucks that I have to use a controller"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Flashbacks to good ol' [Mad Dog McCree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Dog_McCree)

9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Can't wait for games like these on future VR systems! SAO will become real
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Me: This is awesome. 
Brain: Here, have some motion sickness. 
Me: Please don... *Vomits uncontrollably*"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,There are no bad looking games today 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Hopefully it‚Äôs not as janky as gta V first person 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Looks neat, but this was not a smooth feature on GTA5. Aiming was still a little clunky. Here's hoping they improved it for Red Dead. "
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Wow that frame rate is awful. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Graphics are pretty good :)
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,When is the Westworld mod going to hit?
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"###FUCK YES I CAN'T WAIT

### FIRST PERSON IS BEST PERSON"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Can‚Äôt wait for higher FOV on PC. 
Edit: I thought it was going to be on PC but I guess not. "
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Now I really need a mouse. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"I definitely went and pre-ordered right after seeing this new trailer.  Between this and Fallout 76, I'm going to be so damn busy."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"The lighting is so realistic, damn this is like a whole new genre man."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Holy shit fuck. Looks like I‚Äôm preordering this game to..girlfriends going to cut my junk off. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I wasn‚Äôt interested in the game but after this trailer I‚Äôm pretty darn hyped 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Ah, so this must be why they arent releasing pc "
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"It‚Äôs a shame it‚Äôs not on PC, the only way to truly experience this game. Or any game for that matter. "
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Ah yes another generic ""shoot everything that moves"" video game. Great /s"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,we waited 8 years for this trash? Are you kidding me Reddit?!? Don‚Äôt upvote this and give this $hit advertising. Massive failure rockstar 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,this is the closest you‚Äôll be to westworld irl guys get hyped
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Looks awful... 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Mmmmm that 30fps flipbook mode.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"wow, what a shitty framerate!"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,So is this game coming to PC? On launch or later ?
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I‚Äôd give up my first born just to play this game early.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Why do these previews always have such smooth movement that no player would ever have in an actual game? Is it AI or is someone just purposely going all smooth?
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Meanwhile PC players like me watch in disappointment
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Still not announced for PC...

*sigh*"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Man I thought this game would look fun, guess I‚Äôll wait for gta 6"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Wait when cyber punk is first person weren‚Äôt people upset? How come first person in red dead is good? 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Rockstar knows how to do their shit.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,No imagine playing it with a mouse and a keyboard.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,didn't realize console players were stuck with such small screens
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I can‚Äôt wait to play this in about 3 years on the PC. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"I do not have a next gen console.  I am buying one for this game.  Am I stupid if I don't go ""Pro"" type model?"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,Gotta love the Aim assist.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,This game isn't meant to be played in first person.  That's like playing cyberpunk 2077 in third person. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,I can't believe I have to play this on a toaster instead of a pc 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I have pc.... 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,First person you say? This seems to be perfect for a certain platform. Fuck you Rockstar.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Please be on pc. I dont mind waiting I just dont want to go and buy a console just for 1 game.

EDIT: I know its only on console for now."

9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,3rd person is the only way to play this game for me. 1st person sucks for Rockstar Games.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Is this not coming out on pc at all or eventually it will? Like after a year or so

Edit: what's with the downvotes"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"I know MS announced some expanded mouse/keyboard support, I hope they add mouse/keyboard support to RDR2 first person mode"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,With built in aimbot.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Looks good - Not going to support 2K though. Therefore missing out on it until there are reasonable second-hand prices... welp
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,That's a pretty accurate depiction of the fps console will be getting lol
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I feel like I'm the only person not hyped for this game 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,"Waiting for motion sickness. GTA didn't get 1st person right, neither will this"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Meh. It‚Äôs not on pc.  I‚Äôll pass
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Just imagine how this'll look on PC. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Frames look like absolute shit. Almost like some kind of action flick PTSD effect.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Looks amazing but I'm not really a big fan of cowboys and such (also an Eagles fan)
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02, The PC is dead time to grow up and get a console. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,This would be 100x better if i could play it on PC...
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Wake me up when it‚Äôs on PC.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"No PC version?
Meeh"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"This better get released on pc, you fucks."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Looks slow in controller... bring on PC.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Pc version is gonna be smoother.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I see they went with the familiar 20 frames per second of the original game.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Oh boy! I can't wait to experience these graphics with my PC!

9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Graphics look good. I remember the first one it was so popular on PS3 and Xbox 360
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Riding a horse in first person and trying to shoot seems like hell. Especially on a console 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Yeah but if I jump into a wall, will i vault it?"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Hope it isn‚Äôt as awkward and clunky as first person mode in GTA. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Now I can look at horse balls in first person detail

9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,The lighting is gonna be toned down to shit in the real game making the graphics look bad

9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Could you have fried it a bit more? Holy shit the quality is ass.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Well...thank god Xbox is introducing mouse and keyboard integration soon, cause aiming with a controller will suck so bad."

9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,But what does it look like with the brightness set to max?

9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,The first person looks so wonky to me
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"This looks just as janky as GTAV. Maybe it'll feel better when actually playing it, but right now I'm not sold on FPS from Rockstar."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Its ok, my rig, just wait a year or 2"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Looks too much like the GTA first person, I REALLY don't like the kill effects screen flash..."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Well, looks like I'm buying a rockstar game"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Never played RD ever. Am going to get the PS4 Pro bundle. Will I need to watch a recap of last game to keep up?
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I'm not really interested in RDR2 but seeing has got me curious now. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Omfg if they made the first person mode compatable with psvr my life would be COMPLETE 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,How the heck are they going to have this mode but not have it for PC?
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,This game looks dope. Wish it was for PC.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"I'm curious, is there any word out there of RDR2 coming to PC? As far as I know, it's only Xbox/PS4. Has anyone heard anything to suggest otherwise? "
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"This game looks better and better every time I see it. But God damn I hate westerns. The movies, the games the music. I hate the whole western/cowboy theme in general. I hate horses to. But I may have to make an exception with RDR2."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"1st person looks awful again, gj"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Jesus it looks way to much like gta v already
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Ugh... I just bought a gaming PC and unsub'd from xbox Live. Guess they'll get me once again.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,One of my biggest gripes with the first game was how unbelievably easy it was.  It was more like watching a movie and just pressing some buttons to move the storyline along rather than playing a game.  The way he snipes those dudes in first person mode tells me this game will be no different.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Sure would be nice on PC... Oh wait
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Wow it's a video game
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,IT LOOKS AMAZING! I hope it doesn't feel like GTA V's First person mode.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Looks bad
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I don't understand why anyone would play this when Fistful of Frags already exists
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Sucks it's not gonna be on PC anytime soon.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"If this doesn't come out for PC eventually, i think I'll be done supporting Rockstar"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"i dont normally do this, but this game make me wanna dry hump these ideas, memories, or the actual game case to show my enthusiasm @_@ T_T :o "

9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Whoa mount and blade got a graphics update 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,gtav and rdr2 in first person justifies cyberpunk taking the same approach
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Actually decent animations. The hands in GTA V in first person were very poorly done, looked robotic."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Does anyone believe I would enjoy this game if I night it if I loved GTA 5 and enjoyed the story and mechanics?
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Is it going to have an FOV slider or will it be useless and unplayable like GTA V? 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,So its battlefield meets Wii my pony and me.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"That‚Äôs some impressive lighting effects. Going into a building from a lit area requires your eyes to adjust, and the sun‚Äôs glare can put you at a disadvantage."

9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,This looks cool but I doubt I‚Äôll ever use it. I love a good 3rd person view. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Oh man oh man oh man... I can't wait
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I really want to be able to aim down the sights

I don't want to buy an upgraded console as I don't use 4k, but I am a PC player and I'm used to ultra everything at 1080p.

9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I hope it works better than the GTA V first-person mode. I would play the whole game in first-person if it was as smooth as other FPS titles but this game is probably better off being played in the default third-person 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Pretty cool
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,First person was really cool in GTA - until your round out all modes of transportation suck in first person. Can‚Äôt wait to use it here 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"glad the gun models look nice, i liked gta v first person a lot but if there's one thing its definitely that you could tell from the first person gun models that it was original third person lol, i know they probably redid the textures and stuff but they weren't detailed at all imo."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,It looks really good but I'm worried it will feel as gross as GTAV FPS mode which was fun for little bits of immersion and driving but otherwise not enjoyable 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I just did.

9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,looks like control is taken away from you at that  point. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Same here ‚Äî jumping into GTA first person after playing CoD feels so rough. The controls feel unresponsive and imprecise. Hoping they‚Äôve optimized since.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"First person in GTA V was an afterthought that they added in after the game was completed. Apparently Rockstar built Red Dead 2 with first person in mind, so chances are it's a lot less floaty & disorienting than GTA was. Not to mention that Red Dead 2 is a lot slower paced and detail oriented than GTA V is"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I get the feeling it will feel just like that- but there are a bunch of settings to mess around with 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Personally loved first person mode in gtav. I guess mainly for driving motorcycles lol I got really good at weaving through traffic and what not. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,First person felt like they just slapped a camera on the 3rd person body 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Im hoping they changed TPP movement. Its so damn hard to control your character in the most recent Rockstar Games
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Complete opposite experience, personally. Even ended up playing a lot of PvP in 1st person. The model has a weird gravity to it, but once you get used to that it actually starts to feel really good IMO.

I also disagree about it being a tacked on feature: you can set the FOV, head bob, look acceleration, and toggle whether or not you exit 1st person during combat rolls and when entering cover, amongst other things...Rockstar took 1st person very seriously when they implemented it in GTA."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,It felt like a tacked on feature because it quite literally was a tacked on feature to try to get people to buy the game twice.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,It felt more like a mod than an actual vanilla in game feature. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"For me, it was the models, animations and the way weapons were held.

Sure it's not a normal first person shooter, but I felt like they should've  used a more classic FPP camera angle and it wouldve felt much more natural"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Well it was a tacked on feature they added after the fact. This game is developed with it in mind. Also you can turn off the first person pov getting fucked with you rolling around or whatever in the settings. The only thing that really sucked was the minute control over fov they granted because they didn't want us to see shit textures like the floors of car interiors and the like because the game wasnt made to be first person compatible from the get go. I still don't think it'll be perfect and I still expect to play primarily in third person but I think it will be much better. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"I remember reading something about rockstar saying gta 5 fpp mode wasn't really meant to be played in first person, but for the new red dead they put more emphasis into FPP mode. "
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"You forgot to mention that third person also felt floaty and imprecise. I love rockstars open worlds but the gunplay always lacks. 
I‚Äôm tired of having to use the snap aim mode because my sticks feel too unresponsive to play the game like any other console shooter. "
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Judging the movement in this clip it seems the same as how gta 5 did it.

9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,On GTA V you click the analog stick to switch from aiming down the sights to the mode they show here. It's probably the same.

9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Devs don't like to have aiming down sights in trailers because it looks less cinematic but irl we aim down the sights pretty much every time we shoot somebody out of reflex.

9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Could be because you can choose to play in 1st or 3rd person. In Cyberpunk you have no choice but 1st person.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,Came here to say that. The shot horsebacked feels so fake.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I also have been a pc only gamer for the past 15 years. I just pre-ordered a PS4 bundled with this game last night.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Give it up. This isn't the first AAA multiplat to miss our systems and it won't be the last. Get a console if you want to play it so bad or wait it out for the inevitable port.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"It's more than likely the publisher, who just want to double dip, not R*. It'll come to PC eventually"

9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,One of the write ups said that the enemy AI and your pose's AI are both very intelligent.  You command your people to do things and they do them.  I read a few times that you need to use your pose  because the enemy AI is really fucking smart. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,If you watch closely the shotgun points straight up as it passes over his ally. I'm guessing its a gameplay mechanic to keep them from having to create invincible NPCs.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Looks like Micah Bell
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,It's Micah not John.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"For me, FPP in GTAV was just like ""Oh, neat!"". Then never to use it again."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"I think it's because it ties to a character model forced to animate somewhat believably vs COD allowing players to turn 180* in 2 frames.

I found once I ""got used"" to how you couldn't whip your avatar around like a twitch shooter, FPP in GTAV was a pretty dope way to play through it for the 2nd time."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I don't think you can functionally make both work. I can't think of any game that does it without one mode being the primary. TPS games have a lot of animations where the camera holds still while the character reacts to things for immersion. Cover specially is hard to translate from TPS to FPS. In FPS the character model is more static to keep the camera from bouncing around everywhere.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,No! There are 3rd person games that are really responsive. Like uncharted maybe. But gta isnt that kind of game. And shouldnt be.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"What a surprise jumping from a first person game famous for its first person action, nto a third person open world game famous for third person action, was rough... 

Who would've thought"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Yea, Rockstar always learns and grows from game to game, and their open world combat has shown significant improvement each time. It‚Äôs been 5 years since GTA V released. I am guessing they‚Äôve had time to put effort into the gunplay."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Yeah once I adjusted the settings I really enjoyed it and could play in first person for hours.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I mean it kinda was. The game was made and released with 3rd Person in mind. First person wasn‚Äôt added until months and months after release 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Just click the right stick, you'll get ads aiming"

9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"really? i think updating combat (by a lot),upgraded graphics with stable performance will do half of the job already, obviously i think they're gonna add a lot more than that but in skyrim i have over 400 hours on an unmodded run and apart from tw3 i didnt play any other rpg that can entertain me as much without multiplayer, they're simply too short but they seriiously need to focus on updating the combat and make it more entertaining"

9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,"It won‚Äôt feel like a true FPS. In true FPS games, you can start sprinting and the stop on a dime and start backpedaling in an instant. You can‚Äôt do that in GTAV in third person because your character actually has momentum, and needs to slow down before making any big changes in direction. It was done this way because they knew that the majority of people would play in 3rd person, as they definitely will do with Red Dead 2. That‚Äôs a big part of why GTAV first person feels clunky. They needed to maintain the momentum aspect of the character, otherwise it wouldn‚Äôt be balanced, and people playing FPP would have an advantage in movement. If they decided to make FPP feel like a true FPS, and maintain the realism in FPP, and let them play in separate lobbies (like how GTAV does with the aim styles) they would still have to make separate animations for character movement, which is highly unlikely. So don‚Äôt get your hopes up for a true FPS feel."

9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Not a fucking chance it won't come to PC. Not after how much GTA made on PC. It's super shitty that they're trying to make people buy it twice. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,And the FPS mode was added like 2 years after the games initial release
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"The dieting feature was in GTA San Andreas, just sayin'."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"What's the point if you can headshot like that from so far away, assuming that wasn't an aimbot or god tier game marksman doing the shooting for the promo."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Oh is that how? I have it on PS4 and PC and I accidentally did it by scrolling up on my mouse. I figured it was a PC exclusive feature, like terrible driving/flying controls.

Yes I'm bitter."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Thanks for the good news, it actually makes sense. "
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"No shit. all the armchair critics out here oblivious to the fact first person in GTA was obviously the 1st time it was ever attempted

Why wouldnt they improve upon it?"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I did the exact same. Such an amazingly fun play through that second FPS go.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,It‚Äôs not a free add on it‚Äôs a camera angle.

9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Rockstar has always had shotty sensitivity for shooting. So Auto aim was always a must. But in 5 I forced myself to toy with the settings and learned it. Love going into free aim lobbies. Being able to do drivebys and not get fucking auto aim doing 269mph in a car. It‚Äôs not fun at all to be at a disadvantage in a car.

9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"I felt this with the gta v story line. It was a series of button pressing to initiate the next QTE, but the world felt so rich that it didn't matter as much. RDR2 looks very much like it will be in a similar vein. "
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,The previews last week noted the inclusion of first person
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"That was 5 years ago, if they haven't improved upon it by now the they aren't the studio they claim to be"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,So garbage. got it.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,If it has multiplayer similar to GTA5 with microtransactions I'm sure they will bring it to PC.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"It'll come to PC.

Of course it will.  GTA 5 did really bloody well on PC, zero reason to not bring it.

They're doing what they did with GTA 5.  Double-dipping (triple in GTA's case) - release on consoles, everyone buys it, then those that own a PC crack and get it for consoles, then *gasp* it's coming to PC after all with proper 4K, better visuals, blah blah blah.

BOOM! Those that got it for console get it for PC too.  Double sale."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Just wait another year, maybe two until next gen."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I‚Äôm so annoyed it isn‚Äôt coming out for pc right away. I need to flunk out of college now dammit!
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,This I really don‚Äôt understand either.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Word idk if this is just a pet peeve of mine but what I want to see is really good shooting details. Like if I shoot someone in the head id like to see a hole in their head. Or you know if I hit someone one with a shotgun I'd like to see the damage. I know that sounds kind of gory... It doesn't have to be to realistic but at least show me where my bullet hit. 

I'm the kind of person who likes to shoot people in games with arrows and walking up to them to see how good my aim was. Same with hunting. "
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,Yeah but I prefer to see my character and all the subtle details they worked their ass off putting in the game. I live my life in first person I know what it's like lol

9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"It certainly is, but I think he‚Äôs referring to the nerfed body physics in GTA V as opposed to the better ones in GTA IV and RDR.

Hopefully this goes back to the more complex stuff they used to have."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,We can hope.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,In Undead Nightmare I only remember that I was constantly out of ammo and the only way I could get things done was by riding down zombies with my flaming horse.  It's a damn good thing I had a flaming horse.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,"RDR2 is going to have multiplayer? Fuck. That's def a red flag, yeah. Not every game needs multiplayer. Last of Us for example I would've loved to see the resources put into multiplayer put into another expansion for example, even a short one."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Yes, I was planning on playing in third person 99% of the time anyways."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,You‚Äôre totally right! I couldn‚Äôt really put my finger on what it was about GTA first person that I hated. It‚Äôs the head bobbing for sure. That and it overall doesn‚Äôt feel as fluid as a game like Call of Duty or Battlefield.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Ikr fuck me life mate 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Yeah I have a decent enough PC now, which is probably why I haven‚Äôt bought a console. PS4 sounds like a plan. "
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,True
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"I played TitanFall 2 on PS4 recently. Had a great time but I just knew it would be so much more fun on a m+kb or even steam controller. Something about being 'quickest gun in the west' style with a controller sounds eh.

And they'll definitely bring it to both console gens and probably PC with so much undoubtedly being pumped into online."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Ah, the GTAV treatment. Shame, but it worked for them"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Ya PS4 is the right choice, Xbox one x doesn't have any good exclusives, on the other hand PS4 is getting so many good exclusives"

9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Not with that attitude 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,It's always this.  No one moves their controller that smooth in a firefight.  Definitely always scripted.  Just like all the RTX videos.  We won't have a game that looks like that within 20 years.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"I made myself play through the whole story entirely in first person, just to experience the game differently. It was fun."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"On PC at 60 FPS I turned first person mode on and never turned it off, full single player campaign and a couple years of online play. I have it on PS4 these days and the 30FPS makes it feel much more disorienting. The awkward player movement was pretty secondary compared "
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Tbh i really only play in fpp unless I'm in a vehicle
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"I dunno if Id call it believable, sure its ""realistic"" but only if were looking through a gopro on our characters head... Our brains heavily compensate to make our actual perception much smoother."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"You're not wrong, but I also think it won't be as drastic as you're describing. First person is still going to feel floaty and weird simply because your character still has to animate as if you're playing third person. I expect first person to be more like PUBG than CoD."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,What kind of settings did you have to adjust to help with that?
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,It wasn't added until the game released on another generation of consoles and PC. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Nitendogs - Battle Royale

I pulled it out, screamed in terror and ran to my room, not sure if it‚Äôs the cause but since then I‚Äôve had a fear of spiders and tube socks. "
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I think it‚Äôs part of why Fallout 4 didn‚Äôt stand out as much. You still feel like a walking camera rather than a character interacting with the environment. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"While that's true, Fo4 was pretty much the same, only a couple of new gameplay improvements and fallout76 looks the same. They need a new engine, and something completely new. Bethesda games look very cheap in terms of graphics when compared to other games like gta or Witcher 3. Which both also came out some time ago."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,"7 years ago, and still one of the best in my eyes."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"If the next Elder Scrolls is the same as it was before, which is to say hundreds of locations and quests, but very little about any stand out in any real way, count me out.

The problem with Skyrim isn't the graphics or even the combat. The problem is that the engine feels extremely dated, and the environment has so much copy paste content that ""bandit encampment #65"" stops being fun after awhile.

"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,I've played about 80% first person since I got the PS4 version after playing the PS3 version to death. It's awesome. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-02,"Honestly I think the way GTA does first person is more ""true"" to what it feels like to actually perform those actions. CoD is smoother and crisper, but real life movement is usually neither smooth nor crisp."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Josey had the union army after him, though. Munny just had a handful of henchmen. If we could have seen more of Munny in action I might be more inclined to agree. "

9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"They did a bunch of work for it. Stuff like sitting on a sport bike and having the character out on a helmet, with the camera overlay and all, was super cool. Vehicle interiors were very detailed which was nice too. "

9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,Apparently they designed RDR2 with first person in mind so hopefully it feels a lot less disorienting than GTA V was
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Oh boy, that'll be super exciting because Rockstar was so responsible and did such a good job last time. "
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Then they port it to next gen and bam, triple dip. GTAV is a last gen game that currently sells better than new games."

9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"For sure. Gta 4 and rdr used Euphoria, and gtav did use a heavily downgraded version. I have no confirmation, but judging by gameplay and what others have said of their experience, they went back closer to the core Euphoria engine for this one. I hope anyway, the reactions in gta4 and rdr were fantastic. "
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Yep, theyre probably gonna go for the triple dip when the next gen comes out as well like they did before"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"As much as I wish this game came out on PC. There have been some console exclusives that have received pretty good reviews. Spiderman, persona 5, dawn horizon, and now rdr2 just to name a few don't look like they will be coming to PC any time soon."

Fuckin\` false, my man. People are actually playing the game in gameplay trailers 99% of the time. They play through the same bit a hundred times to get it perfect and have no reason to hurry their aim when they know what is doing what anyways. Not saying this bit isn't scripted. I'm saying you're wrong that people don't move their camera smoothly"
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"I'm doing that right now, fuck all the helicopter missions."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Lol I thought I was the only weirdo who did that! Shooting people (especially with a pistol) in first person felt...very satisfying in GTAV. Idk why. The only thing I didnt like was the driving. For one, you cant watch your sweet ass ride as its peeling through the streets of Los Santos, and the camera control was weird. It would default itself back to the driver side of the window making visibility 50%. I know you could change the settings to make it stat where you put it but that didnt help much with turning when you had to look out a side mirror. You end up running through intersections just hoping no cars were coming."
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I did a lot of the game in first person too. Awesome and fresh way to experience GTA. 
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"Me too. I enjoyed it a lot and it put into perspective just how detailed and precise the scale of the world is. I had to turn on ""3rd person in cover mode"" though. "

9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,I like it most in a vehicle. Ups the risk of casual GTA recklessness.  Almost everything feels too fast.
9kgwlh,2018-10-01,2018-10-01,"First off I change the first person button layout to the normal FPS controls (The ones that match COD). Then I adjusted the ADS sensitivity to my liking  and same for the look around sensitivity. I found that it was nice to have the regular sensitivity much lower than ADS so you can have regular control and then quick reaction with ADS. I also preferred to have aim assist on low. Definitely just takes trial and error to find what feels best for you.

 Just remember to save your settings each time you adjust cause for a while I thought nothing I was doing felt different and then I realized I wasn‚Äôt saving my changes."

The thought of one game being over 100 gigs would have blown my mind. That's like those hypothetical conversations you'd have, ""someday video games will be 100 gigs!!"" Yet to think it's not only happening but we have the capability to transmit that data over the internet.

If you had them as TWC and haven't changed anything since then though, you might want to call and see how much it would be/if your bill would be lower by swapping over to the actual spectrum services. The old TWC accounts weren't automatically switched to spectrum, they were grandfathered in to their old services, which... we're pretty much shit, with the TWC stuff."

730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"So I was trying to figure out when RDR 2 takes place,  and looking at the Timeline here...

 I'm assuming Dutch was about 55-60 in the first game. He doesn't look super young in 2 (he already has crows' feet), so I'm guessing he's about 40ish. 15 years before 1911 would put this game at 1896, and 20 years, 1891.

 I'm leaning towards 1891-ish though because of John. John would be 18 in 1891, and I imagine he's going to be one of the young recruits Morgan picks up for Dutch's gang during the story.

Just guessing here, but I imagine John would've joined Dutch's gang between 15-18 (he had Jack with Abigail at age 22 in 1895), so my best guess is that the game takes place around 1888-1891, during the last of the major Indian Wars and several economic meltdowns in the US. 

Maybe at the end of the game, Morgan betrays Dutch and John kills him as an official ""rite of passage"" into the gang.

730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"One big question I have is about the choice in how you play. Morgan seems straight up evil rather than having any redeeming 'good guy' qualities. This makes helping random people and being decent in the game feel out of character.

Our hero Marston was decent, but he had a dark past. So good and bad behaviour was more understandable. Will Morgan have a softer side? That woman seems to respect him over all the other idiots.

Not a fan of Morgan's appearance. He's kind of generic looking. I wonder if he'll be customisable? I doubt it though. His voice seems a bit old for him and a little ignorant if I'm honest. If the writing is good I'll get over that. Maybe he is just a brute and Marston is going to have to kill him in the end as people are saying, but I find that hard to identify with if he's just a prick the whole time.

It's different from the open world Red Dead Redemption, and it plays more like a grindhouse movie than a spaghetti western, but it's a blast. There are insane boss battles against a man who straps dynamite to himself and charges you, a man who keeps a gatling gun in a coffin strapped to his back, and a circus ringleader who teleports around the map, spits acid at you, and sends his legions of clowns after you. And all of these characters are available with their insane abilities in the multiplayer.

730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-29,"For people saying this character seems like a straight up evil guy, aren't watching the trailer or remembering what Dutches gang actually was. 

First of all its a 1 minute 30 trailer. So how much can you take from that really?

An important line of dialogue in it is the female saying to Morgan that he is the only one she can trust, suggesting another dimension to the character. 

Dutches gang was also not entirely evil in the beginning.
They were more of a robin hood gang, stealing from the rich and giving to those who needed it most. Whilst not legal, the morality behind it doesn't suggest a fully evil backdrop.

It was only in later years that the gang became more evil as Dutch started to lose his way and psychopaths like Bill Williamson showed their true colors.

This is even earlier than the original, so the technology isn't there to have crazy things, and rockstar wouldn't put in anything that would completely be out of place. I mean sure GTAV had crazy shit, but it was satire. Red Dead has always been more serious. So unless property becomes something game changing I'm really out of luck for what they could overprice to the extent they did in GTAV."

Red Dead Redemption was a masterpiece in my opinion, I have so many fond memories of playing the game. I even hop on it every now & then and the graphics still hold up to this day! I will never forget the ending which always puts a lump in my throat and makes a tear stream down my face despite how gnarly it is. John is one of the best characters I‚Äôve ever come across. I wonder if this prequel will be able to attach us to a character in the same way, then again. I don‚Äôt think Marston can be topped...
I hope when Morgan & Marston do meet, which I presume they will considering they‚Äôre in the same gang? They get on well with one another. I even think you might do some campaign missions for John throughout the game.  Roll on Spring 2018!"

I liked how in the last game, you were a bad guy turned good, having to do bad things to redeem yourself for your bad actions in the past. 

In this one, it looks like it's just plain bad guy, like in GTA. I enjoy that, but I did like how you weren't pure evil in RDD. I can't see much room for things like horse capturing and breaking in this one."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"The main dude kinda looked like Brokeback Heath Ledger. Is Troy Baker the voice actor for that character?

730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Can't fucking wait! GTA with horses! Also Spring 2018? Bullshit, watch them delay to Fall 2018. "
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Me: Ah, this is the one with the horses."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"I really wish i could get hyped for this game. But after all those years seeing how R* treated GTA V, i can't...
Still no SP content, online on PC is full of hackers, not to mention how boring the grind is, along with other ""problems"", like the stupid forced pvp missions.


Can you imagine? A good multiplayer where you can create your own character. A big, beautiful world with western settings. New guns, new locations, new activities.

Everything sounds too good. Until micro-trasanctions come in. 

I can already imagine: 1 day grinding to buy a horse (because you can't just steal one), 1 month to buy a wagon (and one more week to customize it), and finally: a full year to put a mini-gun into your wagon!"
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,My wallet is crying but I don‚Äôt give a fuck.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"The landscapes, the faces, their eyes... I can't wait to dive in."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Spring 2018 release, so I guess we should actually hope for a summer 2018 release with rockstar..."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"I don't care that Rockstar makes shit multiplayer experiences, the single player of RDR2 will be fucking amazing. With the Red Dead Redemption being one of my favorite games of all time."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,I wonder if we're gonna find out that John was a complete asshole; or if he really was a good man in a bad crowd. 
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,How very underwhelming.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,I hope it focuses more on the outlaw life than the first one. Kinda like GTA 5 did except better and western themed 
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"It's a win-win right? Either the game is fantastic and just as amazing as Redemption and we all have fun, or it's not and now other studios won't be scared off by creating open world westerns? 

I want the genre to be like WWII shooters in the mid 2000s dammit. "
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"So I'm watching this. I finish watching this. I close my app, then I get a notification about this trending! I know it's trending reddit! I literally just watched it on this subreddit! Jeez! "
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,DAG NAB 
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Looks great.  I started playing the first one earlier this year but never got around to finishing it.  Probably should do that soon.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,This looks amazing. I can't wait to skin various animals during my downtime. 
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,I wonder what the single fun mechanic of the game will be
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Is that the late great Powers Booth around 53 seconds?
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,We're all cowboys now!
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,I see on the website that it does not have a release date for PC... shame. Rockstar will probably release it later down the road as a cash grab opportunity. 
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,[deleted]
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,So it seems like we won‚Äôt be playing as multiple characters?
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Cream
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,I wouldn't be opposed to a remaster of the original so I can play the story through again to remember what the fuck actually happened. I don't want to get a PS3 to replay it
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,I've been thirsty for a sequel ever since completing the first one.  Can't wait.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Alright! Cool trailer! I bet everyone else thought so too! 
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"I was really hoping at the end he'd be holding his gun up and go ""No survivors, no witnesses"""
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,This main character seems like an ASSHOLE. I like it.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,I can't wait to play this game dude. Loved the first one 
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"So if this is about the gang moving west across America, then I'm really excited to see what the structure of the world is like!"
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Al Swearingen =/= Dutch
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Dang.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,I implore everyone to buy into the hype!
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"I wonder if it takes place before or after the gang leaves John for dead.

In the first game he mentioned Dutch going crazy and harming innocent people towards the end of his time. Morgan threatening the kid who just lost his father makes me think this might be post John. Although the whole Robin Hood aspect of the gang might've just been John being naive."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,This is literally the only thing I'm looking forward to in life right now 
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Is it just me or does the face of the protagonist and the movement look a lot like mafia 3...
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"So I figured not for PC since they didn't do it for original, but hoped maybe they would change their mind. Oh well. "
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"What made me absolutely fall in love with firsr, was when you're riding into Mexico and that song, it made it amazing. 

I hope they can do something like this again. "
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,I need to finally play the original.  I have a copy for the PS3 that I've never gotten around to playing.  It'll be my plan for this weekend.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"For the love of everything holy don't make this multiplayer,  and release DLC for the story mode.  I was so let down on how much potential gtav had for the story. "
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Can't wait for the always-online, non-moddable, microtransation-laden PC port of the game where cheaters run rampant in multiplayer but never get banned and innocent players get banned literally minutes after creating their character. The reviews will all be variations of how single player is great, but multiplayer is crap."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Can't friggin wait!  Graphics look beautiful.  
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Did it? I guess I wouldn't know. I just beat the story and fucked around a bit. I didn't really dedicate a lot of time to it. 
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,A a a.  H. H. H ye. S
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"What do you guys think will there be an online multiplayer like in GTA V?
Like we get to buy houses, clothes, weapon skins and maybe different kinds of horses and things?
"
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,is 1 still coming for pc tho?
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Guess I have a reason to live until next spring now.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,I wonder if Death will be a playable persona this time. He spooked me in the first redemption
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Soon I'll be able to hogtie people to railroad tracks all over again
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Always thought they'd continue the story with John's son, but I guess Rockstar never does that with GTA so why here? I haven't even played the first one yet apart from Undead Nightmare..."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,I am aroused
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,I got this shit as a youtube ad and I did not skip.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"The only thing I dislike up until now is the title of this game, like.....
1. Red Dead Revolver
2. Red Dead Redemption
3. Red Dead...... Redemption 2

I dunno, It could be something else lol
RED DEAD RELOADED (Just kidding, but something like Red Dead Revenge or Revolution would actually be nice)
"
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Have they included PC to the release or is it still PS4 and XboxOne now? If they are going to copy the release of GTA5 I hope PC doesn't have to wait another year after the next-gen consoles get their release. 
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,6 months away?  Sheeeet
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Please don't fuck over the single player for online bullshit...
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,The voice actor sucks 
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,So its just a single player game right?
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,[removed]
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,But. The thing I liked about red dead was that Marston was a chaotic good hero. Like he had a code and was always faithful to his wife. And even though he was murdering and playing poker you always had a sense that it was like GTA but with a moral compass. I'm going to be so damn disappointed if the new game is basicly Trevor on a horse.

730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Not real impressed so far. The textures and animation are clunky as hell. Maybe shove some shark cards into your budget and get to upgrading.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,I hope they actually do come out with the PC version like they said.

730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Y NO PC RELEASE!!!???
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Can't come soon enough! I loved the first one
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Any guesses as to what they'll call RDR2's version of the shark cards?
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Any word on if PC is getting this?
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Chances we get a PC port within 12 months?
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,I hope they haven't shifted all focus to the multiplayer when they noticed just how easy making money with multiplayer is (Gta online).
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,We need another zombie mode from this red dead as well
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"after watching west world it made me so fucking hyped for a wild west game, i really cant wait for this"
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Very cool
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Can't wait for the Marty McFly BF3 cowboy outfit.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,It's going to be strange to meet John in this game. I spent SO much time with his character...It'll be like meeting an old friend before you became friends.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Real Question here is the PC release timing 
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Literally felt chills this looks like it's gonna be an incredible game
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"I don't know much about RDR 1, however I love this time period in American history and would love to play this. Does RDR 2 seem dependent on the events in the first game? "
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"I bet you pick up John and play as him for a part of the game. Similar to GTA5 but maybe more focused on this new character and how he is a stand alone character that ads a ton to Johns storyline. 
 

Stoked to just ride a damn horse through the beautiful mountains. Hopefully I don't get triple teamed by bears too much.  "
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Im not even gonna watch this cause its gonna be several years before i get my hands on this as a pc gamer.

730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Looks dope AF
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,I'll bet you $20 this will be released on the Nintendo Switch.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Were playing as Lee Van Cleef, motherfuckers."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Hey so I haven't played video games in years and years, but this looks awesome. Should I play Red Dead Redemption before I play this? Would it still hold up or has too much time passed?"
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Fuck yeah been waiting all year for this title. 
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"When I read the title I went: ""huuuu what!"""
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"So the new protagonist (Arthur Morgan) is the voice we heard in the first trailer who said:

""When the time comes, you gotta run and don't look back.""

What if he was talking to John and urged him to leave Dutch's gang? Pure speculation, but that'd be a good way to get his redemption...2.

730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Eh, doesn't look that good"

730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Can't wait to see what the actual game play looks like. Hopefully they improve the horse riding physics and the dueling. I don't even play video games much anymore, but I want a PS4 to play this! Can I rent a PS4? Is that a thing?"
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Looks amazing. Can't wait for it. 
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"OMG, this game looks really good!"
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,I can't express my excitement.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Yeah.... I'll probably be making a purchase
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Looks fucking amazing <3
"
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,They better release this shit for PC as well.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,In what year is the game set at?
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,our new hero looks like pierce brosnan
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Does it confirm that you actually play as Morgan? It just says the story of, it seems pretty likely but not sure why they wouldnt just say ""play as Arthur Morgan..."" Im not against a new character, just think its interesting to think about."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,How can I replay RDR1 on PS4?
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Fuck Rockstar for not releasing on PC
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,From snowy mountains to alligator-inhabited swamps.... how big is the fucking map?! I need to know NOW
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,No luck for PC?
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"So no PC release. That's kind of a shame.
"
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Rockstar? Releasing an actual new game? What is happening!?
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,I cant fucking wait for this game!!!!
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,GOD DAMN IT ROCKSTAR FANAL FANTISY IS NOT A MODEL FOR GAME NAMEING/NUMBERING WE NOW HAVE TO EXPLAIN HOW RED DEAD REDEMPTION TWO IS THE THIRD GAME IN THE SERIES 
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,This coming for das pc?
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,So what's the best way to play the first one?
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,What in tarnation!?!?
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,I love this.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,PC Version?
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Well I guess I have to be finished with Forza 7 by Spring 2018.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Is John Marston in this game at all?
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Can this version have horses that are as easy to control as the vehicles in other 3rd person games please? I was never able to finish the original version because of the horse controls.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,You can only obtain horses by microtransaction.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"I want to be excited, I really do. But I played GTA Online, and I still remember [their broken promises.](http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/51955/gta-online-update-free-deathmatch-race-creators-this-week-captur.html)

Also the trailer was uhh... Not great."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,And the only thing I want to do in this one is put a damn crocodile on the train tracks. Boom! Boots for everyone.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Yea, but how much you wanna bet I can throw a football over them mountains"
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,It seemed like it took forever to unlock West Elizabeth - but was so rewarding when the time came
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Moreover you don't die from touching water in RDR2!
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,The man is a damn legend!
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Landon Rickets retired before John was in the Van Der Linde Gang, IIRC

""It means a little. You were famous when I was a boy."""
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Pretty sure the voice actor died soon after the first game was finished 
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Should be a DLC.  Landon Ricketts Rides Again.  You get to play a couple adventures of his, as told by a young John Marston.  "
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Putting 20 bucks down that in the end you go bowling with Roman
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"And when Morgan is dead, you switch to controlling John which completes the circle."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"I'm guessing it's when John finally wants to leave the life of crime with his new wife Abigail. Dutch orders you to track him down and kill him, and bring Abigail back. John has none of that shit."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"I would be ok with this, this guy does not seem as likable as John"
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Is the same actor on the IMDb page?
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Putting my 20 bucks in the hat for someone referring to your comment in a ""bestof"" post when you turn out to be correct."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"""We need an extra gun.""

That's probably Marston."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Just like in RDR where the main character John Marston is killed and you take control of his son Jack. In RDR2 the main character is killed and you take control of John Marston. Kind of rockstars way of apologizing for making us play as Jack.

I won't be upset if I'm forced to play as John, I love that guy "
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Armoured, rocket powered carriages? That'll be $100"
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,I hate that I agree
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"While this seems like a joke, it isn't that far fetched. They might actually do it."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,I heard there is also going to be a GTA Vs Skyrim crossover. 
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"$20 for 100,000 Buffalo Nickels!"
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Best death threat i heard in a while.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"I'm an idiot.  I didn't get this until I read the comments here.

I thought *""That sure is an ominous way to say he's going to help keep her out of debt.""*"
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"I thought he said ""on your bed"" and was so confused"
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Reminded me that Read Dead Redemption had the best-written dialogue of any video game I've ever played.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,I don't get it 
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,One of the unknowns could be Javier Escuela.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Notice how Marston is looking in an opposite direction than the rest of the gang? 

Wonder if that's a nod at his character arc."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Now that is excellent.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,I don't think Norman Deek was in the gang. If i remember right Marston didn't know him when they captured him. 
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,[deleted]
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Second to the right could be Escuela judging from the hat

Actually there's an article saying it could be Dutch in the actual trailer, just masked. "
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Yes, confirmed to be Dutch from the first game.

>The story of outlaw Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde gang as they rob, fight and steal their way across the vast and rugged heart of America in order to survive."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,I think the guy he was speaking to IS Dutch.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Prequel for sure. Now for the real question: is that [John Marston](https://imgur.com/a/qCkpM)?
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"The official description says:

> The story of outlaw Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde gang as they rob, fight and steal their way across the vast and rugged heart of America in order to survive. Coming Spring 2018 to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One systems.

So yes, it seems to be set before the events of the first one but it isn't exactly as prequel as it doesn't follow John Marston."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"That would be interesting, but he's shown roughing up a lot of people. My guess is he starts as a debt-collector and gets caught up in worse shit with Dutch's gang."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,He's a fucking synth
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,[Youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63h3v9QV7w)
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Simple attempt to really WOW us with the HD when the game is released
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,How much younger would you say he is here? About 20 years is what I'm thinking. Which means this game will probably take place in the 1890's.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Man I hope I don't lose resolution as I get older.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Hold X to root. Press O to toot. 
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,I hope it is E for everyone! /s 
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,I wonder if it'll be rated M!
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,I'm waiting for them to make a game rated A haha
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,I especially like those mountains and the snow. Tall Trees was my favorite landscape in RDR but now look at this!
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,The scene with the train coming to a halt in the pitch black of night surrounded by bandits was sinister. Rockstar are masters of their trade.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,the textures and aliasing actually looks pretty fucking bad. I can't wait for the story but i also can't wait to see this on pc ( i hope). 
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,The music gives me goosebumps...so many fond memories of playing the first one
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Why is all of this even in colour, I thought the world back then was black and white???"
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,A lot of technology was lost after the clone wars. 
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,/r/StarTrekDiscovery is leaking
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Marston was a masterpiece. Setting expectations too high will lead to disappointment.  I‚Äôll just be happy if the character is multi dimensional and not just a prick.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"I think our character will still be on a path of redemption. I mean, since they didn't change the name of the game it still has ""Redemption"" in the title. Marston wasn't a perfect man either, but he slowly redeemed himself over the game."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Has rockstar said anything about playing as one character the whole time? I know it's far fetched but how cool would it be that you play different members of the gang and he's essentially the main villain? It would be weird to develop the character switching mechanic in gtav and not use it again. 

If they said you are only playing as one character I haven't seen that and I apologize for my silly idea. "
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Marston was a great character, but his motivations didn't change much over the course of the story.  Maybe with this new guy they could make him more dynamic and have something happen that changes him in the middle.  Maybe Han Solo type character arc."

730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"I think they're going to release it for PC at a later date. But still, REEEEEEE"
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,What is volumetric snow?
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Assassin's creed 3 had this year's ago, surprised it's not in more games."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Well, gators are [cold blooded](https://youtu.be/zAvXbAJjMxM) aren't they? "
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,And anything GTA V did had to fit on the PS3 and 360. This is honestly R*'s first truly next gen game. 
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,[deleted]
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,It has to be. The shot with the guys in the trees was just like Assassination of Jesse James. Great movie.

big ass cinematography work for those interested "
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Yes.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,or what if they do something like the last GTA where you get to play as more then character and one of them is John? IDK I'm just spit balling
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,It's Marston
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Then you play as John Marston. It's like poetry. 
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,There will definitely be online modes.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Goddamit. Desperado dollars is hilarious except for the fact they'll actually do something like this...

730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"I play games to escape from other people. 

Every thing getting more and more focused online gets old."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"This is the thing that is really worrying me. I hope this isn't another gta where they stop updating single player and fill multiplayer with endless amounts of micro transactions and ridiculous, unrealistic items "
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Disapointed but not surprised ...
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,They'll likely do it a year or so later (like with GTA5) to entice people to buy it a second time. Sigh.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,OUYA exclusive.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"If there's a justifiable reason due to sales when the game releases, then we'll do it. - Rockstar

To this date we haven't seen RDR and it sold very well when it came out. "
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Probably a Pro :( 
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,I just want a sequel to The Warriors.

730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"I honestly wasn't sure if they were showing the main character/'hero' in this trailer, or whether they were introducing the villain."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"That's good, at least for me. Its a nice change from Marston, who was a good and honest man with redemption qualities. This time we could be a damn full villain, or not, 'cause Dutch was said to be a Robin Hood kind of guy, idealistic. "
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,*gators
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"aaaah yup, gonna skin me some gators.

*unsheathes knife*"
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Back again.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Maybe, but the Van Der Line gang formed out of a group of anarchists who followed Dutch wanting to help people, I'd guess that is where his good side comes in."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"I mean, of all things I'd spend money on...."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2018-02-01,Whammy
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"I'm fairly certain Revolver exists in it's own universe. That being said, a quick cameo would be a nice easter egg. "
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,The good news is it isn't even announced for PC
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,We did a train heist in the first game
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Maybe something pivotal happens and changes his tude.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Lol it was a one and a half minutes. Do you think marston could display is masterfully written character in 1:30? Give him a chance. No room for redemption? How can you tell? 

What do we know? He's a straight up thug. Sounds like there's room for redemption to me. He also displayed some interesting character traits like undying loyalty towards Dutch. Maybe that can be explored since marston wasn't loyal to anyone but his wife. "
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Doesn't seem to be any attempt or room for Redemption in this character, whom I kinda find a bit unlikable already.

Hell, I'm not sure I can justify shooting people's gun out of their hand in duels with this guy, which was one my favorite things to do in RDR.

Doesn't seem to be any Mexico, either, also one of my favorite parts of RDR."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,For all we know all of the included lines could be from the beginning of the game. Don't give up hope on a good karma run just yet.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,You waited years for a trailer? Of course you were going to be disappointed lol.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Rockstar does this a lot. Release little info, making the player want more. Clever tactic that has worked in the past. See: GTA 5's sales records."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"The departure of developer Leslie Benzies from rockstar is really going to affect the game quality. He was a very influential force in how well rockstar games turned out, and he is no longer with them."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Same here. I don't really see any new gameplay elements or anything like that. I loved RDR, but let's not pretend I already spent my 100+ hours in that world, and can revisit whenever I want."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,You obviously haven‚Äôt experience Rockstars blue balling much have you. 
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,That's just Kind of how it goes with rockstar. From now until spring they'll release a few more trailers and maybe some longer in depth trailers explaining aspects of the game. That's how rdr 1 was. 
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"I'd much rather be left wanting than be told more of the story. This trailer is supposed to leave you wanting more. It did what it was supposed to do. 

On the same note, I really want to experience the game the way Rockstar intends. They've never let me down before, so I'm happy to wait until they are ready to show more."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Rockstar always like to keep things quiet, I trust them to deliver."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-29,Uncanny valley I think is what you're referring to
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,To be fair one is CGI cutscenes and the other is In Game cutscenes. 
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,The models in this trailer will look the same in gameplay. The models in COD trailer won't be as detailed during gameplay but still close. They only do that extra detail on the faces during cutscenes.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Well when they make the same Call of Duty every year it makes it hard to get off. It's been 7 years since the last Red Dead, so there is a pretty big load built up"
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"This and The Last of Us: Part II. Too bad both don't have an official release date, yet."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Considering the amount of money they made through GTAO, chances are higher than RDR"
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,yes
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,They did the same for GTAV. It'll probably be released later.

730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,They've got plenty of time left but I was definitely surprised by how rough this trailer looks.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Lol the salt
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Yep, especially the ground textures at low angle."

730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,There's always one time traveller in the comments section who has no grasp of the graphical limitations of games consoles in this era. Get back to 2350 with you.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,It's true. Gotta love the fanboys trying to deny it lol.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-29,You make better faces for them then
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"I don't expect them to creep into the single player so I don't really care, though I don't play GTA so not sure exactly how much that holds water."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-29,Have you played the first one?
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,I still feel bad for Bonnie... And that poor Sasquatch. I almost had to start cutting onions for that one.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-29,"To me it seems  Morgan and Marston are gonna bump heads throughout ,mostly because of how contradictory Morgan seems compared to marston"
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,This is all game footage....
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-29,We'll be lucky if it comes to Windows :/
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,People will just complain that it was downgraded.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Yeah by the time GTAV finished it left a bad taste in my mouth. I got tired of playing such scumbags and being beat over the head on why society sucks.

730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,I‚Äôm waiting to hear as well. I will not buy a console to play this. 
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,They will because they make so much more money 
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,so release it a couple years later in an unplayable state?
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Aww? Did spoiled baby lose his lollipop? 
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,I'm sure it's coming to pc at some point. I dont want a switch version if its going to be a Wii quality port. Even though i love the portability it doesn't justify a shitty port imo. GTA V should come to the switch tho.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Not when they know idiots will buy it twice.  Worked for GTA so they'll do it again.  I'll pass on anything Rockstar.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Yeah they love screwing with the platform that made them relevant to begin with.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,which line is his?
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,By the looks of the trailer.. it will be Croc Cards. Or Alligator.. or whatever the hell that was.

730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,I pre ordered super mario odyssey. I feel fairly safe with that decision. 
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Yep. Kept thinking the voice was wrong as a result.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,We had one and a half minutes of him. We don't know him.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,You're like a hot topic emo of the gaming scene.

730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Definitely go back and get Red Dead Redemption.  I've been playing games since Atari and to me it's the best game I've ever played.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Time will tell - but Red Dead 1 was never released on PC, so it's safe to assume it won't happen. "
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Some of that looked like gameplay. The hunting stuff, the train bit maybe."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Didn't the original have an achievement you could unlock for putting a tied up nun on the train tracks?

730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Wasn't john left for dead?
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Had the same thought. A big part of what made RDR so melancholic and bittersweet was how likable John was. It was the end of the West, with motifs of slow dying, futile nostalgia, and decay. Attachment to John highlights that feeling of mourning; a thing that is watching itself becoming anachronistic. Interested in seeing what kind of a tone the sequel will have, being a couple decades previous."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Yeah already not liking the character as a person. 

Which is okay IMO. Watch plenty of shows that are still good but the protagonist or main characters are shitty people. "

730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,They've most likely been working on GTA 6 since 2013 as they worked on GTA 5 from 2008 even while releasing the standalone stories and the pc port. My guess is 2020 and the scale while be massive because they are the only company that can make 300 million dollar games that make a billion dollars in the first weekend... 7 years dev cycle for a much larger map and amount of cars and such sounds right for R*

730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"The fact that it doesn't follow John Marston doesn't mean it's not a prequel. It sets up events seen in RDR, it is a prequel. "
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Doesn't that mean that Arthur will die in RDR2? Thought it was established in Red Dead Redemption that Havier, Dutch, Bill and John were the last living members of the gang."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"It follows the gang that John was part of.  Shit, for all we know they could pull a GTA5 and let us play as Arthur, John, and maybe even someone else.  We'll see!"

730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"I don't think it's confirmed as a console exclusive, but they might do what they did with gtaV and bring it to PC after the console launch. Here's hoping."

730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Amazing movie, almost dreamlike in parts. Also the comment in the trailer that there being chased across states by the law has to be a reference to butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid "

730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Say what you want about Rockstar, but to successfully launch the same game 3 times and make 3 different fortunes out of it is pretty fucking impressive"
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Just like RDR right?
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Very likely. It means we wait longer, but if they spend years just working on the story, gameplay & making it work on consoles at 60fps, then I'm sure an extra year of optimisation and improving the game overall isn't such a bad deal. It's usually better than a company like Ubisoft releasing a game every couple years and either getting the story/gameplay right or the optimisation right, and not both at the same time."
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,They also blame piracy which is BS.  And basing PC sales on a year old product that was being released for a third time is also BS.  They just don't care about their PC audience.  It's been demonstrated time and time again with their stance on everything from concurrent releases to mods.
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,I have a few months to pick up a pro. I hope there will be a themed pro bundle.

Im sure you are, but be open to this having new favorites for you. Maybe things you will like better than Mexico and such (which I agree, was fantastic). 

Apples and oranges, comparing them may lead to disappointment instead of enjoying each as a stand alone. "
730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,Jesus it‚Äôs just a trailer. Let‚Äôs wait until we get the game to pass judgement on the story.

When they tried to do it on PC their game was defamed and went from positive to mixed, having a direct impact on a new buyers opinion on the game. Console players have no power and devs will rely on you to keep it that way."

730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"Funny you say that but what was way funnier was when hundreds of thousands of petitions flooded in to request rockstar not bring gta5 to pc. 

If I had to choose between playing rdr2 in 30fps or not at all I would probably roll with not at all. The only reason I even felt inclined to purchase a Nintendo switch was for BOTW. But when I heard it was going to be available on PC I figured it would be a much better experience. Therefore I didn't have to purchase a $400 console clunker, only the game I wanted. Now I have BOTW in 4k60fps. I mean others may get it in that quality when Nintendo ""remasters"" the game 10 years from now.

I'm obviously not going to get that pissed off if this game doesn't come to pc as I have a million other games to play at a fraction of the cost. I bought gta5 for PC when it first released and probably played all of 10 hours into. Looked like a great game but I just have so many other offerings it didn't really latch me in.

Also when did ""awww"" become a question?"

R* tried to make sense of it, but it just wasnt happening, too much code rigged together too weirdly to be decipherable enough to port the game without having to effectively rewrite it.

Keep hoping fir RDR2 on PC, keep signing petitions, and keep emailing. I'd bet we get RDR this go roind, but that it'll be 6mos to a year of console exclusive before it happens. R* loves nothing more than that double-dip cash where you drop 60 on console and 60 more on PC when it comed out later."

730ly6,2017-09-28,2017-09-28,"It does sound like there were a lot of problems with the RDR codebase. I also heard they did a lot of low level tweaks to get it to run nicely on the 3 core processor in the Xbox 360, then found it barely ran on the PS3, and they had to rewrite some pretty core parts of the engine. I seem to recall the PS3 version had a lot of problems for a while at launch. Not 100% sure if it's true, but sounds like a somewhat 'highly strung' engine to me.

However I'd assume if they remastered it now, they'd just rebuild it using the GTA 5 engine. That would probably negate a lot of those kind of issues in one swoop. The 'quest' system, visual fx and cinematic cameras, walking around, shooting etc. is all largely similar already. The main bits that are missing really are horses and carts, and I guess some of the mini-games and stuff.

Any full remaster is always going to be lots of work of course, but honestly I don't think they'd really use much of the original code these days anyway.

I definitely think they'd make a lot of money over what it'd cost to do, but why bother with any of that when you can just make a few new weapons skins or hats or whatever and sell stacks of shark cards instead..."

95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,The level of detail is nuts!
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,Well that's weird. Normally you cut those off a horse you intend to ride.

this'll have to do"
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"well, i guess we all know what we're going to be shooting at once the game comes out."
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,What we've all wanted and have been begging for. Rockstar has delivered our beloved horse testicles.
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"Fuck. 

Now I NEED to get a PSPro."
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Oh thank god I was thinking was going to have to buy dlc for that. 
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,What about buffalo?  I always liked seeing them on a nickel.

95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,I'm laughing so hard at all of these comments lmao 
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-13,That‚Äôs why the game has taken so long! Makes sense now!
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,It's juvenile shit like this that makes me love Rockstar.

95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Amen

95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,nice

I was really pissed when there was a controversy with Watch Dogs 2 for people having genitals yet I have that game and still haven't seen anything, plus I haven't even updated it thanks to shitty Internet "
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,People are gonna shoot the nuts off these horses
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,The feature I was most concerned about. I could care less about the story or graphics or mechanics. All I want is some fat horse cock with balls hanging. My immersion is off the charts now. 
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,This is it.  It‚Äôs finally here.  We made it guys.  The pinnacle of video game evolution.  I just want to say how happy I am to get to share this moment with each and every one of you.  I... I love you all.  
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Target practice will be fun!
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,My God. We've made it.
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,I'm glad someone took the time to get the information we all truly needed and were waiting for.  
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,You simulated my grandson's horse genitalia?! Y-y-you bunch of diabolical sons of bitches!
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,r/hentaibeast is gonna have a field day... Link is definitely NSFW and I've stumbled into some dark places.
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,You just know the first thing people are gunna do is shoot the balls
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,"You know they snapped a lot of horse nuts to get that realistic look, but are the physics there? Do they wobble to and fro?"
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,Thankfully good journalism still exists. These are the real questions I want answered
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,"Journalist: ""what did you do with extra power of these consoles""

95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,Imagine being the animator for that.
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,What about the penis?
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,No PC version for this game? ;(

*Please let there be a PC release*"
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,"Finally, it makes the game much more immersive. Also how are the bounce physics for them?"
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,Automatic pre-order. 
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,It's like reddit knows exactly what I crave.
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,"How is the horse balls physics, do they sway like real horse balls?"
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,Preordered
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,Totally read that as horse tentacles. The internet has ruined me.

95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,"Welp, here comes the porn."
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,I can't wait to shoot this 
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,But does it have jiggle physics?
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,Wow! That‚Äôs nuts!
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,"When they're gone after the inevitable graphical downgrade, I say we riot."

95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,"While neat that they decided to include this level of detail, its fair to say that the vast majority of the time if a person is riding a horse, it is a gelding ( no balls). Stallions are far far too dangerous, and don't train particularly well, and historically really weren't used in the situations depicted."

95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,"Look at my horse, my horse is amazing."
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,Come on we really need to track this? This I bet is a Corp bot advertising the game. 
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,Pretty sure I remember a scene in RDR1 when a crazy man reaches under and gropes his male horse. The camera follows and you see everything. 
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,Yeah but what about horse cock 
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,the fact this literally got more upvotes than the gameplay video just about sums up r/gaming really
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,"You ain‚Äôt never seen a set on a horse like this ones got, Clark. "
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Still better gaming journalism than Polygon
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,The developers are finally focusing on the important things
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,The best part of the entire game
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09," No day 1 PC release, fuck ‚Äòem."
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Upvote.  Good for Rockstar.  Genderless animals just look wierd...  even worse when studios use up  resources to digitally remove bits and buttholes from real animals in live action films.
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Feels bad whoever had to model them lol
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"Damn it, Irish "

95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"The real question is will ALL the horses have balls, and if so, then where the hell are they keeping all the mares!! 

Or... perhaps they just used geldings in RD 1 

Either way would be great if you could breed horses. Ha. I can see it now in RD3 , breed your own and get a whole new kind of horse.

95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"Wow just what I always wanted, the fact the horses didn‚Äôt have big dangling balls in rdr 1 really ruined it for me."
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"Finally, the feature we‚Äôve all been waiting for"
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Just went from a maybe to an insta buy. 
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Nice !
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"When the game will be out, you can be sure Rule34 will use this detail *wisely*"
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"Great textures, but what about the physics? "
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,What do I do with this information? 
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Finally now I can get some sleep tonight.
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"That‚Äôs all I needed to confirm that I will be playing, thanks"

95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,But what about ... oh nm.

95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,There's gonna be a castration mini game. Gotta  have that 100% authentic cowboy experience.
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"Oh, thank God. They finally gave us horse testicles. Because *that's* what video games have been missing. "
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,And now the burning question I have is will I ever get to shoot horse testicle on PC...? 
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Fuck yeah
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"My wife the horse vet said those look more like dog or cow balls. ""Someone doesn't know horses."""

95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"Testicle details aside, the graphics look amazing and I can‚Äôt wait for this game! I haven‚Äôt had this much speculation about anything since I finished season seven of GOT. "
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,This is really all that matters 
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Bullocks

95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Psh. Horse ain't got nothing on me. But I did just have a vasectomy and I think they're infected. 
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Yeah but the real question is if they got the physics right? I mean they really need to give them the dangle effect for it to seem real. 
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"Great, first Far Cry 5 had bulls humping and you have to shoot a testicle right before the my finish. Now RDR2 has horse testicles. Wonder if they'll have a mission associated"
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Finally. Realism in videogames.
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Yeah but they‚Äôre making it only part of the Season Pass :(
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"We have done it guys, we have reached the pinnacle of gaming, and i thought we plateaued at MGS5 shitting horse.  "

95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Imagine some graphic designer has to go through designing that damn horse testicals.
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"That's a good start, but I'm not buying it till I see full on confirmed horse dick."
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Oh good. Now I can stop worrying 
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Yes!
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,They better have physics 
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Thank god
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"Of all the knowledge to gain out of the gameplay trailer... horse testicles.

In all seriousness, most games that include animals (skyrim for example) tend to not have reproductive organs.  Nice to see them going for realism over ""child friendly,"" even if we are talking about horse balls."
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,So this is where the HD skyrim horse genitals went.
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"Why did I click this?

Why is this getting upvoted so much?

What the fuck is going on?"
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,And that's why the game won't be getting a PC version folks.
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Nice

95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Literally playable 
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,And here I was being skeptical about the sequel 
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,I‚Äôve waited a whole lifetime for digital horse balls to be a thing. Now I can die a happy man. 
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,There better be horse shit technology like in the Metal Gear Solid: Phantom Pain
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,I just want a PC port....
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"But how far does it go, do the bears have genitals, the beavers, what about the alligators?"
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,The bulls in Far Cry 5 are to blame. They started it.
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"Jokes aside, how much more work must that have been for the animation team??"
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Finally!
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Fuck sake now I know I have to shoot them no matter what one day

95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Does this mean there‚Äôs gonna be horse lady parts? I mean if they‚Äôre going for total accuracy you know there‚Äôs gonna be a horse on horse random encounter and if they all have balls.....
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Imagine how much thought and energy went into perfecting those simulated horse nuts.

95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,But do they jiggle?
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,No wonder it was getting delayed... 
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"FINALLY, a feature I've been wanting!"
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Wonder what would happens if you punch them...
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,This game is gonna be so lit
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,It's Red Deads version of the gas cap in GTA 
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Finally! 
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,This game has... Balls! (‚Ä¢\_‚Ä¢) / ( ‚Ä¢\_‚Ä¢)>‚åê‚ñ†-‚ñ† / (‚åê‚ñ†\_‚ñ†)

95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Are these accurate horse balls because they look kinda tacked on
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,So this is what we choose to focus on?
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"Ah yes, 'cause I remember thinking when playing the first two Red Dead games that ""what this really needs to tie together the horse-ass-bobbing-up-and-down experience is testicles as well""."

95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Nice
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,But will there be Tijuana Horse Show in the game?

95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"I'm amazed by the detail in the horse model in general. The muscles look strong. And they seem to have a variety in breeds. Like strong, powerful work horses. And I'm sure they have swift...are they thoroughbreds? What are fast horses called? Besides your mother?"

95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,Gonna see how real they are and shoot my horse in the nuts

95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,Is it bad if I zoomed in???
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,Most important news today.
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,I hope they make gelding your horse a mini game
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,The testes may be there but it appears as though the picture on the right is missing a rather large penis that would undoubtedly accompany said package
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,I‚Äôm shooting them

95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,I can‚Äôt wait to stare at them for hours........
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,"So, when's IGN's review about horse testicles being the 'future of gaming' gonna be out?"
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,Now the real question is if they have jiggle physics
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,to think some guy had to sit there and sculpt those bad boys in a render program. 
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,"I mean hey, realism and all, but does that also mean they include horses _without_ testicles? Because that‚Äôs realism too."
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,The future is now
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,In awe of the size of those units 
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,time to preorder then 
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,I hope there are both male and female horses. It will help with my immersion. It would be neat if they had a few different personality traits too. I know I am asking too much.
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,But is there going to be alpaca testicles?
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,Whats wrong with that? Adds more realism motherf
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,Lol why is this even a thing

95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,"The million dollar question has been answered!
I wont lie, whether or not i purchased this game highly depended on whether or not they showed horse testicles."
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,Thank you for including a photo of actual horse testicles. Needed to verify this for accuracy 
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,oWo
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,You can upgrade to the bigger ones after winning 10 races.  Chrome ones after 50.
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,Oh thank God! I can rest easy now.
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,"If those horses don't buck and start kicking like madmen when they get shot in the balls, I might be severely disappointed. 

I could almost see a Hitman-esque special kill with that. Target is standing behind the horse. You shoot the horse in the balls, and it kicks the target in the head and kills them. 

I apologize in advance if Rockstar somehow sees this and delays the game for another month to add this exact scenario to a bounty or something."
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,Horse testicles confirmed? I can finally justify pre ordering. 
95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,"I wonder if graphics settings affect this. ""Horse testicles"" should be the name for one of the options in LoD menu"

95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-10,As minor as this may seem... it is way more Emerson‚Äôs when I can see testicles... now every time I don‚Äôt see testes I‚Äôll assume it‚Äôs a fixed animal.

thank you, internet. I love you."

95yx0e,2018-08-09,2018-08-09,"I thought the same thing but you've forced me to search 'did cowboys geld their horses' with unsuccessful results.

It's true that a lot of the bad behavior we see from stallions today is due to the fact that most owners lock them in stalls all day. They aren't nearly as crazy in the wild and people from many countries ride stallions regularly.

Stallions used to be used for war and were apparently pretty reliable steeds. But I'm just not sure what cowboys rode.

So idk basically but good point"

Side note: the most painful thing I've ever witnessed was mom's stallion being castrated. We had the Amish do it who don't use anesthesia because horses have a tendency to panic coming out of anesthesia and hurt themselves. So, just local numbing.

So, they tied his tail to the rafters, numbed him up a bit and then took some scissors and snipped. 

Poor guy, crossed his legs, moaned and passed out. Took like 4 guys to hold him up. 

Worst part was when they threw the testicles out into the barnyard and the dogs came up and started eating them. They crunch pretty loudly."

 Its a procedure can be done on ""teaser bulls"" to prevent intromission. Penile-prepuce translocation. Its a surgical procedure to move the penis off-center so it penetration cannot occur. This is used to either determine which heifers are in estrus and can sometimes increase artificial insemination success rates. The sheath is stitched up and and an incision is made so the penis extends at an angle away from the main target. Sorry for this weird science fact."

kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,I‚Äôm replaying RDR 2 right now for the first time since launch. Such an incredible game. I‚Äôve turned off the mini map and I‚Äôm just getting around based off memory/reading signs etc. spent about 30 minutes yesterday just reading Arthur‚Äôs journal. And I‚Äôm happily pokin around in Chapter 2 with the absolute demon Strauss mission being the only thing on the map to do
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,That's a lot of DNA you used.

kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,Damn this made me emotional! Also it makes me really want a movie/series with Norman Reedus as John.

kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,Such an emotional game. Had to stop playing a few times because I was upset about what was happening
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,It‚Äôs beautiful. I‚Äôve looked at this for five hours now.
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,That‚Äôs so damn creative. Very cool!

kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,This is next level art. Love it!
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,shut up and take my money

kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,That's fkin awesome and impressive. I hope you didn't hang it up in your bedroom lmao
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,Like the idea but to lock in that spirt animal vibe the animal eyes and human eyes should have been on top of each other. This might require a larger picture to accommodate the spacing of the characters.
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,God damn it Dutch
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,"Damn, you doing prints? I‚Äôd consider buying depending on the price"

kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,Why does this remind me of [Avatar Aang](https://youtu.be/kXShLPXfWZA?t=708)?
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,2 brothers. Such a damn good game.
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12, I didn‚Äôt know Fred Armisen was in RDR2

kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,A friendly criticism. The shadows on arthurs nose seem too dark and almost push it behind his face.

kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,Norman Reedus and Markilpier are in RDR2?
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,Why is Daryl the wolf?
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,...so you painted with jizz?

kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,"Jesus, that‚Äôs amazing...
It also just made me emotional thinking about the story of RDR2 and the significance of that particular scene."
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,This will probably get buried but did you use UV paint first or finish the regular painting and use it after? Thanks!!
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,You didn‚Äôt even need to show yourself. That‚Äôs true pride.
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,I like it alot! I dont have the money. You could sell it for 3000$ easy at ebay :D
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,The left one kinda looks like norman reedus

kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,"Spoiler tag? I know this game is a couple years old but even the general red dead subs still use spoiler tags, and this could ruin a pretty great moment for someone who might not have played yet"

kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,Is there some significance to when Arthur sees the buck? Is the buck a symbol for something? I've beaten the game and never understood why there was a buck in Arthur's 'visions'
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,This is incredible i would pay for this any day. Great job
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,Honestly this is a very nice and detailed touching painting that represents the game perfectly

kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,I would literally buy this and hang it somewhere. It is incredible on all levels and completely encaptures the feelings red dead 2 got to arise in me.

kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,"If you mass produced this, I‚Äôd buy it. That‚Äôs a hella cool painting"
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,Two of my favorite characters from any form of media. Of course both Arthur and Marston get fucked.
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,Red dead cyber redemption lol
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,"chefs kiss homie or homegirl

kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,That‚Äôs super impressive!
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,I'm afraid to ask what did you paint the animals with :O xD
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,Amazing
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,Wow. Just wow. You‚Äôve got serious talent

kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,That's so fucking sick
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,Wooow this is amazing
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,Oh Arthur.
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,"Holy shit, this is awesome dude!"
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,"This reminded me of Harry Potter, specifically Sirius (a wolf) and James (a stag) when they transform into their animagi forms."
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,"Quick question, how do you do that? Like what paint do you use?"
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,Toooo soooon still!
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,This just made my day.
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,fucking gorgeous
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,I want Norman Reedus to play John Marston now.
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,I miss Arthur.
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,Whoa... This looks so nice!
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,Looking like a tarot in cyberpunk
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,Man this hit me on so many emotional levels omg. Get these onions out of my face.
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,Ahh so cool
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,"I like it, and I have no background in art or anything but Arthur‚Äôs nose seems a tad long"
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,As someone who always give rather a beard it‚Äôs strange to see him with a shaved face
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,That's Dino dna
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,"Okay, so OP, Christmas is coming up and there is now only one thing on my list."
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,That‚Äôs dopeeee
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,I like everything about this.
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,"This has become my instant and singular favourite piece of fanart and interpetration of John and Arthur as protagonists.

(and I know that Arthur could also be the black coyote if you make him, but it's a Redemption, not a Tragedy, so... I think he's the Stag, standing unshaken and wit his head held high)"
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,Didn‚Äôt take me long to save and upvote it!
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,You should do a painting of Micah with a rat under him
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,You really managed to capture romantic atmosphere in this painting.
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,I do not want to know what kind of paint you used for the uv light animals. Nope. Just don't want to know.
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,Dammn this reminds me I need to syart my 5th playthrough.
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,"Like it, i Love it"
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,Awesome
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,"Yeah, I like it."
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,I like
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,I'm replaying rdr2 now and your painting is breaking my heart a bit.
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,I love them boahs
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,Why does the guy on the right look like markiplier
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,"Took a screenshot of this scene in-game among others. Going back to look at them, it feels like I'm actually seeing Arthur's life as a real person. From pics where he's just casually smoking looking bad ass, to pics of the gang having a party to pics right before major events happen. Really incredible game, amazing story telling & top tier soundtrack"
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,"You did an amazing job, although I can't keep thinking that the guy on the right(I think it's Arthur) looks like Rico Rodriguez from Just Cause"
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,Thats really friggin awesome!!! Good job
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,"To think that such a great ending was made by a company with the largest pay to win scheme is crazy. 

Loved RDR2 to death."
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,I want to buy your entire stock
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,For some reason That's The Way It Is started playing in my head and now I have mixed emotions. I am: ***speechless.***
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,Unbelievable job
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,Patronus
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,Now do one for cyberpunk... You don't even have to draw anything.
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,This gives me pain....
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,"I have just beat RDR2 1 hour ago, literally saw that scene on my TV and almost inmediately saw it on Reddit. Such an epic game, such an epic art."
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,i would pay so much for this
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,This amazing artwork!
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,Thought that was Norman reedus for a second
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,"uhhh, what are they drawn out of"
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,My favorite scene. Just beautiful.
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,John looks just like Norman Reedus. I'm not even mad.
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,That's pretty amazing.
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,Looks like he‚Äôs about to lose his bending
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,That is awesome! How do you guys do this stuff?! I see things all the time that are amazing and I just don‚Äôt know how people do them! They do them on the same machines that I have but I am clueless‚Ä¶ LOL
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,Dear god this is amazing
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,I'm playing right now and just discovered I can't do anything about this sickness... Fuck... Haven't touched the game in a week... Don't want to end it...
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,I'd pay many monies for that shit.
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,This is beautiful
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,Absolutely amazing man.
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,I love this so much...
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,You are insanely talented.
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,Ehh yerr alright boah!
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,That‚Äôs bad ass bro.ü§ô
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,Sorry thought this was a hotel painting and the uv paint was... something else.
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,"If I had it, I would forget about it and randomly shine a light there and scare the hell out of myself"
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,"Still one of the best games I‚Äôve played! And to think, I only bought it as a joke because I didn‚Äôt like Westerns then."
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,Oof just experienced this scene a few days ago. I wasn't ready to cry again :(
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,really nice!!!
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,"neat, why?"
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,Maybe this is the reason/inspiration and already general knowledge but there is a base camp flag in online that you can get with someone in a wolf headress and someone in a elk/deer headress looking at each other. I am new to the series so this may be a meme I'm not aware of.
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,"This really emphasizes why they should have never allowed you to change what hat Arthur wears. Handing HIS hat over lost a lot of meaning when I never used that one.

Instead of passing on a precious heirloom, it was more like oh I have this old ratty thing in my bag you can have."
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,Apparently I have super sight. I'm seeing it right now without the UV light.
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,"This give me a sad feeling, nostalgia"
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,Looks like Arthur is about to take his bending away
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,My eyes watered up at this. Thanks for immediately bringing back memories of such a great game. Love it!
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,Spirit animals?
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,Micah with a snake? Dutch with a donkey?
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,"Its urine, the secrets urine!"
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,The right looked like the wendigo
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,that's awesome!
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,This. Is. SICK!
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,"‚ÄúWhen I tell you to run you run, and don‚Äôt look back.‚Äù"
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,Red dead Redemption is a great game the end is just sad
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,This is the best RDR2 related art I‚Äôve ever seen!!!!
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,Looks like Negan and Daryl lol
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,"Am I wrong in thinking that, just from looking at this image, that Norman Reedus would make a great John Marston?"
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,Talent alert
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,Why must you hurt us this way?
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,I fucking love this
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,Looks like someone busted a nut on the painting.
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,I thought that was John Travolta at first glance lol
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,This is so beautiful
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,I just finished playing that game today

kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,"I like to imagine in 100 years some dude is gonna buy this having no idea what red dead was, then accidentally shine a blacklight on it and be like ""YOOOOOOOOOOO"""

kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,"I still couldn't play the game because I can't afford any console or anything to play it on, but I've seen videos of it and I know it's a really good Game
And you did a really beatiful job with the paint it's honestly really good"
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,Got my first silver award for free here and decided to give it to your awesome painting before it disappears in 24 hours.
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,"Not gonna lie, I thought this was cum"
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,It'd be cool (not that it isn't already) if you did it so that the animals would glow in the dark.
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,Will you sell it?!?
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,"I'm so fuckin glad I just finished the game, so that now I can fully appreciate this."

kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,HOW DO PEOPLE DRAW THIS GOOD?! I hope one day I can draw like this I would totally do this and like you do a bit of invisible ink it seems so cool to me
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,So a wendigo being friends with a werewolf.

kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,That's some artistic fapshot!
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,Do these animals mean something to the characters?
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,Looks like he's taking his bending away... For good.
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,You deserve the next rdr3 for free

kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,I get a huge Farscape vibe from this.
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,"Hi, I LOVE you :)"
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,**Skill IOOO**
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,This reminds me of a friend who played GTA IV without the map and memorized the streets.
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,"His journal is so good! How he writes reflects a lot of things. Like the way he actually writes the words on the page, or underlines things. I found that to be just as rich as the content itself."
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,I restarted the game and now that I‚Äôm at Valentine I don‚Äôt want to progress the story every again. Just enjoy the optimism
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,"Yeah good luck completing the linear missions without the mini map.

I tried it and wanted to die."
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,I think a lot of people are going back to or starting RDR2 for the first time since they are disappointed in Cyberpunk release. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs Rockstar or Steam but if it is Rockstar then they are very smart because RDR2 is on sale for 33% off.
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,I love doing this in games! I‚Äôve started to just turn the hud off entirely and try to go by memory it‚Äôs very fun and difficult

kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,"On my replays, I just stay in chapter 2. It has everything/everyone I need."
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,"Ohhhhh nooo, I remember  that mission..."
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,I‚Äôm playing for the first time. I think it‚Äôs one of my favorite games
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,"I played through the original Assassin‚Äôs Creed with the UI turned off once.  Got lost a few times and some missions were a pain, but wandering through a busy market never looked prettier."
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,I‚Äôm going to replay rdr2 without the map. It‚Äôs sound really fun. Also what‚Äôs you opinion on first person?
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,Yeah the replay is really good. I remember feeling rushed to learn the story the first time through when you wanna talk to friends about what's going on. The second time I enjoyed the hell out of the first party night in chapter 2 just talking to everyone exploring all the dialogue they had created.
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,that's actually what I'm gonna do my second play through. I felt like I cheated myself by not taking the time to enjoy the tiny details like his journal and take on various side missions. I'm gonna take it slow this time around
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,Dang I should try that. Sounds fun
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,"Yeah I replayed a couple of weeks ago too, first time since launch, and on pc instead of ps4.

My second playthrough is definitely my definitive experience with it. They story really sank into me this time. I was able to let myself be far more immersed into the world, the characters. 

And my God it's one of the best stories I have ever experienced.

And Arthur Morgan is one of the best fictional characters I've ever seen.

And it's also absurdly beautiful, witch incredible graphics and visual direction, and with a hauntingly good score."
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,Sit at campfire so that you hear the conversations
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,I want to replay too but it's too hard when you know what the train is heading toward.

kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,"I wouldn't go as far as saying he's the best character of any media for all time, I have no opinion of who is though. I would say that his story feels like it conclusively disproves Roger Ebert's claim that video games can't be art.

One of his contentions was essentially that video games don't enlighten us in the same way that other mediums do, that they can't be related to and learned from in order to explore the human condition. I think the sheer fact that you can dig for so long into the meaning of Arthur's struggles against civilization, Dutch, himself, time, etc, and easily find something to relate to in your own life says otherwise.

Another claim he made was that the act of controlling a character inherently removes you from the artists intended perspective, but I'd say that Arthur's story wouldn't be nearly as compelling without all of the exploration you do in between or the choices you're forced to make along the way. Sure, in the end there are only really a few ways the story can end, but that's the point. The artist's perspective remained despite the control they allowed you to exert because they constrained you only to certain choices in the same way that Arthur's choices are repeatedly constrained by the forces bearing down on him.

Edit: I'd also say that no movie, book, or painting could likely ever capture the feeling of a world without civilization in the same way that an open world exploratory video game can."

Jim Milton's drawings were a slap in the face for me haha. I had gotten so used to Arthur's talents. At least John tries.

I just finished my fourth playthrough so I have a lot of thoughts and feelings about the game and characters. Arthur really is one of the best characters I've come across.

kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,"At first I thought I agreed. And the more I thought about it. Nah. Rdr2, is amazing. Truly a master piece. However, you do not want every open world game to try and be red dead 2. I can't really explain it any better than that. Red dead can be inaccessible. 

Now. Cyberpunk has it's slew of problems right now. 

However, there are things that kick red dead shit out of the water for it being a consumable piece of content. Like not relying on the huge dated. Go to place - ride with person to new place while talking -do mission. There are conversations in cars while your driving. But as soon as you wanna be done talking they have a little skip ride button. I've actually intentionally set down through the 4 instances of these rides in 20 hours to see the city. 

The flow is also really good I think. And would be impeccable if not currently plauged by bugs. Like. Everything seems to be designed pretty fluidly. As well as being pretty fast paced. Which is something that I didn't really expect. Then the game flies between these tender moments where I'm talking to characters about real shit, about trying to fix the world, about loss and then just a few minutes later I'm thrust back into the absolutely brutal cyberpunk world. 

The writing and performances of cyberpunk are amazing. I've had to really crazy conversations with Judy and takemura. And I really think they are the best video game conversations I've ever heard. 

Sidenote, RDR2 is my second favorite game of all time. But I'm not sure it or GTA are benchmarks for what open world games should be. They are great. I'm just not sure that's what *every* open world game should arrive for. But if you wanna make me a fluid open world game that feels pretty good when I'm Just running around doing the smallest jobs. I'm absolutely fine with that."

kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,Cyberpunks world is disappointing it feels empty outside of story missions and side missions. The npc ai feels very dated. There's potential for Cyberpunk to be a great game but it needs a lot of work before it will be there.

He was just so relatable. Especially considering he's an outlaw at the turn of the 20th century, which is about as far from my present environment as you can get. Such a complex character. His intentions make me wish he had a better outcome, but I understand it when we consider his actions.

I fired up a new game so I could play as Arthur again. I just pretend his cough is a smokers cough or something..."
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,People out here downvoting opinions with valid reasoning? Arthur Morgan wouldn't do that.

kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,The way point system in that game is genius and just one of like a hundred things the game doesn't get enough credit for.
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,Ghosts of Tsushima? Is that an RDR2 Single player expansion?
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,"I use the map a lot as well... but If it‚Äôs certain areas I usually know where I am... may not know specifically on the map.... but what‚Äôs in the surrounding areas. I also use a technique that I use in the real world as well, where I make landmarks.... like in the game, my apartment building is a landmark... I know if I leave my garage there‚Äôs a convenient store right across the road, and two blocks going east is a ammunation, a little further is a los santos customs, the one where most car meets happen."

kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-12,Me either. Always wondered why I‚Äôd have a defined beautiful sketch of an animal and on the same page there would be some scratch that resembles a bird
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,"I disagree. I see this complaint crop up alot. The things to do outside of quests are the gigs. Which may just seem like more side quests. But they definitely aren't. They are the bite sized, random encounters.  I had a guy try to rob the cafe I was in. It took about 3 mins for the whole encounter. And I'm legit not arguing semantics. The things you do during gigs are way different than side quests. 

Otherwise. Did you want to go bowling? What outside of the missions was there a need to do? I'm trying to think of examples but coming up with zip. 

I'll agree the AI is lackluster. But, I don't really go to open world games for breathtakingly amazing AI. There goons for you to use your cool abilities on."

I definitely didnt se him as ""relatable"" his life as very different and I didnt feel that me and him where en close to being each other (except the commiting mass genocides every now and again) but that isnt nessiceraly bad he isnt you he is Arthur.

And he was the most human like person ever and the story went try to shame out his life that he took (no choice or not) led to consequence and there life 

RDR 1 AND 2 SPOILER WARNING.

Despite there best efforts to make a good future for Jack yet he just couldn't run away from it. It isnt overly edgy  its ist realistic and deep and complex.

But it isnt call of duty 0/10

I could go on and on about Ghost of Tsushima. It does so many things so much better than its peers. Then they gave us this amazing, fleshed out, addicting co op multiplayer that they did not promise us and did not have to do for FREE. Legendary"
kbtw9p,2020-12-12,2020-12-13,Yes. Arthur Morgan stops the mongol invasion of Japan. Gripping stuff. Doesn‚Äôt make any fucking sense though

That was my childhood. 
It was sad seeing GameStop occupy all their empty locations here in Texas growing up.  "
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-25,"Woah! 

Hey guys

Welcome to EB Games "
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-25,EBGames is still a thing!? 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-25,Ohhh shit. I remember my local mall had both stores right next too each other. Gamestop is still there and EB games is a book store now. I preferred EB over gamestop. But that's just me. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-25,Anybody remember Babbage's?
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Oh hey, South City."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-25,Where are the balls
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"I worked at the 2nd EB Games ever opened. The VP of the company came in once, nostalgically looked around, and told me he opened this store. They were a great company! And if you ever worked in a mall with a Cinnabon the smell always triggers memories."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Everyone talking about ""EB Games"" and Gamestop being their childhood... I still remember when they were Babbage's and Electronics Boutique.

God I'm old."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-25,"Eb games is like the British version of game stop right, or am I thinking something completely different? "
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,is that west of loathing?
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-25,Do the balls shrink in the cold?
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"EB games, this one looks clean and nice.  I really miss these.  Walking in seeing full cardboard cutouts, physical games, full poster adverts.  I dont know why but I miss this environment when buying a new game.  Digital purchases and downloads have ruined that experience.  Yes, I know it's for the good and a ton more convenient but something special about going to a store.  Take this pic and look at it 15 years from now and people would be like wow look at those prices!  "
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I miss EB Games and KB Toys.

9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Remember when it was Electronic Boutique before EB Games?

9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,This is honestly pretty cute...
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Copy that

9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Make sure you remember to price match instead of paying their ridiculously blown out prices.
Picked up Red dead 2 this morning for 64 bucks Australian instead of the 110 they had it up for, just by asking them to price match harvey norman."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Wow I wish they still had those out here in CA. Gamestop sucks.. nothing will ever beat Electronics Boutique IMO though

9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-25,My local EB games got replaced by gamestop years ago. :(
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I wish they release the strategy books the day before the release.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,How much for the horse?

9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Does anyone remember a game store called GameCage or something? It was part of Blockbuster if I remember correctly.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,How is Eb around anymore? They charge approx $99+ for new releases and literally next door to many are JB Hi-Fis and they stock the game for $69. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,EB Games is everywhere here in Australia 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I miss having to go buy physical games. Since making the move to PC after the Xbox 360 I don't remember buying a physical copy of a game. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"I'm surprised EB games is still running, I mean video game stores in general have been in decline given how useless they are."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,That's cute
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Damn, the nostalgia. I remember as a kid buying my video games at Electronics Boutique in my local mall. Then I remember when it switched to EbGames. I moved to another state which had a Gamestop, that was the norm afterwards. I don't think I ever saw another EbGames after that. "
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Aw you know the staff got creative and did all of that! Love the passion!

9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Ah I remember going to the EB games at the Briarwood mall in Ann Arbor to play Dead or Alive on the xbox display. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"I wish eb was still here, GameStop sucks"

9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"As a teenager I once walked to the mall about 3 miles away while it was snowing and about 20*F outside to visit the EB Games when a game released. Loved that store while it still existed here in the US, I won't set foot in a Gamestop ever."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Local what now?
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Haha that's cool
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Mine were in cowboy outfits
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I saw Halo and XBOX for the first time walking through the mall and stopping in front of EB Games. I stood there in fascination as the Marines were sweeping through the covenant in the rescue mission.  I begged my parents for one after seeing it and got my favorite Christmas present ever! 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,The Saloon Doors..are *open*
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,EB as in Electronics Boutique? I thought they went out of business years ago. I got my Mega Drive from there years ago. Back when birthdays were still fun and not just mildly depressing excuses to get drunk.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,This makes me nostalgic for the old Babbage's game stores. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I do miss going to midnight release events for games but due to being an adult and having a job and responsibilities I haven't been able to get to one  since the original midnight release of grand theft auto 5 on 360 back in 2013.  of course i was an adult then to in my late 20s but still.  
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,What about Babbage's?!
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I had no clue these were still open. I thought they went out of business.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Come on, next you're gonna tell us it's a couple stores down from babages."

9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,It looks like they used some never-bought Nintendo labos to make a horse
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,This game is already out? I swear it was only announced just this year.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,...is it bad my first reaction was to zoom in on the horse?
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Now I thought I was excited for this game 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Man I wish the states still had EB games. I preferred them over gamestop.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,We only have GameStop in freedomland
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I haven't heard that name in years
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I love it. Also had no idea EB games was still a thing! 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,That's a nice horse.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I feel like I'm in some type of alternate reality 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Well, well, well we meet again old friend *spits into potplant*"
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Ahh reminds me of Toys and Joy's growing up in Hawaii. Best store for a gamer in the universe. Wanted a limited edition white Japanese ps2 slim. Toys and Joy's was the place to get it for a reasonable price. Then you can put your brand new ultraman model you got next to it. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,That is by a wide margin the least amount of balloons and sale signs I have ever seen at an EB Games.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"This is reminds me of the Gamestop nearby me. However instead of putting up cute little props and scenery, all the workers just walk around with raging boners while glancing at the poster every 15 seconds."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,How could they not be? That game looks amazing!
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Awww
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Goddamn how refreshing to see people just excited about a game. I love it. That's awesome. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Woah hey guys. Welcome to EB Games
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,This is like a block buster film release for a cinema. Game shops are gonna cash in

9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,The comments have basically turned into r/nostalgia

9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Your fucking what mate?
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"GameStop got shut down in canada, EB games took over. FYI GameStop, and EB Games is the same thing"
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Love the saloon within a game store, always fun to play wii fit while stumbling around."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"As a PC gamer I kinda almost miss EB Games sometimes. I haven't been since like, 2012 when I started buying only via Steam/Origin/Uplay/GOG. I miss the guys, they were awesome, actually cared about games in my local store.

Also as a pc gamer: incredibly salty about Rockstar not releasing this on PC. "
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Talk about pushing the boat....err horse out
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Someone out there is really proud of that horse they made :') it's beautiful
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"My mall had a Babbages, then I think it later became EB Games, now its a sports memorabilia store.

It is a shame that whenever I decide to have kids they will never feel the joy that I got of being able to walk into a video game store and having your dad or mom say ""pick a game out"". "
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,EB Games looks like a nice place to visit unlike Gamestop which for some reason always smells of ass?
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Damn, I wish I had a small local game store near me. All it is is just gamestop for miles"
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Hahaha I wish my GameStop was like this I kicked the door open and yelled YEEHAW PARDNERS when I get in and everyone looked at me like I was c r a z y 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Cardboard Cowboy is in there getting his early release!
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,EB Games?? Where can I find one of those?? All we have over here is jack off Gamestop
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"My local Gamestop was giving out pizza and drinks, and all the employees were dressed up as cowboys, we all just talked and waited until they were able to give us our copies, really nice experience over all. "

9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Ha, read that as E flat games"
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I remember when they only sold rock candy and polio at my mall. Ah those were the days=this entire comments section lol
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I went to pick up my pre-order for RDR2 at Gamestop and the entire place was full. I ended up going home. I'd rather wait 13 hours til they open in the morning than stand in line for an hour.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Nice. EB stores get paid extra commission of their store fronts get famous. Hopefully they see this. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I'm watching a guy bounce around on a plush horse. He's been at it for about an hour now...
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I remember when I was little my PS2 was broken and my mom brought me into EB games. They offered to fix it right away without charging my mom a cent. I love that place. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,This is all fabulous in its entirety but the cardboard horse is what really makes it 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I'm working the graveyard shift at the hospital but then I have 3 days off. Tomorrow I won't sleep in order to be able to sleep at night. Guess what I'm gonna do with my day..... 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"So I went to have a beer after work right next to the local gamestop (they usually close at 9pm est) they were still open at around 10pm so I was like sweet people still come out for midnight releases. I remember waiting for 2 hours in the freezing cold for cod back in the day. Here it is 10:52, as I went out to smoke a smoke, they are locking the doors because nobody came."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Woah blast from the past.... nice. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Hi! Welcome to EB Games!
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Are EBGames locations usually this clean? Every gamestop I've been to has been a crowded mess.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I thought this was r/nostalgia at first
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Hahaha I work at the store opposite this exact one!!! 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Dude I love when game stores did this shit. I remember going to call of duty releases that had tents set up inside with people playing the game and just chilling. Was awesome.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"When I was a kid I had a cousin who worked at our local EB Games. Every time we went to the mall I would get excited to see him and video games. He would see us, run out the store, pick me up like an airplane into the store, and then I‚Äôd get a new game.

Now all we have is a GameStop that offered me 32¬¢ on a trade in for my car. "
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Awe the horsey is so adorable :3
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Well this certainly is going down as one of the most hyped games in recent years.  I'll look forward to seeing the user reviews in the coming weeks to see if it's worth trying. :p
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Dude! Nice! Used to love the EB games out by me but then years ago Gamestop took over. Was funny cuz for a couple years there was 2 Gamestops right across the street from each other xD was even better when the ""original"" Gamestop closed and the ""EB"" Gamestop stayed until present day (the original Gamestop was run by elitist douchebags who turned their nose up at you if you didn't know everything down to obscure rumors about even more obscure games. The ""EB"" Gamestop just kept the EB staff and they were some of the nicest people you ever met. No wonder at all why one closed and one stayed)."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,EB games still around? all of them in ny were turned into gamestop or shut down
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Aw look at that little horse 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Just picked it up after work. Guttered, I went to Noel Leeming with a $60 gift card but they only had RDR 2 console bundles. I went to The Warehouse instead, currently installing. Looking forward to it haha 46 minutes to go"
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Call me skeptical but where are the banners saying it‚Äôs having a sale 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,OP was this South City in CHCH? I went in today to see why the Official Guide was delayed and did tease them a bit about the display.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Is that horse made from a sawhorse?
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Wow. This brings me right back to my childhood. 

I remember when the first one of these opened up in the town I went to high school. That was a big deal, because prior to that the closest one was over an hour away. As kids we were freaking out about it when they opened it."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Im saving this post and going to look back on it when GTA 6 is released and I want to see a pic of the exact store
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Bootiful
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I am so jealous. My childhood. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I'm more impressed that there is still an EB Games in existence. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Son, in my day it was Electronics Boutique. That's where you went to buy the hot new game
Civilization"
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"New hire at an Eb in Canada here! Just got back from a 9pm release of Red Dead at our location, stood outside in the fall cold for over an hour directing the line. Was worth it though, a lot of people were super hyped to play the game :)

Also bout an hour before we dropped it, an officer riding a horse knocked on our top windows asking if we were expecting a long line up tonight lmao X)"
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,lol I am more surprised to see an EB than I am too see the silly decor rofl
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Your local ebgames is adorable for still existing 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I walked into jbhifi as it is on the way to EB simply cos they said $69 for RDR2 and it was a shorter walk and otherwise I‚Äôd be at EB. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"If I had a platform to play Red Dead Redemption 2 on, I'd go to this store to buy it. Even though we don't have EBGames here, but this is some extra effort that wasn't even needed. They 99% sure made this by themself for fun, I like that."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,You know that horse was made by a nice young chick with purple or colored  hair. It seems to be an employment requirement in all my local EB games. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,It looks like a child‚Äôs birthday party 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,The first EB games I can actually see through into the store. They usually have a marketing campaign as aggressive as the wacky wavy inflatable arm flailing tube man ad.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Wait a second. Is that in centre city??? Never thought I'd see that place on here!!!
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,LMFAOO

9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Just got back from one of the launch events for this. The EB Games location forgot to let the mall know they were staying open late.

9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,its weird seeing EB games not covered in red plastic shit.

9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Holy fuck you still have an EB Games?! I thought GameStop absorbed them?

It must be FREEZING in there!"
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"EB is going the hobby shop or ""nerd den locale"" route more and more because of digital download. I never thought I would prefer digital until I eventually got 5 TB's of hard drive space. It was then I knew the true feeling of unlimited power."

9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,In idaho we used to have a bunch of EB games. Then they all got turned into Gamestops
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Wait EBGames is still in operation?
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,EB Games... EB Games. Now that's a name that I haven't heard in a long time.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,TIL eb games is still a thing.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,EBGames? That is a name I have not heard in many years.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,South City. The City of Dreams and Angels.

9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"EB GAMES? I MISS THE FUCK OUT OF THEM!   


  
(the gamestop guys in my hometown were always pretty good dudes, but still, EB just felt like it had more character)"
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,This looks like South City chch. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I remember Babbages... 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,U still have those there
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,The game comes out tonight but I don't get paid till tomorrow.... Dammit!! 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Anyone else have both EB Games and EBX in their area? I grew up near Plymouth, MA and our local mall had both. It was a god send. "
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,E flat games? What a weird name. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,What year is it?!
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I had no idea EbGames still existed!! 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,What no sale? 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I just have to wait 2 more hours here on the east coast. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,These still exist?!
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Wow, i have not seen an EB in so long! This brings back so much memories lol. "
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I didnt know those places still existed 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I literally was walking by here 6 hours ago üòÇ
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Wait EB games is still around???? I thought they went out of business! 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,TIL EBGames still exists. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Looks more like they're excited for West of Loathing 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Holy shit? But only true OGs remember Jam packs
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I feel really old that nobody is referring to it as Electronic Boutique 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Electronic Boutique still exists!?!
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Walked into my local GameStop today and they had some cowboy hats on and the guy looked me in the eye with my girlfriend next to me and says ‚ÄúGot your shitkickers on?! We‚Äôre gonna corral the heard!‚Äù
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,EB games still exists???
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,EBGames is still alive!?
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Woah, you mean there's an actual store behind the sales signs?"
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Interesting. 

I guess one EB is identical to another, more or less, but if it wasn't for the english-language promo stuff everywhere, I'd swear that this is the EB in Place-fleur-de-lys, Quebec City.
"
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,These still exist??
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"It's my first Red dead title. My buddy and I gameshare, so I bought something else and he got this. I'm a little peeved he pre-prdered it, but as long as take two doesn't rape this game with horse bucks or whatever, then it probably won't be that bad."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,The fuck?! THEY EXIST?!
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,EB games still exists?!? I thought they went the way of blockbuster back in the cretacious when i was a teen. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Holy fuckin Dawg cocks mane, this place still exists?! I haven't seen one of these mamerjamers since I like 1929."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,EB games still exists?? There used to be one at my local mall but now it‚Äôs gamestop
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,This place exists still?!?!
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,That's still a store?
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Can‚Äôt believe you have an EB games.....
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,My EBgames in Hamilton was done up to! I can‚Äôt wait to get home and play it!
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"If you want to see an absurd amount of gamestops, check out clarksville indiana.

When EBGames was bought, they never got rid of their stores. So now we're over flooded with Gamestops.

There's one right off the highway. There's one in the mall not even a mile away. And less than a mile from that down the road, there's another gamestop.

Too. Many. Gamestops."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"If you don‚Äôt already have it downloaded, EBgames is perfect for you."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"I'd wager whoever put the sign up was  under 5'10"""
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"EBGames still exists?

That's like finding a mf unicorn."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Wtf is eb games ?
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,how do those stores still exist when you can just download everything?
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I didn't even know EB Games still existed 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Etc? EB games went outta business...?
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"These still exist, what!?! I thought they were bout out by Gamestop  ages ago. All the EBGames and Funcolands near me (Illinois) were converted into Gamestops around the time Netflix and Gamefly first started (I think, poor memory, long time ago)."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,They charge about 40% more than anyone else. I really don't understand how people give them businesd
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Woah. EB Games? Is that you?
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"I thought gamestop owned EB games..? I'm probably wrong tho.

Edit : they merged apparently. So in places where gamestop was prevalent, all of the EB games stores have been converted to gamestops. In Australia gamestop had zero presence so EB is still a thing. "
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,FunCoLand was my childhood... was really sad seeing EB Games take over
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I came to say the same. I grew up with EBGames in my local mall and was sad when GameStop replaced it. Thought it ceased to exist so this brings me joy. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Which is weird, because Gamestop was/is a Texas company. They were and are headquartered in Grapevine, near Dallas. 

EB was out of Pennsylvania, I think."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"GameStop owns EB. It's only really in Canada, Australia, and some other places"
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Mine was Electronics Boutique. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"I am ashamed this wasn't my first thought!  

First: Aww lookit da cute cactus and horse! 

Second: EBGAMES? "
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Sorry to say but Gamestop actually owns EB. I used to work in a location in a mall that was EB and still had the old signage and down the way was another Gamestop, that was there before the acquisition. I asked about it because all my paperwork to sign on said Gamestop and was given the rundown."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I refuse to give GameStop my business.  Fuck em 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I worked at Babbages in a mall. It was awesome. At the other end of the mall was a Software Etc. Then GameStop bought both of us but we didn‚Äôt actually assimilate to much later. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Yeah all we have here in canada is eb games. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Anyone remember babbages?
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Don't remember any funcolands, but I grew up with EB, gamestop...and a BABBAGES! Which I was about to say must be some super obscure store...and it turns out it was the seed of the devil - what wound up morphing into gamestop! #TIL"
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Come to Canada, where the EB Games are fucking anywhere."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I‚Äôm in Australia and we‚Äôve never had GameStop. EB is still the number one retailer here.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Gamestop actually owns EB Games. But they are run as wholly owned subsidiaries, so aren't nearly as shitty as people say Gamestop is. "
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Hey it‚Äôs me, Texas "
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,EB games and does anyone remember KB toys? Media Play?
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"I miss EB games too, I remember when it used to be called Electronics Boutique"
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Yeah, I thought shit stop took em all over."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,KB toys tho üò´
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,My local EB Games just rebranded to EB X.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I grew up in Texas and I‚Äôve never seen another video game store other than game stop
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Don‚Äôt worry what happened to BlockBuster will soon happen to GameStop
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I always assumed EBGames had faded into nothoingness with Radioshack and Circuit City.  What is it with electronics stores anyway?
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Didn‚Äôt GameStop buy out EB Games?  And they use that name in Canada because GameStop was a registered trademark in Canada already?
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I still people freak out when they thought EBGames was gone... BUT WHAT ABOUT FUNCOLAND?!
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,EB games is all we have in Canada! 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Does anyone remember Tandy!?
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Wait, aren't they the same company? I always thought EB games was the canadian variant of Gamestop"
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Sadly these days they're all the same thing :( GameStop just continued to use the EB Games brand in some regions/countries after the merger. Other than the name, it's usually the exact same as any Gamestop location."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Same story in TN. Where do EB games exist still?
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Youngster, thats Electronics Boutique! "
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,EB games was in the US?! I thought it was just an aussie chain.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"As a Texan I was about to comment ""EB GAMES STILL EXISTS?!"" and then I saw this top comment. lol "
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Babbages for me 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Dude it's Photoshoped, OP is trolling for sure. Everyone knows ebgames disappeared along with all our hopes and dreams. "
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Everywhere here in Canada
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I worked There! Probably one of my favorite jobs.  It was before all the pressure sales stuff you see at Gamestop.  It was Electronics Boutique when I was there ;)
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,If you come to Canada we are still rocking eb games ;)
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"> EB GAMES?!
That was my childhood.
It was sad seeing GameStop occupy all their empty locations here in Texas growing up.

  Same thing happened here in Massachusetts "
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"As someone who worked for EB when the merger happened, a pox upon Gamestop.  EB had some annoying habits, but they treated their employees a hell of a lot better."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,GameCopy would be a game because there's nothing next to organic there. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Here in Canada we have no Gamestops just EBgames.  Yes they are just as good at giving you $10 bucks for a game that's been out for 2 days Gamestop.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Well GameStop owns them from what I understand. So it's pretty much the same thing. I'm surprised that there are some that still exist as EB games.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"EB Games is still around? I thought they went extinct along with SamGoody, Suncoast videos and laser disc."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,All EB Games in Canada
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"EB games WAS Electronics Boutique, which WAS Games 'n Gadgets.  Back when Commodore, Atari, and Amiga owned the walls And PC had a little tiny section of a wall.  Now GameStop literally has 6 PC games."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Sooner or later someone is going to buy out all the empty GameStop's. And that will mark the end of my childhood
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"In Canada and some other places EB Games is GameStop. They never switched the name when they bought EB out, and now it's just Canadian GameStop"
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I didn't even think EB was in the United States.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Since no one else has mentioned it: EB games is owned by GameStop.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I worked at their returns warehouse in PA in high school.  Best job I ever had.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26, Still all over the place here in AU
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,EB Games is still in Canada...but owned by Gamestop I believe. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"EB Games? Shit, son. When I was a kid it was ‚ÄúElectronics Boutique.‚Äù There was no ‚Äúgames‚Äù in the name."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Its the opposite in australia
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,We have a small chain where I live called Video Games ETC. it‚Äôs small and full of sweaty nerds like me and it‚Äôs usually run by people who actually know about videogames. Really neat little place
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Game Crazy was a personal favorite. They would game competitions every now and then. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I remember when it was Electronics Boutique 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I remember when EB Games was Electronics Boutique.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,And now gamestop's are going out of business. No need for physical copies anymore
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Ahhh the feels! The big guys always put them out of business. It's good to see this one is still running.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Off topic but you remember compusa?
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,is there even a difference other than the name
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Still EB games in Australia 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I forgot GameStop existed it‚Äôs kinda dead around me. There was a few but they all closed cuz downloading shit is the future 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,It still exists in Canada. It's technically owned by the GameStop company but EB despite being a part of GameStop now must have some control over how it does things as it isn't as shitty as it's owner (IE GameStop).
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Still all over Australia, except only suckers go there for games. Somehow they are much more expensive than other retailers. They're charging $100 for RDR2 but I picked it up for $69 at JB Hi Fi"
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I used to get all my games at Electronics Boutique then head next door to the Orange Julius on the way out. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Damn kids, back in my day we had Hastings, which basically was a video rental, record store, bookshop, electronics and video game store all in one place.  

Also, first made out with a girl there.  We were waiting in line to buy *Use Your Ilussion I & II* by Guns N‚Äô Roses the day it came out.  "
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Remember EB Games before it was just games? It was Electronics Boutique. I think they focused on games rather than compete with Radio Shack, a titan of the era."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Gamefellas in Austin was a good store. They still had N64 controllers and other old stuff. Closed down a few years back.  RIP
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,R.I.P. The EB Games in Grapevine Mills
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"I didn't even know EB games had stores in America, I originally thought they were only in Europe and Australia but I guess now I know better."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I miss Software Etc. That probably makes me really old...
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,EB Games is like the holy grail for me. Always the best feeling walking into that store...like a breath of fresh air
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"From Texas, can confirm. EB Games was great, got eaten by GameStop."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,EB Games are a plenty here in Canada.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Yeah! I loved EB Games!

""EB Games: Challenge Everything!"""
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Yeah I thought GameStop bought out EB. Guess not. I have fond memories of EB from my childhood as well. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw it either. A ghost from the past. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Babbage's 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-11-27,Same same. In new jersey all Eb games became gamestops. Funny thing is in my local mall there was already a game stop. So afterwards the mall had two gamestops.

9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-25,TIL! I thought GameStop bought them out. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"In Australia they are, they are starting to sell more merch than computer games and branching into board/card games."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Yeah, and they spared no expense with that promotional budget."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,It‚Äôs Canada‚Äôs GameStop. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-25,"There‚Äôs one in pretty much every mall here. I‚Äôve never seen a GameStop in real life, only heard about them from the Internet. "
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-25,Your mall has a book store? All the malls in my area closed their bookstore a long time ago :'(
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Only us old farts who also remember when it was called Electronics Boutique
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"It was Software Etc in my area.

Crazy how many different chains and brands got consumed by GameStop!"
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Yeah my hometown had a Babbages in the mall that turned into GameStop, then after that happened an EB Games opened up at a different part of town. Then after a couple years they got bought out and that one changed to a GameStop too. It was weird to watch."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I bought my first games at funcoland! Turned in to a GameStop at some point.

9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I'm right there with ya.  8 months from 40.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Oh my god ‚ÄúElectronic Boutique‚Äù. That‚Äôs a name I haven‚Äôt heard in a long time.  Man, I feel old now. "
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-25,"Its Electronics Boutique...we used to have them stateside till GameStop absorbed them all.

I miss EB, they were overall just a better experience to shop at."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-25,"As far as I know they‚Äôre the same! No idea why they have different names. This is in New Zealand, though!"
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-25,"Gamestop merged with EB Games, and kept the EB Games name outside of the US.  I live on the US/Canada border, have been to both places, and they're pretty much the same (well, they're the same now, EB used to be better)."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-25,We have ebgames in canada thats our version of it
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,EB Games was called Electronics Boutique in the UK. They were bought out by Game in the early 00‚Äôs.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-25,"English here I‚Äôve never heard of EB games ours is called Game we had GameStop for a little while a few years ago but not many and they‚Äôve since disappeared. 

I don‚Äôt know what yours are like but Game is a huge rip off. "
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"I think in the uk they are just called ""game"". Correct me if in wrong"
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,E flat games?
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Only if there's a spittoon in there
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,it just feels so much more exciting to buy the box then to download and then install for 2 hours. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Yeah. Convenient as it is, I miss the preorder goodies, the packaging, all of it. Sometimes, anyway."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"I miss it so much. There‚Äôs still one right near my house, but as a PC gamer now there‚Äôs just no need. I almost want to pop in just to look around..."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,My first thoughts were that this should be the top comment.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-25,Yup! ;)
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"When Harvey Norman has it cheaper, you know they're over-inflating the prices."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Rockstar are scumbags for not just coming out and saying if it's either eventually coming to pc or never.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Yup. We had one in the back of our blockbuster before it became a Hollywood video before it became an empty building.

9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"It was! I went there this morning post gym. The two guys in there were super friendly. I feel bad I didn‚Äôt ask permission to take a picture, and now it‚Äôs blown up, haha."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Haha, you might have to PM me to remind me to go take it!"

9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Could be an Australian one
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-25,Canada has them too. It's owned by GameStop but the stores are still EB
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,In Canada
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,America isn‚Äôt the only place in the world.

9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Pathetic slow connections. Thats why
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,only overseas 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"From what people are saying in this thread, they were bought out, but (probably because there were no Gameatops in Aus/NZ at the time, and they wanted to maintain customer loyalty maybe?), they left them as EBGames.

Clever business choice, if you ask me!"
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Same with Canada
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"I was working at EB Games when the merger happen. My town's local mall had both an EB Games and a Gamestop, less than a few stores down from each other. For some reason, they decided not to close either, so there was 2 Gamestops in the mall for a long while (and another one a few blocks away for some reason) "
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,You‚Äôre right. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"GameStop does own EB games.

But from what I've seen so far, EB Games still largely do their own thing their way. I have't heard as many horrible things about EB games than GameStop."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,yup. Also same in New Zealand where I am. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"It's funny because Gamestop went under back in the late 90s and EB Games stepped up to purchase them, but Barnes & Noble stepped up and bought them instead. Then Barnes & Noble gave Gamestop enough capital to buy EB Games instead."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Yep Gamestop owns EB Games, when I'd get a paycheck it would be from Gamestop even though I worked for EB Games.

From what I know there is little difference"
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Its funny, because here just north of Seattle, there are 2 malls that had 1 of each, and then (seemingly overnight) they each had 2 gamestops. Even better is the fact that both malls have 1 gamestop within at least 2 blocks, as well. "
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Holy crap dude...I totally forgot about FuncoLand!!! That‚Äôs where my game-buying originated.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"are you 32, too?

edit: holy nostalgia bomb haha"
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Bought my original PlayStation from Funcoland in Toledo, OH with my own big boy money when I was about 10-11. Worked my ass off mowing lawns and shoveling driveways. Funny thing is I wanted a Sega Saturn but the guy at the counter said I would be wasting my money. So I got a ps1, Gex 1, and FINAL FANTASY FUCKING VIII and the rest was history. "
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Pizza Hut was my childhood. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,GameStop bought FuncoLand years before they merged with EB.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Hell yea FunCoLand. Bought all my N64 stuff there back in the day. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,FunCoLand was awesome for trade ins
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,FunCoLand was my favorite place! I used to go there every weekend to look at the wall of Sega genesis games
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"In Australia, the only way to buy Steam peripherals is from EBGames. ""Fucken rip-off"" is what they should rename the company to. Its like $150 to buy steam link when its like $5 from steam AND a discontinued product. Suffice it to say, I refuse to buy any shit from these over-priced chain stores. Also, they seem to hate Nintendo products and only ever have a tiny section for them. During the hey-day of the Wii they often didn't even provide a section. I guess its a good place to go if you own an X-Box or things manufactured by Sony, however those are things I have never owned - I am so glad that the Switch is region free and has digital downloads so I never have to visit these scum merchants."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Just like Toys R Us, EB Games is alive and strong in Canada."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I had EB games and Hollywood video rental next door. Good ol‚Äô days 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I remember going to EBGames as a kid and really wanting that sweet 3DO on the top shelf. I still can't believe they would try to sell that in the mid/late 90s for 700 dollars.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Same here, EB games was great. I remember when my EB turned into a gamestop and the quality went way down. I remember buying the resistance 3 move gun bundle, getting it home and having the box be empty, I was freaked out, thought they'd think I'd stolen the contents or something, I called and they told me to come back in, they put all of the components in, the camera and one of the controllers had obviously been used, I paid full retail for used shit. That was probably 10 years ago and I haven't been back sense. I hate that place. "
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"They used to be headquartered in Grapevine, near Dallas.

They still are, but they used to be, too."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,How is that weird? It kinda makes sense that Gamestop would dominate and monopolize in the state it was founded...
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"GameStop bought EBgames. The odd thing was that GameStop took a lot of the upper management from eb, even though eb wasn't doing all that well and GameStop was doing great (at the time). Everything went downhill after that (in my opinion at least, I was a manager back when eb was bought)"
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Isnt that literally EB games? My dad still calls EBGames electronics boutique 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"That store took a pre-order of team fortress 2 from me then closed down. 13 year old me was so disappointed. (This was the original team fortress 2 that was never released, not the cartoony TF2 that is now f2p)"

I used to work for one as a Manager and I'm flabbergasted that they are still around. Given that they always sell new stuff at full RRP of $99.95 and JB-HIFI next door will automatically sell new stuff at $79.95."

9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Babbages started in 1984 and rebranded as Game Stop.  Electronics Boutique/ EB Games got bought by Game Stop in 2005.

9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I've experienced both in their current forms and I find them to be the same.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"The were originally different companies. GameStop bought EB Games, Funcoland and Babbages, and rebranded depending on the country. All ""Gamestop"" in US, all ""EB"" in Canada, etc."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Game != Gamestop.

Game started in the UK. Gamestop started in the US. Game and Gamestop both operate in Ireland, but only Game operates in England (Scotland, Wales, blargleblarg)."

9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,We used to have Game in Australia but they all closed down.

9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"We had Electronics  Boutique, which was EBGames before they abbreviated  here, certainly in the south of England where I grew up. They bought GAME though, and then rebranded all their EB stores to GAME stores. They were still trash though, same kinda overpriced garbage where they try to get you to buy a secondhand version of a new game at a massive saving of a couple squid.

Gamestation was far far better back in the day, before GAME then devoured them too and turned them into garbage."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"That's another chain. I think they only operate in the UK and Spain, though they're fucking powerful in both."

9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I sold them Battletoads before I was old enough to know what I was selling. However I got Metal Gear Solid and Final Fantasy VII out of it. The memories of that summer are worth more than money.

9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,The lack of **SALE** suggest otherwise.

9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-25,"We did have Gamestops for a while. Sometimes you'd have a Gamestop and an EB in the same mall. Apparently the EBs were more successful because of the connection to that name, so they all became EBs again.

Recently a bunch have been changed to EBX to reflect all the toys and Thinkgeek stuff they sell."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,They did in Sweden
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Yeah, that's how I feel about my city too.  For it's size it feels like there's a Gamestop everywhere."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Damn. Here in Spain, I've only ever seen a tiny bookstore in one of the largest malls in the country (was the third biggest in Europe when opened!) but it's true that most hypermarkets sell books and a lot of big malls have a El Corte Ingl√©s (Spanish dept store with a fair book collection) nearby/inside.

In Portugal, though, I feel like they do have a lot of bookstores there. In every mall there is a bookstore of a well-known chain, or a Fnac (you know, the thing that comes up if you mix a bookstore, a Media Markt and a Starbucks)."

Is that what the cool kids are calling Northern Ireland these days?"
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"We have a similar chain in Australia called Zing.  Owned and run by EBGames and is all about pop culture stuff, lots of shirts, toys, board games, figures and Funko Pops"
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,The one in Rideau is the only one?
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Pretty sure the EB in Brampton just got the lease on the place next door and expanded to be EB/EBX
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Barrie, ON?"
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Also had a mall with two GameStops. I think they liked living in pairs.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-28,Game stop never existed in NZ. It was mostly an american company but they had expanded to some other countries. Once they purchased EB games they just left them as is in Aussie and NZ because they were already known there. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Circuit City was my favorite place as a kid, that and caldors "

Edit: and also eventually funcoland and EB games"
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Oh god yes, I remember there being a Software Etc. on the first floor of my local mall and a Gamestop on the second floor"

9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Holy shit, I'd totally forgotten about KB. "
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,My sister worked there for quite a few years! I got Pokemon gold and silver from there. My grandma gifted my mom the money for a Gameboy advanced for me and she thought they were different games.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I used to work for KB Toys. It was my college part time job until the store closed in 2007. I miss it a lot. I got to play with so much fun stuff and selling toys was honestly a blast. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Used to bring those to school and read in class 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Hell yeah, so someone does remember! "

9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,They are. Babbages and Funcoland i think it was. They did a fusion dance then it went wrong and they became that like.... ya know... downsy one. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Long, long ago Funcoland was an independent company that had a really neat model for selling used games and systems."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,For sure
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"The best thing about working for Funcoland back in the day was... well, okay, it was getting to play video games on the clock when it was slow. Let's not lie.

The second best thing was getting to give honest opinions about how good games were. We lost a few sales that way, but got a bunch of customers who'd come in and buy from us instead of the guys in the mall because we'd let 'em know ""yeah, it was kinda crap"" (or pop it in so they could try it).

One time I had a guy come in who was deeply uncomfortable with his recent purchase of Soul Edge; it had demonic possession, and he didn't approve of Satanic content. I was able to convince him that it was -oriental- demonic possession, thus not related to biblical Satan, and that did the trick..."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Believe me, for a 10 year old Sonic fan this was a hard pill to swallow. But the joy that PS1 brought me between FFVII, FFVIII, Legend of Legaia, Spyro, and countless PlayStation magazine demos was well worth it. "
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,So good you'll want to eat it backwards 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Do they price match? I got Spider-Man there for $100 and a few days later walked into Target and it was $69. I was so pissed at myself.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"My Hollywood video had a gamestore attached to it but I can't remember what it was called.

We got our PS3 there and then I went and rented a ton of games with free rental coupons we got."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Dude I had a 3DO if that thing had more games it would of been a cool system.

9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"The one thing I remember about Circuit City was when I got $100 for my 16th birthday.  I went to Circuit City to buy something cool.  They had a deal going that if you signed up for 2 years of CompuServe internet (like $18/mo), you'd get a $300 gift card for Circuit City.  At the time, I had AOL but gladly dropped that for $300.  Bought a Playstation and a Zip Drive (100Mb disks, hell yeah!) with the gift card."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I bought my first CD Player at Incredible Universe. 
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Omg Circuit City was amazing! It‚Äôs such a shame they went out of business :((

it was SICK"

In high school I finally convinced him after seeing circuit city offered lifetime assistance on their higher end packages. He spent $20,000 on the latest and greatest projector / receiver / surround sound available.. I was stoked! A week later circuit city announced they were going out of business."

9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"So are EB and Gamestop. Gamestop didn't occupy the empty EB Games store, they bought the entire company and converted every store in the US, but use the EB name in Canada and the UK."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"They price match with stores within x KMs. So generally if the store is within the same mall or suburb, they'll price match..to a degree. I don't think they're allowed to price match if matching price is way way lower."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Check out amazon Australia, i got RDR2 for only $62."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Yeah they absolutely do. Harvey Norman have RDR2 for $64 dollars right now. I'll be heading to eb to get a price match this afternoon.

9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"I fucking HATED setting up for the June sale every year. You had to remove the contents (gut) of every game case out on the floor, then put them all back in after the sale if the item didn't sell."
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Most of their store is pre owned stock on sale.
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,Grab something from the Japanese bakery while you‚Äôre there too. The cookie bread is üî•.

9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"That's rough if you prefer physical.  Over here, I don't even need Gamestop to buy physical games.  I can just as easily buy them from Best Buy, Target, or even Walmart(ew).  Granted, none of those places sell used or old games like Gamestop does, but still. "
9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"And let me guess, it's still full price or more expensive even without the packaging and cost of the storefront in its entirety (wages etc)? "

9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,"Lol, my friend and I used to go there in high school and laugh at their service pricing. It was like $150 for hard drive installation. Not sure why we went there at all other than to look at random computer stuff."

9relgh,2018-10-25,2018-10-26,I bought an eMachines with compuserv 2 year contract.

58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"Looks like the time period for this is going to be before Red Dead Redemption.  I'd wager sometime between 1860-1880, given the content in the trailer (large amounts of roaming buffalo, railroad, oil wells, people's clothing, etc).  Of course, they may not be going for total historical accuracy so they could set it whenever.  I'd love a game in the 1840s focused on western expansion.

One thing I can definitely say is, its going to be infinitely easier to hunt animals.  It was really hard to spot foxes and skunks on the PS3 game, but they are quite clear in this video."

58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"In many years time, I will be in a moonlit wooden hut on a mountainside. The warm crackling fire, sitting at the end of a king-sized bed, illuminates the warm rug. The mattress is plump, raised to the right level. The sheets are thick, filled with soft feathers. A window gives a view of the idyllic scenery. A blanket of snow to match the blanket of feathers. A gazelle prances in the distance.
My wife, my gorgeous redheaded wife, perfect figure, hair as red as wine and a gaze as intoxicating. She is as nude as the day she is born and just as messy. I have her across the bed, legs splayed out. Her womanhood bared to take my might trunk. For many hours we entwine, always rough, always sweaty. Finally with a quiver of the leg, my Aphrodite falls back, too exhausted to carry on despite her peak physical condition. I myself, of course, am still fully erect, but give her the moment to catch her breath. I hand her a diamond bottle of pure river water and she gratefully takes a sip to hydrate.
Between breaths, she leans in and whispers to me, ""Darling, I don't think I've ever seen your dick harder than it is right now.""
I turn to her, look deep into her eyes, and respond.
""It's still not as hard as it was the first time I saw the first Red Dead Redemption 2 trailer.""

58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"I gotta say, I'm impressed by how well Rockstar Games can keep a secret.  

Last week, all we had were rumors, hopes and dreams of a sequel to *Red Dead Redemption*.  Then R* rides in and says, ""Yep, we're not only working on RDR2, but it's almost done.  Here's the trailer.  See you next year!""  

In this day and age, when even *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* had its whole plot leaked months before release, and people have camera drones flying over the sets of *Game of Thrones* Season 7, R* somehow manages to release only the information they want released.  That studio must be run like a prison."
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"Is anybody else really confused about the whole ""Fall 2017"" release timeline?  Especially since the trailer ends with ""Pre-order Now"".  Are we really preordering a YEAR in advance?  That seems crazy to me. "
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Looks awesome. I still wish they had named it something like red dead retribution or red dead revolution or something like that. Red dead redemption 2 seems a bit bland. 
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Weak trailer. Let's hope the single player is long and has tons of side quest and missions.  Because gta V relied to heavily on online mode for replay value.
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"They're missing out if they don't call it something besides Red Dead Redemption 2. There are plenty of ""R"" words out there. Red Dead Revolution. Red Dead Retribution. Red Dead Ronald McDonald. "

58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"Does anyone else feel a little disappointed? I think most people here seem really excited, but I have some issues with this trailer. In Red Dead Redemption the atmosphere felt gritty and dangerous, and everyone was only barely surviving. The atmosphere the trailer gave off was light-hearted and happy, as if there was nothing to fear in their world. It seems as if Rockstar is trying to play it safe with this game, and is going to be taking a lot of elements from GTA V because of how well that worked for them. I honestly don't believe we will be getting the same type of game we had from the first Red Dead Redemption. Sure the graphics are great, amazing even, but the atmosphere is completely lacking.


Feel free to give me a counter-argument if you disagree."

58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"So there is a lot of speculation that the game will be about Dutch's old gang, judging by what seems to be John Marston on the far left,  Dutch van der Linde second from the left, and Bill Williamson third from the right.

Even if this is the case though, then that gives me a lot more questions. I understand we would not know everyone in the gang, we certainly don't know who is the guy in the center is, and to be in the center one would assume he is pretty important to the story.

Also, if this is the old gang, wouldn't we also be seeing Javier Escuella? Of all the people in the lineup, the figure on the far right is probably the best chance of being Javier, but it is pretty unclear, if anything because we saw so little of Javier in person in RD Redemption.

Also not really a question about the contents of the game, but I noticed that the figure we can assume is John is the only one looking in a completely different direction than all the others. Might be nothing, but I imagine there might be some thematic significance there."

Red Dead Redemption 2 will be unbelievably superior to GTA5 I cannot fucking wait."

58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,I'm not a huge gamer by any means so maybe it's just me but I don't understand how you guys are ever satisfied with these trailers that show literally zero amount of game play? 
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Can we change characters in this?
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Any coincidence that they release the trailer right after West World has suddenly brought life back to the western genre? I think not! 
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Oh boy I cant wait to be a fat mexican riding a donkey!
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"I'm excited for the game, that was a terrible trailer though, didn't really show much of anything except some landscapes. It's more like a trailer for a trailer. "
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,I'm not sure about this trailer. Obviously it's an extremely small portion of the game showed but it didn't give off a cowboy vibe to me at all. It was less Wild West and more the witcher. But they were obviously trying to show off lots of different locations so we will see.

58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,One year? Hype and rumour for a whole year? Sigh
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Has a lot of grass in that trailer. I actually liked how barren so much of the world was in the last one. It felt almost spiritual to be out there by yourself in those vast deserts.
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,R* really needs to answer whether or not they even Intend on releasing it for PC and that if they give a good reason as to why They havent shown any mention of the PC version. Because a Former R* employee said that during the development of Red Dead Redemption (2010) That PC wasnt even considered. Another employee said that they have an extreme Console Fanboy Culture. As such many PC Gamers feel contempt from Rockstar. There is very little reason not to Release it for PC. I hypothesize that They'll release the PC version in another Fiscal year just like with PC. They discriminate PC players just to look good to investors in their annual reports. 
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,too beautiful.
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,why has no one ridiculed the fact that they're pushing pre-orders a full year in advance?
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,I still am in shock of the announcement itself. I can't believe I'm actually going back into this world they created for us. Have still never been pulled into a game as much as read dead managed to do. With new tech I can't wait to see how they make you immersed.
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Oregon trail confirmed!

58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-21,I really hope there will be native americans living their traditional lifestyle in the game that the protagonist will interact with. Hopefully there will be a playable native american character also. So excited for this game. I've been anticipating this announcement for a ridiculously long time. The next year or so will be excruciatingly long.
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-21,"Looks like they're going further west location wise, those trees look like they could be California or Oregon, and the mesa points towards probably Nevada, nice to see a change in terrain that's still distinctly western"

58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-21,"I really hope they make a worthwhile multiplayer. RDR's zombie mode was the best multiplayer Rockstar have come up with yet. Even though GTAV had the best singleplayer, the online is a mess - constant phone calls about nothing, absolutely retarded matchmaking, etc. "
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-21,"Ok Rock star, don't fuck it up this time and take a year for the pc version to come out."

58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,one can only hope for it to be released for pc
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"Man, as a PC gamer it's embarrassing to see the whining done by everyone on the platform. The tiniest of shit gets blown up to retarded portions. Maybe I just don't get it as much because I don't limit myself to a single platform (just my opinion, don't really get why you would want to). I'm so sick of going to check out a new game and seeing the BIG 3: 

1. PC players whining about anything, take your pick

2. The white knights fighting the dirty pre-orders

3. Anything that could possibly relate to No Man's Sky. Anything at all. A single star in the sky, a leaf.. the fact that it's a game, you name it. 

Anyway, can't wait. First RD was easily in my top 3 games of all time so can't wait to put this one right up there with it. "

edit: those of you telling me i'm wrong/ first trailers never show anything/ whatever else, [this was RDR's first trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOpKJ6hjPIM).  Gives a really good idea of what the final game would turn out to be in only a little more time than the teaser show today (which should have been called 'teaser', not trailer.)"

58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,How the fuck does [this](https://imgur.com/a/QSvZM) keep happening? Rockstar do you just not care at all about the PC people keeping your games going years after the consoles are dead and gone. Literally years people have been asking for a pc version of the original game and you spit in their faces once again (like GTA5 and the stupid wait for a port).

58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"I was hoping for some action in the trailer.

Gunfights, horse chases, fist fights in a bar. Definitely excited for trailer 2."
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,What a day. This looks epic!

58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,So hyped for this! The graphics look so beautiful!
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Looks so fucking amazing
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Well...I guess all we know is it is going to beautiful
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,This is the best Thursday at work I've ever had! CHOO CHOO 
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,I am so excited about this game that I downloaded the original on my Xbox One and woke up early to play before work this morning. And the GTA V guys can make a great story mode so I have a good feeling about this one.
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,What the fuck is happening today.
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,HYPEEEE
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"I'm assuming we got a glance of each of the seven men through the trailer. They all seem like normal hard working folks. Then at the end theyre wearing bandanas over their faces. Will be interesting to find out why, if that's the case. "
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Now ain't *that* a fineeee how do you do?
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"Wow! The sounds, the music, the graphics, the voice acting.... I'm fucking speechless. I'm 10x more hyped than I was before the trailer. "
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,This looks stunning 
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"Incredible scenery, comparable to The Revenant."
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Yall got anymore of that karma?
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Cowboys confirmed
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"That was beautiful, too Bad that trailer was that short"
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Is there a gaming event happening right now or something? Why are so many launches being announced today?!
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"It may have looked like a tech demo, but Rockstar makes tech demos more epic than other companies make launch trailers "
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Oh my fucking god!!!!!
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,More like a teaser.
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,I cant wait to play this on my Gaming PC!
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"So, who's pre-ordering? "
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,I cant wait to do online train robberies.
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Any takeaways from this short trailer? 
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"I guess this is the break out post - congrats OP
oh, and OMOMFGFGOMGOFMMGFGG Red Dead"
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,It looks absolutely stunning. I'm so hyped! 
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,I'm gonna pre
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"Yes, yes, YES!. Hype-train!! Chooo, choooooo!!!."
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Awww yeah. More of dat red dead night sky 
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Needs more zombies
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Oh man. I can't help but not get hyped at that
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"Looks great! I never played the first one, is it worth playing now? Will it seem outdated? I'm sure it's a cheap-ish download on PS4?"
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,yup. need it right now. 
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Now I just hope me and my horse won't die after being 3ft in water
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Watching this I can't help think that the locations in the previous game were almost like placeholders. Seeing that shop about 30 seconds in just made me think that is what a shop should look like and how crappy it looked previously.  
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Too short!!!
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,I can pre-order a year in advance? I can let Rockstar make interest off of my money for a game I could buy on launch day anyway? Sure. Why not. 
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,This is my earliest ever Pre-Order
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,I need gameplay 
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"So excited for this!!! This is definitely the game I'm most excited for now. Rockstar, you always do right by me and I appreciate it"
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Yep
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,[The hype is real baby!](http://i.imgur.com/MXaLbQk.gif)
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,I really hope they add a collectors edition along the way. Rockstar can have all my money. 
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Looks like we're getting some more mountainous and forested landscapes. Glad to see that. It'll set it apart from the previous games in terms of the explorable world.

58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"For as good as that looked, it's crazy that the previous game was so beautiful that this new one didn't look that mind blowing in comparison"
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"Nice, love it when the trailers arent just a cgi cut scene"
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"Meh. I wouldn't call this a trailer, it's more of a teaser. Could have at least given us a MC confirmation. Yeah the graphics look good, but there's a chance they were polished just for the sake of this reveal. Could have done it a little better, Rockstar. Oh well, i'll buy it regardless."
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,u/temtam seems to be getting the sweet karmapot this time! 
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"I¬¥m not gonna lie. It looks great. The nature, animals, people...

Thanks, but no thanks."

58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,wheres the PC port..
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,HOLY JESUS ON A HIGH HORSE CHRIST 
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,tight
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"So is this a new story with new characters, or do you think we'll be seeing what John and Bill's gang were all about?"
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"With those graphics, I seriously hope it comes to PC. It's too good to not pass up."
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"2018 is just over there, now we're on PC wait."
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"That night time shot with the fire and Milky Way, sploosh. "
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Hopefully the multiplayer isn't broken this time around.
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"No PC release? Weak sauce. I would be less bothered if they said ""Available on Consoles Fall 2017, Steam in Spring 2018.""
"
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Sure doesn't look like it takes place in 2017...
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"This brings back memories. Wow, 6 years have passed by really quickly. Red dead Redemption 2 is finally here!

Take all of my money, Rockstar. "
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"A lot of it is obviously prerendered though. But I absolutely love the trailer!  
Looks like they're finally aiming for something more serious, i guess Witcher 3 made them understand that funny isn't always better."
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Nintendo who?
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Okay I guess I just go ahead and play Redemption for about the fifth time now...
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"One of the guys on the poster looks like Bill Williamson (3rd in from the right) and the guy on the far left looks like Marston. So I'm guessing it is a prequel. The beauty of this game is spectacular, but I hope they keep focus on the story and gameplay. A simple change to Dead Eye could make the game not as enjoyable or better. Love the graphics though. Maybe money from pre-orders will give them what they need to keep this high level of quality."
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"As usual with Rockstar, a short ""trailer"" that people are left to examine. Oh yeah, THEY KNOW HOW TO GET ME GOING"
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"Game looks like it is going to have more of a Wyoming-like setting. Calling it now, the state will be called ""New Cheyenne""."
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,People forget that they did this was GTAV. The first trailer was just scenic shots with Micheal talking in the background.
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,THIS IS THE ONE
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,The level of detail in each scene looks stunning. Especially with the fire against the night sky.
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Sounds like Dutch a bit
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,They misspelled Red Dead 3: Redemption 2. That sounds so much better Than RDR2 /s
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"This day can't get any better. 

*Qui√©n es Sombra?*

58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,I can't wait! Beat the original twice and now it's time to move on.
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"Looks fantastic, come and join us to discuss if you are interested: reddeadforums.net "
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"Looks like the environment is slightly more advanced than the world of RDR. Power Lines, the train, larger towns. I'm leaning towards this being a sequel with perhaps Jack Marston and his pose. Never saw him settling down as a rancher. Just my speculation."
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Please for pc

58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"Is there a remastered version of Red Dead Redemption, or can you get the PS3 game on PS4?  I feel like i need to give the original game another try.  For some reason it was a struggle to get into it when I played it, but now I am thinking I just was being overly critical of its similarities to GTA."

58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,So does this Xbox One and Windows 10 thing also apply to this game or is it just for Xbox exclusive titles?
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,So many animals to shoot and skin...
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"Initial release on Xbox One and PS4, then the 'upgraded' version for the updated consoles, *then* the PC version. 

Same cycle as GTA V."

58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"I'm still hoping this will be in the heart of the western civilization. Personally, my biggest gripe with RDR was the automatic guns and advanced civilization in the third act of the game. Would love to have a truly cowboy/western game. But holy fuckeroo am i excited regardless. THE GUNS LOOK COOL"
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Stoo. My penis can only get so hard.
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Sound like the soundtrack will be on point again!

58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"I feel like the game is mostly done at this point and for the next year, Rockstar will just tease us more and more until it finally comes out. And then we can all be sooo happy."
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,It would be pretty crazy if this game was released with the potential to be played @ 4K resolution

58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"In all honesty, not the best trailer. But im hyped nonetheless because of the franchise."

58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Haven't been this hyped in a long time. This might be the game that gets me interested in video games again
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Oh Rockstar you absolute cock tease.
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"Looks gorgeous, but that was pretty anti-climatic.  Even by teaser trailer standards."
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"Just to point out, thats very likely NOT PS4 footage, but infact PS4 Pro footage. There is no disclaimer anywhere as to where this footage comes from. Games cannot run that smoothly at that fidelity on the PS4."
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,TAKE MY PELTS!!!!!!!
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Please come to PC =(
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Still think they should have called it Red Dead Garlic Bread
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"With West World running on HBO right now, I'm even more excited for RDR2. 

There's another level to this game, and I'm going to find it."
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,What a fucking great time to be gaming. 
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"Now this is a very beautiful game, but it seems to deviate quite a bit from the original's art style. I loved the bright colors in the original, it felt like a place you wanted to walk around in. This is a bit too gritty compared to what I expected, though I have no doubt it will be great. "
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,I am so fucking excited for this game
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Hype as fuck. Now waiting for L.A. Noire 2

58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,I really really really want Nick Cave and Warren Ellis to do this soundtrack/score. 
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"So... One thing I'd like to point out:  Doesn't look like the horses have the same animation with realist muscle movement.  I wonder if they'll use the same stripped down physics engine that GTA V used or if they'll use the engine the Read Dead Redemption had.

Other than that it looks amazing.  I love the scope, the music, the graphics... I can't wait!"
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,So is it prequel or a sequel or what
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Train heists with a gang of my cowboy mates PLEASE.
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"Looks fantastic!!!




....wish it wasn't called Red Dead Redemption 2 tho..."
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,A little underwhelming but I hope the random NPC ineractions are knocked up a notch. It's what made the first game for me mostly. The birds flying at the beginning seemed really unnatural like they were just floating up. But the vultures and canoe on the river seemed a bit promising.
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Yes please.
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,well that was thoroughly underwhelming to watch...
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,so are we talking summer 2018 for pc then?
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Anyone else impressed it was all in-game footage and not a CGI mess. This actually looked like release quality in-game footage no over amped graphics or CGI teaser. Refreshing!
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Wow.. this game is going to be so beautiful.. Without any Hydra and other non-sense this game might actually be challenging online during fights. 
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"Fuck all these trailers, it's making me hate the year 2016"
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"I'm so excited for Poker Simulator with Guns 2.

But like *really* I am"
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"Moist. brings me back to when I first saw the GTA 5 trailer. 
Next we need either Manhunt or The Warriors. "
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,that campfire shot with the starry sky was breathtaking 
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"Wow, just wow at the skybox alone."
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Is there a preorder bonus? Anyone know of a reason to preorder now? Seems dumb if there is zero incentive.
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"We have seen what looks like Bill in the reveal picture. John could possibly be on the far left, but he doesn't look like the guy in the middle. My theory is that we see Bill take over the gang in this game, and the events that cause John to run, direct prequel to RDR."
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,It looks massive 
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,I doubt that with these graphics it will run smoothly at 60fps on an Xbox One or PS4.
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,We need Last of Us Mod NOW
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Is this running a new engine? The graphics look stunning.

58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"Alrighty, good doing business with you Rockstar. See you next spring I suppose."
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"idk whats worse, this trailer being so short or the fact that i came before it finished"
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,I'm more concerned as it didn't say made from in game footage.
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,And that's the best thing I've ever seen
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Looks like it's in Colorado ;). Home sweet home.

I know, I know...I'm over thinking it."

I doubt it would be a sequel, the West was pretty much dead at the end of Red Dead Redemption. I also doubt they'd set a new game in the same time period in a different location. If it's a prequel about Marston's story, or has anything to do with him even so much as a cameo in Dutch's gang, then it has to be before 1906 which is when he was left for dead by Dutch. John was 8 in 1881 when his father died, so it would be after that. I'm guessing it's likely the 1890s or early 1900s when the game is set. Again, this is all assuming Marston has anything to do with it. If he doesn't, it could be set between the 1880s and 1900s given the presence of the above mentioned technology."

A prequel definitely makes sense when you think of the old west timeline. The heart of the gunfight era was 1875-1880: (Battle of the O.K. Corral, Billy the Kid, Buffalo Bill, ""Wild Bill"" Hickok, Battle of Little Bighorn, & Jesse James)

When you look it up the ""Old west"" or ""Wild West"" ended in 1912 when the last mainland states joined the Union."

58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"Definitely a prequel, but hopefully only in the sense that it takes place before the events of Red Dead Redemption. I'd like it to be an entirely separate story with cameos by members of Dutch's gang. And I really hope it's not a multi-character story."

58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"Yes sure will, until Cyberpunk 2077 comes out."
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Hopefully it comes. I'd rather have it delayed then rushed.
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Yes

58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,That sounds good. 
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"What did you expect, it's always a short teaser first."
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"games not out for a year, they can't blow their load all at once the hype train needs stoking"
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,So... a teaser trailer.
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,We've got a year off. It's perfect. Gotta ration the hype out accordingly. 
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Listen to me... SHUT THE FUCK UP
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"What do you want? The first trailer to lay out the story, the characters, and every single location? It's a teaser. It's like getting hints at Christmas presents. It drives you to want to know more and *have that fucking thing.*"
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Im pretty sure that was just a teaser not a trailer. They just used the wrong words.
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"It actually shows a lot if you watch it slowly and know what to look for. For instance, it looks like the game will take place in Montana/Wyoming based on the mountains, as well as the style of chaps seen briefly on one character."
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Glad someone else feels the same way. There was little to no portrayal of what you can do in the game... other than look at people/scenery and ride a horse.
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Sounds about right. 
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,I bet Rockstar already has 500 million in sales before it's even released. 
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"I look at their history of released games, and would feel no worries about preordering from them for this."
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,It's about genetically altered dinosaurs.  Didn't you watch the trailer?
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,I think they'll stick to 3 playables with 7 of them being main characters.
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"In thinking not likely. I doubt it will be powerful enough to run it. Also, this game is out of the core demographic for the switch. "
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,I think they just hate money

58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Based on their trailers for  previous games there is a huge chance that this is exactly how it will look.
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Has Rockstar ever downgraded from a trailer?
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"I was about to say, what video were you watching. "

58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"So, like a horse?"
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,I'm with you.  I think it's the neck also.  Something is just off
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Kind of moves like one of those Boston robot dogs.
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"It's just really hard to get animals right in games for some reason. They can get humans pretty well, but animals just live in uncannny valley or something. The horses are better than just about any other game, but they're still a little wrong. Farther down I read they did mo-cap with horses but in this trailer there's still something that's off. Moreso in the walk than in the gallop."
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"Well, telegraph wire preceded the railroad.  1861 is when the west coast was connected to the east coast, and tons of individual lines before then.  And the railroad went through the same period, with the transcontinental railroad finished in 1869.  And hundreds of individual rail lines before then.

This game could conceivably be set as early at the 1850s, depending on what part of the country its based on.  And since the game just uses general locations like 'mexico' and 'tall trees', it really can be anywhere.  Though I think its clear that the locations in RDR were inspired heavily by Arizona, California and Texas.

An early leak claims this game is going to have Tall Trees in it, at the western most part of the map.  Maybe they're gonna go for more of a Mid West setting?  Like Colorado, Montana, Kansas?  That would be perfect for a pre Civil War setting.  But its all just theories at this point.  They could just as easily be telling the story of young John Marston and the gang.  Which would place it around the 1890s.  And that might be a smart way to go.  Each new game can be a prequel taking place a little earlier than the last.  Until they get all the way back to the 1840s."

58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,I feel like after the last few years we've all become jaded. I get that we don't want our hearts broken time and time again but we have to remember to enjoy things and experience a little excitement from time to time.
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Possibly in a single 24 hour window. 
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Make America Game Again.
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,That's what happens when your studio discovers microtransactions
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"I've met some of their core dev. team.  They are passionate about making a good product.

One of the guys I talked to worked 12 hours a day, 7 days a week on Red Dead Redemption, to make the release date.  For a full year.  "
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"I mean, they made GTA5 which does look that good... why would a newer game look worse?"
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"Not really... they did an amazing job with getting the most out of the 360 and PS3, but those were better consoles than today's gen. 

But if you look at the early GTAV trailers, they were much prettier than the 360/PS3 versions. Granted if you max the settings on PC, the new version can look as good as the trailers. 

But regardless, given the lack of ""in-game"" or ""in-engine"" tags, this trailer is most likely baked somehow, pre-rendered, or some sort of movie magic that wont reflect actual gameplay. 

That's not to say it wont be pretty. Bug again, this console gen is unlike the last, they are simple shitty PC's and there isnt much more to gain. This aint your daddy's cell processor. So I'm willing to bet that RDR2 Singleplayer will look like GTAV singleplayer, plus a few extra features. Removing the number of NPC's, buildings, light sources, planes, etc, means they can add more animals and light/shadow tricks. 

So essentially, GTAV wilderness V1.5."
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"GTA V trailer looked nothing like GTA V on PS3/X360, however the PC version looked exactly the same. I'm guessing this is how it's going to look on the Scorpio & PS4 Pro"
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,That dog probably killed the other dog and wanted to eat it but the shitty vultures got in the way
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"yeah, id say the closest thing to it would be MGSV horses, but even they dont come close to RDR horses."
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"Since? No, you're probably right. You should look into Shadow of the Colossus' horse animations though."
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Coyote & the hound :/
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,A hunter is never alone. 
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"There's only one area where they're half crow, the rest of the game they're just dogs."
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,RDR also went as far as New Orleans with Thieves Landing and [presumably] St Louis with Blackwater. I always took Tall Trees to be Colorado but I suppose it makes more sense to be Northern California.

58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Ok how about middle of no where with extreme eagle eyes.
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Yeah most pics of it are long exposure and shit. I heard it still looks pretty good though.
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"Yeah man, years ago I went to a party at a ranch and arrived before dark. Went outside at like 1 am and I couldn't believe how many stars there were. It was fucking amazing. "
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Red Dead Revolver 2. A prequel where you play as Nate Harlow when he found gold with Griff.
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,PS3 emulation will be the first time RDR runs on a PC. We're getting there.
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"Exactly. I only have my laptop. I'm not going to shell out $300 for a console, $60 for a game, and another $600 for a good enough TV to justify playing it on.

I know it's extreme, but I'm just going to consider Rockstar dead to me until I hear that RDR2 is coming to PC. Fuck 'em."
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"Yes. 5's timing seemed to coincide with the end of the lifecycle of the 360 and PS3 so many of us couldn't help but have played it there first. 

Also don't Microsoft now sell games that are ""buy it once"" for both platforms? We win again!"
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Finally playing Mad Max right now. Wow what a fun game. Way better than I anticipated. 
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Realistic forests and grasslands however *are* difficult to render.
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"True, RDR was the end of the wild west. This game has to be a prequel, if it was a true sequel it would not be a wild west game, it would be a post WWI America game. I am glad RDR did cover the end of the wild west though, but I am more pumped to see the height of it in RDR II "
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Bruce as well!
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"And Lazlow. In fact he's been 3, VC, SA, 4, *and* 5."
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"I lost pretty much all my Xbox 360 games during Hurricane Sandy.  RDR was the only one I immediately ordered again.  Interestingly enough when I first played it I found it kind of slow and boring, and stopped playing after about a week.  A year later I picked it up again and I don't think I have ever been so immersed in a game.  The small details in this game are amazing.  My dad hates video games and he would sit down and watch me play this for hours because it was just so damn beautiful.  It's one of only two games I ever got 100 percent completion, the other being Assassin's Creed 2."
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,I bought it last night cause I couldn't find my original disk and I was astonished that they sell it for $15. I was expecting like $40 especially with the HYPE train leaving the station this past week. 
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Why would you make me want something I will never get?
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,God dammit man I literally just had a wank!

58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Insomniac is also a very promising studio. Sometimes those Ratchet and Clank games didn't look so good but they worked!
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,I remember I pre-ordered GTAV for 360 because I also got a $20 giftcard/code from Microsoft. Literally the only time I've ever pre-ordered. 
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"i was thinking more like...

58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,I remember like two days before Arkham city came out I saw the absolutely incredible reviews and we went to Longhorns with a GameStop across the street and I ran across there and just threw a preorder on it for some dlc bonus
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Yea. I usually pre-order Madden with Bestbuy because they have a promotion where you get $25 towards the new Madden if you trade in the old one. If I wait until the day after the release my copy of Madden 16 is worth a quarter. 
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Okay this is really good shit. You want to start a teaser production company with me? You do what you just did and I'll add the canoes.

Destiny is a great game, but Bungie did a quite bit of the NMS-style over-promising in the run-up to the release.

58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Agreed. His legacy was so great I hope they leave it alone. 
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,I think seeing him in passing would be pretty cool.

58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"Well the main point being, which quite a few people have brought up, is that by the end of red dead there were only a couple of years left until world war 1. I mean that was part of the theme of the first one, it was the death of the wild west. So while nothings for sure, I think the chances of it taking place before the first one is pretty high"
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,Honestly if you closely examine most life it's all pretty fucked up.  When you've seen a vulture peck out the eyes of a newborn calf and eat it while it's still screaming you start to realize that human cruelty isn't anything special.

If people didn't buy shark cards, they would've released significant DLC rather than what they have already.  The only **significant** DLC for online is the heists.  The rest are crumbs.  They're the equivalent of popcorn.  

And people wonder why they haven't released more heists... It's because they're doing completely fine and doing even less work than before.  It's shitty consumer practices like that that reinforce shitty business practices.  That's the fucking problem"

58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,I have it and it's pretty good. It's like a Netflix of games and they stream the game over your Internet connection
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,They melt in your mouth
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,That's because horses are crucial to RDR. It is seriously one of the cornerstones of the games. It would be stupid to expect horses in a game like Assassin's Creed to be as good as the ones in RDR. Look at Black Flag- the ship gameplay is excellent because it's a huge part of the game. Different games have different focuses. Even Roach in TW3 isn't great 
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"Same, Epona in OoT and TP. I have not used the horse in Skyrim since. So slow and useless."

I'm all about that."
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"IMO its pointless, we all know what happens to the gang, and what happens afterwords. Why go though the rounds just to get the same conclusion we always knew was gonna happen?

They should start new. But then why call it RDR 2?"
58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"Is that really worse though?  I've never thought the reason for pain and suffering really mattered outside of trying to find a way to stop it.  Someone or something that suffers doesn't stop suffering if the reason for it is malicious or not. 

The way I look at it is that humans are just as capable of inflicting suffering as any animal but our capacity for kindness and generosity far outpaces any other creature. "

58hakw,2016-10-20,2016-10-20,"It doesn't make the animal suffer anymore but in my opinion it makes the act more evil, because we have this ability to be kind and to reduce suffering but some people choose not to, for fun as well"

ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03," Sounds like the Riddler and Mr. Freeze should team up to take over the Gotham City Super Collider so they can create Black Kryptonite and sell it to villains overseas, but their plan goes awry when Victor sees multidimensional anomalies in the collider track, including worlds where there may be a cure for Macgregor's Syndrome. Batman shows up to stop the pair, just in time to witness the doctor telling the Riddler that he must pursue a cure for Nora. Using his freeze ray to stop the green kryptonite in the collider long enough to hold open a rift in the fabric of space-time, Freeze and his gang disappear.  The damage to the space-time continuum is severe, however. Because Edward Nygma and Batman were so close to the temporal rift, their memories of the natural timeline are intact. When they leave the collider facility as Batman tries to take Nygma to the GCPD, it is plain to both men that they are no longer in the Gotham City they know and love. Gripped in a perpetual blizzard and ruled by an oppressive regime of robots with freeze rays, Gotham‚Äôs citizens are closely monitored and allowed little freedom as their genes are spliced with Macgregor‚Äôs Syndrome and they are experimented upon in attempt to find a cure. The Riddler convinces Batman that, since they are the only two who know what happened, they cannot leave the timeline broken like this. The two men return to the damaged collider, review the instrument data to find the date in the past that Freeze evidently returned to, and are able to resimulate the collider conditions and give chase to their mutual enemy. 

Batman and the Riddler arrive in 1892, five years after the Freeze gang first touched down in the past. As the glacial rockies was the only place in North America cold enough for the frosty felon, Freeze and co. had setup their base of operations out west and in the surrounding territories. Batman and the Riddler team up to unravel the damage to the timeline that Freeze had done, cooperating with Jonah Hex and a Princess Diana who ended up leaving Themyscira 40 years early due to The Fates‚Äô recognition of the temporal anomaly.   
 

The unlikely team is able to pursue Freeze and restore the timeline. Batman and the Riddler put Freeze on dry ice and take him to 1893 Gotham, where they meet Nikola Tesla preparing for the World‚Äôs Fair. With Tesla‚Äôs help, they return the caped crusader, Mr. Freeze and the Riddler to the future by the end of Batman: Arkham Frontier.  
 

Or so they think . . .   
 

As the Riddler is helping Tesla man the controls for the makeshift time machine, Batman says to his old nemesis, ‚ÄúSee you soon.‚Äù  
 

As he throws the switch to power up the device, the Riddler grins and says, ‚ÄúSee you later.‚Äù

Batman emerges from his time capsule to a dreary, crumbling Gotham city. Most city blocks are bare or rubble, and what few structures do remain from Gotham‚Äôs glory days are in varying states of collapse. There is no signal from the Bat Computer. The dark knight figures out the year is 2073. Batman finds a 68 year old Luke Fox, who catches him up on how an accident at the Gotham City Super Collider had sped the passage of time on earth, but not surrounding space. This meant that the Watch Tower, in Earth‚Äôs far orbit, was out of range and suspended, seemingly motionless, in time. Without the help of Earth‚Äôs heroes, civilization quickly descended into chaos. What remains of Gotham City, Luke tells Batman, has been carved into three territories controlled by a mostly-cyborg Bane, a necropolis ruled over by Solomon Grundy, and swamps where a mysteriously intelligent Killer Croc and his gang drag their victims, performing horrible experiments to make as many terrified gothamites into half-animal monsters like themselves. Batman and Luke join forces to create a new batmobile from wreckage they are able to salvage, and fight the territorial warlords so they can free enough citizens of Gotham to win back what remains of Wayne labs, send a distress message to Superman in the past and request that he suspend himself in cryosleep. Once the Kryptonian is able to join Batman, the two work together to repair the damaged super collider, and return to the present day to repair the natural timeline in Batman: Arkham Wasteland.

Or so they believe . . .

As soon as Batman and Superman return to the past, the Riddler is waiting for them, Black Kryptonite in hand. Superman splits into his good self, and his evil, tyrannical side. He quickly rallies Gotham‚Äôs and Metropolis‚Äô most depraved villains to his side in an attempt to subdue Gotham, and then the world. Batman must team up with Superman and the rest of the Justice League to defeat Evil Superman and his gallery of rogues and finally set the timeline back in order in Batman: Arkham‚Äôs Finest."

ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"People like it, but for different reasons than what people were expecting. Personally, I like it a LOT more than GTA online because it's a lot harder for people to fuck with you. All the guns pretty much play the same, there's no crazy fucking vehicles with homing rockets, and most of the well-paying missions don't involve PVP, or at least it's optional.

Personally I enjoy it because doing bounty hunting and hunting for the trader deliveries is really satisfying and kind of relaxing. I've spent way more time in RDO than I have in GTAO and I've been a lot less stressed by it, too. I never feel like I'm constantly strapped for cash or that everything is way out of range of me buying it.

But yeah, if you were wanting it to be gang fights and constant robbing, thats not really how people play it. There are posse wars sometimes, but they're rare. I've only ever seen one outside of blackwater."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"If Heists aren't in the works for RDRO then I will be sorely disappointed in Rockstar.  Honestly I'm pretty disappointed they didn't plan it from the beginning, but with as long as their dev cycles are I'm not sure heists were even in GTAO when they were building RDRO.

Heists were literally the only reason my friends and I played GTAO, and they are lots of fun.  The reason for the cash grind with the heists became to get cool shit to do the heists better or unlock more heists."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"That's because it's the most boring game I've played in the last few years. I was so excited about RDO but it's definitely my biggest disappointment regarding videogames ever.

I even tried it once again today thinking, it might be that I was incorrect the first time, let's try to play once again. After half an hour I basically turned off my PS4 because it drained my energies to keep playing."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"I‚Äôve said it many times and I‚Äôll say it again. It‚Äôs what happens when companies see huge demand for an online component to a game that should only be single player.

He was never one to get his hands dirty directly unless he absolutely had to. 

Compare and contrast with Kingpin, if you would. Only instead of being a thick slab of a mutant (at least in some versions), he's a more erudite and entitled fellow, preferring to employ lateral means of pressure. But they both operate on the same level of mastermind, moving pawns this way and that, dabbling in real estate, that sort of thing. 

You can make him a thoroughly loathsome individual, the sort of fellow that you are just itching to see taken down a peg. His casual disregard of those 'beneath' him can, if played up right, be the perfect blend of uncaring amorality and mustache-twirling evil needed for the role. 

While Joker might blow up a building for the laughs, Two-Face might do so because the owner crossed him... Penguin would do so because it was shedding money and it was cheaper to blow it up, with all the tenants still inside, than to repair it. Collect the insurance money that way."

Even though you can't play as story characters,¬†rockstar¬†has been releasing some outfits inspired by them, but they're available for limited periods (Like Arthur's and John's)

The game had its ups and downs, some controversies regarding how¬†grindy¬†it felt at release and servers instability/performance. There was an update not too long ago that basically broke the game for almost a week, it's fixed but rdo is now sitting in a state you only find lobbies with 5-7 players but the performance (like animal and random events spawns) is better than ever.¬†Still¬†a great fun experience with friends, they've been adding updates with different roles that suit specific¬†playstyles¬†like bounty hunting, collecting stuff around the map... some are pretty fun.

ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"Crazy how it wasn't their first priority to add an Outlaw role to online seeing as, you know, our online characters are outlaws and the game is about being an outlaw.

All of my friends stopped playing during the beta and I can't blame them."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"Yeah never really enjoyed the first but was highly excited to give this one a try. Made some incredible advances for some elements of the game, it was just empty and boring far too often for my own taste as well. I usually explore the shit out of open worlds and side activities kept me playing the GTA story way longer than it should have taken. I ended up just beelining the story to get through with RDR2."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,And if Rockstar didn't thirst for money maybe they could instead have added a few components to Single Player.
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"He was an enjoyable villain in Arkham City. In the Gang War plot of the game, he used his resources and goons to take over the Museum of Gotham, turning it into a massive fortress. He imprisoned Mr. Freeze and put him in an ""exhibit"", took his freeze gun, and then made ""exhibits"" for every one of his enemies that he couldn't wait to put them in. Had exhibits for Batman AND Bruce Wayne, the Joker, Harley Quinn, one for Harvey Dent, one for a member of the League of Shadows, etc.

He was a good villain in the sense that he himself was not really threatening / powerful as every time you have the chance to fight him hand-to-hand he goes down in one blow. But he is crafty, manipulative, strategic, and a touch crazy. He'd fit well in the Nolan-verse, where he could totally have been part of the mobster-plot like in the second film.

Edit: I'll also add he is usually depicted as a personal enemy of Bruce's that just happens to tangle with the Batman. He envies the success of the Wayne family over his own family that has been made destitute over the years. This especially is used if the writers ever want to make Bruce's parents more morally ambiguous."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,Nah I though that portrayal was too weird/unbelievable for the Nolan films

I feel like they took the worst part of GTA Online, basically sells, and implemented it straight away inside this game and making them worse with longer traveling times. It wouldn't be that bad if they had also implemented the fun parts of it as well. At least that's my impression.

I am definitely not logging on anymore as well as I'm really sure it won't change the direction even though their decisions had a direct impact (less players, complaints, etc.)"

ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,Ghost of Tsushima is the beautiful lovechild of Dark Souls and Assassin's Creed. Play it!
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,Oh it IS fun
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"The combat system in GoT is pretty bad, imo. It's all button mashing with stances that make that button mashing more effective, depending on the enemy."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-04,"OK then, his parents were murdered by a mugger with a flintlock, and then he watched in horror as the guy took a minute to reload, and then run off."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"Its good, my local comic shop put it on in the local movie theater to promote it.

Its like off the wall nuts though and I think that turned some folks off, its really some anime ass nonsense, but I really enjoyed it."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,My buddy says it's fantastic but I just can't stand the animation. It's weird cgi.
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,its neat. The Joker/ Batman rooftop sword fight is cool.
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"Honestly I hated it. It's like they jam packed a bunch of memes into it. Rather than make an anime themed, or a japanese themed story, they jam packed as many references as possible. It's low effort, nonsensical, and not interesting. 

Premise: Batman gets lost in ancient japan with none of his weapons and only his utility belt

Scene 2: Batman whips out his batmobile and chases the joker. The joker has a castle that turns into a robot. 

Some people like anime that relies on tropes, but most of that anime ends up being forgettable because it can't stand on its own. Batman Ninja is only entertaining to poke fun at anime tropes. If you aren't familiar with the tropes it can't even do that."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,It's a huge let down.
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"Honestly some of the worst writing I‚Äôve ever seen from the DC universe, worth the watch for the pure insanity though"
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,The booster gold Time Masters spin off that came out of this is also very solid.
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"No, fuck Micah"

ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,You‚Äôre speaking as if half the corporations today wouldn‚Äôt hire people to kill unionizers if they had half a chance.
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"It‚Äôs a shame Rome only lasted two seasons, and that last season was seasons 2 and 3 mashed together."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"They support a show for 6 seasons then it‚Äôs on the show. It‚Äôs why nearly every series pre GOT has a hard 6th season end. If the wire was on today it would go until season 12, we‚Äôd be in LA and Omar‚Äôs long lost brother Bromar would come whistling through skid row."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"Can't really blame HBO for Game of Thrones. That show *needed* another couple of seasons at least, and HBO was willing to give it to them but the show runners declined and raced to the finish line."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,Some of them are the opposite. Carnivale was amazing when it was pulled.
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"Game of thrones wasn‚Äôt bad because it went on for too long, it was bad because they finished it off themselves."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"Lmao I agree, I honestly just didn‚Äôt want to come off as misogynistic not including the main female cast member as well."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"Goodfellas, LOTR trilogy, Aliens, Apocalypse Now, 2001: A Space Odyssey, No Country For Old Men are some of the others on my yearly watch list"
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"You... I've seen you.
Let me see your face.
You are the one from my dreams."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"Lmao, I had to Google it too! 

I'll be honest, your post was more creative than mine."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,Bob Hoskins would've been a great anything
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,He was English
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,The playerbase for GTAO was nearly extinct early in it's release. They finally pulled their shit together to get people to play and they were able to turn it into the cash cow it is now. The same issues have kept RDR2O from every getting off the ground.
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"There are like four different bounty hunter missions:

1. Go to a camp, kill the gang and get the bounty.

2. Chase the bounty while they ride a wagon or train.

3. Go to a location and find clues leading to the bounty.

4. Destroy things to draw the bounty out.

Like come on, you guys couldn't have bother to add at least a few more varieties? I get the legendary bounties exist but off the top of my head to only really unique ones are The Wolf Man and the guy in the swamp who drugs you and you have to fight him while you're hallucinating.

Honor means nothing as you can murder the entire population of a town and then tend to your horse and the two actions will balance each other out. Honor doesn't even mean anything outside of unlocking story missions because as far as I can tell high honor doesn't get you discounts like in the story mode and low honor doesn't give you more from looting.

My main gripe with Red Dead and Rockstar on general is their communication is so fucking bad. It is horrible. They go radio silent for months after releasing each update, never bother to say ""Hey guys, here's what we're working on"". The suggestions box feels useless because they've barely added any of the most requested features. I use to play the game daily and now I log on maybe once every few months and get bored within half an hour."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,he's talking about the multiplayer online mode which is basically still/forever in development for new activities. singleplayer is perfectly fine.
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,I‚Äôve had it for 2 years and I‚Äôve only made it about 50% through the story. I find it boring because it‚Äôs literally the same mission over and over just with different characters and locations. Basically ride somewhere to steal something and/or shoot all these bad guys. The map is beautiful but too big. It takes so long to get anywhere most of the game is just horse riding simulator. I had more fun searching for the animals and materials to get the best satchel than I did playing the story missions.
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"The activities across single and multiplayer just weren't captivating. Loads of random events tried to keep things fresh, but it was largely setting out to do the same ole nothing... which granted sells living in the frontier, it just didn't hold my attention."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,The single player is incredible but holy shit there were some things that were so tedious.
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"Story was incredibly slow and I despised just about everybody you interact with. Had some incredibly high moments, but far too many flatlining moments that wiped those out."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"Oh I agree, it fit the tone of burtons film."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"I... don't think you get it. The above comment was a reference to DeVito's casting as the only movie portrayal of the character. That's it. If anything, he was lampshading the differences you are pointing out with his comment."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"I'm a simple man, I see an IASIP reference, I upvote"
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,At their Happy Feet?
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,Thank you!
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"It didn't even last that long. Released at the end of March, WB announced at the start of June it shutting down in August. According to the Wiki it was in development for almost two years and it lasted 2 months before getting the axe. The MOBA saturation from that time was fucking bananas."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"Catwoman was the best to play. Max cooldown reduction and barely anyone could catch you between the whip tripping spam, dodge, and slowdown debuffing."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"No it wouldn't. Assassin's Creed is a series of boring, tedious games that start with a kickass premise and never deliver.

Red Dead Redemption 1 and 2 are both ten tiems better than Assassin's Creed: Yeehaw would be."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,That‚Äôs what I miss about the AC games. At no point in GoT did I feel like I couldn‚Äôt win a fight if I just did better. Sure I was overwhelmed a ton but that was my fault lol. It didn‚Äôt have a bunch of enemies level gated where I had no chance of winning unless I came back later after dropping off a love letter to some guy.
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-04,"lmao good match for fuckin' batman innit?  pulp magazine batman also had a gun

for real he probably just had a dual shot flintlock or carried two of them

shot mama  de la Vega right in the pearls.  pick every one of those fucking perals up diego i loved  you but i loved pearls first so *pick em up*"
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"Will all depend on if they like anime  and if the person then likes that terrible cgi anime that they're using now.

Edit: its not a bad anime the story is typical anime insanity but it worth a watch if you can handle that style, i watched it once and as much I i love anime ill never watch it again because I hate that art style."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"Ok, Kill La Kill is my favorite anime. Nothing gets as ridiculous as that and stays high quality and compelling. So I say bring it on."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,I enjoy trash movies so I don't think I would mind too much haha
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"No, don't fuck Micah. Shoot him."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,What do they do today that‚Äôs so bad?
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"I only saw a bit of Rome but it looked dope. Opposite problem, some shows get cut down way too early."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,Season 13 swirls around Yomar and his struggle to make it in the hip hop world.
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"I enjoyed the bulk of it and I agree, they out paced the books and probably would have been better to take a hiatus but I'm not sure George is gonna put that out before all the child actors in GOT are in their mid 40s"
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"Heck, the man played Mario Mario."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"Just cause hes dead doesnt make him less english. If anything, MORE SO."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"Mostly what they did early was ban people for finding ways to make a lot of in-game currency and nerf missions that paid well.

GTA Online launched rough, yes, but they fixed what issues they did address quickly and ignored the rest.

The griefing was never addressed because people paid real money in order to be better at griefing others."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,I do remember when GTAO was ‚Äúdead‚Äù
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,He also mentioned at the end he spent hardly any time in single player. The way it‚Äôs written he might‚Äôve been talking about single player the whole time
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"I also like the hunting more than the story missions, but I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a bad game. Any AAA game I log 60+ hours into is a good game by me. $1 an hour for entertainment is pretty cheap."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"Take those tedious things, and make them the only things you can do. Tadaaa! You now have Read Dead Online, except it's way more tedious because all money earnings are 10x smaller than in single player."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"your opinion is unpopular, but you're saying the exact same things I thought of RDR1. I think it's really boring, and I played LA Noire thoroughly without ever getting bored! So weird. at least now i know I wont buy the second one any time soon"
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,Catwoman was pretty disappointing in the third Nolan movie.  Like I can't even remember the point of having Selina Kyle being Catwoman instead of just Bruce Waynes fiance.
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"They really didn't help themselves out either. I was one of the beta players for that game, to get in you had to fill out an application that ended with answering a bunch of obscure DC trivia and listing your favorite characters with reasons why. Basically just ensuring that only DC fans really got in. By itself that's totally fine, but they then gave out a whole bunch of premium currency to the beta players who, by their own selection process, were exactly the type of people that would have paid for it."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"I agree with the exception of Assassins Creed 2. One of the best games I've ever played.

Red Dead Redemption is my favorite RPG of all time though, as a series (both 1 and 2) and I don't even give a shit about cowboys, that's how good they are."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,[deleted]
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"I hated the CGI less in this one but I know exactly what you are talking about. That's always kind of a turn off but there are some good animes that use that.

I was apprehensive going in when I saw the CGI stuff but I pushed through that and saw some cool samurai batman stuff."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,">  and stays high quality and compelling

batman ninja does not do this"
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,Yea I was definitely entertained. I just found myself saying wtf every 5 minutes.
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,Happy cake day
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,lol if you don't realize those in power will always try to suppress labor power.
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,Yeah HBO apparently can‚Äôt find the balance of show length. They either kill it too soon or let it run until it‚Äôs a bastardized version of its former self.
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,Jussie Smollet is cast. Hes Yarlow and he's making people just appear everywhere.
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,">The way it‚Äôs written he might‚Äôve been talking about single player the whole time

That's how I read it, too."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"Earnings are 10x smaller, and prices are 10x (or more) higher. The prices are so ludicrously out of scope in Online considering this is supposed to be a historical piece... Nobody on earth would be paying hundreds of dollars for a hat or some boots, but in that game that's the price."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"Bummer, I never even tried RDO. Guess there‚Äôs not much point in doing so. Too bad Rock Star only really cares about GTAV online. I mean putting it on the next gen consoles is just absolutely ridiculous..."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"And that's the beautiful thing. I'm not proclaiming it bad, I'm stating my opinion. But Reddit be Reddit."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"I'll give you that, AC2 was a great game. I'm just bitter about Black Flag. That game should have been SO. MUCH. FUN. It had all of the right ideas, they just managed to make it boring. Like you chase magical fluttering pages though town to learn a new sea shanty to sing with the boys! That's Jack Sparrow as fuck! Why did it have to be slow and clunky?

0/10. Did not swing from a chandelier nor any other proper swashbuckling."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,agreed. although I never really used smoke bombs because I could usually just win fights
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"Its really good id definitely tell people to watch if if they can.
The only omes that style I've watched and loves were cidonia and the godzilla movies.
Cant explain it it just looks janky when they move.

Samurai batman is a badass so definitely worth the watch.



Also someone's is going to point out that all anime is done on computers now, so I'll just go there first and say you know exactly what I meant....ypu know who you are lol"
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,It may still be fun. It's not in Netflix in the US though.
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,It is indeed a wonderful cakeday to be alive.
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"I mean in the modern day you'll pay that much for boots at least - a decent pair will set you back $150-250 (Justin, Ariat, Twisted X) and a truly nice pair will cost $350-800 (Anderson Bean, Lucchese, Rod Patrick, etc). 

That said, 100 years ago I doubt even the Rockefellers were paying RDO prices for their footwear. You could probably get stuff custom made from a top-notch cobbler for half that price at most, rather than whatever St Denis has on the rack in the store."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,well your opinion is unpopular outside of reddit too lmao
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,Smoke bombs are great if you run and ambush enemies at the start of the fight to get a chain assassination going
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"That's what I mean. They're basically today prices in the catalog, but 120 years ago."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"See I read all this, and have the exact same thoughts about the combat system in the Batman games. None of the unlocks seemed unnecessary, and most of the gadgets were just as useful in combat as out. Except the hacking tool."
ilsb6h,2020-09-03,2020-09-03,"2020 catalog pricing, 1820 earnings potential (a deer pelt sells for about a dollar, [as it was in 1824](https://historymyths.wordpress.com/2017/03/11/revisited-myth-113-a-deerskin-was-worth-a-dollar-hence-the-origin-of-the-word-buck/)), all wrapped up in a visual presentation of the year 1900."

74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,"I remember reading somewhere that the only reason RDR1 was never released on the PC is that the game was a horribly coded mess of spaghetti code and was created on what was essentially 2 versions of Rockstar's game engine mashed together. It was such a nightmare that they essentially had to focuss on just getting the Xbox version in a working state so they could release the game on time, and as a result they were never able to optimize a PC version of the game. It's such a horribly coded mess that going back and optimizing the game would be nearly impossible without sinking more money into the project than it's worth."

In all seriousness, or at least I hope so, were most likely looking at a delayed release of it. Obviously with better textures and all that good stuff. Just like GTA V. "

74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,How can they be so money grubbing with the sharkcard crap but they won't release it on pc? Just pay a third party to port the original and the second one if they don't wanna do it. Hire a bunch of interns and pay them in Rockstars and bread sandwiches if you have to.
74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,I felt like this may have been a spot the difference picture then realised it wasn‚Äôt... lol

74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-05,I can stand not playing this game until it can look good on my monitor.

74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,It is their own fault they don't want my money. I will never buy inferior computer (console) just to play few games in poor quality when I already have a good computer (PC) to play on. 
74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-05,LMAO. I am a PC gamer who really wishes we could have a simultaneous PC release and I found this to be hilarious.
74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-05,At least it's free.
74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,"I hope it gets ported to PC, the gta v port was really good, really late but really good"
74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,So true. And so stupid. Who has enough spare time to watch other gamers enjoy themselves playing a game? I'll never understand...
74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,They must hate money. I would totally buy it on my PC but I'll still buy it for Xbox.

74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,Would love to see RDR on PC but unfortunately with the way Rockstar handles GTA for PC it would probably come 2 years after consoles and still be full price for eternity.

74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,"nah, nah, nah man. PC folks will get RDR2 but it will be 7 years after the consoles, once everyone's over it. Is cool."

Also, isn't Red Dead Redemption about cowboys or something?

Edit:  this was a Joke, people. You console fanboys are just seething at this, aren't you?  That's called a joke. Sorry my $2,000 gaming setup does more than a typical $800 setup, I guess?"

Otherwise, making the game from the ground up with PC platform in mind and then purposefully hiding that fact to rip off their consumers is just terrible. GTA V was made from the beginning with PC and next gen consoles in mind, but they shamelessly denied it's existence for a huge period of time"

74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-05,"Wait, do you need an actual Playstation for this to function, or can you basically play RDR on PC with just the subscription?"
74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,Red dead redemption is awesome on psnow.  Be warned though the undead zombie version seems to be plagued with bugs and is pretty much a non functioning game after 10 mins.  Zombies become headless and never stop spawning.  Meaning you can't continue missions. 
74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-05,I did not know this was available on PSNow... Thank you. Playing that tonight.

74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,"RDR 2 is not available to PC at the moment,"
74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,"Yep, they're not.

Everyone is, apparently, too busy creaming their jeans from gusset to knee over Take-Two's latest iteration of ""The Sandbox Game"" where nearly all the support and DLC is going to support the online portion packed with microtransactions."

74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,"Cuz they know console release, then PC release a year later yields maximum profits. PC gamers will buy the console version, then buy the PC version later for modding and better graphics. Happened for GTA V"
74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,"There isn't a difference.  Xbox and PS4 quality is the same.  The PC one is a YouTube video of the game since it's not coming out for PC

74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-05,Isn't Bloodborne a ps4 exclusive? 
74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,"That's why I waited to get a PS4.  Once RDR2 and Dragon Quest XI come out, I'll also get a bunch of the previous games (like the half dozen DQ games already out).  Just like I waited until year four of the PS3 and suddenly had 12 great games to play all at once."
74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-05,Two consoles that aren't a waste of money Switch and PS4.

74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,Read Dead Redemption 1 was never ported to the PC despite the popularity of the game and fans demands.  The joke it that the only Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC will be video clips on YouTube.
74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,I was scrolling just to be sure I wasn‚Äôt the only one who thought that. 
74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,PC is the YouTube trailer. 
74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,I wonder if they'll put in the work to take advantage of the capability of the One X or if Sony has a clause with Take-Two to make sure the PS4 Pro doesn't look bad.
74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,It¬¥s shared memory between GPU and system so there isn¬¥t 12gb of dedicated graphics memory.

74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,"From what I know they build for console first as that's their biggest market, then afterwards spend more time making sure the port to PC is good rather than releasing a crispy version of it."
74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,"Basically yeah. They worked out most problems on console, then spent extra time making sure it worked well on PC, personally it's one of the best ports I've played."
74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,"Why not just wait the year or so for the inevitable PC release? You'll have the advantage of both, the power capabilities of the platform as well as a year of (hopefully, released) fixes. After all, Take-Two has a history of releasing their titles in quite a sorry state. So, why experience the game at its worst?"
74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,"Presuming that Take-Two doesn't have a clause with Sony to not make the PS4 Pro look bad, the copy on the One X will. 

Or, if you're willing to be patient and don't want to experience the game at its worst, the inevitable PC release that Take-Two will stay silent over in hopes to convince as many people as possible to buy the console game before they pony up for the PC version."
74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,What you said last
74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,"Maybe in 2030. We only have a few PS3 games that can be totally emulated. And you need some pretty decent hardware. But since they integrated Vulcan the hardware requirements have come down a bit.

We have even less 360 games we can emulate. No one even cares about Xbox HUGE anymore."
74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,That still might happen but will be closer to the release of RDR2 if it does get released on the PS4. Fingers crossed ey :)
74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,The pc version is only on youtube because there is no pc version.... deploy laughter
74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,"They will. They are going to wait a year at least, so PC people might buy it twice. Same as GTAV"
74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,At a later date.
74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,It's a port.

74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,"I like watching streams because it's something I can put on my third monitor while I'm working on the computer. It's easy to ignore but still enjoyable to watch. And exactly as you said ""who has the time"", I don't have the time to play everything but I still want to experience the single player story lines of some games like shadow of war next week (or exclusives i can't play, but people won't stop talking about like last of us.) Finally watching saves me from impulse buying some truly shitty games and helps me find games I'd enjoy but haven't seen before. "
74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,"but you cant even emulate red dead one yet, ive tried"

74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,Why does everyone being over it have any meaning for single player game? You need some global circlejerk to enjoy the game? If there isn¬¥t a million people playing the same single player game you are at that exact moment you can¬¥t enjoy it? You need validation from forums?
74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,"Complaining about the graphics of a game from 2010, 7 years later. Really?"

74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,"... As a PC gamer, 95% of the time console exclusives are overall better games... PC exclusives just exist because it's the easiest platform to sell games on, so indie developers usually
 put them out on PC only. Bigger companies won't bother with a PC exclusive, there isn't as much money to be made that way."
74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,"You're aware that console gamers don't give a shit about all that nonsense, right? That's why they aren't PC gamers... they just want to play games that look good to them and are fun for them."

I've got both a PS4 and a switch, I just dont particularly enjoy having to pay ¬£40 a year to use my internet that I already pay for, especially in the case of xbox when the dashboard is just a big advertisement wall anyway... If I really want RDR2, I'll buy it.  "
74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,"It's hardly the fault of the platform that a publisher is refusing to port a title to that platform.

If it's technical limitations (e.g. Switch), I can, at least see an argument, but with all the potential power of the PC platform, this is Take-Two pulling the same crap as they did with GTA V, trying to cash-in two-fold on people buying the title on console and then again, a year later, on the PC. 

And, honestly, if the Switch can handle Doom (2016), as fast paced as that is, surely it can handle this. It may be in sub-30FPS with a shorter rendering distance than the binoculars, the way that Breath of the Wild was, but I'm expecting that it can handle it. So, this is just Take-Two refusing the acknowledge certain platforms."

74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,"The first Red Dead came out in 2010. Back then relatively few games were honestly ported to PC. It wasn't viewed as a viable market by a lot of people, especially since the common knowledge was ""It will just be pirated and won't be worth the money"". Plus, the cost to update and guarantee stability is higher on PC. So a lot of companies just didn't do it.

These days that isn't the case to the same degree. It's now understood that the PC market can be a major source of profit - even if companies haven't figured out when and why all the time. Considering the demand for the first game on PC and the success of other Rockstar titles, I'd be surprised if it wasn't ported eventually. Will it be in working condition, in a playable state, or be sold through some weird second client? That's to be determined. "

Check [Page 13](https://www.scribd.com/doc/308200451/Benzies-v-Rockstar)

>In addition to responsibility for Rockstar North and global game design, Mr. Benzies was also Rockstar‚Äôs troubleshooter on non-GTA games, substantially responsible for resurrecting and turning around a number of troubled projects. Some, such as Red Dead Redemption, were created by Rockstar itself, while others were created by third-party developers. These projects were previously overseen by the Housers, but had flailed for over six years.
 
>As Sam Houser himself recognized, the Houser brothers were incapable of completing large and complex games without Mr. Benzies‚Äô oversight, management and skill in taking unwieldy designs and making an understandable, cohesive, and enjoyable game. For example, Sam and Dan Houser took the lead on the development of Rockstar‚Äôs game Red Dead Redemption. Mr. Benzies had no assigned position on the game. As the game‚Äôs delivery date grew near, Sam Houser urgently reached out to Mr. Benzies in an October 22, 2009 e-mail, writing, ‚ÄúThe ups and downs are VERY extreme. We have to fix this. Quickly. Help! I‚Äôm freaking!‚Äù As Sam Houser reviewed more of the game that he had overseen for many years, he became more desperate writing to Mr. Benzies the very next day, ‚ÄúThis [RDR] is a (recurring) nightmare. But one i/we need to get out of. I have problems with the camera all over the place. So much so, that I can‚Äôt be rational or specific about it. The darkness!!!‚Äù As reflected in his October 24, 2009 e-mail to Mr. Benzies, Sam Houser‚Äôs desperation was escalating, ‚ÄúPLEASE help me/us get rdr [Read Dead Redemption] into shape. I am a jabbering wreck right now. I need The Benz!‚Äù

You're in a thread filled with console fanboys gloating over the fact that RDR2 might not be on PC or will be delayed, that's why.

74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,"I hope so too, and the on the Xbox one it's emulated. That's why only some games work on Xbox one and when you run the game it has to download a modified version that will work on the Xbox one.

My personal hope is that the Xbox one gets hacked so we can see what makes the 360 emulator work. Also from what I understand the Xbox one runs a modified version of Windows 10 it would be fucking amazing if the Xbox one got hacked to run windows, the Xbox one x has some pretty good specs for the price"
74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,Are the other games even released yet?
74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,Nioh is coming to PC in a month. You're right with the rest though.
74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,"Well I did say two exclusives so I'm not sure what your point is, and it running on rpcs3 is just another reason why the ps4 is a waste of money"
74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,Exactly. They're only doing this for profit. Companies need to be more consumer friendly instead of only focusing on money. This is why Sony and Microsoft get such a bad reputation for their consoles. Because the way they handle things isn't good. You have to pay to play online on a console you already bought on a game you already bought using Wi-Fi you're already paying for!?! What bullshit is that?!? 
74io7c,2017-10-05,2017-10-06,What bad games have Rockstar released? And what promises have they made regarding RDR2? You really think RDR2 is going to turn out like No Man's Sky?

The game that drops out the other end is hardly bad and is genuinely decent, but because it's balls were hyped until they went sore ahead of time and promised the world to the audience, it was a disappointment due to impossibly high expectations.

I mean, should I bring up the promised GTA V single player DLC that was promised and then ditched in favor of the GTA Online trash? Or, Take-Two's two-faced words of supporting mods and then trying to eliminate them when they discovered how much cash they were raking in via Shark Cards on a premium priced game? And, hell, even the older stuff doesn't get off Scott-free. The original Red Dead Redemption was buggier than a big bug, bugging out in a dune buggy. For instance, I still recall how often my horse would get lodged in a wall, falling through the ground, the camera leaving you behind, being unable to start missions because the NPCs lost their heads, wagons and horses rubberbanding into the sky, and even birds having bodies of NPCs as they fly around. And, the less is said about the PC port of GTA IV, the better. "

fpofr5,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,"I love this painting the only difference in my opinion is bob Ross has a haze/blur(not to sure what to call it other than that forgive my lace or art terminology)type of style to his paintings where this looks very clear and detailed!

Does he take commissions for work ?"

fpofr5,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,"Really nice work bro.

One thing I'd point out is your cabin has impossible perspective. It's a common mistake in art and not many folk would notice it, it's just if you can see the side of the cabin like that then the base can't be straight like that. It would be angling up to the left to follow the rules of perspective.

Great job overall though!"
fpofr5,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,i actually would not mind paying money for a painting of this calibre
fpofr5,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,"""Isn't five dollars enough? It's just your time and talent you used, not as real effort as with a real job"""

fpofr5,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,"Surprisingly cheap.

Remember, Bob Ross literally created the style in order to churn out thousands of paintings at a blistering fast speed. By his own account, he produced at least 30,000 paintings, not including the thousands and thousands of tin pan paintings he sold for $5 while in the Air Force. 

Ross sold most of his canvas paintings for the equivalent of about $50-200, adjusted for inflation."
fpofr5,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,What did the OP say?  I dont want to figure out how to private message someone.
fpofr5,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,"This isn't very good, though. I'd think twice about hanging that on my walls."
fpofr5,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,That gives me an idea for another painting...
fpofr5,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,"Good question. That's my painting outfit. Shitty jeans and a flannel shirt that doubles as a rag if I ever really need it to. Only makes sense to cover one set of clothes in paint, right?"
fpofr5,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,"Bob Ross' paint style is designed to be very fast. He basically covers the entire canvas in a wet layer (that liquid white shiz he keeps talking about). That way he can very quickly blend any paint he adds into the background or each other. It's nothing like a more traditional oil painting technique.

While filming the tv show he made every painting in triplicate, one after another. The first version was free form and acted as the painting guide for the version he painted on camera. Then after the recording, he made a 'perfect' third version to be photographed for his books because he figured he had it down at that point."
fpofr5,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,Literally did this for another painting I posted a while back.

Just get some basic equipment and watch a video you like  once. Then go through it with him, pausing and rewinding as needed. You'll be surprised at how easy it is - especially if you stop worrying about skill and just imitate as best you can while having fun."

fpofr5,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,He painted a man with a hat leaning on a tree next to a campfire once.

While I definitely can (and do!) paint using more demanding techniques, I'd encourage anyone who is curious about trying art to gave painting along with Bob a go. No time like the present - if you find yourself with an excess of time thanks to (to pick an example at random) a pandemic putting everyone in quarantine, you may as well have fun doing a happy little painting with Bob."
fpofr5,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,"Also this is a pretty solid dinner/drinking party idea if you need something wholesome for the fam. My cousin bought some canvas, paints, and brushes and threw an episode on before dinner.

What are you taking about? Actually read the question, analyse it, and *then* comment back.

They never once asked ""how many days did this take?"" They asked:

>Was this a one day project OR did you just keep wearing the same outfit

OP then answered with ""that's my painting outfit"" which clearly means he kept wearing the same outfit (which is one of the options posed by the question).

Now did we figure out how many days it took him to make it? No, but that's because it was never part of the question."

I genuinely don't understand why some people get upset when others share their own hard work that they're proud of. For me, seeing cool stuff that other people have done is the main reason I even come to reddit. But hey, each to their own. Hope you have a good day man."

Riding horses is like a partner ship like you see in ice skaters, dancers, musicians. They could all change partners and dance just fine but it wouldn‚Äôt quite be the same. 

Horses are the same with their riders, there are so many cues to give them as a rider and so many cues you get from the horse. A professional could ride the horse and get the same results, but the partnership is different.

Horses are really good at reading people. A sensitive horse would know if you have bad intentions and would most likely do what it could to get the bad person away."

nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,Reminds me of the film [Stay Alive](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thefilmagazine.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2015%2F02%2Fstay-alive-screencap.jpg&f=1&nofb=1) ~
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,My favorite game ever made. It saddens me to think that I probably won't ever play a game as close to perfect again in my lifetime.
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,Looks like a teaser for the new map for Hunt: Showdown
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,One of the rare instances when Dutch actually had a plan
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,Yoooooo thats sick

nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,You painted this when the game came out and it just dried right? Lol looks amazing
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,I read the title and it still took me a second to really realize this was a painting
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,So good might have to buy this for PC and replay it
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,"Looks awesome, now I want to play the game again"
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,I genuinely thought this was a screenshot with graphics set to low before I read the title
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,This is my favorite mission on red dead. This or the one with Lenney where you get drunk.
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,I should totally finish this game
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,"At first.i read the title as Red Dawn not Red Dead and I was so confused, I was like I've watched that movie multiple times and I've never seen that scene anyway thay looks rlly cool nice job"

nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,I felt like such a badass riding towards that mansion with my crew knowing full well some shits about to go down. One of the best parts of the game for sure.
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,The music that plays during the ride and lead up to this scene was so impactful. I think in my play through it was raining early on and it set the mood even more.
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,Looks like left 4 Dead
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,I loved the details put into this portion of the game.

nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,"One of my favorite versions of this was a clip on Youtube with subtitles some fan added. There's a line where Dutch says something like ""come out you inbred piece of filth!"" and then someone from the manor responds with ""What?!"" In the subtitled version, it goes 

Dutch: Come out you inbred piece of filth!

Inbred piece of filth: What?!"
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,You thought you could just put a screenshot and nobody would notice? >!/s!<

nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,The last moments where they are actually united as family. It is all downhill for Dutchs gang after this.

I knew they had to do a ""falling out"" angle to make the first one make sense. But sometimes, I really wish they went with the classic Western last stand and most of the crew die brothers in arms style"

nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,This mission really felt like you could connect with the gang because of a shared feeling of rage towards the braithwaites

It's a shame the gameplay is not that good... this scene/mission alone is a good representative of that, everything is scripted, there's a huge gun fight but the shooting sucks, etc..

nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,Most of the game is great but it's this moment where you feel like you're doing some real cowboy movie shit.

nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,Hahaha! Yeah. He definitely didn‚Äôt feel that way when Marston caught up with him in RDR1.

I think Red Dead should be more compact. In contrast to something like GTA which would be better off with a slower pace because you live in a open world full of exciting things, red dead is just basically nature. There's hardly anything to do"

nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,Just played this scene for the first time last week!
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-13,Yeah you are right no one is ever going to play the game for the first time anymore because it‚Äôs been 3 years. Good shout. Move on. Nothing to see here.
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,I think that was the best mission of any video game I've ever played. Every second of it was so entertaining.

nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,"Eh. I'd like to disagree. There needs to be a balance. Yes, I don't want constant fast travel. But RDR2 is just too slow

I think something like The Witcher had the best of both worlds. You had to have some adventure but it never felt jarring

In RDR2 it is jarring, you get punished for it. Take care of clothes, food, horse, police... Sometimes you get attacked by random mobs (I've been attacked more than once by mobs on a single trip)

There's a difference between immersion and straight up pointless gameplay. I was pretty immersed in Red Dead 2, 4 Chapters in. I didn't need 30 more hours of shitty horse travel and the most boring side missions after that. I understood the world pretty well at that point.

The biggest gripe is travel. If they sorted out the travel, the game would've been fine. Because it does force travel sometimes (which is fine. In those forced travelling missions you absorb the world enough imo... It's a open world. If you want you can always go and explore. But the fact that the game had no mechanic outside of it was dogshit)

Also, I loved RDR1. That had a good balance of everything in my opinion. Even the setting was superior. RDR2 is pretty much just nature overload other than that one town which had a flu or something."
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,I never beat the story cause I got lost in the game and was let down by the online experience bad enough to never touch it again but now I wanna finish it.

I insist"

nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,The way the soundtrack swelled like it would in a Sergio Leone film gave me goosebumps.
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,What took ya so long? (This isn‚Äôt supposed to be rude it‚Äôs a serious question)
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-13,"Well, let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs like a movie from about 5 or so years ago. Every seems to like it so you expect everyone has seen it. Pretty much same senerio."
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,You can't stop us from talking about a 3-year-old game because 'someone might get upset' lol

nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,"If you've spent the last three years planning to play the game and avoiding spoilers, what the hell are you doing reading comments on a post whose title makes it explicitly clear it is depicting a scene in the game? What the hell do you think the comments are gonna be about if not the scene being depicted?"
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-13,"I genuinely hate this sentiment. If a plot point being revealed ruins the game/movie/tv show/book for people then that game/movie/tv show/book was never worth your time in the first place. ""Spoilers"" are not a big deal since the story isn't ruined by knowing how it ends, and they will never be a big deal since only a shitty story is ruined by ""spoilers"" being revealed.

Edit: I would like to note I'm not advocating spoiling the story for people. I'm noting that in a game so crammed with emotional moments a few spoilers do not ruin the story."

nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,"Finish it.

My only advice is when you find a horse you connect with keep that horse, forget about stats, make it YOUR horse. Name it, feed it, love it. I won‚Äôt spoil anything but it‚Äôs worth it. It‚Äôs the best single player game I‚Äôve ever played.

Mass Effect is the best trilogy for me by far. But in terms of one single game nothing beats RDR2. Forget online. Soak the single player in, take your time with it. It‚Äôs not a game, it‚Äôs an experience."
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,I refuse to play online. Can‚Äôt let it taint my memory of playing this work of art for the first time.
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,"Totally true. This combined with the slow animations and large travel times with the same repeated open world stuff happening again and again and the 30fps on consoles was such a turn off for me. The story, i agree was immensely good, but I couldn't see past the other issues."

nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,I started it and dropped it shortly after because of class. Decided to play through a few weeks ago and I should have played it a long time ago!
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,"I disagree. the element of surprise is large part of many games and for it to lose its strength can bring down a game. you see this in almost every single player game. there is always that one moment that you wish you could experience in a game the same way you did for the first time. Knowing exactly how that moment will pan out, it really isn't the same."
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,"Wow, just WOW! Who the hell has a mindset like this??? This guy apparently. You're a special breed my guy. The element of surprise IS a huge thing."
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-13,"Not cool bro, people tend to wait for sales and time they can actually spend on plying video games, they don‚Äôt hop right through when everything gets released. Minor spoilers are ok but that was a dick move."
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,"Oh yes I remember that! That was pretty funny. I watched a stream of that game on release and oh my god the bugs. Really loved the concept though.

RDR2 is just on another level for me. I consider it a masterpiece."
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,"I wasn't really expecting anything. I'm just saying the game revolves a lot around seeing, observing and exploring scenery and it gets boring after a while

Horse travel should not have been a forced mechanic. Fast travel should've been here (and not the shitty train one or the one you unlock way late in the game by upgrading the deck. A Witcher 3 like Fast travel would've been nice)"
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,"I fully went in expecting it to be ""Just okay. I guess?"" Fully expecting to think Arthur was just alright.

I have never, not once, not ever, wanted to kill a character in a game like I did the final ""boss"" of the game. You know who I mean. I have never once felt *sad, genuinely sad* over the death of a fictional character.

The game is so well written, the characters so well defined and acted and everything comes together so well that it actually ruins it's own replayability. I cannot go back and be a different version of Arthur. My decisions will always be the same as my original playthrough because, to me, *that is* Arthur Morgan.

There are better game play experiences. There are games that feel like less of a chore. But it will be a long time until something comes along that can beat out the in depth character examination that is the story of Dutch and his gang."
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,It‚Äôs so amazing that it managed to be as amazing as it was when people were kind of giving a lot of backlash that there was a bee main character before the release.
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14," I started playing it when it first came out and just got sidetracked by real life right when I got >!shipwrecked in not-Cuba, and to be honest, I was sad about Hosea and Lenny!< so I never finished it.  I recently came back to it and started from the beginning.  It's such a good game but now I've been >!diagnosed with terminal tuberculosis!< and every mission I do just makes me sad.  I'm going to keep going, though.

I mean, I knew >!Arthur wasn't a character in RDR1, but I've been telling myself my head-canon would be that he would fake his death, reconnect with Mary Linton and go live happily ever after in a cabin with her somewhere!<

This game also really make me want to replay RDR1 now that I've spent so much time with so many of the characters John Marston had to deal with in that game."
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,"we could be twins

yeah i never understood why red dead even wanted to be online? for me it's not that type of game

nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,"As someone who played through the story twice (and started a 3rd) you should give it a try. I just recently started playing online and it's a much different experience, but I'd addicting as hell, lots of different things to do. Also, the skills you learnt from the story will give you a leg up on other new players."
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,"My whole hope for the game lay in the online experience because I had such nostalgia associated with RDR1 online. Let‚Äôs not confuse that for red dead revolver, I had that as a kid on ps2. Could never beat  that damn train mission at the end. Nobody talks about  that, but everybody wanna bring up San Andreas‚Äô train mission"
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,Yeah it‚Äôs a great game
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,I wholeheartedly disagree with this sentiment. You can experience more intense emotions knowing what is coming because then you notice other things because you aren't as caught up in shock factor.
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,Not if the story is actually good.
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,the duality of Reddit...

nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-13,"It's been 3 damn years. Even if you didn't buy it at launch, there is a statute of limitations here."
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,"It is, production wise. No doubt. Just love those silly completely off the rails quests."
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,">oh my god the bugs

You should pick it up now. It's been several years, the game is mostly bug free and it's extremely good. I can also recommend the DLCs. While RDR2 has the best open world I have ever seen and probably will see for a long time, KCD even trumps RDR2 in immersion imo."
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,Fair enough.

Well said indeed.
It‚Äôs not a game, it‚Äôs an experience."
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,All the characters have such depth. Arthur's great but everyone from Sadie to Tilly had great stories. Soft spot for Sadie's arc. The speech she gives after her and Arthur finish her last story mission broke my heart.
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,"FUCK YES!! That's the problem with this shithole country, too fucking much of *that guy* and not enough Arthur Morgans..."
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,"But that‚Äôs the point.

Arthur was just a thug at the start, little more. As we play we discover him. He‚Äôs an artist, he writes, he‚Äôs loved and lost.

The reason we as players fell in love with Arthur is the same reason we fall in love with anything or anyone, we see past the rough mask of an exterior and see the soft underbelly of the interior.

Rockstar was brilliant in how they marketed Arthur, a rough Clint Eastwoodesque man with no name. He ended up being a man who truly personified the game‚Äôs title: Redemption."
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,That's why I don't listen to hype or bashing before playing a game unless I see a lot of the same thing being said like cyberpunk being glitch hell.
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,"Oh you poor thing. I honestly can't imagine how you felt.

I fucking cried when it happened."
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,There are people playing online without playing the campaign first?

nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,"All you had to do is rob the damn train, Marston!!"
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,"That's just not how it works, mate. And even if that's how not how you think, a huge amount of people are still heavily affected by spoilers, so it's not a cool thing to do. Sure, I already knew about Arthur while going into Red Dead 2 but I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't have been prepared for it if I didn't know about it. What's even the point of watching a story if you already get a huge spoiler? It would ruin so many good moments and instead of saying ""Holyshit"", you would be saying ""Oh yeah, that finally happened""."
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-13,The house burning down is somewhat ok to spoil but not the fucking ending you dummy

nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,"So nicely put. Your comment makes me feel sorry for people who see video games as just childish fun. Games, especially in modern days, are beautiful works of art with so much time and though put into them. They can contain character development, deep emotional moments, beautiful scenery, and much more. And Rockstar excels in all of these aspects."
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this transcript from you. Also, can I name my horse seriously in game? If so it‚Äôll definitely be Epona lol. I may have been halfway through or better. I‚Äôm unsure. It‚Äôs been awhile."

nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,Lol what? Obviously when they do release something the time and effort shows. Let them work. RDR2 was so worth the wait.
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,I let my uncle borrow it and went to visit one night and watched him beat that fuckin mission. I never did. I‚Äôll never forget that night. He also killed a mouse with a daisy BB gun sitting in a lazy boy that night  lmaooo
nz7134,2021-06-13,2021-06-14,"So you think nobody can enjoy a story, regardless of the quality, if they get a plot point spoiled? Then why do people reread books, rewatch movies and tv shows, and replay games? It's to experience those emotions all over again. When the story is good enough it's about the journey to the point that is spoiled that creates the emotional connection. I will acknowledge that shock value is stronger if you don't see a twist coming, but shock wears off while true emotional connection endures."

 being a dedicated red dead fan, i'm constantly on the lookout for new news and rumours.. i suppose it is a good thing if more people see these types old rumours though, get more hype, discussion and demand for a new game going to hopefully show rockstar how badly we want this game. there's no doubt in my mind that it is in development.. i mean if it is going to be released sometime in the next few years, then it's very likely that it's already been in development for years.

Now this?

Yep, it's Leak Season alright. 3 months to go."
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,"I don't like the multiple playable character thing :/

I never felt like I cared about or connected with GTA V's characters. I loved John Marston because I was with him through every second, both the triumphant moments and the bullshit ones."

4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,I am crossing my fingers and hoping it'll come to PC!
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,Awesome! my second favorite game after the last of us

4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,"I don't believe this for a second. I've been teased so much over the years with ""Red Dead Redemption squeal is gonna be announced soon"" that I REFUSE to believe this game is even in development until I'm holding a copy of it in my hands. "

4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,"While this is awesome news, and I can't wait for the Fall '17 to be here, I still can't help but wonder when the hell they'll ever get around to making Bully 2?

4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,I bet it'll be called Red Dead Rebellion
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,I'm going to choose to be skeptical so this is still a surprise to me
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,Isn't this the reveal? 
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,WiiU exclusive side-scroller
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,"Timing is about right for a new Red Dead, however, I don't believe most of this rumor to be true. the ""legends of the west"" rumor was really absurd, it included you playing as Seth as part of it. If that isn't a flag right there I don't know what is.

I still think we might get something this year, though. Red Dead deserves to be on the new consoles and PC, i missed out on the multiplayer last gen. So this would revitalize the game pretty well. A HD version really feels necessary, it's just too classic of a game to keep in one generation."

4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,Lol nope

4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,fucking finally! 
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,There would be more leaks if this was in serious development.
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,"This makes no sense, RDR was #2 in the series already ‚Ä¶¬†"
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,Is this going to be an xbox only game?
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,Fuck OP don't play with my emotions like that
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,Bully 2 pls
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,No. Fucking. Way. I have waited so long for this day to come!! 
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,Wouldn't it be red dead 3
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,What happened to Red dead Revolution?
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,"I would buy the fuck out of this game. With that being said, I liked the setting of Red Dead so much that I don't want them to change it at all, and I know they will."
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18, Please let it come to PC!!!!!
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,I will buy a system for this. RDR is one of the best games I've ever played.

4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,"OMG, YES."
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,"Isn't it exceedingly ironic that games are revealed online to be ""revealed"" at E3 months before the fact?"
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,"What a great time to bring the franchise to PC!

^pls^^rockstar"
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,Stop trying to make RDR2 happen. Its not going to happen.
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,"Is there a Vegas betting pool for what the title is? I'd like to bet on it.

I'm going with ""Red Dead Resurrected."" "
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,"This is not very credible.

That said, I'd like RDR2, as long as it isn't called RDR2.  If they're going to do a series of westerns set in the same universe, they should name it like the Dollars Trilogy.

A Fistful of Dollars -> A Few Dollars More -> The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly

Red Dead Revolver -> Red Dead Redemption -> Red Dead Return or something.  Remembrance.  

Red Dead Remembrance.  Because of how and when RDR ended, if they do a sequel instead of a prequel, the title would bring to mind [John](#spoiler) as well as the Old West.  Civilization has spread and the West has been largely tamed, but cowboys are still cowboys.  Oh, and [Jack Marston](#spoiler) will be more likable.

At first, I didn't see how you could do a sequel to RDR because of when it was set, but I suppose it could mirror the death of the Samurai in Japan."
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,Was wondering if this was [Circle jerk](https://m.reddit.com/r/circlejerk)
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,I bet it's going to be about John Marston during his time in the gang when he was younger.
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,I would love a sequel to Bully honestly
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,"That shit better have drivable model t's

4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,Can we get RDR1 on pc..?
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,"This is bullshit.  This exact same rumour is several years old now.  The last iteration was that ""Legends of the West"" was being announced at E3 2015, then it was Gamescom, then....

People are so hyped for a new open world western, and so am I.  Why doesn't another studio just make one? The interest amongst gamers is obviously there but it would seem that Rockstar have zero interest in doing it."
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,"Isn't saying ""Red Dead Redemption 2"" like saying ""Skyrim 2""? The original was Red Dead Revolver, and then Red Dead Redemption is the second one. So this new one is number 3?"
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,Wasn't Red Dead Redemption already a sequel to Red Dead Revolver?
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,Anyone feel like trading RDR for Destiny? Have yet to play it.
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,"I remember I bought red dead redemption on a whim, it was a great decision it was a great game "
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,fraghero.com? I've never even heard of this site. Is this your site OP? Click baiting all of us lol. This would be awesome if true. Ill believe it when I see it though. Or reported on by a more legit site.
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,Hot dang am I ever excited for this one!!

4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,This is so obviously bullshit.
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,I CAN ONLY GET SO ERECT
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,"Squeee!!! Oh, please be true..."
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,Just fucking release it on pc please!!!

Hopefully a The Warriors remake."
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,I hope they announce some GTAV story expansions. But RDR2 would be a pleasant surprise. 
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,"I only had a PC when the original was released, and was very disappointed to miss out on what looked like an amazing game.

Now I have a PC and a PS4.. so either way I cannot fucking wait!"
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,Did they technically just announce it there?
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,Excited.
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,Wasn't Red Dead Redemption a sequel to Red Dead Revolver?
4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,PS3 and Xbox 360 only

4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,I hope it won't be like Division or alot of other games in the sense that it will get announced and E3 then not come out for years to come. I hope its about Johns life before the first game back when he was a criminal.

4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,"There are multiple things wrong with this

1) an anonymous source from a reader is a major red flag. There's a high probability that's it's just an asshole who has nothing better to do.

2) People seem to not understand that it's the Red Dead franchise, not the Red Dead Redemption franchise.

3) And the most important point that people seem to forget. Rockstar never reveals any of their major projects at E3. They do it on their own accord."

4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,This exact rumor happened at last year's E3.

4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,"My friend and I have always talked about this game. We both found it odd a second game was never released for Red Dead Redemptoion since 1) It's a good game with a neat story in the wild west. 2) People LOVED it. It was popular. 3) It seemed to have made some decent money when it came out. 

This is all just speculation on my part (and my friend's) since we both thought the game would become a new franchise. Eventually he came to the conclusion that MAYBE the reason the game wasn't turned into a franchise was because it was to much like GTA, but with cowboys and horses.

4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,OK first of all Red Dead Redemption was the 2nd in the franchise so this next one is going to be the 3rd in the series. COME ON PEOPLE! This isn't FFXIII 2 or some shit. (pushes up glasses)

They said it themselves, RDR is important to rockstar as much as GTA and they probably want to incorporate a GTA online aspect to the RDR universe as well for whatever new game they make using that IP.

He drives the Redemption aspect of the game. And the fact that he turns into what his father was shows that John ended up having no redemption, so Jack is necessary for the story of the game to have legitimate meaning instead of generic video game plot. I would hate to play as him in a sequel because his father's story is over, and he only existed to give a grim, bitterly black humor end to John Marston's tale"

Which would also allow it to take place before/during ""Redemption"" rather than be stuck taking place after it (during the end of the cowboy era and the rise of automobiles and urban development).

They'll probably introduce three badass cowboy characters, perhaps including a cowgirl, and let you swap back and forth between them like GTAV."

4avf1g,2016-03-17,2016-03-18,"To be fair though, that was in the previous generation when the consoles and the PC had huge differences in operating code, and porting games across that gap actually took a lot of effort. 

The current generation of consoles are *much* more similar to PCs than the previous gens, and the games are basically interchangeable as far as the code goes between the two consoles, and between those and PCs. 

To put it another way, in the last generation bringing a game from console to PC was like translating a novel from Chinese to French. In the current gen it's like translating a novel from British English to American English."

It could be

Windows V.9

Microsoft Windows 9

Or infinite other options. 

I think the psychological association with Windows 9X, and the resonance of 10, are more than enough to explain it. "

Then one day I did it. Staggered him with my first few shots to delay his first shot and buy me a second, then one of my bullets found his head. I'd beaten him. 

With that I unlocked the final multiplayer character and two weeks later my **goddamn memory card corrupted the save**.

The beginning of the game, where John went to the fort single handedly to try to take down Bill at the fort. He wasn't stupid, he knew that if he went like that he'll mostly be killed. That's what he was trying to do. He knew that there's no redemption in the eye of the government, and that despite what the FBI said they were never going to let him go. The best shot that he had was for him to die, so that the FBI will leave the rest of his family alone. That way, his wife (a former prostitute looking for redemption as a mother) can live in peace with her son.

The whole game is John grasping at straws trying to keep his son away from a life of crimes like he did so that he could grow up normally. This is why the game had you spend those missions on the farm messing with cows and horses.

But we all know what happened in the end. There's no redemption. His son became the exact person that he was with the assassination of the FBI agent."

fn9ces,2020-03-22,2020-03-23,">practically all male website
    
Women make up about a third of reddit's userbase. Perhaps it seems more male-dominated than it actually is because everyone keeps using men as the default gender for a reddit user even though that's wrong half as often as it is correct."
fn9ces,2020-03-22,2020-03-23,This.
fn9ces,2020-03-22,2020-03-23,Make your own art and then you can post it without showing your face.
fn9ces,2020-03-22,2020-03-23,"I agree with this. I saw OP's history and she has posted the same pic on this sub but it didn't get this much upvotes.

I mean she is really a great artist. like srsly. but it's a fact that people in this sub prefer those with women in it. To be fair, it's a trend here and they have the freedom to use this trend for themselves. The major consequence I can see with this practice, though, is lowering the quality of posts on the top page of the sub. If this continues, more of these types of redditors will post content like this here and we will be r/girlswgamingstuff instead of r/gaming.   


So basically, it's up to us if we want to sustain this thing or not. But also to them, if karma is more important than using a few brain cells to know if their content is appropriate to the sub or not."
fn9ces,2020-03-22,2020-03-23,Your ‚Äúcomment‚Äù isn‚Äôt an observation it‚Äôs an assumption and it‚Äôs sounds like your saying that women can‚Äôt be in photos with their work unless they‚Äôre looking for attention

but you most certainly are debating something that is noticed and discussed by people on here all the time. It's a cliche at this point and more people on reddit are sick of it and honestly embarrassed"
fn9ces,2020-03-22,2020-03-23,"Then again, isn't anyone who posts on reddit seeking attention, including women. Therefore aren't they attention seeking women because they post on reddit, rather than just because they're women?"

It is. 'Im a girl, give me attention' in its purest. 
Believe what you like. I'm not a sheep, and she received my down vote. This is sad because that bit of artwork is exceptional, and had it not been for the comments or collage to 'prove I'm a girl' it would received an award. 
Like who the fuck even needs to prove I'm a girl, who cares unless it's for upvotes."

fn9ces,2020-03-22,2020-03-23,"I see your point and agree, everyone on Reddit wants upvotes and popularity but in this case this girl is getting insulted and bashed for seeking attention on her artwork because everyone seems to think because she put a sliver of her face in she‚Äôs using the fact that she‚Äôs a woman to gain attention"

It gave me positive honor for burning this guy alive."
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-05,"I came across the kkk one suntil now, waited and saw two accidentally burn themselves to death. I then talked to the leader, who was pissed I didn‚Äôt help them, so I shot him in the face. I proceeded to loot the bodies, and a whiteness shows up. A black man... looks at the bodies, then at me: ‚Äúdid you do this?‚Äù He gets out a gun and points it at me. 

Now I know the npc was probably programmed to be offended by the corpses, but I‚Äôd like to believe he thought I was part of the kkk, and that‚Äôs what made him draw a gun. "
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,It's funnier to not disturb them. They're so clumsy they always end up killing themselves
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-05,"The honor system in this game kinda pisses me off. 

Looting dead bodies you don‚Äôt kill lowers your honor.

Petting dogs increases it. 

Shooting people who start shooting at you first lowers your honor. How does that even make sense. 

I usually do the nice option when I have the choice but if playing the game like ghandi is the only way then screw that. 

Is there are purpose to the honor? I don‚Äôt know yet. "
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,"I allowed them to carry out their event. Once they were done scattering from the fire, I lassoed the leader, hog-tied him, read his notes (which are hilarious btw), and took him on a journey. 

Eventually he ran out of new dialogue and I used him in A Most Dangerous Game -esque event. Dropped him in a field, and limited myself to throwing knives. He was fast. Until he lost control of his appendages. Then I kicked his body off a cliff. 

I really like this game."
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-05,"I threw a stick of dynamite into the first meeting I found. Gunned down the survivors. A black guy on a horse came riding up, took a really long look, and then decided to report me for murder. :("

9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-05,"Unrelated, but I think RDR2's honor system is kind of pointless and stupid.

It hardly effects the game. The reasons for ""what is honorable and what is not"" is stupid.

So it's honorable to rescue a cop from a bunch of bandits, but it's also honorable to help a convict escape. How does that make sense?

Not to mention all the fun things to do in the game (robbing banks, stage coaches, horses, trains) all lower your honor. And unlike RDR1, wearing your bandana doesn't stop your honor gain/decrease."

Slaughtering stupid ignorant redneck scum klansmen and lunatic confederate diehards in this game is pure therapy for me for the anxiety the real world situation of deplorables in office gives me.

9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,It should be noted that these are just KKK wannabees and not the actual clan. Thus why they are hilariously inept every time you encounter them.
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-05,"It's not really disturbing to see them in the game. They're presented as comical. It'd be disturbing if they were in the process of lynching someone or maybe raiding a church. As it is in the game they come off as just some run of the mill racists who happen to be having a small convention. Everybody's met one and everybody's (hopefully) ignored them (and by ""met one"" I mean any racist, not specifically a Klansman) . If you wanna fill me with the urge to murder them have them doing some of the awful things the Klan was doing in their early years. Have them be an actual threat like they were. The closest they got to that in my game is when Arthur made fun of a leader after some of his guys got crushed by a cross and the guy pulled a knife on him. "
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,Cause they aren't KKK members. They are peaceful protesters of fire.

9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-05,I see all these KKK posts but have absolutely no idea where these events are at lmao...im on my second playthrough and have not seen a single clan member besides the guy in Saint Denis spouting about dna
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,Wtf I didn't know KKK was even in the game 
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,AS IT SHOULD BE.
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,"Oh man, imma kill so many of them in this game."
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,"The Eugenics guy can be killed and well. You don't gain or lose honor. The law was standing next to ne and did nothing after I shot him. Well, he acted surprised and said, ""Holy shit!"""
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-05,But you shouldn‚Äôt because they usually end up getting themselves killed in hilarious fashion 
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,I want to know why my honour goes down when someone  pulls a gun on me when they're angry and fires it. Yet I fire back and I get punished.
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,Idk why anyone would‚Äôve thought it would lower your honor level. They‚Äôre a gang of criminals and murderers.
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,I shot a white supremacist handing out pamphlets in Saint Denis right beside a lawman. No one cared and it was great.
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,What I want to know is why does your honor go down if nobody witnessed anything?
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,Kill them all
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,"So, same as real life then?"
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,lol who gives a shit it's a game
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,"Haha, classic KKK members."
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-05,I gained honor when I antagonized them.
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-05,I killed a KKK and got my honor up
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-05,Spoiler much lol damn
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,I actually gained honor for (quite literally) executing the black-robed klansman as he was walking away from the burning white-robed klansman.

9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,I just came across my first batch over the weekend. I lobbed a stick of dynamite at them. 
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,"Lol man I feel like ive been playing this game like crazy and im amazed I still havent made it to this chapter, even tho I caught wind of them like 3 days after launch"
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,If you kill the leader in black it actually gives you honor.
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,"I heard that is raises it, if so then how can i find them? My honor is almost all the way low and i need an easy way to raise it
"
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,Probably the only thing that really made me says holy ****. Was during the mission where go into the old guys foreclosed house to retrieve his things and you realize why he doesn't have a job anymore. When you give them back and he's there on his hands and knees crying. If you put a bullet into the back of his skull you get good karma. I can't even put into words what went through my mind when I saw that little honor sign pop up 
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,Where in the map are they? I finished the story and have yet to come across them. 
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,"Came across them once. Lined up the whole group with dead eye then the game crashed.

Haven't seen them since."
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,Where in the world do I go to find them? I‚Äôve been riding my horse in circles at night with no luck
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,"I killed the leader, and it actually brought up my honor."
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,"Can you join them? It sounds kinda fun having the character with the title of Grand Wizard or w/e DnD titles they used before DnD was a thing. But that might just be the PDX fan side of me. 

EDIT: Apparently wanting to roll a morally bankrupt character for a play through is frowned upon. I'll just go over here and play with horses and bears instead then. "

9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-05,"I get it, but isn't it still murder?"
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,But spoiling will
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,This game has a weird moral compass. I get to kill 100 police officers while robbing a bank but killing a ex-slaver will give me good karma.  
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-05,I don't mind that but the fact that they'll simply kill themselves with their own buffoonery if you don't intervene is a bit cringy tbh.  It's like trying too hard to make a point.
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-05,[removed]
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,Well I don‚Äôt think Jesus would‚Äôve murdered a group of KKK douchebags either 
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,And yet for some reason game journalists still call the game offensive because you have the option to attack Women's suffrage leaders.

9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,"Black guy here (cause that's important to people). Did you know the KKK actually started out as somewhat decent people and not a hate group? They formed to help protect farmers and stuff. They don't teach that in schools. They gloss over a lot of things actually. If i remember correctly, they disbanded and then reformed into the monsters they're known as today. I saw it on some PBS documentary years ago."

9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,Hey I'm all for klansmen killing but I thought this was supposed to be the old western 'south'. Just doesn't seem realistic to not be aligned with the klan in this game.
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,That‚Äôs kinda bad considering that they are still people 
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,"Is everyone in this thread really this ignorant or am I misinformed? It was my understanding that the kkk does not exist in this game; they are called chalcedonians and worship a turtle, believe in paganism and have nothing against black people "
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-05,"LOL at a dozen murders giving your honor level a hit. I get more of a positive hit for saving someone, than killing double that amount in murder. Bonus for looting each one."
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,But won't that be offensive to kkk members?
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,So much for the tolerant left

Not super surprised but I wasn‚Äôt expecting specific dialogue while I was stabbing them."
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,"I've had 3 different encounters so far. Two encounters were larger groups. The first time there were probably 10 and I never got close to them to see what they were up to other than rocking their hoods and torches. I sniped the guy in the black who I assumed was the leader and they ended up killing me. The second time I caught a group of about 8 during an initiation. I snuck up on them and threw some dynamite. Wiped em all out. Lastly, I had the falling cross scenario. There were 3 of them and I actually approached non-threatening. The two died under the cross and when the leader said he needed to get more recruits, I tomahawked him in the back."
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,"Oh shit, I got the cross falling but had no idea that was KKK. I mean, in retrospect, it's painfully obvious, but my dumb ass was like ""Wow, those poor weird Christians just got smashed by a cross... Time to loot their corpses!""

If I had known, I would have shot the dude that was having them raise it."

9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,I never let them get to that point. I always tnt them on sight. I definitely want to see that. I need to get better at letting the random events play out before I act.

9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-05,Wouldn't think so. Even killing a store owner outright in a side mission doesn't remove them.
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-05,if they're vendor NPC's they'll come back with their head wrapped up or a cast on their leg or whatever. And they usually make a comment about yo not causing trouble again. not sure about it correlating with the KKK though.

9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-05,"No lol, the game isn't that deep. It's not like you can kill the sheriff  and run free around town while they try to hire a new one.

All games still have to spawn random characters to make the game feel alive, but in the end the technology isn't to where you can have an actual living and breathing town with every citizen being a unique entity."

9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,Did you shoot him too?

Yeah but that is realistic. People strongly look down on people stealing from the dead.

>Petting dogs increases it.

As it should, you heathen.

>Shooting people who start shooting at you first lowers your honor. How does that even make sense.

Yeah, that is frustrating. My most interesting case so far has been a guy that got into a fist fight with me in Valentine. I was honestly trying to avoid the fight, not being sure if fighting back would get me in trouble with the law. As I am running around the guy trying to box me, one of my gang members runs up, pulls out a shotgun, and lays the guy down. I am immediately wanted for murder.

Like, what? The guy that was dancing around in the street trying to avoid a fist fight?

Yeah...

>Is there are purpose to the honor? I don‚Äôt know yet.

I honestly think it is just surface level, at this point. Like, ""people say good things if it is positive and bad things if it is negative"" sort of thing. Would love to be wrong about that.

9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,You don't think stealing shit off dead bodies is wrong?
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,"I was looting dead NPC's to see if they had a quest, treasure map, items to return to their family, etc. It's very annoying that honor drops when doing this. It makes no sense."
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,There are some perks as you level up or down your honor and some items that can only be unlocked at certain levels
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,I found out that greeting random people increases honor.  Greet 3 or 4 strangers in a row and you should see the little honor thing pop up.

9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-05,"Ya know, a year ago I would've said it's insane, but as a German living in the US I keep running into people who, knowing my heritage, assume I'm ""of the same mind"" on ""certain issues"".  There's always been that kind of person, but the last year or two they've gone from rare whispers to somewhat more common and with no regard for who else is listening. 

The look on their face when I tell them how hugely multicultural Germany is now and how proud we are to have learned from such stupidity in the past is usually pretty great though.

::edit:: just before anyone gets pedantic, of course it was Nazis in Germany and not the KKK, but to these people they are basically brothers in arms. "

I don't think people think highly of the KKK. I think people are just tired of ""Nazis bad"" ""KKK bad"" posts on /r/gaming whenever any of the groups show up in a videogame.

Yes, they are fucking bad, we get it."

9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-05,"I personnaly don't think highly of the KKK at all, but I don't like applying today's morality and equality standards to historical periods. If you think like that, most of the characters in RDR2 are horrible people, and the KKK aren't even the worst. It's why I don't really like all this ""killing Nazis and racists is the best !"" trend."
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,have we really gotten to a point where a few downvotes = racists?
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,I can safely say I'm not one of them that has downvoted but I could see why someone would. I get not giving bad karma but in general arguing that killing people is a good thing is not a good thing. 
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,Its much more alarming how closely you are monitoring your upvotes tbh
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,"First of all, I‚Äôm tired of the sheer amount of rdr2 kkk posts, but secondly, in those days, most people liked the KKK, because racism was part of the culture. The ‚Äúhonour‚Äù level doesn‚Äôt seem to be based on anything, if it isn‚Äôt based on values from the time the game is set "
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,"On one hand they were horrible people. On the other hand, that does not justify killing them.


Edit: guys it's not okay to go around vigilante murdering people in real life."
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,I downvoted cause it isn‚Äôt the KKK it‚Äôs just a weird cult.
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-05,"I hate the KKK as much as the next level-headed individual, but I'm upset that the game focuses so much on murdering them and nothing else. What if I wanted to join to see a different storyline."

9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,"I actually think that's why it's a lot *more* interesting.

If it actually affected gameplay in big ways, your choices wouldn't actually be choices - at that point it's not a question of what you think is right, it's just a puzzle to be solved. Instead of asking whether I feel like shooting the guy or not, I end up asking myself what effect it will have on rewards and mission availability or whatever.

The fact that they still have a mostly nominal honor system lets them make the same statements they might otherwise make through mechanical rewards/penalties without hamstringing you by, for instance, penalizing you for doing all the fun things just like you say here."
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,Having low honor can cause you to miss missions.

9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,"I Just met him about an hour ago. I chased him down, hogtied him in broad daylight then carried him over my shoulder for about 15 minutes trying to find something to do with him...not a peep from anyone. I wanted to load him onto a train or something forcing him to leave town but I couldn't find one so I just dumped him in the bay."
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,"I refused the pamphlet and just pointed my gun at him in broad daylight. He ran off, but there was no wanted status. Guess the law has no time for his bullshit either."

9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,"So did the GOP. Thing's change. 

For what it's worth the KKK that was created in 1860 was a largely white supremacist organization according to Wikipedia and PBS so their treatment in RDR2 isn't anachronistic, with the possible exception of the white sheets and hoods which weren't common klan getup at the time - apparently it was more common for them to just wear masks.

"
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,"No. No they didn't. Maybe you are black, but you know shit all about the history of the KKK."

9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,You're the one equating the KKK with the Republicans.  I wonder why you're offended by killing the KKK not being dishonorable....

9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-05,"Definitely do not provide any substance to your claims. It‚Äôs so much better when people have to guess at what you mean. 

For example I choose to believe you think:

It‚Äôs really a clandestine gathering of sheet costume enthusiasts having their annual pointy-headed ghost meet up. 

They hide their enthusiasm for sheet costumes in a secret cant designed to sound like racism to confuse observers. 

Sheet costume enthusiasts were some on the most persecuted people in 19th century America. They fled West to escape persecution at the hands of the licensed costume manufacturers. 

But I‚Äôm pretty stoned so I might be wrong. "
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-05,What exactly about it is propaganda? That the KKK suck and deserve to be ridiculed and laughed at? That's what your statement implies. Are you really saying that the KKK is a *good* thing?

9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-05,I've found them in the woods South-West of Rhodes. I get the feeling they could be anywhere in the South of Lemoyne.
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,I first came across them SW of Valentine. I was riding at night and saw a large fire (turned out to be their torches)

9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-05,I let him languish in his misery.  Maybe I should have put a bullet in him.
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-05,I shot him and put his body in the fire! 
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,"Just to clear it up. He wasnt a slave owner.  He was a slave hunter. There are letters in the house that talk about Property recovery, and the ledger uses the word rewards for the price next to each slaves name.  The man hunted runaways."
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-05,Me too. While he was crouched over the fire by his tent. His corpse fell in the fire and then he burnt to a crisp.
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-05,"I was frustrated the game didn't let me knife him. For a moment I thought the game was telling me he was un-killable, but then I set him on fire... so yeah.

Honestly, as far as stranger/sidequests are concerned that is a standout favorite. It goes from feeling a little sorry for the downtrodden old man to a gradual realization (I read all the notes and stuff in his house) of what he was. I had forgotten, to some extent, what the setting of this game meant until that  point (this was before I came across KKK members)."
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-05,Same haha. 
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-05,Oh I was under the impression he was like an overseer or something. Because it mentioned him getting fired.
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-05,"Yes I noticed that too, was very cool!"
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-05,Damn i should have killed him
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,Funny I gained honor for leaving him alive... should've shot him 
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,"I lassoed him and he fell into his own fire. Better than I could‚Äôve done and no evidence, worked out perfect."
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,"I shot him as he was crying over the campfire.  I shot him once in the head and his dead body slumped over into the fire.  I watched a few times as his body would burn with flames, cool off briefly, and then the flames would return to burn him again.  I tried to loot the body in the brief moment the flames went away, but they come back to soon and it won't let me.  Basically his body keeps igniting in flames over and over again.  A fitting ending."
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,"If it‚Äôs the person I think he was not a slave owner, but someone who worked capturing escaped slaves. "
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,You gain honor no matter what. I didn't shoot him and still gained honor.
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,Fuck! I just did this. Should have killed him.
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,I pushed him in the fire at his camp lol
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,"I figured ""living will be your punishment"" and left him alone on the woods and I gained honor."
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-05,"Well you lose honor for killing them during the day but once they put the hood on at night you don't lose honor.

9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,"So much this. Usually I don't make the comment though cause I know I'm gonna get called a Nazi sympathizer or something. Enjoying the thought of harming people does not make you a good person, even if the people are bad people. Same way it is with all the calls for torture as punishment or prison-murder whenever there's an article about some awful criminal.

As soon as the person is not a threat to others, there is no justification for violence. If that makes you disappointed, well, you're fucked in the head.

Obviously it's just a game, but I feel like for some of these people it scratches an itch that's just a little too real."
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-05,"Do... do you not think it was bad to want to kill black people 100 years ago? Like, I hate to break it to you, they were still people then too.

Like. It was legal to rape your wife until relatively recently. That doesn't mean it was any less of a disgusting thing to do."
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,"There were good people back then too. I don't excuse someone for hating black people in the 1800s because ""I wasn't educated"", because abolitionists also existed and knew the hatred and fear black people, or themselves, faced.

What's wrong with saying they are horrible people? Most of your historic figures were terrible douchebags to most people, but did great things in spite of it. You pick and choose what you like about a person. You could look at them at face-value, and if they truly did something great, they out-weigh the cons. Just keep a open eye at the good and bad of a person and see which one triumphed."

9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,"That's why I'd like to see a game that combined a reputation system with an honour system. Fallout New Vegas kind of did it, but ultimately Karma affected very little in that game.

Say you have a number of competing factions, and which factions you side with will impact the outcome of the game, so for that you make the gamer choice. But then your honour could compound with that and change how they interact with you. So a particular town could still like you because you did a bunch of stuff to help them, but be uneasy because they know about this other terrible shit you've done. So people speak to you differently, more out of respect than friendliness. And you could become a fixer of sorts, who handles all the messy jobs. While if you have high honour, you would get different missions."

 Just look up some stories about Dwarf Fortress (game Rimworld is based on) and how one simple new feature can affect the rest of the game. Like the one where the new feature was getting drunk and it coused cat's to instantly die if they tuched an alcohol stain on the floor. That's because the creator programed the cats to lick each body part and the calculation of the alcohol was based on the dwarfs who didn't lick themselves. Because of that the creator forgot to adjust how much alcohol sticks to the body and the small house cats instantly died, since each bodypart they licked was as if they drinked the whole thing.

Imagine a group now that is unhappy with all of our recent changes in society in the past twenty years and how poorly some people are taking to certain civil liberties and gender issues. At that time they had different issues, but they wanted to be free men living on their own terms. Also, as others have said Dutchs gang became more of the badguy type in this game just because of how the story has played out, but not so much in the first one. 
I bet if we still had a wild west currently, we'd have tons of outlaws right now lol. "
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,"Haven‚Äôt played RDR2 so I don‚Äôt really know how the story goes, but I feel like that‚Äôs been a problem for stories in Rockstar games for a while. The playable character has a personality and morals, yet the game is designed to allow you total freedom, which usually involves making the playable character do things they otherwise wouldn‚Äôt do, thus turning them into hypocrites. It‚Äôs like in GTA IV, where Nico talks about wanting to get away from the violence in his home country even though you might‚Äôve just gunned down hundreds of innocent people mere minutes ago. Hell, in the first Red Dead you can have atoning respectful John Marston be just as bloodthirsty as the people he‚Äôs hunting. There‚Äôs a huge disconnect between story and gameplay in these types of games, is what I‚Äôm trying to say."

Short answer:  not great, but not that worried.

Long answer:  it's higher than we've had for like half a century, but it's also not that high comparatively. There was always going to be a backlash for the hugely progressive stance we've had for the last decade, and we're not immune to ""fake news"" either.

Perhaps the reason I'm less concerned there is that I see way more people proudly sharing #WirSindMehr (We are more) than I see with any far right rhetoric, let alone actually racist talk.  It's far more open where I live in the US. 

Of course, if the last few years have shown us anything it's that anything can happen. "
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,"I don't think we (though we're not a collective hive mind) are regretful of our past but rather conscious about it and acknowledge it so that it won't happen ever again. It was atrocious, yes, but I wouldn't say that we're completely regretful. Maybe you're right but ""completely regretful"" doesn't sound right to me as a German.

What I don't understand is this hatred towards this kind of people that lived waaaay back in a time where knowledge and education was very different. I mean, nobody's hating of the Pharaohs for enslaving and sacrifying thousands and thousands of people. Perhaps it is the fact that these more recent events still have consequences on today's society."

9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,"Fable II had two different metres.

Good and Evil.

Pure and Corrupt.

Though personally I much preferred the simple Good and Evil metre in the first Fable. Though I remember when I played it when I was younger, I was conflicted over the decision of whether or not to finish off Twinblade, a bandit king. When I did, I got Evil points for it. It was conflicting because my rationale was that Twinblade could always once again menace society or harm innocents. While he acknowledges that after being bested ""I'm finished anyway,"" it's hard to say that making sure of that is a *bad* thing to do.

And it's also hard to say that letting him live and being merciful was such a *good* thing to do, as well.

Most other things made sense though. Killing bad creatures (including bandits) was good. Killing innocent civilians was bad. Taking up a corrupt mayor's offer at marriage in exchange for silence was, if I remember correctly, bad. And >!killing your sister in exchange for the Sword of Aeons, as powerful as the name implies,!< was unfortunately also bad.

But it's okay because so long as you kill enough evil things it doesn't matter how many innocents died at your hand. Nothing can't be undone!"

9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-06,"I get where you‚Äôre coming from but I think you are being intentionally obtuse here.

I don‚Äôt think anyone is saying that behavior was okay just that you can‚Äôt judge the morality of generally uneducated people from over 200 yrs ago by today‚Äôs standards. 

If you were a white man born in the pre-civil war south I can guarantee you would have been racist at a minimum and likely would‚Äôve participated in the business of slavery in some form. 

Does that mean all white men in the pre-civil war south were evil? Idk maybe.. but it just seems like a cop-out to not examine the way society and culture can affect the values people hold."
9ufxdu,2018-11-05,2018-11-05,"Exactly. Some even are quite racist, like Micah, and most still have prejudices towards Mexicans or black people. Realistically, I'm sure there were groups of people like the Van der Linde gang that were quite open-minded for their time tho."

How come he didn't switch over if the parties switched? (Because they didn't). The democratic party also filibustered basically every civil rights act from 1950 to the 1970s, so they didn't switch then.

The abolitionist movement was pretty much nonexistent among southern society.

To your last point... that is simply not true. In states like Mississippi and Alabama close to 50% of white families owned slaves. Further more due to the incredibly flawed culture they lived in evidence has shown that in those poorer families there was a strong desire to acquire slaves both for economic reasons and as a status symbol.

But I know T_D specifically denounces any and all racism/sexism. you'd be hard pressed to find upvoted posts reaching their front page with that type of rhetoric. 

From what I gather /pol is a small part of the site, and not a accurate representation of them as a whole. Their corroboration in the TD maybe there, but the blatant racism and sexism isn't supported on T_D. From what I've seen, 4chan hates reddit and T_D.

How about Teddy Roosevelt leaving the Republicans and forming the Progressive (Bull Moose) party because of the conservatives consolidating power in the party and putting their support behind Taft. And when he lost, those liberal Republicans decided to join the Dems rather than return to the Republicans and became what we now call the ""New Deal"" Democrats. 

By the way, the KKK was founded by Confederates. Calling them Democrats is disingenuous at best. Though it's funny you bring up the ""klanbake"" meme (that refers to the 1924 DNC, by the way, Mr. Facts), because I have a name I'd like you to look up. That name is Hiram Wesley Evans. Then come back and tell me who he was and where he was in 1924. Heres a hint. He was the head of an organization that rhymes with Flu Flux Flan, and he was hanging out at an event that rhymes with Fepublican Fational Fonvention, where he endorsed a candidate whose name rhymes with Falvin Foolidge."

oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,Shame the end kind of ruins it with how the wolf needs to go up a hill so it just *rotates*

oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"I saw a nature documentary that had a conflict between wolves and bears. The wolf pack just took down a deer and started eating it. This bear comes along and decides to take it for himself. The wolves scatter and start circling the bear as it's eating their kill. Bears are like tanks and are too dangerous to actually try to fight directly so what they do is harrass it. They keep running in an nipping at it and run off before it can get a swipe in. Eventually, the bear decided ""fuck this. It ain't worth it."" and let the wolves have their deer back. So yeah the bear is not really in danger. It's hard to take one down even with backup."

oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,I might be alone in this opinion but I have trouble playing games that have way too good graphics because I find it difficult as hell to see things in them. I usually lower them just to get better visibility.

oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,And yet i still do it so much
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,"Personally I bought both the first and this one a'd could not go through them, I stopped both games after a few hours.


Reason : gameplay and shortcuts are fucking horrible and you can't remap them like you want. You sometimes have to hold two buttons and press a third to do some simple shit that should be assigned to one button. Using a lasso or even firing a weapon on a horse is fucking horrible it's like I've been sent back two decades in terms of gameplay. The games looked great and I was hyped but I just could not work through the permanent annoyance. Why they don't let you remap every action to wtf you like is beyond me."
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,There‚Äôs literally no difference between killing a person in RDR2 vs any other shooter. Stop acting like it‚Äôs more than just a game.
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"Literally every ""game system"" within RDO is complete and utter trash. Professions are trash. Drop rarity is trash. Prices are trash. Monetization is trash.

Not even just the time in development, but the decades of experience that Rockstar has with this type of open world game. They've been building the tools to make this since the early 2000's."
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,"Ain't that the truth. Rockstar set a high bar, and I don't know who will even hit it next."
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,That's only possible if Rockstar made Skyrim. Badesta does not have the talent to pull of an open world of this calibur.
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"Well Skyrim VR is the best game to me, it‚Äôs amazing"
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"I haven't played Skyrim, but after playing Dark Souls 3 and Bloodborne, I'm hoping Elden Ring can scratch that rdr2-level open world fantasy itch for both of us."
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"The ending was too melancholy for me to just replay it like everyone else does. I beat it the year it came out and hadn't replayed story mode since. I finally decided to try it again and I am in chapter 3, but taking it really slow."
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"Same I had it for xbox and spent every minute of free time I had playing through the story and loved every minute of it, then I got a ps4 and got it for that, 2 chapters in I couldn't handle how slow paced thing where moving, 15 minute horse ride to start a mission thet involves another 15 minute horse ride and then 5 minutes to loot everyone on the battlefield"
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"Definitely, it might be the best game you will ever play"
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,100% yes!
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,YES. Hands down one of the GOATs when it comes to video games.
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,Only when it's the scripted encounters such as this one. They want to make sure you really did notice it and not just glanced by.
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,I noticed it in this clip as well and after a lot of time playing this game that‚Äôs the first time I e seen it.
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"Mastering the lasso was one of the most surprising things for me. First playthrough and I basically killed everyone who was ""in the way."" Now I only kill if I absolutely have to."
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,That's actually a really decent free starting horse btw. American Standardbred is pretty solid compared to what you can afford early.
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,Yep. They should absolutely have gone with closed lobby co-op. There would be millions of players logging on every day.

oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,I played it for the second time last month. I usually have to wait 5 years or so between replaying games but this one is just that good.
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"If you didn't play GTAV, I do have one piece of advice. Don't get too frustrated with the slow control scheme; you get used it it faily quickly and it doesn't negatively impact gameplay nearly as much as in GTAV or GTA:O.

That said, RDO is garbage. Try it if you want, but don't be surprised if you hate it."
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,"It‚Äôs scripted. But there are so many elements like this, it‚Äôs amazing."
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,It's a scripted sequence that triggers when you enter that area for the first time iirc. The path is pretty linear and it's unlikely a player would miss it. It's still really cool and the fact that people think it's just spontaneous ai interactions gives credit to how much time and effort the devs spent filling the world with hundreds of scripted moments to stumble upon in order to trick you into believing it's real.
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,It's a scripted event.
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"I once got run over by a bull elk, and then a grizzly ran up and ate me while I was down."

oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"It is scripted, but one of the strength's of RDR2's open world is the sheer number and variety of these ""random"" encounters. So many other games have like 5-10 such interactions, but RDR2 has dozens. It's very possible to play 2-3 times and still not see them all."
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,"It is more special than a cutscene because it's ""hidden"""
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,"They for sure would. Pretty sure a large pack could take down any sort of bear, but [here's a video of some wolves facing off with a polar bear](https://youtu.be/J3euEMWC8tg?t=219).  I think the key term is ""fuck with."" More commonly you'd get wolves challenging bears for food or territory, rather than either being the preferred prey of the other.

oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,You're right. Unless it was sick and injured or a cub all alone. But highly unlikely.
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,They faceoff just like you saw in the video.
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,"I thought the story was decent, but the gameplay didn't hold me. Too slow paced of a game for my liking. Thankfully, my wife loves the game and binged the hell of it back at release (and *just* started a fresh replay this afternoon), so I can enjoy the game without having to devote the energy lol"
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"Eh different strokes for different folks. You are entitled to an opinion and there's nothing wrong with sharing it.

For me, the only real weak points are all from Rockstar's stubborn insistence on retaining their garbage control and inventory systems. At least deadeye makes the gunplay 1000000x better than GTAV."
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,"That's what happened to me when I saw this (scripted) encounter. The bear sounded unnaturally close, I thought it was a glitch or something. Turns out it was another bear (pretty sure this was unscripted) a few feet away from me. I galloped like hell while looking behind me and ran into a fallen tree, flinging me off the horse."

oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-09-07,"Really late reply I know, but what was bad about the story and AI? They knocked those aspects out of the park with RDR2. Possibly the best in all of gaming."
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"I got a *super lucky* encounter of all four having perfect pelts. There were no survivors, and I went home with four perfect pelts."
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,I thought perfect pelts had mostly to do with the way you killed them. i.e. bow gives higher quality pelts over guns etc
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"According to National Geographic, the wolves should have decimated the Bear's habitat with mining and logging industries, and probably globally warm the bear's primary foodsources to useless inedible mold just to be safe."
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,Sue Aikens said she watched a pack take down and eat a bear.  She did mentioned that the bear had just come out of hibernation though.
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,Is epilogue weakest part of the game in your mind? If you only completed it 3 times.
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,Can I ask what I‚Äôm supposed to do in the beginning? I‚Äôm at the first camp (after they come out of the pass) and there are no quests or anything except finding some playing card people. I wandered through town and there was nothing to do. I feel like I‚Äôm missing something. They told me to help out the camp but there doesn‚Äôt seem to be much to do. The ‚Äúcamp improvements‚Äù are a fucking joke like add antlers to the campfire. There has to be more to do....
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"Man I wish I had that thing you have that I don‚Äôt. I just can‚Äôt get myself to replay games like these. Given how the game progresses I got like halfway through a second play through and was just like why am I doing this to myself.

It is one of if not the best games I‚Äôve ever played, yet with this and other masterpieces-I get to that kind of down, slow part and can‚Äôt make myself push further. I know what happens‚Äîand just can‚Äôt make myself slug through the parts I don‚Äôt love.

It‚Äôs the same with books, shows. Once I know how it goes, no matter how much I loved the first go through, I can‚Äôt stay with it the next time around.

I wonder why that is. We both probably enjoyed the game equally immensely the first time.

I need to find a place like a third of the way in where I can just open the game and enjoy the world and not progress the story at all. That‚Äôs what moments like these make me want to come back for."
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"A lot of us told R* we'd happily pay $30-40 for a proper expansion, especially with Sadie. I hate that we'll never get anything that won't be stupid online content. Rockstar is SO good at singleplayer and so incredibly terrible at multiplayer. If only they had given RDO a proper closed lobby co-op system - I know a ton of people who would play then.

Nobody I know (including myself) wanted to play another GTA:O style clusterfuck."
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,A true western sim game would be a lot of fun.
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"I should have done that. I don‚Äôt want to spoil anything but if you like the beginning around Valentine, you should stay there.

oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"Yeah...I have hundreds of hours in. I think I'm somewhere around chap 3. That's as far as I ever got in the storyline. I just wander around doing ""stuff."""

oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,"I know what you mean. There is nothing wrong with amazing graphics, but because there is just so much detail, your eyes kinda just get lost and you catch yourself not really sure what you're looking at.. I dunno, kinda hard to explain how to describe it. I wouldn't consider it a game breaking drawback for me, and nothing that really affects my playability.. but I get what you're saying. 

Games with blur effects are really what bother me.. It's immersive, sure, but it's also kind of annoying."

oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,"I'm playing Valheim right now and I had to kill the graphics for that reason. It's a very nice looking game, but if I'm looking for resources or enemies in a forest, I want as few distractions as possible.

oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,"That was my biggest gripe about the game.  It has lots of stuff to do from hunting to trading to raising horses, but you don't have any choice in how the main story plays out or even how you want to do the missions.

It really contrasted with Cyberpunk2077 which had pretty much nothing to do in the world aside from the quests, but at least quests/stories gave you options how to complete them"
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,That's why you should play Rockstar games ( and generally any game with shooting mechanics tbh) with Mouse and Keyboard.
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,I really just started it -- I still don't know what's going on -- but while learning the controls I shot some dude dead in the street.  Then I punched a horse.  I felt bad about both things.

oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"> It's not THAT crazy considering the time and workforce put into RDR2 vs cyberpunk.

It's not that big of a difference. RDR2 is the most expensive video game ever produced, and CP2077 is right behind it at second place. Both games had teams of 1,000+ devs, and both were notorious for abusing their workforce with years of crunch. Rockstar just has the advantage of better tools, more experience, and evidently, higher standards."
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"Honestly i'd rather Bethesda over Rockstar any day of the week, Bethesdas games are WAY more open in terms of gameplay, they allow modding without their publisher sending Lawyers to their house and the games controls a hell of alot better, sure their buggier but that's to be expected with games so large and open with choice. Take simple movement for example in Skyrim i can quickly tap W to inch foward towards a cliff and just get *right* to the edge of it where as in RDR II i tap W and Arthur takes to full beautifully animated steps off that cliff and dies. When riding on horse back in Skyrim if i take my hands off the controls the horse stops moving, just like a game should, where as in RDR II i take my hands off the controls and the game plays itself until the horse arrives at the objective, Rockstar has this bad habit of caring about realism over what's acutally better for gameplay."

oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,O ok I see. Havnt played enough rdr
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"I think one of the real accomplishments in their ""random"" encounters is just the number and variety of them. That so greatly contributes to how ""real"" the game feels. You can do 2-3 playthroughs and still be finding random encounters you've never seen before."
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,That's really interesting. I had this naive idea that bears were almost untouchable by most other animals.
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,Honestly wouldn't surprise me if they found a nature video of it and just scripted it in the same way it actually happened.
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,"Yeah the story is probably solid but it didn't grab me. I didn't crave to find out what would happen next you know? Now that you mention it: The gameplay didn't hold me either.

I would love to finish the gave some day but as long as it feels like work I don't think that day will come soon :)"
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,"What also bothered me is that I can't just go rogue for a while and perform some crazy stunts without getting a huge bounty on your head. I guess it is pretty neat if you're going to act a certain role or something..but when you want to go full on western-gta on a village.. it will cost you.
Maybe I'm wrong though.  I only played the game 20 to 30 hours or so and mainly played as a kind bandid."

oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"If you observe the animal, it will tell you the quality of the pelt. I'm pretty sure you then need to kill them the right way to keep it at that quality."
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"It's both kind of, like if you observe some random deer and it's good quality that basically maxes out the quality and depending on how you shoot it that determines your pelt. But if you observe some deer and it's perfect and you gun it down with a shotgun or something crazy the quality will go down. It depends on what you shoot them with like I think for small game you have to use a bow with small game arrow I think. For larger game I usually use a Rolling Buck rifle and aim for the head that usually preserves the perfect pelt."
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"Playing the long game, eh?"
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,"Like the other guy said it‚Äôs good, but I kind of wish I could play as Arthur, which is a big reason I‚Äôve replayed the story as much as I have. Also imo the replayability of the first part of the epilogue is kind of weak (as well as the first 2 chapters of the story, if I‚Äôm being honest). Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I still love the entire story, but the gameplay aspect specifically is what I‚Äôm referring to (I mean come on, you‚Äôre doing farm work for like 6 missions and spending time with the family for another 3 of them)."
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,"IMO it‚Äôs awesome, the only dumb part is you can‚Äôt use Arthur anymore.  They should have given you the option to choose between Arthur and John."
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"The epilogue is a beautiful conclusion to the story and necessarily sets up RDR1.

Thing is, if you did your utmost to enjoy the world as Arthur, there isn't a lot left to do in the epilogue. That's why it was actually kinda brilliant to lock off part of the map until then."

The only thing I can think of that you might be missing is the mission near black water. It‚Äôll be in a wanted dead or alive area but you can do a little sneaky deaky to get in there. I‚Äôve heard a couple people who didn‚Äôt realize this, so perhaps that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre stuck on. If that‚Äôs not the case then idk what‚Äôs wrong, perhaps it‚Äôs a bug. Also don‚Äôt worry about camp improvements too much aside from maybe the things from the ledger to keep supplies (which show in the top right of the screen at camp) stocked."
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"Did you have the quest to collect debts for mr. Strauss?

To finish this quest, you have to go to the logbook ($ sign in camp) and pay the debts to the camp stash. It will show up as its own option.

I somehow missed this and didn't have any new quests, because this one wasn't finished."
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"Yeh I understand what you‚Äôre feeling, and it seems to me like people tend to just be either one way or the other (like me, willing to slog through the slower parts to get to the good stuff or like you, not willing to do so). When I was doing the trophy where you need to get 70 gold medals on story missions, I realized using the replay story missions is a pretty good way to go through story of you want to skip the slow parts (also you don‚Äôt have to ride to each objective between every mission)."
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"I thought I was the only one thinking like that. The online mode is not what I want. I want free play like in the epilogue but with some more stuff to do. (Or an expansion with Sadie as you mentioned, but I feel like that‚Äôs too much to ask for from R*)"

I‚Äôm sorry you and everyone else downvoting me are incapable of differentiating from real life and games."
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,"Does the 8 years of development include only software development or also story writing, design, concepts? If that is all of the things included I suppose writing code is at most half of that time. And they probably made a lot of development tools and game engine parts that can be reused for GTA6, like world simulation and mocap."
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"I only think it's trash because Rockstar learned *NOTHING* about what was wrong with GTA:O. They just carried over every stupid mistake.

Also, R* needs to completely ditch their control system, inventory system, and movement system. They need to start from actual scratch in their next title. The weapon wheel sucks, is unresponsive and slow, cluttered, and frankly not that usable even with a controller.

It's amazing to me that they made this top 10 game of all time, and yet they carried over broken systems from a previous game."
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,">Both games had teams of 1,000+ devs

That's just not true. Cyberpunk had around 500 devs, RDR2 had around 1600 developers across all of Rockstars studios. That's more than **THREE TIMES** as many people developing it. RDR2 uses the Rockstar Advanced Game Engine that they have been developing since around 2000 to make games EXACTLY like RDR2. It's also a frontier game and there's almost nothing easier in a game engine than creating landscapes with trees and plants on them. Cyberpunk takes place almost entirely in a futuristic city and is going to have its own major problems because of that. You'd be better off comparing the witcher (a frontier style game) to rdr2. Especially if you're going to ignore the decades of expertise built into the RAGE engine in areas like AI, scripted events etc. Do I wish Rockstar had made Cyberpunk? Obviously. It didn't stop me from enjoying the game though, and I wouldn't have wanted to wait another 5 years for them to keep developing the tools to put it out at the same standard as a rockstar title.

Every game 'abuses' its workforce with crunch. Especially if you're doing something insane like either of these two studios. If they didn't Cyberpunk still wouldn't be out. It's a thing you deal with as an artist on literally anything with a deadline because you're putting everything you can into it before it goes live. Same with commercials, TV shows, Movies, games, etc. I don't know a single creative field that doesn't have crunch, it comes with the territory. And before you @ me I've been a 3D artist working in studios for 12 years. Crunch is a persistent thing for artists. I even had it in college when working on projects."
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,Oh yeah absolutely over the top haha. I will say that Bloodborne has one of the most immersive atmospheres of any game I've ever played - but also the most frustrating. Both that and DS3 are from the same publisher that's making Elden Ring. Check it out if you're able!
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"Same. I would pay $5/mo to play co-op private server RDO. I don't even like the game systems that much, but the free-for-all multiplayer is what ruins the experience."
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,I'm trying to cover for any spoilers you might have let out in case someone hasn't played the game
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,[Here are some of the more obvious ones (30 mins)](https://youtu.be/QUZl1tseOF8)
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,Two deers fighting to the death with their horns is one.
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,"That isn't naive. They are almost untouchable by most other animals. The only real exception are wolves because they are also apex predators, can hunt in packs and happen to live in the same place. Only other danger is probably other bears."
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"i will add to this real quick, every type of animal has a specific type of weapon that gets a clean kill. Aiming for the heart is most efficient, as the animal will drop cold almost instantly. If you shoot it in the head there's a good chance it runs a few paces, and that can make the difference.

The best way (imo) to hunt deer for pelts is lasso, then walk up and slit throat. Deer cannot run into tragedy and ruin pelt."
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,How would Arthur make any sense in the epilogue?
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"I'd have liked an option to select Arthur after having completed the Epilogue (I.E. American Venom completion required), but I can also understand why they didn't from an atmospheric/narrative point of view. Playing as John is great and melancholic, considering what A: Happened with Arthur and B: What happens with John in RDR1"

oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"There are no spots on the map. No markings of any kind except for the photos of those random famous gunslingers. I did some shootout mission which took a while, robbing some Irish guys at a cabin or something. Then it was back to nothing to do. It‚Äôs the weirdest."
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,Huh. I think I did do that. I'm pretty sure I turned it in?
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"R* was great at expansions until GTAV. The online model killed expansions and the shark card model killed online play. RDO isn't nearly as shitty and grindy as GTA:O, but it's just as buggy and filled with trolls and cheaters. The public lobby system sucks donkey balls.

The only thing they improved was eliminating the need to load single player just to load into multiplayer."
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"I don‚Äôt remember that scene, would you remind me what happened?"
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,Yea for competitive sports. I‚Äôve never heard someone say the graphics are too strong for them lol.

oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"I think your complaint would be more valid if rdr2 was meant to be an rpg and missed the mark. R* never set out to create a world in which the character is meant to alter the world through choice, they wanted to tell their story through an interactive medium. And I'd argue against lack of meaningful impact on the world anyways since multiple places are drastically altered or deserted after the Vander-Linde gang rolls through. Cyberpunk is a good example of where your type of criticism would make more sense, as there is a large number of broken or outright missing features that were promised or advertised. Rdr2 on the other hand didn't advertise itself as something it's not, regardless of whether or not its a good game. And judging by other comments I doubt most people go into a R* game expecting something akin to Fallout New Vegas, they expect to be told a story in a realistically designed world that they can also fuck around in. And that's exactly what R* delivers every time, even if other parts of the game are shit."
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,Nah I wasn't arguing that you had to care but just showing an argument as to why people would i mean people feel bad for movie and TV show characters deaths how is that any different to a game?
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-05,I see. The only instance I know of is siberian tigers preying on bears.

oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"I'm not judging anyone here, it's just how it is, graphics evolved exponentionally up to a point, from where most of the further improvements are environment details, and this is why the original comment makes sense - there is so much detail that our brain can process, it takes away attention from actual gameplay, which is fine if someone wanna get lost in immerse worlds, but others may prefer to play for story/progression, and lower settings make that easier. There is no wrong or right here, just preferences, I merely suggested that people who only played high quality visuals are downvoting, because they don't understand this."
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"Both what? That's exactly what I said, that a game is supposed to be more, than visuals. Sometimes I like to get lost in details and immerse worlds, but sometimes I just want to progress through an interesting story, which is easier if I'm not distracted by countless fancy features. I didn't mean to insult anyone (unlike you), just stated a fact, that people who grew up on fancy games probably don't understand why lower settings make sense for others - which is the only explanation I can come up with for the downvotes on the original comment."
oea4j2,2021-07-05,2021-07-06,"Problem is, the game is giving you an illusion of choice, where there is none. It‚Äôs like the game constantly gives you options to approach obstacles, but if you don‚Äôt do exactly like the writers wanted ‚Äì you get a *mission failed* prompt.

If, as you say, many people confuse it for a RPG-game when it shouldn‚Äôt be played as one ‚Äì the. It‚Äôs obviously a design flaw. 

It‚Äôs like half of the studio worked on an open world rpg and the other half a linear story-driven game, then tried to merge the two together just before launch."

It's supposed to be used to push unrelated content out of the conversation. That's why comments with high downvotes are hidden.

Do people get bent out of shape when the main character can wear outfits from other games in Resident evil when you beat it? I'm guessing not. Same thing here - we played the game, we know the story. Now give me postgame+ where I can play as Arthur.

That's just not true. It absolutely does. The problem is that people have just trained themselves to hit the downvote button on just about everything they mildly disagree with.

No, my comment is giving you a fact. It has nothing to do with agree or disagree. It's point blank telling you.

> You complain about ""fragile"" Redditors but the emotion in your comments kind of lumps you into that fragile group

lolol Everyone always thinks I'm so emotional, because I capitalize for effect and use ""fuck"" a lot. I'm not emotional at all. Also, if I was in some way emotional, telling someone ""Hey, this is actually not the case"" in any way is not even remotely close to ""My God someone disagrees and we need to hurry up and hide away the scary comment!""

> Opinion certainly isn't bad but per what you provided if the opinion doesn't contribute to the conversation then it gets downvoted.

You see, that's the problem. You're misunderstanding the ""doesn't contribute to the conversation"" portion. That's how everyone validates their wrongful downvotes. The original purpose is something like this: 

A man posts a picture of his cat eating food, and someone comments, ""I make $75/hr working from home"" or ""Cats are dumb."" It's basically to move spam and troll/worthless comments down. But it's still stupid. The entire idea of a downvote system is stupid, and reddit's is even worse. If a comment isn't worthy of contributing to conversation, it should either a) be reported (if it falls under the reportable guidelines) or b) ignore. The other comments with upvotes will naturally mean the one without will fall to the bottom. But, no. That's not how reddit works. It even goes so far as to hide the comment. Thus, the echo chamber is fortified.

When I said that's not what the downvote button is for, it actually did spark a response, so... how could you say it doesn't contribute to the conversation when it did, in fact, contribute to the conversation?"

f8by9f,2020-02-23,2020-02-23,"Agreed. It's my only complaint about what is nearly a perfect game.

Micah was too clearly a fuckstick from jump street. He overtly betrays them like three times and no one seems to put two and two together.

Any one of them (including Dutch) should have cut Micah loose or killed him ages ago."

f8by9f,2020-02-23,2020-02-24,"Micah reminded me of Trevor, he's crazy in it for himself primarly and has no true moral compass. Though unlike Trevor who has loyalty to Michael and Franklin. Micah in the end doesn't have that loyalty, he is a shark looking for a meal.

I played Red Dead Redemption, these games have a lot of characters who just aren't good people yet you can still work with them. Micah may have been an ass but I in the beginning at least understood his views and figured he wasn't the worst of the gang. Hell my Arthur not even two minutes before going in to strawberry found a man dying by wolf bite and executed him without a second thought because I wasn't sure I had medicine to spare.

It wasn't until we got to St Denis that I went from tolerating Micah to disliking him especially cause Seans death made me a little bitter."

f8by9f,2020-02-23,2020-02-23,Agreed I could spend hours robbing boats and it never gets repetitive because as you level up you can rob bigger boats and take more loot and I could spend the same amount of time exploring and doing side missions. It really was a masterpiece of a game by Ubisoft. Thats why I would absolutely love to see Rockstar put their own little spin on the genre  because we are lacking good pirate games and if anyone can make a masterpiece Rockstar is the company.

I hope someday they add a Rancher role where you can buy your own land and raise crops and livestock."

d53ybc,2019-09-16,2019-09-17,"I can't seem to stay connected on my ps4 but of only dced once on my xbox one.

 The new roles make earning money and gold bars really easy. The outlaws pass is cool because if you complete it, you get all your gold back. Playing as a trader can be really fun at times especially with a group.

I'm less of a fan with how they sped up a bunch other stuff. Makes it feel a lot more like a normal GTA and less visceral which is what I love about the singleplayer.

Edit: And i played it the last 5 days without seeing a griefer while playing in defensive mode which is really surprising. I'd definitely say its improved a lot and I can't wait to see what comes next."
d53ybc,2019-09-16,2019-09-17,"It's still just ok if we're being honest.

I'm right there with you though, I've captured the same murderer like 10 times already, even though I brought him back dead a handful of times.

The outlaw pass can smd though."

There are literally hundreds of thousands of animations in SP mode, and the story itself was fucking incredible. At some point you have to decide to be happy with what you got. 

Also, you can earn gold online at a fairly decent rate just by playing the game, nobody forces you to buy bars. Online is what keeps people coming back to the game far past the point of them being burnt out on SP mode, and is what keeps generating revenue in between major title releases."

I bought the premium version of the pass as well as the collector role, and I still had gold left over (around 45 or so) and I never spent a dime on the MTX, nor do I play a lot. 

RDO virtually floods you with all the gold you can want and you don't really need to do much either."

I honestly don't think Rockstar deserves money from their fan base, and I'm waiting for the surprise MT's or Shark Card clone system.

Rockstar has been gauging their fanbase with the same title for years on end now, with some of the poorest outsourced customer support service in the industry. I would rather give my money to EA in the extreme circumstance that I had to choose between the two of them. 

Everyone buying and pre-ordering from Rockstar is just going to encourage their disgusting behavior, they will be selling RDR2 for full price for the next five years I guarantee it, then they'll lazily update RDR textures and recharge you full brand new price for that as well, oh and the editions, there will be editions.

9hggug,2018-09-20,2018-09-21,I was wondering what feature they were adding that was so much more important than a PC release.
9hggug,2018-09-20,2018-09-21,"Rockstar, the only company in the world who does not give a shit about the rating (I love you). They know that the rating wont stop kids from getting the game, rather the opposite. The parents don't give a fuck about the rating either, they just want their kid to shut up and play with their friends. Rockstar bring everything to the table. If you are a 8 year old kid and cant even make your own balls shrink or expand, you will still get their games."
9hggug,2018-09-20,2018-09-21,"the real question is, if you take the horse near a mare in heat, does it get all excited?"
9hggug,2018-09-20,2018-09-21,Since it‚Äôs not coming out on PC it‚Äôs a relief that I won‚Äôt have to miss out on the mod for that at least

Hell sometimes you swap them out because one of them has had enough of the hot lights and the camera crew.    Getting enough horses that look similar enough to pass for each other is hard enough.  Limiting the entire cast to just mares is harder still.  I'm sure that was the case in the early days of film,  but now  it's much easier to just rotoscope it out.  "

Also they're not terribly aggressive in real life, they've only killed about 34-38 people since 1970, so that's not even one person a year. They WILL turn on you with their mouth open as a threat though, but probably would not lunge unless you continued to poke them. They are shy and flighty.

9s8yab,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"some extra facts about gators

their tail is responsible for the burst speed. basically like a giant spring or lever that pushes them forward. if you ever have to run away from one, run in wide zig zags because they won't be able to keep up that way. 

alligators aren't agressive by nature, but if on land they are *very* territorial. The key sign to look out is a giant ""slide"" on river banks where they pull up to sun themselves and is a general entry/exit into the water. they also prefer to ""burrow"" a bit for nesting so any giant holes or pits nearby, or fallen logs/trees usually means it could be a den for alligators. when threatened they will hiss and ""growl"" to signal that they aren't afraid to attack if you don't heed that warning. Baby alligators also ""[bark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFfciCu8wY8)"" to signal for their mother, so if you can hear that when out in the wild (and no hiss from the mother) you're probably way closer to a den than you should be and you should probably get out of there before she comes back.

Alligators are ambush predators, they rely on stealth in the water to strike at animals coming to drink/feed, they are also super silent when swimming to allow them to sneak up on any fish and strike before they know what's happening. Alligators in captivity have also been known to lure birds into their open mouths to strike when they're hungry. Contrary to belief if you're in the water and believe that gators are nearby, make as much of a commotion, as safely, as possible. most alligators will want no part of that (since it's too much work) and will avoid you. 

If caught by an alligator in the water, it will do what's called a ""death roll"". Basically once it has it's jaws locked it will barrel roll in the water to sever bones and tendons, especially if the prey is too large to swallow hole or in giant chunks. IF you're ever in that situation try to roll with the alligator otherwise you could easily lose and arm/leg. Their power comes from the strength of the ""snap"". the muscles holding alligator jaws closed or open are very weak (which is why most alligators captured can be neutralized with a quick wrap of duct tape to the snout), so surviving the roll with your limbs in tact gives you a much better chance of keeping that limb. On land they will shake kinda like the OP's gif which is much harder to overcome.

The only ""real"" weak spot on an aligator is a small intent around the base of the skull. about the size of a US 50c piece. It's the only place where the hide is soft enough and where there isn't a thick mass of muscle/fat/bone covering vital organs. The underbelly is soft enough for a sharp knife to penetrate, but unless you manage to strike a major organ you aren't going to do much of stopping an alligator that way. 

On average, the length of an alligator's snout from nose to eyes) in inches is approximately the length of the body, from snout to tail (in feet). So the longer the snout, the bigger the alligator, and the less chance you have of taking it on toe to toe. Very useful if you can only see the head and not much else"

Put your hands on its snout, elbows on its eyes, and press down with your torso to keep its mouth shut. Then use your legs to lock down either side of the tail. You have to get the tail secure because half the gator's length is its tail, and the tail is all muscle, and they can flip themselves over and over with a simple flick of that tail. Most people don't think about the tail when dealing with them.

Edit: modern cartridges have much better powder. Modern pistols and rifles are all matched to a twist ratio and are properly tested for terminal ballistics.

Commenter below has literally been shot with a .22 and it didn‚Äôt even break the skin. This is not a hatred for .22 thread. I‚Äôve fired weapons of the era and studied them along with the kits they used to load and reload ammo. The sad fact is that weapons of that era were only marginally better than a recurve bow and hunters were often times better off with the bow than with a revolver that might misfire or not be accurate 60% of the time. I‚Äôd stick to my guns on this issue and take a bow for hunting a gator over a six shooter. Maybe I‚Äôd change my mind if he‚Äôs also got a double barrel 12-gauge or a Henry repeating rifle. "

9s8yab,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"> The only ""real"" weak spot on an aligator is a small intent around the base of the skull. about the size of a US 50c piece. It's the only place where the hide is soft enough and where there isn't a thick mass of muscle/fat/bone covering vital organs. The underbelly is soft enough for a sharp knife to penetrate, but unless you manage to strike a major organ you aren't going to do much of stopping an alligator that way. 

What about the eyes? In these kinda facts about sharks, they often say to hit them in the eyes. I guess that should probably work here as well?"
9s8yab,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"It's also important to note that, unlike a crocodile, it is possible for an athletic adult human to hold an alligator's mouth shut with their bare hands, as the muscles for opening the jaws are much weaker than those used for closing them."

I know further south, Florida and Louisana, tour guides feed marshmallows to alligators to impress tourists and get a better tip, and this is a terrible thing to do. They're overriding a wild animal's instinct to be shy and replacing it with a conditioning that when people come, it's marshmallow time. The result are alligators who are not afraid of humans, and are in fact expectant instead, and this is not a good thing. Overexcited reptiles tend to bite first (thinking there's food) and realize their mistake after, this is true of snakes, lizards, and turtles too."

9s8yab,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"Sir, it looks like OP experienced a problem exists between brain and controller event (PEBBAC event), colloquially known as being a complete and utter dumbass. 

**Point 1:** OP was chasing an alligator. The terrain was bayou-like (Cfa in the Koppen Climate Classification), with negligible to mild inclines in elevation. Given the average humidity for a Cfa environment, pursuit could have been kept up for some time, at least until OP ran out of stamina. The alligator appeared to be moving at a fast trot, likely fleeing after OP launched some sort of arrow projectile in its direction.

* Point 1A: OP's arrow appeared either to miss or to hit the alligator in a non-vital location, allowing the animal to flee on foot with minimal indications of injury. Although it is purely speculative, there is a non-zero possibility that OP was trying to insert the arrow into the animal's rectum from a safe distance, which while in this analysis judgment must be reserved on the act itself, would constitute the most intelligent course of action OP undertook in the reported incident.

* Point 1B: Somewhat less intelligent, in the opinion of this report, was the decision to pursue the alligator in the first place versus that comparatively less dangerous turtle he passed early on.

* Point 1C: Although given everything covered in Points 2-5, it is possible that an encounter with the turtle would have been similarly lethal.

* Point 1D: Upon further consideration, OP must be commended for not inserting his penis into the turtle's mouth. [Seriously.](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1946972/moment-man-narrowly-escapes-having-his-penis-bitten-off-by-snap-happy-turtle-in-china/)

**Point 2:** The reported on incident shows OP chasing the alligator with his bow and arrow still drawn. While OP must be given credit for the foresight to go into the encounter with a weapon drawn, it must be questioned why the presumably perfectly functional rifle in evidence was not used instead of the bow and arrow. The rifle's superior range, accuracy, and damage potential should have been taken into account, particularly as OP was chasing an annoyed animal, prolonging the encounter and increasing the odds  of a less than favorable outcome.

* Point 2A: It's entirely possible that OP had no ammunition for the rifle.

* Point 2B: It's entirely possible that OP simply forgot it was there, for reasons that will be expanded upon in Point 3.

**Point 3:** It is the considered opinion of this report that things began to go wrong when OP actually caught up to the alligator. In this instance, one cannot help but recall the old adage about the dog who caught the car. OP catches up to the alligator, and temporarily surprised by his success, stands there and stares at it as it comes around to defend itself. 

* Point 3A: This is, in the opinion of this report, where the PEBBAC event began. The importance of that split second between dumbfounded shock and the events covered in Point 4 cannot be overstated.

**Point 4:** As pat an explanation as it would be to say that OP did everything wrong at this point in the incident, it is the opinion of this report that OP did in fact do nothing wrong. Indeed, it is a recorded fact that OP did nothing at all as the alligator closed in.

* Point 4A: Despite the fact that OP did nothing wrong in the eyes of this report, it would be incorrect to liken OP to Hitler. OP is literally not Hitler.

**Point 5:** Toward the end of the incident, OP appears to attempt a novel form of diplomacy. He seems to try and enter the alligator's mouth. While brave, and invaluable for its lessons learned, it must be noted here that OP's attempt to climb inside the alligator's gaping maw had one significant flaw in its execution. The alligator's mouth is, in fact, lined with dozens of pointy objects. As OP entered the alligator's mouth, dozens of these teeth appear to have penetrated OP's body, precipitating a rapid hit point depletion event (RHPD event). 

* Point 5A: Adult alligator mouths contain between 74 and 80 teeth. While it is not the place of this report to make policy suggestions, it would be a dereliction of duty not to point out that so great a number of teeth should be avoided if possible.

* Point 5B: Immediately subsequent to the RHPD event, OP was most likely kicked back to a loading screen and respawned at the last check point, possibly with a mug of cocoa, and a blanket.

**Conclusion:** This whole incident could have been avoided had OP not been such an OP. In future, it should be noted that further PEBBAC events will, most likely, precipitate more RHPD events. This would be, to put it mildly, an undesirable outcome. In is, in the final analysis, perhaps advisable for OP to borrow a page from the Dark Souls playbook and ""git gud"".

American Alligators don't go past Texas, and if I remember their northern range is North Carolina."

9s8yab,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,If you encounter a salt water croc in Australia your beast options is death
9s8yab,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"That's because there isn't much you can do against a full-grown saltie. Unlike alligators, crocs can open their jaws with similar force to how they close them, meaning that you need around a ton of force to hold their mouth shut. "
9s8yab,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"Wait.

No I'm kidding. Most people when they wrestle they don't do it alone, and they have something in their pocket to wrap around its snout, like tape or rope. Once the mouth is secure they can tie up the legs and stuff, but that tail will still let the animal flop around like mad.

If you have a knife, stab into the small depression between skull and neck, that's where people aim with a gun when they actually want to kill one. You're not going to be able to choke it to death, and even using a rock to bash its brains in is unlikely because it's brain is the size of a walnut and encased in armored bone. You could try to jab the eyes out and leap off the back (away from the head) and run, but, honestly, why would you want to do any of these things to alligators? They're shy and gentle unless you're furry and on all fours.

Crocs though, I dunno, but all the Aussies seem to recommend shoving a finger into the cloaca, and, well, I'm sure they have a good reason for it. It's a different world down there."

I know they were just caught off guard and didn't know how to react at first, but if you're gonna get that close to a gator, or any predator, you should anticipate its attack. 

That being said, the inertia has caused me to bump into people with my horse and suddenly have a gang of lawmen after me. It can be annoying in really cramped areas, but out in the open, it's easy to work with. "
9s8yab,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,You've got me by the balls there
9s8yab,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,Read the compendium in game . Bow takes like 3 shots.  1 Rifle shot to the head will get you a perfect gator skin.
9s8yab,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"A modern .22, certainly. An actual gun from the 1870s with 1870s-1890s ammo? Not nearly so certain. Ammo of the time was wildly different in quality and would be considered low-grade hand-built ammo. You‚Äôd definitely need a revolver or a repeating rifle for multiple shots to ensure you killed one. Ammo quality was definitely a factor and random speeds or burns from inconsistent powder could be the death of you. I‚Äôve fired everything up to a .50 cal musket with ball and patch, and I‚Äôd never want to rely on one of those against a gator. An arrow would have far more terminal ballistics going in and the broader head would help ensure a clean and humane kill on a smaller brain or spine. You can say that it works 40-60% of the time, but I would hate those odds when trying to chase down something that big. "
9s8yab,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"That depends on the gun it's shot out of. I've been hit by a 22 myself before that didn't even manage to make a hole in my shirt, still hurt like a mother fucker though...

EDIT:  Since people seem to not understand how guns work. A bullet gets it's power from the expansion of gas behind it in the barrel pushing it forward, and the rifling of the barrel giving it spin so that it doesn't tumble and loose energy. If you fire a 22 bullet out of a smooth barrel, that is nearly double the diameter of the bullet not only is it propelled by far less energy, as any gas that leaks around it is not transferring it's energy to the bullet, but it is also tumbling like mad and losing even more energy and accuracy that way as well. For example if you put a bullet in a vice, and you set it off with a nail and a hammer, the bullet won't move more than a couple of feet if at all. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6M0qbMbkIw

So yeah when my idiot partner decided it would be funny to shoot me from about 20 feet away it was with a super shitty musket style gun with an ill fitted smooth barrel, and ended up leaving me with a bruise about on par with getting hit by a low quality pellet gun from 50 yards away."

9s8yab,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"Ah, I see. Makes sense, thank you for the info"
9s8yab,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"Arrows have much more total weight coming in. ~700 grains in a modern broadhead versus a 40-grain .22. It‚Äôs not just the broadhead tip that‚Äôs hitting you, it‚Äôs also the whole rest of the shaft that‚Äôs propelling that forward and increasing the wound channel. A .22 also isn‚Äôt powerful enough or fast enough to generate hydrostatic shock, so the momentum and size of the projectile are the key factors. Literally the size of the round versus the arrowhead is what counts in this era. 1‚Äù arrowhead at 700-800 grains versus a .22 at 40 grains. Again, the whole discussion I put in the other comment concerns quality of ammo at the time and how realistically unreliable it was. The British army upgraded from .38 to .45 after they fought armies in Africa that would wear double layer leather armor to stop arrows from penetrating further than the head. The .38 would not penetrate the first layer of leather and led to the .45 being standard."
9s8yab,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,Absolutely wrong.
9s8yab,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"That's just not true.... 

Today's guns? Sure. 

But old guns don't have that much piercing power and arrows are heavy, sharp motherfuckers that can pierce most armor. "

9s8yab,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"Certainly, but you‚Äôre not going to realistically have more than 20-30 rounds per expedition since they‚Äôre heavier. The key is that the powder for those was a little more consistent and would be more reliable the higher up the caliber scale you go. I‚Äôd take a larger rifle since the powder is almost guaranteed to get the power you need to hit one at 20 yards. "
9s8yab,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"I tried looking for some links to quickly nail down the big points, but there‚Äôs not much out there. I know archery from being a Boy Scout, musket and ammo deficiencies from Philmont (Boy Scout adventure camp, hiking the Rockies, greatest trip ever) and a few other times learning historical weapons, advanced terminal ballistics from being a Marine weapons coach and tactical trainer. The specific details I had to look up, but I had distinctly recalled that muskets were no match for arrows until the invention of rifling, and then the industrial revolution made ammunition manufacture a steady and reliable thing. Prior to those happening, the Native Americans were rightfully secure in their thinking that they could always outshoot any white man with a bow and a war horse. "
9s8yab,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"I know for a fact there are some small lakes and ponds near Lubbock with active alligator populations, so they have certainly made it a ways."
9s8yab,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"as loose as I can, I‚Äôve found most of what you play through to be Lousiana Purchase territory. I can‚Äôt quite figure out what city black water is supposed to be‚ÄîFort Worth? But all that new country that we play in at the beginning of RDR2 is like the area west of the Mississippi and east of Rockies. 

Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Oklahoma are all evident. 

The scale of the game isn‚Äôt big enough to pull of E. Colorado or the flat bits of Kansas and Nebraska (most of it). You can never appreciate the hugeness of the flatness when the mountains or the next state really never leave the backdrop. Heartlands tries to get there, but in the interest of interesting terrain you never get lost in the flatness.

New Austin is pretty clearly W. Texas over to somewhere short of Los Angeles.

To me, that means there is potential for another RD in another decade. Back it up to just before or right after civil war. Focus on California, Oregon, Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Washington. Instead of dying west tropes and critiqueing the expansion of government, make it about unadulterated capitalism and greed as a contrast to the beauty of nature yet similar to nature‚Äôs brutality. 

What I really want tho, is a prohibition game by R*, set in fictional Chicago mid 1920s. Could serve to tie GTA and RDR together (although I‚Äôve seen San Francisco referenced in RDR2‚Äìyou‚Äôd hope it woulda been San Fierro). "

Legendary animals are even easier you can just load them full of bullets without worry of pelt quality.

Paul- you and your group are going to work on the plants and trees 

Keith- your group is going to focus on all things human

Mary- your group is going to focus on the animals, we are really excited about this, we have 75 different breeds of horses, we know you minored in equine studies at Dartmouth, this is our most important area, this is Grand Theft Auto but with horses and cowboys.

I'll see you back here in 2 days with your assembled groups and their sub assignments

later that day, Mary ""Hey Jeremy,  we are going to need 150 unique sets of horse balls for these animals, here's a book on the anatomy of horse genitalia, and the number of a local horse farm so you can get your hands on the real thing (lol) well, you know what I mean.

737uso,2017-09-29,2017-09-29,"Help me out here: The initial dangling thing you see swings off to the right hand side, and for a brief second, you see another dangling thing cut in from behind the left side. Exactly when the initial dangling thing swung to the right.

If the first dangling thing was the foot, then what's the tiny flash of a second dangling thing swinging from the other direction?"
737uso,2017-09-29,2017-09-29,"You CAN actually see the left front leg, which I think some people are confusing for the balls. If you think it's a leg, look slightly up and left when the tail swishes out of the way and see if you're not looking in the wrong spot."

This is because the stimulationüí°üíÜ requirementsüìú for getting their cocksüêìüçÜ out of their sheathsüó°Ô∏èüëõ is vastlyüåä less than actual ejaculationüçÜüí¶üí¶. In all of those videosüìº, those peopleüë™ are just‚öñÔ∏è playingü§°‚öΩ with flaccidü•Ä horseüê¥ dicküçÜ more or less.

In orderüì¶ to use those in most casesüíº though, the horseüê¥ has to be willingüëåüôã to ""mount""üóª the deviceüî¨, and beginüé¨ the buckingü¶åüí∏ and humpingüê´üê™ on their own. This is usually achievedüíØ‚úîÔ∏è by spreading‚ö±Ô∏è estrusü§∞üçë pheromonesüåπüëÉüíû around‚Ü©Ô∏è, gaining the horse'süêé attentionüõéÔ∏è‚ö†Ô∏è, and having them mountüóª a sawhorseüößüêé or fenceüöß or something where the positioningüìç makesüé® them believe‚ò∏Ô∏è‚ú°Ô∏è‚ò™Ô∏è‚úùÔ∏è that they are actually on topüé©üé™ of a Mareüê¥ü§∞. Then at that point‚òùÔ∏èüìå they are attemptingüôã to shoveüëê their, very erectüóºüè¢, cocksüêìüçÜ into a Mare'süê¥ü§∞ vaginaüåÆüçë, but there is noüôÖ Mareüê¥ü§∞ presentüéÅ. If the personüë® with the artificialü§ñ vaginaüåÆüçë isn't‚ùå fastüí® enough to get it around‚Ü©Ô∏è the horse'süê¥ cocküêìüçÜ, after aboutü§∑ 15-30 seconds‚è±Ô∏è of attemptedüôã mountingüóª the horseüê¥ will tryüôã to giveüéÅ up‚¨ÜÔ∏è and reevaluateü§î‚ÅâÔ∏è the situationüíπ.

9i327z,2018-09-22,2018-09-23,I have the MGS Collection on PS3 which comes with every game released up to MGS4. Cost me $25.
9i327z,2018-09-22,2018-09-23,"Do it! You can get a pre-owned copy of the HD collection on either PS3 or 360 fairly cheap - it doesn't include MGS1 though. To be honest, the PSX version feels very dated these days, so if you have a Gamecube I'd probably recommend the Twin Snakes remake of MGS1.

MGS4 really was the pinnacle of gaming for me - I don't think I've ever been so emotionally involved in a story, and after playing the MGS games solid for 10 years, it was the perfect ending to the saga. I haven't played V yet, although I have a copy of Ground Zeroes lying around - I'll until I get a PS4 and play the 'Definitive' edition."

Within what seemed minutes I had a pile of bodies, horses and wagons lol. I shoulda just ran when the timing was right but I kept thinking ""well I could loot the body and take their horse and stuff"". The best strategy is to drop the bodies in a flowing river or stream.

9sckr4,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"As far as I‚Äôve understood, yes, otherwise the law will be on the lookout for a killer. I barely started the game though. I believe this particular scene is from close to the beginning of the game where the blurb about hiding bodies was stated (for me at least).

*edit to add - I think this applies more near towns when you have to smoke someone and not way out in the sticks because I certainly haven‚Äôt hidden all bodies in the game."
9sckr4,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"Depends.

If their is a body on the ground and people see you near it. Some freak out and run away, some don‚Äôt care, and other times they‚Äôll assume you killed them (which is usually true) and go tell the cops. So it‚Äôs best to hide bodies or move them elsewhere to search them if you killed them near a road or something. "
9sckr4,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,not really. as long as you don't hang around you're fine in most cases. extra time spent hiding bodies is just more time for a stranger to appear and try to snitch. then i gotta hide more bodies.
9sckr4,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,Or kill/threaten all witnesses.
9sckr4,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"If you are in the same general area as the body for awhile, yes, If you get out of there quick, not really."

9sckr4,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,Yea if you kill a guy in a town you gotta move him. Kill a guy on the road and assuming there no witnesses then you cool.

9sckr4,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"Yeah, the game is a lot of fumbling around and tripping on bodies/animals. Only because the people walk into them though. Once you get used to the rules of the world, you‚Äôll find yourself making mistakes less often. It really is an incredible role playing game."

I've got an outfit saved which is just one of the templates that I don't like/wouldn't otherwise wear with a mask added, and change into it before committing any planned crime. Works pretty well so far."

Personally I'm confused by how I keep getting attacked by bounty hunters when no one has seen my face and sometimes they attack me during the segment where Dutch doesn't want you pulling out guns in a certain town, so I can't even defend myself."
9sckr4,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,Yeah this is just headed into the first town. I got jumped and figured that bodies on the way to town with new strangers around might make some people concerned. I guess it's no longer my problem to worry about.

9sckr4,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"Nah. I think that would necessitate 'auto-loot' as the looting system throughout, in order to maintain parody with the rest of the game. Which would in turn kill the entire 'realism' quality the game is clearly shooting for. Also, I think the skinning animations are timed pretty well, and with the larger kills you can see that it segments the sequence a bit to speed it up. I think Rockstar nailed it.

&#x200B;

9sckr4,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,Or like literally every other crafting action and just hold to do it faster.

9sckr4,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,It takes like 5 seconds. Is that long 
9sckr4,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"They did that on purpose. So you can't just farm animals to make a ton of cash. Because then you would quickly got rid of any bounty.

Just like you can carry only one body or large skin."
9sckr4,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,I think if you hold the skinning button (triangle for PS4) it does autoskin. I've done that and it's just a quick autoloot instead of animation.
9sckr4,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"Also I lose more skins than I sell due to only being able to carry one, and it gets knocked off if you bump something."

Even in situations of self defense, I have learned that I will not be given the benefit of the doubt.

That mission when you are first introduced to hunting.  On the way back to camp you see a bear and decide to find a different route.

9sckr4,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"RDR2 definitly takes some getting used to... they could have done a bit better with the controls... I feel that The Division did the same sort of thing, but better... (in RDR2's defense, there's not a lot of cliffs in t√∑)"
9sckr4,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"I think the controls are mostly fine. My main problem is that Spider-Man hinges a lot of pulling the right trigger to swing all the time, and here I'm just accidentally firing my gun and inciting violence when I do that."

Anyway, despite my being an assole, I agree with you."
9sckr4,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,Everything in the game takes much too long.  Auto loot should absolutely be an option.  It‚Äôs a video game I don‚Äôt need to spend 5 second animations looking everyone.  What a waste of time.

9sckr4,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"I've never been ""investigated"" for killing any O'Driscoll's or other bandits.  Any other person who you accidentally provoke and then wind up having to kill is a different story though.   Standing too close to them on the road?  They shoot you, you kill them, and now you're wanted for murder.  Some guy in the streets starts a fistfight with you?  You fight back, and are wanted for assault.  Kind of a pain in the ass."
9sckr4,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,This lesson cost me 90 dollars at Valentine to learn. Self defense kill on some O'Driscoll dudes who thought it was a good idea to ambush me. Two random strangers on horses come down the trail on different sides well after the smoke had cleared and took off in different directions. I even tried to defuse the situation but they weren't listening. 
9sckr4,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,The bodies disappeared one time and I was searching their horse that didn‚Äôt despawn and a witness accused me of animal cruelty. 
9sckr4,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"I had it one time where I had killed someone with no one else nearby, I walked a little bit away. Someone discovered the body and I think it was saying they were investigating but there was an 'unknown suspect'. I came back by to test out if they would leave me alone because they didn't know who did it... but then I just became wanted. I didn't even get that close and it was pretty instant; no ""back away from this crime scene, mister"", just WANTED.

That was pretty disappointing.

It's also disappointing that if you kill a lone person in the middle of nowhere you're in the clear, but the moment you loot them you get minus reputation even though no one saw it. You can loot rival gangs' bodies, and I think bounty hunters, without losing rep, though. But if it's a citizen/""stranger"", it doesn't even matter if they are the one who started it; it seems looting them is always negative rep.

I don't know if you can always get away with killing rival gang members in town or not. But I once killed a Lemoyne Raider near Saint Denis that was calling me out with some passerbys just feet away who didn't even bat an eye.

Thought I swore another time in Valentine an O'Driscoll was calling me out so I killed him and became wanted; not positive though."

""Not much farther."" she says but we're stuck in an intersection waiting for a coach to turn. 

Then this guy pushes into us. ""Why you standing so close to me?"" my horse is wedged between the coach and this a*hole. ""I  **said** why you so close to me!?"" The coach moves and I start walking forward. The guy strings a few swears together then I hear his gun click. This prick decides to shoot me in the back. Through the woman. Now 3 other men take out the a*hole, but I'm left looking down at this dead mom in the mud. I decide she deserves better than to be in the mud so I pick her up and place her on a near by porch.

On my horse ready to head out. Accidentally hit R2 out of habit because in every other game on a vehicle that‚Äôs the gas pedal. I forgot that in this game it‚Äôs the ‚Äúdraw your pistol regardless of whatever your currently selected weapon is, including fists, lock on to something with a heartbeat, and fire‚Äù button. 

I shot the paperboy dead - the one standing just next to the gun store. ‚ÄúOh shit‚Äù, I say, and take off as the town erupts into gunfire. I t-bone a horse drawn carriage at full speed, fly off my horse and into the carriage seat, possibly killing one of the drivers, stumble off to get back on my horse, who‚Äôs just now getting off the ground, and amazingly run out of town. I either kept the bounty low enough that I just paid it, or I restored. I don‚Äôt remember which. 

I was pissed though. And I keep my finger off that stupid analog R2 button, which is the dumbest fire button I could think of. And doesn‚Äôt care what weapon you select. So many times I‚Äôm out hunting and had put away my bow while on horseback - because I guess he gets tired of carrying it - and when I use R2 to aim I draw my pistol and disintegrate a rabbit.

The environments in RDR2 don't feel like they were made by a team that knew anything about how the cover mechanics were going to work (even though they're basically the same as the previous game as far as I can recall). Also the cover system in RDR2 is among the worst in recent memory.

And somehow I‚Äôm the bad guy here???"
9sckr4,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,That happened to me last night. Three guys together started harassing me and even tore me off my horse. I domed them and then half the city was after me.
9sckr4,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"They will investigate you if you loot their dead bodies after offing them. Ive learned that its not worth the 50 cents, 6 rounds of revolver ammo and a gold pocket watch."
9sckr4,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"Yeah I had the same thing happened. Dudes shot at me in town, I kill them and suddenly have a huge bounty on my head. Kind of pisses me off that the game doesn't distinguish between murdering criminals and civilians when the previous game did."

Me and my 2 cousins were going around sharing the controller, though, and one of them always racks up a big bounty so everyone hates us now.

I was trying to do a Gambler challenge that I had to beat an opponent at 5 Finger Fillet and every time I came in sight of the fillet table, if someone was there, they got up and ran from me.

...so to gain rep I tried greeting everybody around town over and over.... well, turns out some people don't like being greeted and a man pulled a gun on me for greeting him; so I killed him in self-defense and lost even more rep.

What a game."
9sckr4,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"I agree that it‚Äôs disappointing you become wanted even if there is no suspect. I imagine it probably has something to do with the fact that you are likely covered in blood. The only way to test that theory that I can think of would be to switch horse-stored outfits; doing so at camp cleans you up, so maybe on horse it does as well?

I did read somewhere that altering your appearance frequently (i.e changing outfits, and shaving/changing styles) helps avoid being recognized in some vague way. Don‚Äôt know the details, but it seems to me that understanding this better could help. "

9sckr4,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,As a pretty hardcore PC gamer I gotta say: You should not have all these downvotes. There's really no reason to not buy a cheap used console for a game as amazing as this.

I left the region with a $400 bounty and havn't been back yet."

9sckr4,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"I think it adds to the game and its pretty on purpose.  Now instead of shooting first and asking questions later you have to think about how to approach violent situations.  Bounty running too high?  Looks like you are gonna either have to run for the hills when ambushed or you gotta try to lead them into an ambush of your own.  I like it cuz its honestly the first time in a videogame ive ever felt compelled to run away from trouble.  And its kinda like real life, where sometimes you have to think about what it looks like rather than what it is.  "

9sckr4,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"With all the details in this game that wouldn't surprise me.

Another way to get rid of blood is walk through water, but having your horse nearby is more likely.

Picture it: it's 10:30 pm. I have a head cold, but have been taking in cold&flu meds to keep me upright so I can play this game. My husband has set our tent up outside to make sure it's ready for a trip in a few weeks. He decided to ""camp"" with my toddler. They're both asleep outside.

 I rounded the corner only to be t-boned by a wagon! Horse goes balls up and guys gets flung into the street. Dead. I am alone, partly distraught, partly enraged, and hopped up on cold meds.


I shut the game off and went to bed. "

Guy starts punching me I whip out my knife. No. Wait. Why is that out? *selects hands* ok. I'ma punch him. (knife is out). Ugh. *selects fists* ***annnd I stabbed him through the chin***


Then there was that time I watched a guy rob, murder, and loot a stage coach couple. A stranger passed on horseback and just watches the bandit leave. ""Oh. What aren't you gonna report **HIM** to the law?? It's just me?""

Idk if it's the head cold, but this game really stresses me out."

9sckr4,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,Doesn't quite make sense since they start the shit talking and then I escalated it. THEN they pull the trigger if you don't walk away. 
9sckr4,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"The issue I have with it is that the marshalls do not give a fuck until YOU pull out your gun, which feels like an oversight.

For $5 you *at the very least* get the entire map that you can free roam, probably the best open world I have seen to date. If it were just a free roam sim with nothing to do it would be worth the $5, but there are a ton of fun things to do. At $5 it's probably the best money I have spent for what I got on a game. You get the whole map, lots of activities, a horse, a gun. Etc. Buy it, for real.

kn4gxo,2020-12-30,2020-12-31,"I always heard of it being taboo.  Maybe someone more educated can add context.  


I found this. http://www.native-languages.org/legends-eagle.htm
Because eagles are considered such a powerful medicine animal, the hunting or killing of eagles was restricted by many taboos. Eating eagle meat was forbidden in many tribes; in some legends, a person who eats eagle meat is transformed into a monster. In some Plains Indian tribes, feathers were required to be plucked from a live eagle so as to avoid killing them (to accomplish this, eagles were trapped in a net and released.) In Southeastern tribes, only men with special eagle medicine, known as Eagle-Killers were permitted to kill eagles. In the Cherokee tribe, even Eagle-Killers were only permitted to kill eagles during wintertime."

Now if we are talking about Latte's - a reasonable sized Latte is still under 5$ unless we are talking a Starbucks gargantuan sized monstrosity that is guaranteed to go to at least luke warm before you finish it. But then you are talking a Cafe Latte not a Coffee.

Unless of course we are talking about having someone make you a poor over of a really nice coffee in which case those can certainly be over 5$.

Plus you can be a bounty hunter now which is good fun.

It's very much the cowboy simulator it set out to be, and with a huge variety of shit to do I don't think it's exactly fair to call it dumb and boring, just because you personally can't motivate yourself to do any of the vast amount of shit to do."

I have two different friends who have been on them (one after his realtor suggested they apply due to some really interesting ‚Äúcircumstances‚Äù... ie their previous house was literally buried by lava).

The realtor in their episode was actually their realtor, and the house they chose was their real house (and the two they didn‚Äôt were two of the ones they had looked at that weren‚Äôt sold yet) - just that they had already bought it 3 months prior to filming (so the interior was temporarily ‚Äúrestaged‚Äù to look more like it was before they moved in).  They weren‚Äôt given scripts, but were given potential talking points, and there were several takes of much of it that were edited later.  And of course the ‚Äúcheck in after a few months‚Äù was shot the day after the ‚Äúhouse hunting‚Äù part.

It‚Äôs a pretty low budget affair - 2 days of filming and then another day a few weeks later on for some external shots and reshoots if needed.

Honestly the most interesting part of it was hearing about the random conversations my friend had with various crew and producers about OTHER reality shows they had worked on.  House hunter shows are nothing compare to some of the insanity that goes on in the ‚Äúreality‚Äù genre..."

Luckily they got fully reimbursed since they actually had lava insurance (fun fact: he still owns the property... it‚Äôs assessed at $0 but maybe in a few thousand years he can build something on it....)

Anyway - he decided to try a different ocean the second time so bought a place in St Thomas.  And of course 6 months after he closed it got nailed by a hurricane... (survived this time!)

Yeah everything but outlaw shit which is the stuff I want to do. And I fear when they eventually wise up and do the ""outlaw"" it will all be dumb mission based garbage.

>Like he said, robbing things is fun when you plan it out and it‚Äôs unexpected. Someone giving me the blueprint to a robbery that only works out if everything goes exactly as planned?

What games aren't like that? That's the nature of games. What you want is to be able to walk into a shop/train, rob it, and leave. How is that fun, emergent gameplay? You could do that in GTA and it was fun but not something you spent a lot of time doing.

RDO is basically RDR2, but online. There's very little missing from it now, other than a main character and story of course.

Seriously, I'm struggling to think of anything significant thing that was in SP, but not MP."
kn4gxo,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"Walk into shop, rob it, leave.

That's not exactly the huge, revolutionary gameplay mechanic that's absence in online has literally ruined your experience.

It wouldn't translate well into online because it would be fun once, then the next time you want to buy something but can't because the shops been robbed by anonymous cowboy #6 for the 100th time that day, it stops being fun and becomes annoying and completely immersion breaking. It would work in singleplayer where you are the centre of the story and universe, but not in online. It's the same reason why big events are mission based on not free roam, you would just end up with players sitting in a massive queue to be allowed to rob the bank, MMO style.

And there's a ton of outlaw related stuff to do. You can take over a town if you like. You can roam the map hunting down other outlaws, be it in the wilderness or at their heavily defended hideouts. You can hunt bounties, you can murder and rob NPCs, you can hijack a train and ride it around the map shooting everyone in sight. There's also a ton of general, non-outlaw cowboy stuff to do. The game covers every base, it's tone-deaf to complain because your preferred playstyle hasn't been given special treatment over the others."
kn4gxo,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,They want to be able to grief other players by robbing
kn4gxo,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"It's fun because of how the world deals with your actions. Or how the other players might try to stop you or rob you themselves. How would it not be fun dude? You need to try a sandbox game.

""RDO is basically RDR2, but online. There's very little missing from it now, other than a main character and story of course.""

Blatant lie. I can't fucking be a outlaw! The main thing the game is built around. I don't get how this is hard to understand."
kn4gxo,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"Whenever I tried to murder and Rob people it gave me nothing, now tbf this was at launch. I want to rob a train not steal it. It works perfectly fine in gta like I said. It's fun to rob something and go on the run from the police figures. 

Why can't you just let me not like the game for my reasons? Why is my legitimate critism not valid. All I want are the single player mechanics in multiplayer. Why is this so much to ask?"
kn4gxo,2020-12-30,2020-12-31,Yes
kn4gxo,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"Oh okay, so we have what, 3 scenarios that can play out?

You walk into a shop, rob it, and leave.

The law attacks you, or other players attack you. Real exciting stuff.

You're also not considering it from a balance perspective, either they make it pay out small amounts, and nobody is interested, or they make it pay decently, but then it becomes popular and you have to queue for an hour to wait for your allotted time slot to rob the bank, MMO style. Real immersive shit right there.

From another comment I left:

> And there's a ton of outlaw related stuff to do. You can take over a town if you like.

So other than ""uhhh i wanna rob things"", can you name anything else missing from online that is present in singleplayer?"
kn4gxo,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"There is also private games where that wouldn't be a issue at all. And those 3 scenarios sound like a lot of fun. I want to rob shit with my friends why is this hard to understand for you. It's a fucking cowboy game that's what they did (in pop culture). Outlaw should have been the very first job released.

Don't tell me what I can and can't like. The game should be a sim not what it is. Fuck can you even play cards yet?!"
kn4gxo,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"If you have to go into a private lobby for the game to function as intended, the game is broken. That's the same argument as ""oh just go into a private lobby if you don't like being spawnkilled by a 12 year old on a flying motorcycle"" (GTA). 

What's hard for me to understand is what exactly you mean by ""i want to rob shit with friends and be an outlaw"". Because ..... you can do exactly that. Just not trains or shops in free roam. There's a vast amount of other outlaw related stuff to do, and like you admitted, you haven't even played since release.

And yes, you can play cards.

I've only just realised you're replying to me on two separate threads, lol. Why not just reply to one instead. I've basically written the same comment twice because you keep going off tangent in different threads."
kn4gxo,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"No I said I havent tried robbing and murdering someone since release. I said in like my second comment that I went back recently to see if it got any better and it didnt. In fact the game seemed to try and prevent me from shooting people in town, most likely a bug but idk. Free roam stuff is the stuff I want. I've said this like 6 times. I don't consider the stuff you brought up as outlaw activities to be outlaw activities. 

Can you play cards with other players? On the map not some seperate mode?

Haha sorry dude I saw you reply to the other guy and I couldn't resist.

And I do go I to private lobbies to avoid spawn killers and shit. Why wouldn't you?"
kn4gxo,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"You don't consider robbing and terrorising people as outlaw activities?

Dude the entire focus since release has been on adding more stuff to free roam, there's a huge amount of shit to do now, loads of random events and encounters. You don't have to leave the lobby to do anything anymore, except for very specific things that only work in instanced lobbies.

And yes, you can walk into a saloon, sit down and play poker with other players, as long as online gambling is legal in your country due to microtransactions. 

&#x200B;

> And I do go I to private lobbies to avoid spawn killers and shit. Why wouldn't you? 

I'm not saying that you shouldn't, obviously nobody wants to deal with that shit. I'm saying that if you have to play in an empty lobby, to enjoy a multiplayer game, then that game is broken. Hence why ""just go in a solo lobby"" isn't a good counter argument to the idea that free roam heists would just lead to queues and immersion breaking BS."
kn4gxo,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,"As long as online gambling is legal in your country due to microtransactions. You defend this?
Haha this is sad. Gambling online is illegal in my state as far as I know this is probably the issue.

I'm not talking going solo i want to play with my friends who all bought the game expecting the same thing I did. If I was going to play solo I'd play the far superior single player. Even if it's just for fun and you get like a feather or something because money doesn't exist if I remember right, I still want to be able to rob the banks, the stagecoaches, the trains, the store, the tavern, all the places you can enter and rob in single player. It's in gta online and works fine. I expected them to improve the concept from that game. I didnt think using gta online as a base of expectation for red dead online was that out of the question. Same company same model

The biggest issue was them doing microtransactions which ruined free roam. That's why you can't rob anything because gold is worth ""real  money""

And yes robbing people and murdering them is outlaw activity I more meant the other shit like killing hideouts and riding a train around. Who cares? That shit is boring.

We went into to town to get supplies and I haven't seen her again. Does she play a major role or is everyone excited about her because she is a girl?"

9xms12,2018-11-16,2018-11-16,"If I can give some advice, eyes/eyebrows don't display determination, and the head is tilted downward which all around gives a non confident vibe. 

Adler is nothing but confident by the time she looks like that in the game.

I'd argue you went for [this shot](https://www.nag.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/red-dead-redemption-2-sadie-adler.png). What could improve the confident look IMO would be a straight neck and head, slightly frowning sight, hat a bit more down to cover more the forehead. And shooting with a slightly lower height, the camera should be aligned with the mouth to neck, not with the forehead.

My two cents if you're looking for improvement.

Props and make up on point though."

9xms12,2018-11-16,2018-11-16,Only thing that royally pissed me off which I am sure was intended was how everyone talked shit to you about not doing shit. Meanwhile I single handedly paid for the entire camps upgrades.

9xms12,2018-11-16,2018-11-16,It's just you. She is easily my favorite character besides Arthur and John. She does have a big mouth but that only makes her more cool/badass. 
9xms12,2018-11-16,2018-11-17,"Yeah she annoys me too. Especially her raspy voice. She‚Äôs also way too bloodthirsty to the point where she‚Äôs just irresponsible, she got that hot air balloon guy killed ffs. "

Like I was doing something in camp and then fished until the next morning and Ms. Grimshaw waddles over and says ""What happened to you Arthur? You used to be a man of action. Now it seems like you hardly ever leave the camp."" I made a mental note to kill her if ever given the opportunity."
9xms12,2018-11-16,2018-11-17,"Its because you may not have noticed, but there were chores to do around the camp. They wanted you to carry shit as well as being the sole earner, heh. "

9xms12,2018-11-16,2018-11-16," she's this vulnerable woman then turns into  badass gunfighter overnight...I dunno, seems mary-sueish, that and she fucks up a few missions which gets people killed."
9xms12,2018-11-16,2018-11-16,"Last lil bit. Know that at the end of the day we have our DNA and ""default settings"" that are really hard to temper with. But notice how more badass looking are slightly squinted eyes, with the lower eyelid reaching the iris. It's all in the details. Look at the shadow on half of her sight that create this feeling of intrigue, and seem to change her worried look into a determined one.

Anyway, IMO you're genuinely already in the top tier in terms of fidelity and efforts. I'm done, keep having fun cosplaying!"

9xms12,2018-11-16,2018-11-17,I shot the guy because I was mad I lost (I stuck at aiming with a controller)... and ever since I've met him again on 3-4 different occasions. My save must have been fucked up or something.
9xms12,2018-11-16,2018-11-17,I shot one or two bottles and the guy said something like ‚ÄúWhat the hell is wrong with you?‚Äù And ran away. WTF?
9xms12,2018-11-16,2018-11-16,"That's pretty funny, tbh. Your version of her just couldn't handle life on her own afterall."
9xms12,2018-11-16,2018-11-16,You came back and it said she had died of starvation or how do you know?
9xms12,2018-11-16,2018-11-17,"Yeah, I was super creeped out by him. Says he‚Äôs gonna go back to her or something. Then he caught A random hatchet to the face. Very bizarre weather phenomenon "
9xms12,2018-11-16,2018-11-17,They're not. 
9xms12,2018-11-16,2018-11-20,i think its part of the realism aspect they were going for. i would try to explain more but spoilers
9xms12,2018-11-16,2018-11-16,"Her transformation?
You mean complaining for two chapters about helping Pearson then in 2 minutes she's the bestest rider, bestest gunslinger, bestest leader, bestest planner, bestest bounty hunter, invincible bullet proof, greatest at everything ever in all the land.

Boring... lazy... unimaginative... zero depth."
9xms12,2018-11-16,2018-11-16,"It's not hard to hate almost all of them. Most make rash decisions based on emotion to fuck up terribly and get people in the gang killed. 

 "
9xms12,2018-11-16,2018-11-17,Don't knock till you try it bro. Prostate massage. Look it up. 
9xms12,2018-11-16,2018-11-16,"When I went back she was just lying dead in her cabin, so I assumed she died of starvation, because the point of the mission was to teach her how to hunt. "
9xms12,2018-11-16,2018-11-20,the famous gunslinger missions can't be played after you have finished the main story. there are a few other side missions like this as well. 
9xms12,2018-11-16,2018-11-20,Missed missions show up from time to time after the story missions are completed. But they aren't all the same I think. From what I've seen.
9xms12,2018-11-16,2018-11-16,"All after being a widow and damsel in distress. Its a video game and not a movie the story is about Arthur then John, its long enough as it is to try and cram in everything Sadie had to do. A good example of her not being invincible but badass is the mission where she tells Arthur to snipe and she goes on a rampage. "
9xms12,2018-11-16,2018-11-17,You truly are fucked up in the head. It takes 2 seconds to see your comment history to realise you have mental issues. 
9xms12,2018-11-16,2018-11-17,"I'm glad I save her, but I love that story can play out differently if you mess up. 

The first time I encounter the guy that escape from prison and still has his chacles, so he asks for help but I missed the shot to cut him free so he got scared and run away. Next time I saw him, he mentioned something about he hoped I didn't mess up this time."
9xms12,2018-11-16,2018-11-20,Only the ones that are directly related to arthur
9xms12,2018-11-16,2018-11-21,"there's two side missions that im trying to do now that are so far apart on the map that by the time that i ride all the way to one, the icon has dissappeared(2nd icon, not ""?""). ive tried more than once for each so im not sure if those only appear at certain times  or if you have to wait until later in the game to access them. "
9xms12,2018-11-16,2018-11-17,"Damn. Okay, you had to go there. "
9xms12,2018-11-16,2018-11-20,that would mean some missions aren't available after you finish the story then right?
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Looks a little like Walt longmire
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"In a pre-rendered cut scene, yeah."

8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"It looks great for sure, but I am not blown away by this level of facial detail anymore (yeh im spoiled) as it's becoming the norm for big AAA games. That's a result of playing games like Uncharted 4 (this could almost be from UC4), Horizon Zero Dawn, God of War, Battlefield 1, SWBF2(EA), Star Citizen and other modern AAA titles. They all seem to function somewhere in the same level when we're talking facial graphics, in my opinion ofcourse. The similarities between them could be the limit of our tech and techniques at the moment, or simply because they are using the same techniques to achieve it.

8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"Not actual in-game footage though is it.

I don't really care if the graphics are only a tad better than GTA5 as long as it's as good a game and has an equal life cycle."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Walt Longmire?
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,This game is literally West World

8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Looks like Sheriff Longmire 
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"I'm not falling for this ""This game finally looks realistic!"" bullshit until the game actually comes out. "

8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,It looks great. Very realistic yet I don't see any uncanny valley problems
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,This realistic cutscene graphic was new with battlefield 4... Now its a standart artstyle
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,That's a lot of polygons.
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"idk, we've had high fidelity textures for a while, I'll be impressed if the animation is at the same level"
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Hope it releases sooner on PC. this console exclusive bullshit is really getting fucking annoying.

8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,I SWEAR TO GOD THIS GAME BETTER COME OUT ON PC
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"It really didn't look that good in the trailer, just slightly improved tech from GTA5. Horizon Zero Dawn looked about 10x better."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,but isnt this just the GTA V engine?

8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,I really wonder if some day we'll have game graphics that will look truly identical to the real world so we won't be able to tell if it's real or not.
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,I hope the Brawny Man makes an appearance in this game!

8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Except they didn't animate the faces just moved the mouths and eyes so its still some uncanny valley bullshit.

8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"Yeah I hope it‚Äôs similar in the actual game. 

This will be the first R* game made for PS4 or Xbox One this generation. And it‚Äôs so late in the generations too, so hopefully it‚Äôs amazing looking on the Pro and X1X. "
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"The actual real time face-model in-game looks quite low-poly, compared to recent games. Go back to the second trailer, or focus on the zoom in in some characters faces (including a a certain scarred one) 

Quite low-poly. "

8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Looks like any other x1/PS4 game
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"When is it out?
"
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,I would be more impressed if it had no cut scenes.
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,The imperfections make him perfect.
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,"You realize that Rockstar has begun to neglect single player campaigns? For GTA v there were no DLCs or major updates, instead they focused on online content. In addition, they increased prices and decreased payouts for jobs and missions. Rockstar makes both good single player and multiplayer content, but it‚Äôs what they prioritize first that will determine if it‚Äôs going to be good or not "
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,Why does it still look just a little bit wrong?? I can‚Äôt tell why I can identify this is a render rather than a photo??
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,Please tell this is coming to pc... 
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,"Bear in mind, almost every game released looks nicer in the trailer. There's gonna be some downgrading."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,He looks like George Straight. 
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,But the online caracter faces will probably look like rubber with facepaint beards.
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,Is no one else seeing Bryan Cranston?
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,This dude has exclusively posted in r/readdeadredemption. Seems fishy...
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,"I mean, it's looks pretty much like Gears of War, which is a good thing."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,Like LA Noire on steroids.
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,I cannot wait to play the story mode. Rockstar Games know how to tell a story.  I'm quite interested that they chose to do a prequel. The story mode is the biggest selling point for me and the online version is just an added bonus.
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,Darude \- Sandstorm

8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,Does anyone else think that he looks a bit like Michael in GTAV?
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,"While the level of detail is good, the lip syncing is not so good."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,Arnold Schwarzenegger ??
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,In the trailer the characters still looked like dead eyed mannequins. In my opinion Rockstar is really behind with even semi-realistic facial animations.
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-07,Unlucky the game only comes out on consoles. With good graphics 30 fps is to be expected
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-07,Loved the first game but the past three trailers for this one have done nothing for me. 
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"Are you serious?

This is pre rendered and even for that its nor really good by todays standards"
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,That guy looks like Crocodile Dundee!!!
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"Let's just hope it stays that way, and that it's not the usual upgrade for trailer purposes only. "
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,I'll believe it when the game is out.
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Good to know my graphics card wont be able to run it
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Hope they bring it to PC in 2019 or 2020.
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,This looks pretty standard. 
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"Yes yes very pretty face, much wow. 
My question is what will the frame rate be? If it‚Äôs 60, I‚Äôm picking this game up at midnight. If not, guess I‚Äôll be waiting a few years for PC.
I don‚Äôt care about how pretty a game is, I just like when my games run at a proper frame rate that doesn‚Äôt feel terrible. "

8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"Wow, a face from a game in the 2017-2018 era. This doesn‚Äôt impress me. We have seen graphics like this before. We need gameplay then we can circle jerk over this game. Currently, I‚Äôm excited but I have seen nothing yet except cutscenes."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Psh. Wake me when they grow some balls and make Bully 2.
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"Prerendered, but hats of for making a face that could actualy exist in real world, not some half humanoid mutant as always."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,[And just last year we had this.](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lPu2a8fyuZg/maxresdefault.jpg)
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Console exclusives are ruining the gaming industry
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Didn't we get this like 3 years ago? 
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Is that before or after a shitton of microtransactions?
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"It‚Äôs pre-rendered, how is this upvoted 3K times?"
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,[deleted]
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"Pre rendered, but still quite epic."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"Oh cool, you've played the game and seen it yourself? You wouldn't just be basing this opinion off a pre-release video, would you?"
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"I guess it looks good for a prerendered cutscene that doesn't represent the look of the game, that'll likely be downgraded between when it's shown off and when it's released."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Can't wait for the online micro transactions :)
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"Jesus Christ, don't link to cutscenes stills"
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Can't fucking wait for this game and no one can tell me otherwise. If I could just find that jabroni who made that mean Rockstar post ahead of the trailer...
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,the framerate on this game is going to be ugly
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,But how will it look on a regular PS4?
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Inb4 the RDR2 circlejerk
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Rockstar took There sweet ass time on this game
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Rockstars finest
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Any information on a pc version?
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Well guess who now needs to get a PS4 Pro... and a 4K tv... 
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Let's hope the game is as good as the pre-renders look. 
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,This is nothing special
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"Meh 










/s"
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,It‚Äôs gotta look out of this world. How else do you bring casuals in to sell lootboxes other then them graphics
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Fake af
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"disappointed by the skin textures, theyre just nowhere near as good as god of war. but i guess rdr will have way more content so it makes sense"
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"That last trailer that came out looked about as graphically good as GTAV does, which came out 5 years ago. "
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"God of war 4 looks incredible too, go play that "
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Good luck getting 20FPS on a Xbone.
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,[deleted]
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,I came here for this. Thank you! Agreed.

8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Longmire was one of the agents in the Matrix...
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Aren‚Äôt Rockstar cutscenes in-game?
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"It's a fucking trailer y'all. Don't shit your pants yet, wait for the game"
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Watch Digital Foundry's analysis of the third trailer. There is gameplay used in the trailer.
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"I highly doubt this is pre-rendered. R* never use pre-rendered cutscenes. All their cutscenes are in-engine. 

I can imagine this quality from the RAGE engine. They probably cheated a little and this is actually running from a PC or something with slightly higher definition but I bet the final game isn't too far off on console. "
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"IGN said that the recent trailer was in game cutscene footage running on a base level PS4, at least that's what rockstar told them."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,I don't think it's a pre-rendered cutscene. But it does cost $3.98 to unlock the upgraded NPC 'Joe Fandango' face.
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,[removed]
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Rockstar cutscenes are in-game
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,It's totally possible to render this realtime nowadays.
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"Exactly. I'm a 3d artist and I have some friends who do character modeling. Given enough time, you can create some incredible faces, but they aren't game ready. This is the work of a talented artist, but nothing new."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,There is no need to say ‚Äúpre‚Äù. ‚ÄúRendered cutscene‚Äù is sufficient. 
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,It's not pre-rendered. It's running live in the engine..
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"In a pre-rendered cutscene this realistic characters facial complexity of Red Dead Redemption 2 is truly something else? That makes little sense . I honestly thought we were passed the point of throwing pre-rendered around to instantly try and make something moot. 

I am not a fanboy of this game and don't care for it at the moment. But still, it's obvious it isn't pre-rendered and is in-engine. I'd wager it is sharper than the X1 and base PS4 versions will be but I am certain it will look like that on the Pro X1X. It's pretty but go play any big modern AAA title with a narrative focus and you'll see facial graphics like that running in realtime cutscenes"
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"According to IGN, this game doesn't use pre-rendered cutscreens.  Everything happens in engine."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Let's all upvote the lazy inaccuracy!
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"I was impressed until I saw this, thought it was a bit too much for current consoles without either dropping to sub-par 25FPS or without checkerboarding fake 4K.

Lol at downvotes, consoles can't handle these visuals at solid framerates on high (fake) resolutions, don't kid yourselves."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,cut scene as good as 2015's battlefront in real time 
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,That is an in\-game cutscene. Confirmed by IGN.
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,And what about his Big Iron?
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,And does he have horse testicle physics
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,"Maybe but I don't think this dude rides ""merrily along."" At. All. "
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"Whenever I hear ""in 2020"" I always think that it's really far away in the future. Like people say it to make fun of something such as ""I cant wait until Half Life 3 launches in 2020..."" Not sure what to think of it being so close now."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"I'd love for this to happen, but it's just not going to.  "
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,">Just imagine how it will look on PC in 2020 when its released

Probably about half as good as it could because it still has to work on consoles that are not good enough."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Just imagine how many shark cards you have to buy to actually see the cutscenes. 
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"2020? More like 20never   
"
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Why?
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-27,And with graphic enhancement mods.
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Nowhere near that good
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,eleventy twelve
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,They're called shark doubloons now.
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"The original RDR had long and hard grinds for unlocks, - of characters, weapons, horses - so unlocks featured heavily in game, had major gameplay advantages (bar characters really) and were tough. Paid DLC was also heavily utilised, including some imba weapons. It could be frustrating BUT if someone had a weapon much higher level than yours, you could kill them and pick it up AND KEEP IT. I got the Hi-Power and Buffalo Rifle really early on because of this and thus it never felt too unfair going around free roam.

Prediction:  it‚Äôs going to be fucking inescapable and impossible to get around in RDR2. You‚Äôll be trotting around with your Bay horse and a Schofield revolver while Little Timmy gallops past you on a fully upgraded and Well Fed With Premium Speed Feed(tm) Horse of the Apocalypse while wielding some Battlefield 1 heavy machine gun with desert camo and extended magazine."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,I believe the new currency should be Armadillo Dollars
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"Yep.

Remember kids, RDR2 will be infested with even more insidious microtransaction bullshit than GTAV. 

No reason at all to even get your tiniest of hopes up."

8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Fate pulled my shart card last night at dinner. Luckily the place had a nice bathroom with soft paper towels to wet a little and use as a fresh tp
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Why did this get downvoted? Every Rockstar game is exactly what he described. 
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"The only thing I am worried about in this game are the seemingly horrible ground textures...[they almost look last gen](https://imgur.com/a/EXlNI8r). 

That and [the physics which don't seem to be the same awesome RDR ragdoll physics](https://media.giphy.com/media/jnUJaUX6tHt6T6xPef/giphy.gif)

"
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"The facial expressions always seem kind of robotic, but that's true for most games."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Ever sense crysis I havent been too impressed with facial detail.
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,Horizon has plastic faces and some of the worst animation in AAA titles
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,"I honestly am more interested in good, expressive facial animation than realistic faces for screenshots. That's been pretty rare.

I saw some good instances in an indie game, A Story About My Uncle, but it's rarely so good as that."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Analysis - what elicited that response?
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Have you ever seen anything so full of splendor?
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Nah. Still images are not an issue. It‚Äôll be when it talks.
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"I definitely get a slight sense of uncanny valley from RDR2 and Battlefield 1 faces. But [God of War](https://i.imgur.com/zpPmYjq.jpg) faces look so realistic they seemed to just skip over uncanny valley entirely, I think it's the skin texture it's so well done."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,I can't stop seeing Mike Rowe.
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"I can‚Äôt think of a single Rockstar game since GTA 3 that used pre rendered cut scenes. 

Everything is in the same engine, the gameplay and cut scenes.  This is in game footage. "
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"It is in game footage but toned up for trailers, but yeah it's not gonna look this close at release. It will still look great though. "
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Equal life cycle is pretty hard to achieve when we're talking about gta5.
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"Genuinely curious - why would you want a game with a life cycle that long? That pretty much means they are going to focus on milking it for every possible penny, instead of creating new quality content."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Doesn‚Äôt look like anything to me
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,If video game NPCs have souls I am one of history's greatest monsters. 
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"No, it is LITERALLY Red Dead Redemption 2."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"No, Jorah's way sexier. "
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,I was thinking Tommy Lee Jones-ish.
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"The circlejer- uh, I mean... Rockstar bad?"
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"I'm more concerned if their success with GTAO will bleed into RDR and ruin the title.  
Anything we see or hear is going to be cherry picked to spark hype and pre-orders. What I really want to know is if the games built as a successful sequel with quality or if a fan favourite title is being used as a Trojan for a dlc-microtransactions galore as the next 'Gta'."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,">No matter how good it looks, the top comments will still always be about how it's not in-game or how it'll only look this good on PC. 

Wouldn't need to be said so much if people didn't constantly say how good something looked when it wont actually look that good when its out. Reminding people that it won't look as good on release just makes people remember."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"If Dennis Quaid had a child with Walt Longmire, then yes."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"Yeah , that is nice in single player. But all the multiplayers are full of hackers and you have to play all the games on lowest graphic setting coz thats how you gain the advantage. No tnx, i stick to consols"
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"Well, it isn't animated."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,On Rockstar games?
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,DAE Crysis had A-MAAAAZING graphics years go?
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"Don‚Äôt know what the hate is for. However, I don‚Äôt think we should ride on a company‚Äôs dick until we see the product. Nonetheless, they have never let me down in the single player realm."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"> Of course...but I've never had any reason to feel swindled by a Rockstar game. They are not EA, people seem to forget that here.

Give it time. There's a 'camp building' aspect to this game from what I read, just waiting for the microtransactions now.

They can make more money by milking it with micros, anyone who thinks they wont (especially after seeing GTAV Online) is just fooling themselves.

I'm hoping that I end up being wrong, but I doubt I will be."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,"I agree.  Microtransactions suck, but GTAV's singleplayer was way more than worth the $60.  If the nickel and diming doesn't reach the singleplayer, then I'm completely ok ignoring the pay system like I did with GTAV.  Does it suck that a lot of content is basically blocked behind a paywall?  Yeah.  Is the base GTAO fun enough without paying for it?  Yeah, but better with a couple of friends.  But I've never felt short changed by a Rockstar game."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,I hope there‚Äôs a fuckton so Reddit can collectively cream it‚Äôs pants about how they ‚Äúcalled it‚Äù and finally shut the fuck up about it.
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Those faces clearly aren't as good...
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"Yes, Rockstar pays for random people to upload screenshots to Reddit because they're really going through hard times after the failed release of GTA V."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"Paid account. Look at his post history.

EDIT: I could be wrong. Maybe I'm just paranoid."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05," it's 100% possible to have completely realistic graphics currently. The trick is getting the lighting right, but you can't have 100% realistic in a game as it will probably blow up the game system"
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Well textures can be pictures - the difference between a picture of a real location in a game and a ‚Äúnative‚Äù photo - is that the game is made from a puzzle of pictures and the native just one.
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Happy cake day my dude
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,"They have to, right? It only makes sense for it to. "
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,"lol you never """"""have"""""" to buy them this game will be amazing its a singleplayer game. if your buying it for online your buying it for the wrong reason."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-09,Ye olde shark deed
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,Uncanny valley
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,"Who cares, this is the first rockstar game in 5 years and the first on the current generation of hardware, it‚Äôs gonna be unreal!"
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,"No worries, it won‚Äôt be on computers any time soon."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,They have a big spinner at rockstar. A lot of their titles like max payne gta and red dead and every year they spin it to start developing a new sequel. Bully is a very small segment of this spinner.
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,How?
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,The Xbox One X will probably be the best console to play this on. 
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,IGN said many of the trailer scenes were in game footage.
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Surely you mean Ferg.
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"Technically, yeah. Its not uncommon though to switch regular player models for more detailed versions during cutscenes. Sometimes you'll also get a lighting quality boost and stuff since the console/pc/toaster only needs to load the objects currently in that cutscene as opposed to loading many more objects that may be needed around the player as they move around the world."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"They are, but this is probably pre-rendered for the trailer. In game it won't look as good since it has to be rendered real-time. Not to knock consoles, but I don't think they have the power to render something in such detail. Maybe if it was on a really, really high end PC... We'll probably see in two or three years when R* decides to port the damn game."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"In-engine, at least. Which can be a huge difference from in-game.

EDIT; Why the downvotes? All of Max Payne 3's cutscenes were pre-rendered, in-engine."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,I'm pretty sure Rise of the Tomb Raider (not R* but similar looking cut scenes) were also rendered in engine but they clearly looked markedly better than the actual gameplay sequences. 
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,i belive they are but as said pre rendered meaning its like super ultra quality but its a recorded video file
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Are Rockstar cutscenes still free or do you have to buy them with shark cards and they're only available online? 
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,I don't think they ever make prerendered cutscenes ever.
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,"Ubisoft ones are too, its in-game engine render, same as cgi, but a little bit more automated"
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Aren‚Äôt all cutscenes in game?
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"Seriously. I'm sure it will be an impressive game but, come on. "
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,Wasn't there quite a difference between the Gta 5 trailers and the final ingame version of the scenes? I guess this could be similar. 
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"I do not believe them at all, why wouldn‚Äôt they show their product in its best form? "
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,If you're going into a gta game looking for any of these things than the fault is on you.
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,I wouldn't hold my breath for split screen co-op.
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-27,Split screen co-op in an open world game? What kind of drugs are you on???
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"You're the minority in that aspect. That's cool that YOU want that but I don't know anybody who cares about any of that. Companies make games for the majority, and this sub is so picky and never happy with anything.

8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Super baseball 2020 was a game released in the 90s. Always sounded SO futuristic. The future is SUCH a disappointment.

8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,"Rockstar used to do a game every year or two, then they get 5+ billion in sales and i guess they are now doing a 5 year gap...heres hoping for Max Payne 4 in 2030"
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,"It's true. But they are the WHOREHOUSE of the industry. The way they release a great single player campaign, and then drop it, like it never existed. They are a slave to the dollar in a way I've never thought possible. Can you believe they didn't release any amazing stuff like Ballad of Gay Tony for this? Instead they release and sell this awful multiplayer shit that, that, yeah, people like but no one asked for.


Also: release the game on PC on day one FFS. Total whores for every penny they can get their hands on, it's disgusting. "
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"Look up the Euphoria physics engine if you don't know about it already. It'll all make alot more sense once you know what it is and why the physics in R* games have changed. GTA4 and RDR used the Euphoria engine and took advantage of it really well. They still used it for GTA5 but it was toned down alot - some say because the 360/PS3 couldn't handle the updated visuals too well whilst using that physics engine. Others say it was a design choice.

This game is developed without restrictions of last gen in mind, so here's hoping they bring those legendary physics back in some fashion."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,What do current gen ground textures look like? They look ok to me?
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"Wow when did you play it ? Cause that opinion, surely it's not coming from a trailer viewing üòÇ"

8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Face expressions in gow are very natural imo. The witch character in particular is great. Definitely did not get an uncanny valley from the animations. Rdr2 still really looks off to me. Improved textures but animations and pupils especially are odd.

8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Even if it‚Äôs not pre-rendered it‚Äôs probably a different character model. 
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"I highly doubt your characters face will have this level of detail at all times. Just because they don't use prerendered cutscenes doesn't mean they don't enhance the detail and lighting during ""normal"" cutscenes. TW3 did the same thing. 

I'm not saying the game won't look good, it's Rockstar. But I doubt this is 100&#37; game footage."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Yep I also believe it is dolled up a bit for the trailer. But I would say its mostly things like the really sharp image quality and resolution. So you'd probably get close to this with Pro/Xbox1x/PC. Im fairly confident it will be real close just because the time they've put into making it at this point
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"I have gone back to GTA 5 many times in its life span. After the 6 months I initially played it for, mostly online I put in 32 days game time and hit a wall. I no longer enjoyed it, However over time I have gone back many times.

Whether because friends have bought it and I have had someone to share the experience with or simply because the urge got me again. Each time I have returned there has been countless updates and changes and new modes and great updates that have made the game fresh again. Of course less time is spent each time I revisit but I have over 55 days online time.. that's replayability!

Bank heists and most likely train robberies. Which would probably be really fun. 
Sadly, as a pc gamer i don‚Äôt think I will ever see it. "
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"Should be Q1 2019, right? Isn't that how GTA5 worked? This is a game that deserves good hardware. Not shitboxes."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"You can definitely run this real-time on consoles now, this is a very sharp image and a beauty shot though, it's not like every character will have that level of detail simply because NPCs can't possibly get this kind of attention cost-wise. 

We are actually living in a golden age of graphics right now, we're no longer held back by the limitations we had at the end of 3rd gen and the tools and engines we have are jumping enormously with physically based *lighting* next on the horizon. 

Nathan Drake had this level of detail in the newest uncharted, but R*'s best when it comes to scope, as they always create an ambitiously big world and actually fill it with details, you know that the best character in this game will be the playground they give you."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"Exactly, because it was 99 % rendered on a PC. You will not get this graphics on this old ass console hardware ...."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Not if they're cut scenes
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"That doesn't mean anything anymore, since game engines can change level of detail on demand and the smaller scope of a cutscene allows high detail without impacting gameplay performance.. "
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,"Honestly, the final game looked better than the trailers for GTA V. "
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,What are you 8?  All you guys care about is your little COD shooters with no story and no co-op at all.  Best times I've had with games are ones I'm playing with the boys.
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"The change in fidelity / compression and loading time is usually noticable, and breaks immersion. An ingame cutscene can also take into account stuff you've done that impact the surrounding environment, like bodies on the ground / debris, whatever"
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"Because there's a certain charm to having the whole game rendered in the same engine. It gives a sense of continuity that's lost when it suddenly switches to a flashy pre-rendered version that looks totally different to what you're playing.

Sure, I can understand why some people, maybe even the majority, would prefer the swankier pre-rendered version. But there's definitely a reason why some people wouldn't."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Because games are big enough already without adding unnecessary 1080p video files to the disc/download?
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"Something called hype perhaps? The game has been in development for 8 years or so and we're finally seeing trailers and information regarding it. So it's becoming very real which is when you start to really get hyped and care for it - which is what I mean by not caring, I am not hyped as many others are at the moment and not really invested in the news about it coming out."

I would have just hoped they are like in RDR and GTAIV and not like in GTA V because that was boring. And its pretty clear from that body falling off the coach its definitely similar to V and not like RDR where you shoot someon the leg they are limping around, maybe falling over, or just bodies feeling like bodies when you interact with them. For one RDR2 so far looks like a GTA V makeover, which in terms of physics I think is a bit of a shame. IMO the physics in RDR fit the western genre so well."

8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"It's really only a bad game when it's used in advertising and hailed as ""in-game footage"".  Cinematics are in the game, so technically they aren't lying. I'm not saying that's what's happening here, though. It's still too early to know what the game's actually going to look like.  I can say that the three hamsters I use as my graphics card would explode if I tried to render this image on them. "

8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"I cant say for sure, but most likely. 

Chances are the cutscene-versions of characters not only include higher-rez textures, but also higher polygon counts and more complex facial rigging to allow for more convincing lip-synch at cinematic angles.
"
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"Haven't played the game, but probably.

Any AAA game with high-end graphics and detailed cutsenes probably does this.

Almost every 3d game from the last couple decades uses LoDs in general gameplay too. LoDs (level of detail) are meshes that basically reduce in quality as a player moves further away from them. Sometimes you may see these as models suddenly 'popping' extra details as you move towards them. This is very similar to how higher-detailed models are used in cutsenes, and lower detail models used when that extra detail is no longer needed."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,But was it on a console?
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"I have a PS4 Pro and I love it and you are right that games look amazing on it...but it still pales in comparison to my pc. 4k and hdr are not the only thing that brings games to life. The level of detail that can be packed into the game just because of the sheer increase in memory and processing power is astounding. Games that look just as good on console as they do on pc are because the devs did not develop them for the pc, they were made for consoles and ported to pc.

So the argument is always going to be that you get what you pay for: you can spend 400-500 dollars on a modern console + a nice 4k/hdr tv and get a satisfactory experience that looks awesome and plays well. Or you can spend 1k dollars on a gaming pc + a nice monitor and get a fully immersive experience where you can max out all settings and crank up details to truly live in the game.

TLDR: just enjoy gaming and don't get hung up on whose face looks better, tech is always advancing."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"No, I'm not kidding, considering the AAA titles you listed don't run at native 4K - it's all around 2K resolution upscaled to 4K. Most high end PC's wouldn't be able to run games at that detail level in true 4K, and they use better hardware than there is in a console. Sony probably has some proprietary tech used to make the upscaling look better, but it doesn't change the fact it's not native. 

Both the Xbox One X and PS4 Pro use the same tech that is in GPUs used for PCs, so they don't have some magic juice that makes games run better. The only advantage console games have is that they have to optimize their games for two systems, not endless combinations of components. Just as most PCs aren't.

Again, I'm not knocking consoles, I enjoy playing games on them, but it's a matter of fact that consoles aren't capable of rendering a real time image that is that good looking in native high resolution."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"The games all have caveats to the 4k performance on console, factor in the ludicrous price for online service, accessories, and games, now take your $650-750 investment into a console and apply that to a PC. I couldn't care less about 4k @ 30fps, and that's the problem, 30fps.

The consoles are barely 4k, and considering that you're probably playing it on a TV, it's a moot point."

It gives a more seamless effect to the gameplay in my opinion. Instead of it loading and then playing a slightly blurry video, it transitions into a sharp cutscene using the in-game assets and game engine."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,The lighting [in this scene](https://img.gta5-mods.com/q95/images/gta-v-trailer-graphics-project/b4c57b-47.jpg) looked a bit better in the trailers than the game.

8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"No, I only have my PS4 for the great single player exclusive games, as that's the only reason I see owning a console is good for. I love story driven games, but my main taste is competitive gaming. On that aspect the competitive games are either cheap or free. League, DotA 2, and Starcraft 2 are free and CS:GO is like 10$, so I'm set really as for what I'm into. I don't think I am obligated to tell you my age but your guess is pretty far off.

The number of people who want to play split screen while sharing a couch is not worth the development time."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"Yep, also custom costumes, whatever characters are standing around, etc. Way more versatile, and you don't have the (sometimes jarring) changes in lighting style or resolution. Also with modern graphics being as good as they are, you get diminishing returns from pre-render cutscenes. The biggest advantage to pre-rendered cutscenes is that you can do crazy things with high-quality particle effects and physics that you can't really do in real-time. Also the lack of load times can be good for intro cutscenes, and makes it so you can jump from one location to another without delays. But in terms of quality, the divide between AAA real-time graphics and pre-rendered cutscenes is getting smaller and smaller, and consistency is often as important as quality."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,the game should just link you to a youtube video with the cut scene you're suppose to see to further reduce the install/download time.
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"If I am being honest, Online is probably the only reason I might get this game anywhere near launch. Otherwise I will wait a year or two and grab it on Black Friday."

"
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"Well if we want to use the correct terms it is a ""Animation software game engine"". People who know the Euphoria name know what it is generally as we were obsessed enough to go and look up the tech demos. But when we see characters stumbling around and grabbing onto thing in unique manners or are launched from a speeding vehicle and then are accurately portrayed as they bounce and slide down the road attempting to reach out for things until they come to a bloody halt - we say ""Those are some cool physics"", not ""those are some cool behaviours""."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"We need actual gameplay before we can say. This gif you linked is a cutscene which will have ""handcrafted"" and scripted sequences.

The devs are very aware what made the first RDR what it was and still play the game to remind themselves. RDR relies on satisfying gunplay, it doesn't have helicopters, aircraft and a plethora of weaponry to make up for some basic combat. I mean, alot of us all recount memories of dragging a dude with our horses, stumbling around drunk or shooting the limbs of enemies and having them react accordingly in RDR and having fun because the physics - the developers have to be aware of it too so I believe they'll nail it."

However Crysis also uses very detailed facial models during gameplay, whereas third-person games generally only use high-quality models during cutscenes."

As for other games you see Top players do this to gain an edge in performance to get the smoothest fps possible. I guess sometimes they might do it because of the graphics as some graphical options are purely glamour and might get in the way, but mainly the other reason.

8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,If Rockstar does this it's definitely not a very big change in texture/poly count. I know I've certainly never noticed it.
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,"I don't think they have more polys, they're just rendered differently. The in-game camera probably isn't going to have effects to make the game look as good as cutscenes because you're actually controlling it and could make the player feel ill. It would make sense to have more polys in a pre-rendered cutscene, but if it's real-time, then changing the amount of polys just for a cutscene would still be too much for the engine to handle."

Yeah that's what I thought as well. But matter of fact is, the only really noticable thing is the lightning and consoles have great lightning nowdays. Stuff like face complexion in the above picture is nice, but I honestly don't notice it at all. Granted I don't play on console so maybe the difference isn't noticable, but for me the immersion doesn't really come from details as much as the gameplay around me."

But yes, consoles can't truly compete with PCs, but that's only kind of true in the sense that, yes you can spec out a PC to absolutely destroy any current gen console, but you're also paying a hefty price for that, to spec a PC to be roughly the equivelant of a console is going to cost you roughly the same as said console, but with the bonus that you can upgrade the PC later."

8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"Mainly because there was a change in console generation change, so they made if in old gen and current gen, and the PC, I suppose the distance from the current gen release to the PC release (5 months) is the right amount of time to expect now since there is no older generation to interfere with the process, also IV had a margin of 8 months too."

8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,The things is Rockstar are known for making trailers *out of* gameplay. I very much doubt they scripted the physics of this particular scene.

Put the gameplay model right next to the cutscene model and you'll notice the differences."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"Lighting is definitely a huge factor. For me personally, biggest immersion I experience in a game is seeing things fully rendered by the engine because they are actually individual objects. In most games, even today, it's standard practice to have something that would be multiple items actually be a single  object and slap a texture on it that looks like multiple things. That practice can be done really well with texture and normal mapping with lighting cast on it, but it's still a singular object as far as the engine and the players interaction are concerned. When a game attempts to use individual objects for almost everything and the engine is required to treat them and render them that way...now I feel immersed in a living world. That kind of detail is generally only attainable on pc games where they can count on large amounts of high speed memory. But as I stated in my first reply, consoles have definitely come a long way and games have been optimized to look and play really well on modern setups."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"The word combination '$1000 PC' is absolutely fucking meaningless.

When you say 'Xbox One X', we know what to expect, because it's one system with set characteristics.

When you say '$1000 PC', it can mean fucking anything. What kind of components does that computer have? Why does it cost $1000? Is it the price of its components or is it just a pre-built severely overpriced rig you paid $1000 for? When did it cost $1000? It could be a ten years old computer, for all we know and you could be naming the price you paid back then."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"I don't have experience with FC5 on X1X, but something tells me it's not running Ultra on 4K, but I may be wrong. I watched some videos to copare the two and the difference is not noticable on a 1080 display on my PC(watching videos, not playing). 

Still, I agree, that consoles are more efficient at running games made and optimized for them, but PC offers (in my opinion) a better experience, at a higher cost of entry. This I think is balanced by Sony and MS selling consoles at a loss, which makes online services paid and games more expensive overall."

8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,There is no way that‚Äôs true. In fact part of the reason why the game has sold so many copies is because people keep buying foreign copies of the game that come with shark cards that are cheaper than the actual cards by themselves.

8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,"I do agree with you on some aspects. 
Yes, hackers on PC are a problem that could be dealt with better, but it's getting there, and I wouldn't say console's have 'zero hackers' but it definitely has way less. 
Console exclusives are a definite plus on both xbox and PS4 with some quality titles. But PC does have the largest amount of exclusives. Some are really good, others not so much, so I guess it's purely opinionated.
In terms of graphics, PC definitely has a lead with the possibility of much higher resolution's and higher frame rates. (144 htz is something you really have to try at least once.)
In the end both PC and console's have their different ups and downs, it doesn't really matter which one is better, just enjoy them for what they are.

8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"The only reason I knew that is because I was such a huge Backbreaker fanboy before it came out (although it was kind of diappointing) and read everything Natural Motion would put out on their website, but I think a ton of people (including myself before backbreaker) think its responsible for all the ragdolls and everything, when really it just makes the ragdolls look more realistic, and does a great job at doing that."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,"I agree, but the demo also recieved a fair bit of criticism, people were afraid that it'd focus heavily on the scripted executions like Assassins Creed. So I was really glad when it turned out much better than the early demo."

8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"Consoles end up looking cheaper because the other objects needed to use them are generally already owned by families.

But by that stroke, I need a PC in my house for non gaming reasons, so taking the full price of my gaming PC doesn't make sense. If you take the difference between my rig, and what I would have needed to purchase anyway if I did no gaming whatsoever, it's only a $200 difference."

8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"You can't count the monitor unless you're counting the TV. You don't need the mouse mat, I promise. You can't count the headset unless you're counting your surround sound (or bundling with the TV price). You don't need a $150 keyboard.

You paid for luxury items. Don't roll that into the cost of PC gaming."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"Yo I gree completely, I was just talking about the fact that Rockstar released content for gta5 online which could be acquired by just owning the base game.

I'm not saying they are the good guys. Of course it was a strategy to push people into mtx.

8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"Merriam-Webster recognizes the alternate definition of literally, and I get that they're supposed to reflect usage and not codify it, but damn it this is one time when I wish they would have tried to hold their ground! Literally is a useful word, and allowing it to mean the opposite of it's real meaning waters down a useful rhetorical tool."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,Yes it is.  That's literally how language functions.  The way in which we use and interpret words constantly change.  Would you want English words to mean their exact Latin counterparts?
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,I remember gawking over the GTA 4 vids and Euphoria tech demos showing it off.  I ended up conflating the way it interacts/assists with ragdolls and physics.
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"And how much memory is windows hogging? Again, I'm not saying these are -major- influences, but they are influences or used to be, as I stated, they are less so today with the Xbox One's triple OS thing and the PS4's background OS crap, but if you go back to the PS2 and Xbox that wasn't the case, but even the Xbox One and PS4's OS's take up less of the PS4 and XB1's resources than a barebones Windows 10 installation."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"I got to admit, I'm unsure of what you're saying in this response, I'm not a native English speaker so I'm not sure if I'm just not connecting the dots right here."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"My old desk was roughly $40 and lasted about 10 years.


You can get a keyboard for $10, sure it's not a ""gaming"" keyboard, but it's fully functional, you can get a mouse for about $10 as well, also not ""gaming"", but again, fully functional, a mouse mat shouldn't cost more than $10 unless you want a full desk mat and again, you can get a headset for about $10, yeah it's not going to be the greatest thing ever, but it's fully functional.


You chose to spend more, just like I did, but that doesn't mean that our options are the only options available.


When I was younger and had at most $100 a month to spend, if I was lucky, I was more than happy to use my old IBM model M for damn near 20 years, and that thing came with my first computer so I don't even know what its original price was, but when I finally replaced it with a USB keyboard ... I think 2008, that USB keyboard was a $29.99 keyboard.


I've replaced more computer mice than I dare count though, the $10-20 mice really don't last long, so you won't ever see me advocate getting them, but yeah, they're certainly an option that exist.


And monitors also have a variable price, so do TVs for that matter, my monitor costed me 13,999kr (roughly $1400), but I also went for an ultrawide 100hz 3440:1440 monitor, before that I had a 999kr (roughly $99) 1920x1080 59hz monitor that served me from 2008-2016


You can get TVs pretty cheap, you can get monitors pretty cheap but you can also spend lots, ultimately what you're willing to pay is what you're going to get, it's not a requirement.


The only things that are requirements are if you want to make a desktop that competes with a console, you've got a set of requirements to follow, obviously you're going to need to reach at least the same performance as the console, so you're going to need parts that give that performance, locking you into a price point and ultimately, that price point is going to be roughly the same as the console, maybe a little bit more depending on where you live and how jacked up the prices of graphic cards are thanks to miners."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,"Yes, you can. You absolutely must have a monitor, you absolutely must have speakers/headset, you absolutely must have a mouse, and you absolutely must have a keyboard. I'm waiting on a PC game to announce release details before I build a gaming PC but since I don't currently have any of those (my computer right now is a laptop) I am going to have to buy them all and that's another few hundred dollars on top of the components that go in the tower.

You are correct that if I didn't have a TV then I'd have to add that in to the cost of console gaming. But I did already have a TV when I bought my Xbox One S so for me the total cost was just the console itself; it came with all the wires and and a controller.

Plenty of people had a flatscreen TV before they bought the console. People buying their first gaming PC most likely do not have all the additional accessories laying around. It's asinine to say that there isn't an additional cost to entry for PC gaming, it's not even close to buying an a console, even if you build a PC that costs the same as console."
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-05,Oh? I don't recall reading that... Any links? 
8h6w75,2018-05-05,2018-05-06,"What rhetorical tool?  It's just a word.  Words literally (using the supposed ""correct"" definition) change meaning all the time.  That's the natural flow of language."
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-18,Not sure if cosplay or really good fanart
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-18,Doesn't have enough O'Driscoll blood on her outfit!
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-18,"You know, it occurs to me that I've never seen a Sadie cosplay that looks natural. In game, Sadie has a sun and weather worn face. She looks like a beautiful woman who's spent her life working hard outside in the sun.

All the cosplays, on the other hand, seem to make her skin look almost like some kind of weird discoloration, like she has a skin condition.

This is a great cosplay otherwise, but I can't get over the unnatural look of the makeup."
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-18,Sadie was ride or die to the max. Loved her character.

ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-18,trigger discipline was not a thing in the ol' west so that is historically accurate. 
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-19,"It was 1899, so modern ideas about firearm handling hadn't fully taken hold yet. Also, in the game she was riding with a band of outlaws who ran around robbing banks and killing people, which probably broke even 19th century rules of gun safety."

Ideally the the trigger should be half way between the tip of your finger and the first joint not halfway between the first two joints. "

ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-18,"Did you read that from somewhere or something? Why wouldn't it be a thing then? It's not like people had to discover at some point that being accidentally shot was a bad thing.  
 
Sure when firearms were first invented, gun discipline in general wasn't really a thing because the whole thing was new. But the late 1800's was not that long ago lol."
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-19,"People always like to say this, but the reality was that gun handlers were even more cognizant of these things back then because guns of that period had far fewer safety features than modern firearms do and could easily go off from being dropped or mishandled, even with the hammer forward if there was a live round underneath it.

You can find pictures of people doing it both right and wrong from any period of history. But really, one of the biggest reasons that you see it occasionally in older photographs has more to do with the camera technology of the day. Cameras of the day weren't really capable for action shots, so they were very heavily posed and stylized. Likely with unloaded weapons. Often for promotional purposes; especially when you're talking about famous people like Wild Bill or Buffalo Bill who were celebrities at their times."

ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-19,"Karma farming to appear legitimate for propaganda/commercial shilling later on. 

The fact that many companies exist to promote your posts, brand/etc on reddit is no secret. We've had multiple articles about it, videos over at /r/videos, and other evidence supporting that it is a thriving business. Ever wonder how they do that? They need tons and tons of accounts. But if you just make brand new accounts and use them, it's pointless. Many subs auto-mod/ignore low karma users. They have sweatshops dedicated to making these accounts look legitimate. They age them, sometimes just by making them and letting them sit there for a few months, and then they karma them up by going to sites like /r/gaming /r/videos /r/TIL and other easy karma farming subs and repost past popular posts and then making a few random comments, often in high karma subs like /r/askreddit until the account has enough karma to look ""legit"" then it's moved into active use for whatever they need it for. 

Next time you see people saying ""repost!"" just click the OPs account and look at it, more often than not it's an account just like the OP of this thread, a fairly new account with a massive ratio like this. When your purpose is just to shotgun submissions until something sticks, it's easier to build link karma than comment karma.

Though the Model 3 had a Double Action cousin that looks fairly similar.

That said, those guns actually look more like fancy toys rather than authentic replicas.  That, and authentic live-firing replica Model 3s are fucking expensive, lol.  I'd bet they are Denix non-firing replicas just looking at them."

ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-19,"Old west single action guns don‚Äôt edge the hammer back when you squeeze the trigger, is what I‚Äôm saying.  Only way the hammer on a single action goes back is when you cock it with your thumb or fan it like McCree.

ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-18,"so? People always do that unless they are specifically taught not to and being annoying about trigger discipline is relatively new fangled, especially the straight finger thingy everybody does now. I think you would be hardpressed to find a photo from anyone from WWII on any front who gave two shits about it in a modern fashion. "
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-19,I wasn't talking about stylized photographs but photos of soldiers in WWII and Korea. Also I didn't say they weren't safety conscious there is a reason carrying 5 rounds with the hammer down on the empty cylinder in a single action revolver(also early double actions before transfer bars) is pretty much the established norm but the standard manual of arms back then were different and in different precautions were taken the primary way both civilian and military was not to carry on a loaded chamber. The 4 laws of gun safety that are universal today were popularized by Jeff Cooper.

ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-19,"Yeah, there's a cutscene where she turns around and unknowingly sweeps the barrel of her rifle across John's whole family."
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-19,"No it wasn't. It existed in some form or fashion i'm sure, but it wasn't taught the way it is now (Jeff Cooper's 4 Rules). "
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-19,"Maybe in the military or at civilized rod and gun clubs, but this was a band of outlaws and criminals. I think Bill is supposed to have been in the military at one point, but he was kicked out."
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-18,"For sure. I don't know many people that would spend $2,500 - $2,800 for the revolvers, tax, and FFL fees just for one costume. Unless they already had them for some strange reason. "
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-18,"True, but I think a little context is in order. It's not a gun, it's a prop. Even if it were a gun, if the hammer's resting on an empty chamber it cannot go off or be made to go off without cocking the hammer. And, on top of that, this is a costume of a person who was a dangerous outlaw in a time before gun safety was anywhere near as stringent as it is today. When 1/3 of the comments are still yelling, ""trigger discipline,"" despite that it seems pedantic at best. "
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-18,"It's good advice for newbies, but not really all that realistic. There are plenty of ways to know a firearm cannot fire.

Besides, if you treated every gun as a loaded one all the time, how would you ever transport or clean them?"
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-18,I'm your huckleberry. *subtle hat tip*
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-18,"I don‚Äôt disagree with the actual importance of trigger discipline, it‚Äôs just one of those things that redditors love to bring up any time they see a gun. It just feels like people are trying to be like ‚Äúlook I know all about guns Bc I know what bad trigger discipline is!‚Äù (Full disclosure I don‚Äôt know a whole lot about firearms either) "
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-18,"Also, I don‚Äôt think they gave a fuck about trigger discipline in the cowboy days. I reckon you‚Äôd get shot making a comment like that "
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-18,I'm just simply stating why people care about trigger discipline. It's not something you can just turn off. Doesnt matter if it's a staged photo like this or some fuckhead pointing his ghetto blaster at the camera.
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-18,">especially the straight finger thingy 
   
lol  

How else do you position your finger when it's not on the trigger...? 
 
Jesus man, have you ever even seen an actual gun in person before? 
 
You very clearly have no idea what you're talking about, not sure why you're acting as if you're an expert on the history of guns. So, again, post the source of what you're claiming. "
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-19,"Unfortunately reddit operates like a hive mind, studies have shown that too. Seed a submission with upvotes and it has a pretty good chance of getting up there, so they can use many of their other accounts to help seed submission for new accounts, just a little at a time, same with comments. Upward and downward momentum is pretty real, and it often doesn't take much to kick it off. It usually only reverses if there is something really sketchy about the submission, or the mods step in. Unfortunately in many subs, like this one, the mods are completely checked out and don't give a shit about anything except jerking off because they have 20 million subscribers. I've said many times, /r/gaming being the less serious sub is fine, but that doesn't mean the mods have to let it be a complete shithole. "

ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-19,"Nah man, it was just taught by their parents. They weren‚Äôt all incompetent fools"
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-18,"You could buy replicas for like $600 from Pietta, no?"
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-18,"I'm not disagreeing with you. Having seen reckless behavior with real firearms, I can't see it without seeing the results. You'd be surprised how much blood a body holds and just how fast they grow cold. "
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-19,"The way I think about it is, you handle every gun as if it were loaded until you can examine the chamber and confirm that it isn't loaded. From that point, you know that it isn't loaded as long as you have it in your hands or line of sight.

However, you still generally need to keep it pointed in a safe direction with fingers off the trigger just because any people who happen to be around you haven't had the opportunity to confirm that it is unloaded, and it's important not to give them the impression that you are being careless or threatening."
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-18,"I don't know how to politely answer your question. Usually you disassemble a firearm for proper cleaning. Transportation, you use a gun lock. "
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-19,"All right, 'lunger'. Let's do it. God, what a great movie."
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-18,"No, I totally understand. That's usually how it goes, i'm just explaining why I do it sometimes, but its only whenever there are obviously real guns being handled poorly."
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-19,"> it‚Äôs just one of those things that redditors love to bring up any time they see a gun.

There's a good reason for that.  Good weapons handling habits are about safety for you and everyone around you.  The world has enough dumbasses that you can't ever repeat these things too many times.  "
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-18,"Actually, I'd argue that they did, considering that I'm sure they'd go some place and someone would ask to see their gun and they didn't want to shoot anyone. Trigger discipline doesn't really need to be used whenever you plan on, or may plan on shooting something- its when you just take it out to show it off. Responsible gun owners have to be paranoid about it going off- check the mag, check the chamber, never point it upward unless you're aiming and finger out of the trigger guard until you're aiming at something you want to kill."
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-18,"You can find photos of everyone from your Uncle Bubba to super duper elite spec ops guys from the early 90s back to when time began and none of them are practicing what we would now call proper trigger discipline. 
Like it or not it‚Äôs a relatively new concept. Prior to that the reliance was on the mechanical safety or the operator themselves."
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-19,"I think Uberti and one other company makes the Schofield, and they both come in over a thousand for the 7"" barrel. Pietta does make the Colt SA Army for around that price though, if I'm remembering correctly. "
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-19,Or you could borrow the guns.
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-18,On that we can definitely agree. Dangerous jackassery with real guns is not a laughing matter and shouldn't be taken lightly. 
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-19,"That's my opinion, exactly.

I just cannot stand self-righteous assholes that feel the need to yell ""trigger discipline"" over and over when it isn't even relevant, especially the ones that haven't even touched a firearm in their lives."
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-19,"Even in my lifetime (40 ish) I remember gun safety being a thing, but some things from present day not receiving nearly the emphasis they do now.  Transportation of a deer rifle or shotgun in the 80's often involved a back window rack and a loaded, if not chambered, firearm."
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-19,"But you don't disassemble a gun that could go off at any moment, do you? That's how you get free shrapnel or a bolt through the cheek (wasn't pretty, believe me). And transporting a gun that could go off at any moment is a huge no-no.

The point is that teaching people to assume every single gun is always loaded once they have a grasp on the basics is stupid."
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-18,Yeah I getcha lol
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-18,"Or, the 'wild west load.' It was fairly common for someone who wasn't currently in a gunfight to only load 5 rounds and have the hammer over the empty chamber so they didn't have a round go off by accident while doing day-to-day activities.  

Things that might unintentionally fire a round include but were not limited to: Mounting or dismounting a horse, falling or being thrown off a horse, bending over and picking up something heavy and awkward like a hay bale for instance, getting into a fistfight with someone you may not actually want to kill, climbing a ladder, and one could go on. Point being (some) people were pretty safety conscious about a revolver strapped to them of stuffed in the waistband of their trousers. Not everyone was always ready for a shootout at high noon."
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-18,"I think a lot of the comments are gatekeepers that see a pretty girl and feel threatened so they hone in on the only flaw. From an enthusiast perspective, they aren't wrong, just assholes. "
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-19,"Yes and they had lead in paint, asbestos in walls, and hormones in animals. Strange how we learn as we go."
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-19,You do you. Darwin will sort this out eventually. Just don't be on the same range or forest as me please. Thanks. 
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-19,"Lol no.

Girls with guns is the greatest thing in the world.  Especially cute girls with guns.  Nobody ‚Äúfeels threatened‚Äù at all, I promise.  Anyone who likes guns wants girls to also like guns.  

People are sticklers for firearm safety."
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-19,"It is funny how it works that way.  But at the same time there are legions of people still alive who transported firearms that way and never accidentally shot themselves or anyone else by doing so.  Generally speaking, many of hose folks are probably going to regard current practice as paranoia.

I swing back and forth on whether I, personally, feel that way or not.  A little paranoia can be helpful to continued existence."
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-19,"Just don't ever touch a rifle with the bolt removed, it could go off at any moment!"
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-19,"I would just go with the statistic of accidental gun deaths, but that's just me. You can easily say the same for seatbelts and not dying while driving. Accidents happen. Education reduces them. "
ahck10,2019-01-18,2019-01-19,"It does reduce them.  But at the same time, there's never, to my knowledge, been a teaching technique with firearms that has had a dramatic effect on accidental gun deaths in the dramatic way in which seatbelts tend to reduce auto fatalities.  At least not that I'm aware of.  And some of things that were driven home to me in my youth...every gun is loaded until proven otherwise, don't point this at it unless you want to kill or destroy it....have remained the same.

So I tend to regard them as being the 'core tenets' of gun safety, and would at least hazard a guess that those things go a lot farther to preventing accidents than any other particular safety practice."

In RDR1 you just held down the button.  Unless you were trying to run at warp speed all the time."
9rp7sd,2018-10-26,2018-10-27,"Agreed. I hate how Rockstar handled the simulation part of everyting. Immersion is given priority over fun gameplay and it's everywhere. Playing this game is a chore and while it gets high praise from every review outlet (wich baffles me even more, you could think these ppl never played the game) and surely will become GotY, for me it's only getting more annoying, more frustrating and more disappointing with every hour I put in."
9rp7sd,2018-10-26,2018-10-28,"Cinematic mode is where it's at. Also, holding L2/LT and x/A keeps you from having to tap x/A. Or just go into cinematic mode and hold x/A and not have to worry about anything else. "

9rp7sd,2018-10-26,2018-10-27,Yes because it isn't random but scripted. So everybody sees it. Plus it already got reposted maybe 20 times

9rp7sd,2018-10-26,2018-10-27,"Animals natural reaction is to flee at 90 degrees to the threat in the direction they are facing.  So since the birds are facing the threat they fly at 90 degrees to it so that the threat would have to make a turn in order to come after the target thus losing speed and distance.  If the birds take the time to turn around and fly they lose time in making that turn, if they go directly away from the threat they risk the threat being faster than them.

Deer do this to which is why cars hit them all the time, the deer run at 90 degrees to the approaching vehicle to evade the threat if they are already facing the road.

Sometimes an animal will run or try to evade by moving away from the threat to gain a bit of distance before making a sharp 90 degree turn to evade."
9rp7sd,2018-10-26,2018-10-27,"Its.... ok.

9rp7sd,2018-10-26,2018-10-27,"You have to hunt in order to keep your gang happy but you can't bring more than one large animal with you. Why? Because there is only so much your horse can carry. Why not have Arthur put the animal on the horse to show the nice animation and have every additional animal store in your inventory? Why do i have to go on a hunting trip 5 times to feed my gang?

I got into a bar fight after drinking too much and woke up in the middle of nowhere the next day. When I wanted to whistle for my horse it wouldn't come because it was still tied to the pole in front of the bar where I left it. The game didn't understand that I really need a horse in that situation and kept it from me because it was more realistic.

To search a box or cabinet you have to hold one button to open it, watch the animation, press another button to manually take a single thing, watch a different animation, press the first button again to switch drawers, watch another animation and if you are lucky you can push the second button again to take a second single thing and watch that animation as well and if you not, there is nothing more to find and you have wasted your time opening the second drawer for nothing. Why can't I just go to a cabinet and reach in with a single button press and have every item Arthur finds be displayed in the corner of the screen. Why do I have to go through so many button presses and animations just to pick up some stuff?

Why did Rockstar care to make a animation system that lets me crash into low hanging tree branches and throws me AND my hunted animals off the horse?! Because they can? Why did they even model such trees in the first place? Just to show that it can happen? To tap themselfs on the shoulder for their immersive ragdoll simulation?

And why do I keep running into these things because my horse doesn't do wtf I want it to do? Just because there is a tiny little snake in the grass my horse suddenly loses its shit and drifts off track, ignoring my inputs and running straight into a rock or a tree.

I could go on for hours. The game is full of this stuff. Sure the graphics are amazing and the story is well written but I am not looking at a postcard nor am I watching a movie. Gameplay is the most important aspect of a videogame and Rockstar thought it was better to make a hyperrealistic simulation than a fun game."

9rp7sd,2018-10-26,2018-10-27,To each their own!
9rp7sd,2018-10-26,2018-10-28,"> First of all I'd ask if you enjoy this game or are these just the issues you with have with it.

Giving it my everything because I really want to love this game but Rockstar's underlying approach to every mechanic makes it really hard for me to enjoy even the most mundane activities. It's not these specific mechanics I have issues with but the overall design philosophy behind everything. What they see as a deep mechanic is time wasting and overcomplicated to me. They slow down the gameplay deliberately for a more laid back experience but it should be my choice if and when I want to go down that route and when I can't choose wether or not I want to go at full speed because I need to get shit done or lay low for a bit and catch fish for the sake of it, it feels more like Rockstar is taking control over the game away from me.

> The hunting sections aren't really required. You could just donate money, items, or restock the camp supples to increase morale. There are also other things you can do like chores that help with morale.

Okay, I thought I was supposed to hunt to keep the gang fed. If not, I still have to hunt animals for crafting and such and it's a part of RDR1 that I really enjoyed. Let's say I need a specific herb, do I ever get to see its location on the mini map or am I bound to aimlessly wander around and picking up ever plant that looks similar until I have found the one I need?
 
> I'm pretty sure that drunken section was supposed give you this reaction because just like Arthur you were inconvenienced by the whole situation. He was only supposed to be there for a bit, but instead ended up in the middle of nowhere without his horse. It wasn't unreasonably far either. I could have sworn they put you close enough to the camp and also near a train station if I recall.

I understand that Rockstar wanted to build a connection between Arthurs situation and how I was feeling about it but the point is, the resulting gameplay was not fun to me. I get why they did it but what's the point if you are annoying the player by putting him in a bad situation? Maybe I was supposed to feel bad for Arthur and help him get back on his feet but it felt like the game was punishing me for doing what it told me to. I would have prefered it if they offered me a way out instead of making me go back to Valentine to get my horse back. Why not just use the situation to teach me how to catch wild horses or have a stage coach come by and show me the travel mechanics? 

> The looting sections can be easily dealt with if you just hold down the button, you don't have to keep pressing it. They tell you this in the beginning with tutorial prompts.

So I can just hold square and Arthur will grab everything? I don't have to search every drawer individually?

> When you crash into something and fall off it's most likely your own fault. The main roads give you enough room and if you choose to go offroad you have to be extra careful. Rockstar also gives you the option to stop the horse and choose the direction you want it to face. When it goes out of control just hop off, deal with the problem and whistle until it comes back. It's not like the snakes are everywhere. If you are always falling of your horse then you are doing something wrong.

I want to go off the road a bit and explore, I don't see why you would punish the player for exploring the world. I have to limit my riding speed to not crash into a rock or a tree when going into the bushes but all it does to me is slowing down the game when I try to speed things up. The game does a ton to slow me down already, limiting my walking speed and taking away certain controls whenever Rockstar feels like I shouldn't be running around or pulling my gun out when I am not supposed to. 

> Personally I just think many of these things aren't as big of a deal as you make it out to be. If you find certain things tedious thats fine, but from your response you make it out like there are almost no fun things to do in this game which is completely false. There is something in this game for everyone to enjoy. You can be a bounty hunter, rob people and stores, customise your items, build up the camp, do stranger missions, fish, hunt, gather plants, find treasure, or even just explore. I am enjoying this game so far and I'm sure many people are to. If you had a bad well thats too bad, but I hope you can find something to enjoy in this game. Just give it another chance.

I just hope my issues will resolve once I get deeper into the game and have a better understanding of its mechanics. Hopefully there is a way to streamline my gameplay for a more seamless experience and avoid most of the things I mentioned either through character upgrades or changes in playstyle. I am sure the game has plenty to offer, I just wished Rockstar would give me more options to tailor the experience to my playstyle and not the other way around.

In RDR1 no one complained about not being able to clean your guns or managing your nutrition. And your brother is right. I also hate that. But this has nothing to do with Rockstar's attempted realism, it's just an inconvinient design choice.

7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,This is probably a bad time to remember that rockstar said there would be microtransactions in every future title.
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-02,Are you guys really bitching? Rockstar comes out with amazing games and I for one would rather wait a whole nother year for a polished optimized game than one that's rushed with bugs (and we all have seen those in 2016).

I hope it's good. I hope it's really really good, but with incoming microtransaction, the beyond stupid console exclusivity rockstar has been doing and general debauchery of video games in 201X I will not hold my breath.

7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-02,How many micro transactions will this one involve
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-02,"As a PC gamer, I can't wait to never play it."
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-02,Finally they release something after GTA V. It's been how many years? Bethesda is doing the same thing. The gap between releases is increasing. I personally think it's due to the large companies investing much more in micro transactions and finding out they are much more lucrative. Which is a really bad sign for the future of the gaming community if these releases become longer and longer. Eventually they'll just keep upgrading the same game forever. I know that's an extreme but really isn't too big of a stretch.
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-02,No PC? Alright. Sucks for me I guess.
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-02,Fml........better be the best game of my life

I really hope R* is going to focus on a great singleplayer experience in RDR2 instead of putting all the effort in milking the cash cow with stupid multiplayer stuff like in GTAO :/"

Rockstar isn‚Äôt the same developer, that have adopted some of the worst predatory micro transaction policies and in recent meetings Rockstar‚Äôs CEO keeps saying that they need more of them. GTA was a huge cash cow that had many failures in the gameplay department, go watch any GTA4 vs 5 physics video. I‚Äôll I can do is pray but they have completely gone to the dark side and I believe RDR2 will suffer. "

7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,I can't wait to play it in 2020 on PC.
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-02,"It sucks that possibly the single player portion of this game could be ready for launch in a few months but the game is delayed for the multiplayer mode.

Hell, there may not be a single player mode."
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-02,"There is one reason I'll be buying this game and one reason only.

Let me first say I think that the direction Rockstar moved in with GTA V, GTA Online is honestly one of the worst things to happen in the industry in my life time. It's despicable, and a good part of me wants to just not support them anymore that said.

GTA V had the biggest budget in video game history, and it made that money back in the first weekend it was released. That means that the budget for this game was bottomless. This game is going to redefine what ""Tripple A game"" means. Everything literally every part and aspect of this game will be top of the line. You know what excited me most from that trailer? The dog leaving dynamic footprints in the muddy road. This game is going to be literally full of tiny little things like that that are going to blow my mind. 

I just wish I could hope for undead DLC but that just isn't going to happen. What do you guys think? My money is on ""gold bars"" instead of ""shark cards"" my friend thinks they are just going to straight up sell money packs. What ever it is it's going to be gross."

This is going to be micro transactioned out the ASS. The CEO has stated that he wants to find ways to maximize payments of players in all new games, and figure out ways to force recurring revenue e.g. Paying when you run out of bullets "

7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,"They have the base game finished and are holding back to put the lair of loot boxes over it.

I'm not saying that RDR2 is in a broken state right now. I have no idea in what state it is in. But I personally would rather wait longer for the game to be great instead of having the game right now. I'm sure gamers can pass the time until October with a variety of other games."

7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,Wot?
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,At least the pc version will uave more dev time to deliver a better version

7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-02,By then we can also wait for 2026 for GTA 6 on pc
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,"Their last couple games came with a hefty delay to PC, maybe with the exception of Max Payne 3, it's tradition at this point"
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,"For GTA 4 and 5, the PC versions came with a video editor and improved graphics options for those with high-end gaming PCs. I'm assuming that extra development time on RDR2 will add similar features. 

Since GTAV was the top selling game on Steam for years until PUBG came out, I would be surprised if it *didn't* come to PC. Not to mention the players that bought in-game money with Shark Cards, Take 2 is probably going to pull a similar stunt in RDR2."
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,"They haven't even released first RDR on PC, i am only willing to wait delayed PC version if they are gonna release both games at same time, but other than that i am not gonna buy a 1-2 years old game for full price"
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,I triple dipped on GTA 5 and can safely say I will not be buying this til PC. I sold my consoles and have no real wish to buy another one. 
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,Keep buying their games multiple times and they will keep making you wait for the version you really want to begin with.
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,Im gonna buy the cheapest console i can find just to play it. Fuck waiting.
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,And that is exactly why they're delaying it to PC.

7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-02,I hate R* for doing this to those games which could have had so much better content with Singleplayer DLCs. 
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,Nah. They‚Äôll still deliver a hallmark single player experience. Their reputation demands it and that reputation is what allows them to bleed multiplayers. Y‚Äôall are too doom and gloom with no real reason to be.
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,What are you talking about? Name one rockstar game that didn't have a great single player campaign?

7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,"If they think this shit keeps my hype up, they're wrong. When the first trailer dropped I came in my undies. Now, after all these delays, my hype is practically dead. I don't dare hype October 2018 since they might just delay it again. "
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,"Being really optimistic here, but it would be so awesome and surprising if they delayed it for a simultaneous PC release. If not...hopefully fall of 2019 at the latest, if ever. "
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,"The corporate higher ups have to go to board meetings and they have to tell that board when they will be releasing products that will generate revenue. That way the board can make financial decisions with a rough idea of their revenue stream. That corporate higher up will go to the development team and ask them to tell him when the game will be ready. They then have to go to all the subgroup heads and ask them when they can finish their part, which are all heavily intertwined and depend on the pace of completion of parts of the game entirely out of their control (""We can't finish animation until the voice acting is completed."" ""We can't finish voice acting until casting is done."" etc.). Those people then have to guesstimate using their own theoretical timetable and the theoretical timetables of the relevant groups to give the development team a target. The development team then comibines all those estimated targets and gives the estimated release date.

They didn't do a terrible job at estimating. It's just damn near impossible to get a correct date for a game of this size.

Remember Assassin's Creed Unity? They hit their intended target of Q4 2014. They also [had to apologize](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30226586) for how ridiculous the glitches were.

If Rockstar delays this game until 2020 to get it right, that's fine by me. Otherwise this subreddit will explode with hate for them for rushing the game, or not including something or another, or just making a money grab."
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,Shit happens. That's why its estimated. Just because you understand jack shit about it doesn't mean it's terrible.
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,"> but that's a terrible job of estimating.

But also a great job of marketing.  It forces the gaming community to pay attention to it, it raises the hype even more (""They're really trying to make sure it's perfect, like with GTAV!"").

The longer you talk about a game before its release without any actual information, that's a win by the marketing department."

7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,"The potential risk here is a change in priorities.  During the development of GTAV, Take2 hadn't yet seen how much money they could make with Shark Cards in GTA:O.

They now know about their cash cow and they knew about it early enough into RDR2's development to shift focus or funding to online multiplayer, possibly allowing single player to suffer as a result.

No way to know for sure, but I wouldn't be surprised if the additional delay was caused by removing resources from single player to develop RDR:O, thereby extending the single player's dev time."
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,"I can't wait until people realise that there is an argument to be made on both sides. 
GTA5 did suffer due to how hugely successful GTAO was.
No single player DLC.
Possibly dev time spent elsewhere in the run up to launch. 
There was content either cut, or placed in the world of singleplayer that was only relevant to online gameplay. 
The prison being one.

Rockstar do need to be told by the customers what they want, or they will just follow the money...which unless people really kick off and they think they may get some backlash.

Will the online part be a similar shitshow, most likely. It was very profitable.

Will the singleplayer be incredible, most likely. It usually is.
But the world they build is for both. 
Hopefully it won't affect single player too much."

Which gets old for me. I guess another GTA along with red dead would be reason enough for me to just buy another system. 
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,"That's what I was hoping yeah, but given how long it took to ""polish"" the PC version, we're looking at March 2019. That's going by how much longer GTA 5 took in development."
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,"GTA 5, Rockstar table tennis, midnight club! I know your talking about recent games, a long history of mediocrity before and during the early gta years, but that‚Äôs neither here no there. GTA 5 has been a downgrade in every aspect and their policies have me worried to the point where I‚Äôm not exited about RD2. If the trend continues RDR will have a story straight from a western movie and have a physic and gameplay downgrade from the predecessor. The online won‚Äôt be the fun experience it was in RDR, but a massive grind fest to incentivize micro transactions. I used to love Rockstar, was my favorite developer. "

If someone pays one hundred fucking dollars on your game they should get whatever they want for the end of time. Fuck you for that Rockstar.

7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-02,"This has **not** been confirmed and considering Rockstar has many different divisions working on many different games, it's not safe to assume so, just because they ported some previous games to PC.

7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-02,I am at a point in my life where it's no big deal for me financially. I mean I'll spend the cost of a game during a night of drinking so what's the big deal buying a game twice over like...2 or 3 years?  It's no skin of my balls. 
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-02,"Well let's clear up one thing: As of now there is no PC version announced. The first RDR never made it to PC. 

All of this ""They delayed the PC version for X reason"" is complete speculation because *they have not announced a PC version*. 

Either way it's no skin off my balls. Like I said in another comment reply I spend more than the cost of a game when I go out drinking. What's the big deal of I want to replay the game in a couple years and there is a (I would assume) superior version available I can buy so that's the version I choose to get ? No one is putting a gun to anyone's head and forcing them to buy it twice. Hell, if it's like GTA V it won't even have mods so most people won't care anyways."

7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,They cancelled the single player dlc for GTA to focus on GTA:O so sure the story of RDR2 will probably be good but we can't expect anything like Undead Nightmare
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,Nobody is denying that the single player story won't be great. But they will do to this game what they did with GTA5. They'll abandon the single player campaign and focus on their brand new money printing factory otherwise known as Red Dead Online. They have no reason not to because it is what worked before and they know it will work again.
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-02,"Eh. Battlefront was a revered franchise and dice was (is?) a reputable company. Look what happened there. The problem was more because of EA - the parent company- than the developer. Take-Two is Rockstar's parent company. Thus, the bottom line is that Rockstar is gonna do whatever makes Take-Two the most money, and microtransactions (also known as ""recurrent consumer spending"" in the words of Take-Two's CEO) are absolutely the way they plan to do that. Take-Two's CEO said as much. I imagine the single player will still be good, but the online portion is gonna be riddled with microtransactions."

Looks at the nuclear holocaust that has been the gaming landscape for the past few years...*shrug* 

* Remember No Mans Sky? 
* Remember Destiny 2 releasing DLC that gated off parts of the original game on top of charging microtransactions for things that were free in Destiny 1?  
* Remember Star Wars Battlefront?  
* Remember Star Wars Battlefront 2?  
* Remember Day-Z?  
* Remember how the Division launched (did they ever fix that)?

7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-03,"My point it that all of those games came *before* Rockstar's owner, Take2, realized how much they could rake in through Shark Cards, which caused them to entirely abandon GTA V single player to focus exclusively on GTA:O.

The head of Take2 has also been perfectly clear that all Take2 games going forward, which includes RDR2, will have persistent monetization as part of ""games as a service.""

7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,"Rockstar is also notorious for delaying their games, but like you said it's almost certainly due to how ambitious the projects are. I'm sure everyone is disappointed but no one should be surprised by this. "
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,"One more point: cannot release it the same week/month/quarter with another title releasing. Target dates for game release, even if ready, could spell doom in sales if during weak months (summer, mid-winter-post Christmas...). Historically, they want Sept-thru-Nov. It might be ready by August, but then they use Oct...and we don't know if there is any ""new hardware"" in the pipe from Sony/Microsoft that they might contract for ""exclusive release"" tie in. "
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,october 2018 will come no matter what. Better to wait for a game that will forever be good.

7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,Sure you didn't have to pay any cash to play single player through but they still cancelled the single player dlc to focus on multiplayer
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,"I wouldn't trust rockstar to keep micro transactions cosmetic. The only glimmer of hope is that RDR is a period piece and probably won't have rocket cars, yachts or 36 different assault rifles. Unless they take it to some kind of Wild Wild West level of absurdity.

I loved red dead redemption, it's one of my favorite games ever. But they ruined GTA so badly that I can't help but be cynical. If it comes out and I'm wrong, SP lives up to it's predecessor, and multiplayer isn't just some place designed around revenue like GTA online is, I'll pick it up when it comes out for PC in 4 years."
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-02,They are to my knowledge.
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-02,"They are but most cutscenes nowadays can be in engine and still loaded with a huge amount of additional shaders or higher quality models. Just take a look at Assassin's Creed Origins cutscenes. They're clearly in engine, but the shader work is far superior to the playable parts of the game."
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-02,"I'm getting the sense that if a sentence does not make complete sense, it disturbs you hahaha"
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,Yeah but when they do these in engine screenshots they ussually ramp up the settings a shitton where the framerate is crap but it obviously doenst matter since its a single screenie.
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,"Usually they're 'in engine', which means they cranked everything past maximum, ran the game at 1fps at 8k and then produced downsampled images. "
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,"My experience has been the opposite.  Yeah, there's usually some fat laying around you can trim out if you go back to hot spots, but if you're ignoring optimization you usually have to drop the whole effect because scaling it back too much makes it look like garbage.  It's way easier to work in an roughly optimized fashion and scale up than it is to scale things down.

I'm not too familiar with mutli-platform studios, but the console devkits I'm familiar with usually just have a bit more memory because it's better to show a memory warning than it is to crash.  I think this is done for the same reason why I think iOS updates ruin the performance of old iPhones.  Devs are working on the newest hardware and older hardware is an afterthought.  While you want beefier hardware for compiling and developing assets, you want to test as much as you can on the hardware users will have in their hands."
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-02,"This. Always PC screenshots, trailers, any marketing material, etc. Don't see why they just won't do a simultaneous PC release as well. It made on a PC. Every game should be PC by default. Was looking forward to Death Stranding's true graphical potential on PC. "
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-02,Same
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,"I don't really see what is weird about it. They're excited to have what they assume is a concrete release date but also sorry about having a delay, this kind of thing happens all the time."

I‚Äôll respect your opinion that you didn‚Äôt like as much but you‚Äôre in the significant minority. Midnight club was a racing game difficult to compare it and it was still a good racing game and table tennis was obviously table tennis. GTA 5, 4, RDR, Vice City, San Andreas, Bully, Max Payne 3 are all great games by just about any measure. How in the world is GTA 5 a gameplay downgrade from 4? Driving in 4 was like driving on an ice rink shooting was completely mediocre, no customization other than changing clothes. You say it will have a story straight from a western and yet ignore GTA 4 had a story straight from a mob movie. "

I also keep in mind that *there has been no announcement of a PC version.*  The first one did not come out on PC.  Now, I know if rumors are to be believed there were very specific reasons we never got RDR on PC but until I see an announcement I'll  assume it isn't happening.

I am also banking on it being at least a year or more between versions.  If it takes a year and a half for a PC version that will be right around the time I'd normally start thinking ""Man...I haven't played that game in a while I want to replay it"".

7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-02,"Basically they ruined GTA because they turned it from a game about stealing cars into a game about buying cars. They killed off SP expansions and never let you use or even buy the DLC cars with the billion dollars you could earn by playing the stock market. You can only spawn them with SP mods. They also put too much focus on public games, as they added more and more modes and games that were exlusive to public games, my friends and I who don't like playing with random 12 year olds were kinda left behind. The heists were terrible because you needed exactly 4 people to play them. Getting exactly 4 people to play is impossible when you have 6 friends who bought the game and most of them have jobs, classes and/or wives. There should have been bots to fill in the inevitable gap.

It's an amazing, alive world like rockstar games have always been, which makes it all the more tragic. "

7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,Kinda wish they remastered fallout 3 and new Vegas instead of remastering skyrim and putting it everywhere 
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,"No lie, their Honest Hearts DLC inspired me to see what the Grand Canyon was like in person. It was incredible. "
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,"easily the best soundtrack in the fall outs: jingle jangle, the civilization song, blue moon, big iron, heartaches by the number."
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,Interesting.
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-02,"I bought it on 360, ps4 and PC. Might've even gone for Xbox if they did an X patch."
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,At least we have a fairly solid ballpark for MHW
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-02,Still no crossplay with friends who play on ps4.  So that's a big loss.
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-02,He just told you that they won't leak the information because it would cannibalize console sales. 
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,And I just said why.
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-02,"I am. If it's not released on PC around the same as the consoles version, I won't buy it.
"
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,"I don't have a console, as I'd rather play on PC, and I also wouldn't throw $60 at a game twice, for a copy of the content. I'm glad you don't have any regrets, but that just reinforces their release schedule and MTX plans. "
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,"I did it 3 times. Xbox 360, Xbox One, then PC. I dont regret it as it deserves the money."

7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-02,Man that glitch ages ago where you could trick online into thinking you were playing undead overrun while open world was nuts 
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-02,"That has to do with porting games over to PC and where their priorities were.  Not all games come out on PC,  not all PC games come out on consoles and some games are exclusive.  That doesn't mean the games weren't good it means they didn't meet your specific wants and desires.  GT4, GTA5, Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare were all amazing games by most all accounts.  Sure,  it sucks for anyone who only had a PC or specifically chose to wait for a PC version,  but Rockstar isn't obligated to release their games on every platform at the same time.  "

7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-02,"So it was ruined because it went from a game about stealing cars into a game where you buy cars... and then in the very next sentence you complain that they don't let you buy cars in single player with all the money you get in the stock market.

Let me repeat that, they ruined GTA because you have to buy cars instead of steal them (which I still stole a car to get around all the time online, I didn't care about luxury) but they also ruined it because you can't buy cars in single player.

Ruined it because they make you buy cars (MP), ruined it by not letting you buy DLC cars (SP)... got it.

Most of those missions had 4 people precisely because every person had a different role. Its easy to get bots to follow a scripted route or a series of things to do based on triggers, but since a heist can be solved many different ways you would be annoyed having to babysit your bot player.

My main beef with the heists is it seemed to auto-assign you to a role. Like in one I was a pilot but I just started the game and had NO idea how to operate a plane... my team was VERY pissed with me because all I knew how to do was fly back and forth and I had no clue how to fly or even turn so i couldn't meet my crew at the tarmac where they were waiting for me and the timer ran out."

7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,"I played New Vegas for the first time last year on my 360 and had a blast.

To me its fun when the OG game graphics hold up really well.

That being said, im sure if they remastered it and added all of the various DL content/some of the mods it would be really really amazing."
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,Some people are making a Fallout 4 mod that turns the game into New Vegas
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,"Well, we've always got Fallout 4: New Vegas to look forward to!"
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,"im sure we will get a fallout 3 remaster or new vegas before bethesda makes fallout 5 or elder scrolls VI. IMO i think the reason they are trying to not constantly make those games and try out other IP's is because they are a single player open free world with so much to do in them, people have a huge expectation for these games and they not include microtransactions. Why would they keep making so much single player content without monitization "
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,"Or just, you know, fixed glaring bugs like never being able to trigger Raul's and Lily's personal quests.

Maybe there's a mod to fix those though.  I gave up on vanilla FNV doing it after my second playthrough."
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-02,but modders are doing just that?
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,I hope you didn't go to the Grand Canyon thinking it was Zion National Park

7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,I guess we'll see
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-02,I used to think the same thing until the original Mass Effect
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,"I bought it on the XBox 360, and it was absolutely stunning what they pulled out of that old console.  Then I bought it on the PC and had a blast with modern graphics.

The only thing I reinforced is that I was willing to purchase a higher quality version for replay.

Also, that wasn't me. Don't make assumptions man.


*edit*
I did just down vote that accusation though. "
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-02,"Yeah, I can have different opinions because there's a huge difference in acquiring cars in SP vs MP. In one mode you play through the missions and the stock market jobs and actually have fun earning money. You don't have to repeat anything. Once you are done you basically unlock everything, and have enough to buy anything you want and have hundreds of millions left over. In the other mode you grind the same missions for hours or days just to get one vehicle, in lobbies with kids hell bent on killing you and stopping your progress for no reason. Or you can do heists for the 15 minutes a week your friends' schedules all align. Or hey, why don't you just buy a shark card! Want a knight  rider car? That'll be over $4,000,000 or over $50 worth of shark card. $50. For a single vehicle. That's not fun, that's a blatant rip off. And you can't just steal cars like that to drive around, it's not like they spawn in the game."
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,"Yup just started replaying it after a few years. Still holds up as the badass and buggy game I remember it to be. The stories are the best, way more in depth than Fallout 4."
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,Yeah I've played most of the dlcs and they're pretty great. One of them is really difficult though and some of the mods you can find for it are amazing I think there's one that just came out or is coming out soon and it's like a completely new story 
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,Yeah we were discussing that. It looks pretty amazing like I've seen remake mods where they mostly just remaster the character and weapons but this actually has updated landscapes and stuff
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,What is that a mod or something? 
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-01,Yeah idk what you're talking about but I've mostly played it pc 
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-02,"You do realize they have the PC version for Red Dead 2 finalized already? So no, you're not ""willing to purchase a higher quality version for replay"", you're willing to purchase the game twice so long as they stagger the releases a bit. It's like saying it's okay to be milked. "
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-02,"I still think they should have had a open world zombie mode, that glitch was fun as shit but it only spawned a handful of zombies and didn't give you the single player feeling

"
7ujpv2,2018-02-01,2018-02-03,"There are big devs who don't even bother making a PC version though and there are exclusives as well.  Look at Last of Us,  which was considered one of the best games in recent times.  

We don't say Zelda and Mario are shit because their exclusive to Nintendo,  we instead say 'shit, Nintendo is dropping some good games maybe I need to get a Switch'.  I just think it's a silly argument to criticize games because it didn't come out on their prefered system when they wanted it to.  It took 2 years for GTA5 to be released on a PC?  Well shit,  sorry,  they clearly were focused on consoles.  I'd love to play Civilization VI on my PS4 but I can't  and I understand certain games I'm going to need a PC in order to play.  Star Citizen?  Nope.  And so on.  That's gaming. "

It's a cosmetic car, I don't care if it cost 6 trillion dollars. It doesn't prevent you from playing any activity in the game. If your main reason to down a game so much is because you can't have the pretty car you want that is bullshit.

As far as your thing with friends a ton of matchmaking games are like that. You need x number of people to play and sometimes you gotta take a chance on random people. As you find ones that played well and them to your friends and after a few hours you will have a few dozen who take it seriously."

gkk34l,2020-05-15,2020-05-16,"One my favorite Rockstar glitches was in GTA 3. My friend and I were messing around in the rhino and had cops chasing us all over. The rhino was invincible and the slightest touch would blow up any car it hit. Well as we were being chased, a lone cop car appeared ahead of us and decided to play chicken. I was fully expecting him to just explode when I hit him but instead something happened that we still laugh about to this day.

The cop hit us head on and instead of exploding it just shot backwards into the air like a football punt. It never touched the ground. It just kept going further and further, higher and higher, gently flipping end over end, until it disappeared into the distance. I imagine it's somewhere out near Neptune by now."

gkk34l,2020-05-15,2020-05-16,"The entire GTA series was created because of a funny glitch. When they were creating the game, (under a different name, that I can‚Äôt remember at the moment) it was a pretty generic top-down driver-shooter. But there was a glitch during play testing, which affected the police cars‚Äô pathing. 

Basically, by default, a police car should ‚Äúpath‚Äù to you, (meaning the game figures out a way for them to get to you, and they follow it,) stop before it reaches you, then the cop exits and tries to attack/arrest you. But that‚Äôs not what happened... The pathing system had a bug, where the police wouldn‚Äôt start slowing down until they *reached* you. In other words, **the game was full of homicidal cops who would intentionally plow into you at full speed with their cars**. At first, they thought to fix it. But play-testers actually enjoyed the glitch so much, they decided to leave it in. So the game name was changed to GTA, to better reflect the crazy driving, and the series was born."

When I turned it over, it uncovered a small nest of roaches.  There were probably no more than a half dozen, but because every fast moving object was leaving tracers behind it in a way reminiscent of a multi exposure photograph, to me it seemed like thousands of roaches were boiling out of my lap.

9hz1vh,2018-09-22,2018-09-22,"Here‚Äôs an excerpt from the interview on IGN (they call it ‚ÄúReal Life Permadeath):

‚ÄúWe really wanted to make people care about Arthur Morgan and to not just lead him into dangerous situations with no caution. It‚Äôs an immense sense of immersion to know that if your character dies, a shockwave will be sent out of the game, killing you instantly. It forces you to play smart, like you really are that character....

It‚Äôs also important to note that Red Dead Redemption 2 is a game designed by the elite, for the elite. We only want the best players playing our game, in single player and multiplayer. Adding a feature like this ensures us and the community that people who aren‚Äôt good enough at the game will be weeded out, leaving only the elite.‚Äù

It‚Äôs an interesting concept for sure but I can see this backfiring on them in terms of sales. There‚Äôs a lot of people who don‚Äôt want to die that probably won‚Äôt pick the game up now. Sort of silly marketing if you ask me to mention this before release."

You have to do chores to keep some arbitrary happiness number up or unlock gameplay bonuses or stat boosts or whatever. I can‚Äôt stand grinding repetitive crap in games and it sounds like they‚Äôre really doubling down on that sort of thing even outside of the MP.

In fact, it sounds like they‚Äôre trying to at least partially integrate some aspects of MP and SP. I‚Äôm willing to bet they‚Äôve designed a lot of the single player missions to be playable in coop in the online mode as well. Let‚Äôs them reuse content for where the real cash cow is for Rockstar these days.

Doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt be a good game, but that sort of grindy game as service stuff is not what a lot of players want after the first game."

9hz1vh,2018-09-22,2018-09-22,"People answering this comment probably does not shoot black powder guns...

BP is corrosive, and water soluble. Meaning after every range trip you're supposed to disassemble the gun, clean it with water, dry it carefully (since water is also corrosive), and then oil it properly.

I read one guy's comment that he go around it by just dumping the entire gun in a bucket of spill oil and thus avoiding having to clean it immediately.

The annoying cleaning procedure is why I stay away from black powder shooting.

Meanwhile some people shoot thousands of rounds through their HKs or Glocks without cleaning ever."

It won't be worth preorder. After 3 months of heavy play the hype will die off. Online play will be hyped up for the next 9 months after which. We will see a big social media wave of RDR2 posts, gifs, and videos to spark a second wave of sales.

The architecture of modern consoles means that they are basically PCs with different logos on them.  There is no reason for there not to be a PC port.

I will not deny that I'm also in that camp of thought. Honestly even the title of this article shows how skeptical of R* and T2 I am that I'm sure they will find a way to quantify the stuff to charge Micropayments for it online.

But the absolute hysteria over Rockstar's business model with GTA:O is hysterical to me. It's a FtP online component tacked on the GOTY for its year of release and with a robust single player expierence that ranges from 25/45 hours in length depending on completion rate. No one got ""gypped"" by Rockstar when they bought GTA V, and no one forces a gun to these people's heads and makes them play the online component."

> adjectives in English absolutely have to be in this order: opinion-size-age-shape-colour-origin-material-purpose Noun. So you can have a lovely little old rectangular green French silver whittling knife. But if you mess with that word order in the slightest you‚Äôll sound like a maniac. It‚Äôs an odd thing that every English speaker uses that list, but almost none of us could write it out.

> But the plural of ox should be oxen, not oxes.

> Then one fowl is goose, but two are called geese,

> Yet the plural of moose should never be meese.

>

> You may find a lone mouse or a whole lot of mice,

> But the plural of house is houses, not hice.

> If the plural of man is always called men,

> Why shouldn‚Äôt the plural of pan be called pen?

>

> The cow in the plural may be cows or kine,

> But the plural of vow is vows, not vine.

> And I speak of a foot, and you show me your feet,

> But I give you a boot ‚Äî would a pair be called beet?

I've said it before but it is truly a love letter to the old games on PS2. Web-slinging mechanics are spot on, the story is good and the acting is superb with a really likeable Peter Parker. Plus it is ridiculously huge with loads to do. "

Haven't picked up Spidey, God of War, AC Origins or Odyssey. I also liked Far Cry 3 and 4 but think I'll pass on 5. I do really want to play RDR2 since the previous was my favorite game last gen--tempted to just pick it up at full price..."

9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,"Same here, thing is that it's really not worth it to play single player games right away at full price when in a year or two you can get them for $15 or something. "
9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,It's ok. I just started Skyrim.

9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,The last game I bought was Cuphead. This sub loves the hype train to the point where it empties your wallet. If I can't look at a trailer without any fluff and be interested in the game then it's not worth it.
9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,"Don't feel bad, just make the time when you can. I just started on the first uncharted game today."
9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,"I'm cursed with more disposable income than I have disposable time to play games. Only recently I've bought God of War, AC Odyssey, Spiderman, and now RDR2. I played maybe 10-15 hours of the first 3 and still haven't started RDR2 yet despite buying it day 1. My teenage self who would save up for that one game he wanted and play the absolute shit out of it would be so disappointed right now

EDIT: Forgot I bought Black Ops 4 a couple weeks ago, have hardly touched it :("
9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,I‚Äôm still grinding through BOTW.  Granted I only am able to play one or two hours a week.

9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,"I have botw still shrink wrapped on my shelf. Installed spider Man, haven't played it though. Until I get an external hd I can't even install Rdr2, but Costco has brand new games for 49.99 so why the hell not (Rdr2 coming to Costco online soon)"
9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,I'm playing Breath of the wild and dark souls right now....

9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,Its not as great as people make it out imo
9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,I still haven‚Äôt gotten around to Bioshock Infinite...
9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,It just so happened to release at the wrong time. Tsk tsk Spidey sense didn't help 
9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,"Between Red Dead, Spiderman, and, less recently, Horizon Zero Dawn, I'm really wishing I had a PS4."

9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,I bought a ps4 for Spiderman and I'm right before the final battle. I'll probably never finish with rdr 2 taking my time. 
9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,"I feel your pain, I had to sell my console and good *TV after I lost my job, I'm so looking forward to replacing them and catching up as this was my first PS console ever.  Edit - to -> TV"
9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,"i havnt played spiderman either but if this reddits any indication its not even worth it, literally everyone 100% completed the game within 24 hours. boring."
9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,"Relax buddy, im in the same boat on account of not having a ps4 to play on, only my 1440p ultrawide gaming pc and my friend's xbone elite that i have no interest in dealing with on account with how bad the original xbone was (mandatory hour long ""installs"" for physical disk anyone?) In comparison to 360 . Same thing happened with monster hunter world, waited 9 months in anticipation for the pc version, and it was a half assed, straight port that apparently crashed on startup for a few people, apparently due to hardware incompatibility, which isnt help by capcom's insistence on using drm that is a known performance hog, so i didnt buy it and no longer have any interest in playing, capcom's loss i suppose. Thats not even mentioning my general distaste of R* over hiding train heists behind preorders and how gta 5 turned out (all effort went into adding op toys for people to grief with in online in order to sell shark cards, rather than an ""episodes from san andreas/ los santos"" sp dlc, or really any new missions that arent some form of ""run to point a on the other end of map, drive slow ass unarmored van to point b while dodging retarded npcs that spawn in front of you, and players in jets or flying cars/motorcycles firing homing missiles at you"" for chump change or nothing at all). And i was the guy that voted rdr2 on YT polls over games like bf5, spiderman, and new god of war."
9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,Here i am trying to finish Witcher 3! 
9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,Playing thru AC Origins right now myself. But i have a pc so i wouldnt be able to play either of those games anyway : /
9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,Have to wait for my bday on the sixth. GUESS I JUST WONT GO ON YOUTUBE THEN.
9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,"Here I am with a PC, no Red Dead, no Spider-Man, late Fallout 76 beta... I thought it would be a great time to get into PC gaming because the awesome graphics of new games."
9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,"I'm still playing Horizon Zero Dawn, i'm not even in the dlc's yet. I'll grab Spider-Man and RD2 when they drop at 20 with the all dlc's.  "
9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,I paid $400 to play this game on ps4 pro. Most expensive game ever.
9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,I haven‚Äôt even played Spider Man 2 on the PS2 so i can somewhat relate to this 
9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,Oh GoW... I'm way behind. Still finishing MGSV
9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,"Persona 5 , Spider Man , and Red Dead 2 are the first games I played with this console and I am very pleased."
9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,Needs more online play. Single-player storylines are dead amirite?
9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,Just started Spiderman myself last night finally. 
9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,"I started Spider-Man yesterday, the game's amazing. Red Dead will have to be on my list for now with the other 200 games I wanna play lol"
9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,Yeah OP I'm at like 80% on Spiderman and just have to 100% it before I get into anything else.
9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,Red Dead Redemption is overhyped anyway.
9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"I know I'm going to get downvoted for this but I found Spiderman to be kind of bland.  Swing into a bunch of badguys, web bad guys to wall, repeat.  It was fun but in no way was it near as good as GoW, HZD, or Bloodborne."

9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,You're not missing anything. It's an ok game but definitely not what it could have been. 
9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,Oh you mean the Mary Jane & Miles stealth adventure game Featuring Spiderman?
9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"Sometimes I get games that are brand new. Then the hype train passes, no one seems to talk about it anymore and you feel like you aren't apart of that culture. It sucks but there are a ton of people in the same situation. Enjoy the game for what it is when you do happen to get it.   


If you buy the game later, you don't have to sit and wait for DLC like everyone else and you also get the chance to buy these games on sale with the DLC. "

I put what I had for gaming into my PC instead. I still miss out on exclusives, but I get to grab so many games at 90% off.

Also, any games older than a couple years are easy to run on max settings on my mid-range rig. "

9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,I skipped this gen aside from the switch. The just wasn't anything compelling till now. But now I don't really want to blow that kind of cash on a gen that's almost over.
9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,My last (non-Nintendo) console was a 360... switched to PC gaming and releases like RDR1 and RDR2 make me sad because they seem incredible... and then I remember that I still have never plugged my Switch into a TV
9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"Can I ask why? If its affordability, I upgraded with a used 1TB OG PS4 for about ¬£140 three years ago and there's even better deals than that around these days! It is worth it!"

9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"TBF, Destiny 2 demands a shit ton of time after the Forsaken Expansion passed. If you aren't playing religiously every week, you get left in the dust.

That's why I don't have Spiderman or RDR2, what time I do have for video games is sucked up by D2, and I still don't get everything done that I want to."
9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,This is exactly why I neither lend my games out nor take lent games from friends. No telling when the fancy will strike to play that game again and I don‚Äôt feel like rushing to play through something just cause I feel obligated to return it quickly.

9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"As someone who just picked up RDR2, I would recommend you read and consider some of the middle-of-the-road user reviews before taking the plunge. Spider Man seems to be universally loved, or at least universally liked."

9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,I'm still playing Spiderman and it's just alright... But I'm debating if I should sell it and just get red dead. 
9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,"I was able to hop right into Spider-Man and loved most of it (there are some bizarrely misplaced stealth missions that really mess up the flow and momentum of the game.)

I started RDR2 yesterday, and am really struggling to get into it.  I was prepared for that, as I read reviews saying the first couple of hours was a slog... but this has been a very boring slog.  The controls are also infuriatingly bad and really takes me out of the game.  There‚Äôs been a couple of times where I wanted to talk to someone and instead pulled my weapon out on them. "

9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,"Save up and get a PS4. There's actually a lot of great games. While Switch's Zelda is my favorite game of all time, PS4 has Horizon Zero Dawn which is an absolute masterpiece and similar feel, God of War, and Last of Us remastered, on top of what you already mentioned you want to play. I love PC gaming best but I've found a new appreciation for console this gen. "
9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,"I honestly don't get why RDR2 isn't on PC at launch. Spiderman is an exclusive so that kinda makes sense, but developers have to realize that PC is a massive market and we want games too. Just look at how well monster Hunter world did on PC. "

-Infamous 2
-The last of us remastered

9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,Odyssey is awesome but after playing RDR2 I went back and it felt like an arcade game compared. Lol but RDR is so slow and tedious that youd have to be retired with no family to ever finish it. That doesn't take away from it's fun factor though.

9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"youre not alone. it was just hype fever. now that DLCs are kicking out more people are taking a step back and realizing the main game was pretty bland, but so many were on the hype train when they played it they still have fond memories. entirely hype fever. i have a close friend who stays off social media so had no clue about the game, and this was his first spiderman game, at first he loved it but both of us realized it was super bland once we got a bit past the tutorial levels and found the game had not much more to offer. in the end it was a thumbs down 'meh'. his words echoes what i was thinking in that it was fun for a minute but the story was super stale, broken up only by crappy stealth missions no one wanted."
9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,I've found that auto-renewing subscription accounts are generally a poor value.  If I get busy with life or just run out of energy they just keep charging me money and require some level of attention to actually cancel them.

9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,"game specific subs help some with that, a place where (usually) people currently enjoying said game thrive."
9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,"I think reddit communities are ok if you want to talk about an old game. Dragon Age reddit is still going strong. So long as people respect spoilers, people are generally happy to talk about it a couple years on.

9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,"It is kind of nice to play games while they're relevant and you get to take part in the shared experience, but it's also nice to pick up games cheaper and with all the content. Another fun thing is sharing your different experience of a single player game with your friends. It's a toss up though.

I went through a period a couple years back when I was enjoying a bunch of stellar games that came out years ago. It felt great to pick the games up for cheap."

9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-29,I don't think is about hating destiny 2 as is that the dude borrowed a game and he didn't even played it yet. That's just rude imo. Just play the game or return it to the owner already.

9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,"I second this.  RDR2 is amazing to me, but I can imagine it's not for everybody.  Indulging in the minutiae of every day cowboy living can be oddly rewarding, but undeniably time-consuming.  Spider-man has a deep combat system that you won't master until late in the game, but virtually anyone can immediately swing around NYC and fight thugs with relative ease.  In RDR2, you better make sure you can quickly identify an incoming threat, what direction it's coming from, and appropriately respond or you're dead."

It has glimpses of it with the beautiful cutscenes but you need to be heavily invested for it to affect you(like lorewise, also playing the game for 5 years helps). Like Cayde‚Äôs death scene, for my brother it was ‚Äúmeh‚Äù, for me I was crying the most I ever have in a video game just because of the line ‚ÄúI‚Äôm coming home,Ace‚Äù it‚Äôs stuff like that"

9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,"Yeah, I just don't have the time for it. I can certainly appreciate it as a technical marvel - visually, at least - but the pacing, the frustrating controls, and a few other issues (i.e. someone draws a gun on me, I beat them up, and *I* end up wanted with a bounty that's = to 50% of all the money I've found so far?) make RDR2 a disappointment for me."

9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,"Meh, never finished wd2, just didnt have the tone or story of the original, more like gta with hacking mechanics, since there is nothing stopping me from going on murder sprees while my happy go lucky hipster PC fails to react in any way, atleast in the first game ppl would recognize u and call the cops if your karma was low enough, and killing cops gave you massive negative rep, legshots and nonlethal less so, made you feel like a real vigilante. I pretty much stopped playing after i got bored taunting ppl with my wheely bot and calling swat teams and rival gangs on random dudes. Not helped by it being a ubisoft game, on pc, where im garanteed to see some hilarious immersion breaking bug within the first couple hours, in my case floating cars and npcs standing inside of cars with their heads clipping thru the roof."

9sf2uh,2018-10-29,2018-10-30,"Yeah my biggest issue with patient gamers (at least from what I saw there anyways) was that they didn't so much encourage waiting for games as they did condemn you for playing new games. On that sub, there is _NO_ reason to play any new game, and if you spend more than like $10 for the GOTY edition then you're an idiot. "

PC arent consoles, and there's almost nothing separating an Xbox from a Windows PC in what and how it can play stuff, PS4's with their new architecture and removable HDD slot with loading, instalation, OS etc is just a expensive niche computer, kind of like a mac. 

And then there's the switch. That's a game console. It has games and they are funny and creative and the console offers something no PC can offer.

9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,">hyper realistic

This is the worst myth about this game in my opinion because it‚Äôs not consistent. *Some* aspects are realistic while other aspects of realism are completely ignored.

One example of many: yes, I must feed myself and my horse to keep our strength up. However, if I leave my hat in the middle of a field, it‚Äôs magically back on my horse somehow.

It‚Äôs selectively realistic. Many times, some of the most annoying things about this game get excused for ‚Äúhyper realism.‚Äù Eh, I could care less. I‚Äôm more interested in solid controls and airtight mechanics. "
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"What do you mean the combat is melee based?  Bows are so OP you don't even need melee.

9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"I bought both on the same day, with RDR2 being a preorder at the time. I played ACO for a few days and really liked it, but I haven‚Äôt gone back since RDR2 came out. I still haven‚Äôt finished Chapter 3 yet, because I‚Äôve been hunting legendary animals, getting perfect pelts for crafting, beating challenges, and hunting treasure. 

I found it really slow, especially in the beginning, but I have grown to really enjoy it and appreciate its pace. I can play it for long stretches or just jump in and do a quick mission or hunt for a perfect pelt.  Once you level up the character and your horse, it‚Äôs easier to go faster, even if you are riding your horse a lot to go between points to deliver pelts, do missions, or hunt. Camping and cooking outside camp and staying out while you get things done feels fine, and the world feels alive, so there‚Äôs always something to hunt, someone to rob, ambushes to get out of, or side quests to stumble upon. I find RDR2 to be a masterpiece in ways I didn‚Äôt expect. I am looking forward to going back to ACO, though. "
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"Odyssey's bounty/wanted system is much better. In RDR2 once you get to Saint Denis all the minor annoyances start to add up, like accidentally running into someone and being wanted and it doesn't help that there are lawmen around every corner."

9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"Idk if it's just me but RDR2 just isn't doing it for me. It doesn't provide that minute to minute enjoyment like most other games can. Riding horse for 5 min to destination (which is beautiful btw), then proceed to hold down A for another 4 minutes as characters talk, followed by a shootout, some more dialogue and then rinse and repeat. I love the characters so far, Dutch is one of the best characters in the last few years, however the gameplay is so fucking boring sometimes and the gun play hasn't been imroved since the first RDR and feels like it has controls from 15 years ago. 



I really wanna have fun and have a drive to actually launch RDR 2 again, I thought I would love the slow pace and be immersed but it honestly just makes it so hard knowing I have to do so much running and riding to experience anything above sub par gameplay."

I have followed lots of infos before and did research on both games, and both should be totally my taste.

But with AC: Odyssey i think the Season Pass is kinda... expensive,... (?usual?) so i will wait before getting this additionally. There's probably hundreds of hours main game content until wanting to dive into some DLCs."

When i first met hyppokrates and asked about my mother he said that first i should've helped him retrieve notes to help a patient that is almost dead and then he would talk, or i could try asking the priests, at that point i went to the priests first since i didn't really want to go in the fort, and after doing their quests i got the notes and when i came back the patient was dead with hyppokrates saying something like ""you took your time..."".

Or when i went to help a friend of Perikles in the ostracism quest and i got caught whilst trying to change the votes(kinda wanted to try it) and then the guy got exiled and sokrates got a bit mad since it was a friend of his."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Odyssey I s great but the level of detail in RDR2 is leaps and bounds greater.

9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"I loved both of these games, easily my favorites of the year and I think I enjoyed both more than God of War. As much as I love the Red Dead series and loved RDR2 I think I may have had more fun playing Odyssey, RDR2 just has so many depressing moments. Red Dead is definitely more polished and absolutely gorgeous, and overall just an amazing technical achievement. I'm still blown away by the small details and beauty of the world. Odyssey is beautiful in it's own right but had plenty of glitches and didn't elicit as much emotion from me as Red Dead did. What was originally purchased by me as a time killer before Red Dead ended up being an incredibly enjoyable experience. I didnt expect to finish before RDR2 but it just kept pulling me back in and before I knew it I had put in 90 hours and had beaten the game. "
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,I haven't played RDR2 yet but as far as I know punting people from high places isn't a viable combat option so Imma have to say AC Odyssey.

9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,"I like this, it makes me want to play odyssey. I lost hope after Assassins Creed 3 was awful, but Red Dead Redemption has been hard for me to get into. It's pretty slow paced to be honest, so that combined with some life style changes has made it pretty dull for me. "
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,rdr2 also has first person (which actually to me makes a huge diffrence) AC does not
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,Nice ad for assassin‚Äôs creed 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,The difference is that I bought RDR2 because they didn't stuff their game with microtransactions while I'm going wait to buy Odyssey because I shouldn't have to pay extra money to make leveling less painful (also RDR2 doesn't have leveling it has skill levels which makes more sense to me).
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,"Honestly i wanted RDR2 to be slower and have less shootouts, more 1x1 / 1x2 kind of conflicts. I love it regardless

9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,Is this satire?
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,Ok?
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,"Worth adding:

-Can play in 2019+ when PC ""final edition"" arrives.
-Can play now during the wait for 2019+.

Games like ACO are the reason why I do not feel I need to resort to lesser iterations of games before they've had a chance to be fully realized."

9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,Isn't Odyssey also bogged down to a grind for the sake of promoting microtransactions?
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,Any rockstar game would be obviously better than one assassin‚Äôs creed game.
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,Ones made by Ubisoft
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,"On one hand i can get ass creed on PC but it isnt optimized great so it runs like ass 40-50 fps. But red dead is not on PC yet. Not sure what the FPS for ps4 red dead is. I have booth and haven‚Äôt played much of either. My brother is a big ass creed fan but i just bought him RDR for his b-day. He tried out both and we both agreed that Rdr2 was more bang for his buck. 

Ass creed will be cheap next year and will have a new title in a year. Red Dead will last years to come. "

9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,I have conflicted feeling about how both games pleased me. I like how RDR 2 take it slow and focus on immersion but I also like AC Odyssey focus on faster pace and less chore on mundane tasks.

9wdy01,2018-11-12,2019-01-17,I am an AC fanboy and I just cannot fathom how anyone can say that ACO is the better game of the two. 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2019-05-11,are they really comparable? I never played Odyssey but I loved rdr2..but that franchise is legendary..
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"Call me biased, but Odyssey is just a re-skin of Origins with some RPG mechanics added on top (in general feels more like an offline MMO from what i've seen on streams (especially level/gear scaling) then an actual RPG. I've beat origins and couldn't give 2 shits about buying new one). And meanwhile RDR2 is a generation-defining game that sets a new bar for how open world games should be made in terms of player-world interactions and level of big and small details in this world."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Except red dead is good
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,odyssey is garbage
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Played and completed both but AC:O is my preferred game to go back to because of the fast pace satisfying combat and replayability. Might go back to RDR2 to check out the online mode whether it's an enjoyable experience or a micro-transaction shitfest.
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,Odyssey cannot be compared to this masterpiece
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,"Is AC:O really that great? RDR2 is probably the best game I‚Äôve ever played imo and I keep seeing a lot of talk about AC:O in relation to read dead, but personally I stopped giving a fuck about AC years ago. Has the series suddenly just become great again?"
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,2nd part with years of development to make it perfect vs thousand part of an every year product that stoped being enjoyable after the 4th release
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Odyssey has some of the worst side quests I‚Äôve ever seen the story is good and the world was ok but that‚Äôs all I liked. Rdr2 is a much better game over all I enjoyed the world story and side missions in that game.
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"I have spent 60 hours in assassins creed and I think I'm still quite far from completing it, it's so much fun.

I actually like getting bounties and killing those bastard mouthy mercenaries. For people who have played both, are the bounty hunters in RDR2 harder to fight? Cos I've heard they can be really annoying, whereas in Assassins Creed they're avoidable if you like. "
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,It's almost like they are role playing games. *sends shifty glare at Fallout 7fail*
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,I honestly like Assissings Creed Odyssey more than RDR2. The fact that Assissins Creed has way more involved that makes me want to keep playing the game. They both have huge maps and ACO is more organized where RDR2 is like here is a HUGE map figure it out. I love the RPG elements in ACO where there really is none in RDR2. 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Rockstar -- Not Rockstar
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Is Odyssey any good campaign and story wise? I've seen you can basically charm the toga off anyone which is undoubtedly fun but I'm not spending 60 bucks just to be a hot athenian amazon love goddess 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"Enjoyed ac:o more so far, I think a lot of that has to do with the fact I was expecting nothing from it, while I was expecting something probably unachievable at this point in gaming from RD2.  Still love RD2, but the clunky mechanics and lack of smoothness throw it off a bit for me.  "
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Red Dead 2 was such a disappointment
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"I‚Äôve been playing AC Odyssey on Project Stream, got about 14 hours of gameplay so far, and if youre wondering, that game is FUCKING AWESOME  "

9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"To be honest, both are a must-buy. They really nailed it calling this ac title for odyssey. This sure as hell is a HUGE odyssey. I have 87 hours on my save file and 45% of the map is still foggy. I still can't wrap my head around how huge it is and how much there is to do. Then you have red dead 2... Way more slower paced but realistic as shit. You can virtually do everything in this game, it scares my how beautiful it looks. Red dead 2 is extremely heavily story based and lenghty. It never feels repetitive. "
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"Tbh more historical accuracy is in ac. I know, the weapons and characters can get whack, but the actual setting is damn near flawless. 

The ""wild west"" never even existed, really. Not sure in and way how red dead is hyper realistic. 

Both games are fun. Go play them. "

9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,AC Odyssey - Critically acclaimed??? 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,[deleted]
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"Haven't played rdr2 yet, only watched clips but in my opinion Red Dead feels more real to me. The conversations in AC seems lacking to me. Just unrealistic and boring. I mean just look at the dialogue exchange between [Odessa and Alexios](https://youtu.be/5-9nEndQ2Vc?t=1110). She clearly states that she isn't interested in you and tells you not to try advancing on her again and 15 seconds later you flirt with her again and shes all for it. It's just bad. Really bad. Do you really think that's well written?

Maybe RDR2 is just as bad since I have not played it but RDR1 was really really good. The whole of AC:O is just meh, you can beat the whole game and kill every mercenary and cultist without a hint of backstory. Most of the choices have very little impact, you can do the conquests however you want... doesn't matter who you help at all. There is no crafting in the game, no cool story line for the end game gear. You just kill things and happen to get whole legendary sets. Look at the Witcher 3, each set had it's own quest line with backstory about the witcher who wore it before you. Not only that but you can upgrade the set and it changes visually as it grows in power.

The whole game is just lazy in my opinion. The main character never really says anything to fill the void when you travel. Think back to God of War, it knows when you're traveling and it fills the time with cool tib bits of story, lore, characters, etc. The most Alexios ever says is something along the lines of ""The city of Pephka!... better watch my pockets."" It's all just a bore. Yes there is story to the game about the landmarks and lore but you have to google it or read a small paragraph in the menu. It could have been dialogue he could have had instead with the other characters or with his bird, just something.

All that time they put into having Alexios and Kassandra as playable characters was also a bad design choice. All that time, effort, and money spent on that could have been on fleshing out the rest of the game. Making side quests more fun or making ship combat matter more. I mean fuck, I had my ship fully upgraded by the time I got 30% of the game finished. Also boars are broken as fuck. You literally can't hit them in the head. Sharks despawn whenever they feel like it. AI in general is dumb af. Drachma has zero use for anything. Cool loot locked behind microtransactions and timewalls (if you feel like grinding for any of it for a random piece). They could of had badass DLC with a story for some of those microtransactional armor sets instead... lazy, greedy or both? The game also is a CPU whore and is hard to run even with a 1080ti, unacceptable. Gameplay is somewhat boring, no assassin play at all, no traps or any cool tools to help stealth play. You just run around assassinating soldiers until get caught then you slash, slash, bow, bow, slash slash, parry, abilities, rinse wash repeat. Takes no thought.

I could go on for days but I'm gonna stop here because no one is gonna read this except for maybe one person and they are gonna most likely downvote me anyways. I'm not trying to hate on anyone's opinions, quite the opposite. I respect that many enjoyed the game because it was worth a play through, but I feel it's rude for people to downvote me for having solid reasoning and logic behind why I disliked it.

**TLDR: if you enjoyed Assassins Creed Odyssey then I'm happy and I respect your opinion. But I do not think we should ignore the major flaws the game has and how great it could have been.**"
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"AC also has an overbearing, really invasive UI, which seems par for the course for Ubisoft. It does not make good use of it's screen real estate at all."

9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"Lol, there is no VS. Odyssey is just buggy boring and terrible game. That has like 0 interesting and copy-pasted content.

RDR2 is full of unique content and story itself is so long that you start suspecting it will not end. And once you think that it reached the end, it is still going. To connect both games. 

Quality and attention to details in RDR2 is so good that Ubisoft can only dream about something like this.

Rockstar is ultimate proof that you can spend as much as you want and take as many years as you want. Because if you have talented people, you will make HUGE profit out of it. I'm quite sure that development cost of this game returned over the dam weekend."

9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"Sure, ""critically acclaimed"", but there's a big difference with most reviewers giving a game an 8/10 (AC:O) vs. being tied for the highest rated game of all-time (Red Dead)."

9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,One thing I don't like about AC is that its not realistic enough. I like to Mod my Games to be as realistic as possible. Can't wait for RDR2.
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"good example why studios matter, I would usually always pick a historical fantasy/melee combat rpg over a western game with guns but in this case I bought rdr2 and I will never bother to play odyssey because its the typical ubisoft game design even tho it also looks pretty the world feels empty and you just run from map point to map point"
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Lol was anyone actually looking forward to another shitty addition in the AC universe? Swear there was a shit one that released last year haha no comparison AC is like COD. Same shit every year. 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"Ok look, i've fully played through both games but lets just tackle Odyssey.

&#x200B;

Its overall fucking terrible. It takes 70 hours to beat which you might say is a good thing, but unlike Red Dead or Fallout or Skyrim or any other game that takes nearly as long to complete, it isn't fun to do so. The whole world is one massive grind. You've got all these regions to visit that are just filled to the brim with the exact same content. The exact same forts, exact same camps, exact same caves with exactly three lions in them. By the time you've completed two regions you've already seen the vast majority of the game's content.

&#x200B;

And its a grind the whole way. Now Some people have claimed they were always overleveled so its not grindy. I was too, I never had to do extra content in order to level up enough to move on. But just the standard content and story missions aren't interesting or fun or new. Getting through the quick way is a slow, methodical, boring, grind.

&#x200B;

Then the microtransactions that absolutely ruin this game. You need resources to upgrade your gear, which becomes obsolete every time you level up. Thing is that because you can buy this stuff, they make the required amounts to level up gear so astronomically high that you either have to spend an entire day collecting enough or spend $20 on the resource pack, that for $20 still only gives you enough resources to upgrade a single piece of equipment. And in a couple hours you'll have to upgrade it again.

&#x200B;

The game has no real ending, it just kinda stops. Super anti-climatic. Also being vague to avoid spoilers if you are going to have a character that has plot protection and I don't get to choose what happens to them, don't make them do something so heinous that I hate them forever. FUCK ASPASIA. That's the most evil thing i've ever seen an NPC do and next minute Kassandra is joking friendly with her again. Fuck no.

&#x200B;

The world isn't changed by your decisions. The whole thing on Kephallonia seems cool but nothing actually changes if you go back, and there's no reason to ever go back. The whole war between Athens and Sparta is pointless. Even if you pick a side and fight with them to takeover a region, it doesn't actually mean anything. Great you put Sparta in power in Arkadia, now you get to do all the same forts all over again but this time you kill Spartans. Even though you just fought for them. Even if you try to dedicate yourself to one side in the overall war it doesn't matter because once you leave a region it'll randomly flip flop between which side controls it again.

&#x200B;

I loved a lot of Odyssey. I loved the Greek history and mythology mixed in, I LOVE Kassandra as a character, and I loved using Spartan Kick all the time. The combat was fun and awesome and just stellar overall.

&#x200B;

That being said, Odyssey is a soulless, thrown together, greedy, broken, boring, BAD game. Once you've played about 10 hours you've already seen it all. I honestly recommend no one waste their time with it, it wont pay off.

&#x200B;

Assassin's Creed Odyssey is a game that I absolutely loved through and through, that spent the core section of it's game doing everything it could to force me to hate it. I wanted to love it all the way to the end, but that was just impossible. Odyssey wants you to hate it with every fiber of your being and it's very good at making sure that you do."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"AC:O rpg decisions do *not* matter. Not even the conquest matters, you always just do what gives you more loot. Even most of the dialogue choices dont matter whatsoever. Sometimes it has a small effect and changes some dialogue exchange but hardly. Most of it, especially with Odessa, makes zero fucking sense. Just go look at the relationship options in the final conversation with her. It's horrible and makes no sense."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"Yeah maybe don't compare the glitch fuckfest at Cleopatra's with Red Dead Redemption. 

This level of crime is not acceptable.

Please. STOP. Get some help."

9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"Yeah, usually these are made to make one game look bad compared to the other, right?

Too much positivity up in here."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Right? Like it's just a short list describing each game. So fucking what
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"Hyper Realistic? The Law system is not realistic at all.  Also player health is insanely high and easily recoverable.

The AI Law NPCs are too much like the borg. Every law NPC in miles knows about your crime a few seconds after it happens and not only chases you, but appears in front of you as you are running away.

Not to mention the entire city knowing exactly when you hand the train NPC a few hundred dollars and that you are no longer wanted.

I think the game would be much better if Rockstar didn't force GTAV's wanted system on top of RDR 2. Back in the day crime wasn't always met with immediate chase and pursuit, but notoriety.  As you gain more notoriety, the bigger chance a particular lawman might try to take you in. If your were extremely notorious, a band of Lawman would ambush you in their own time."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"Not sure either. Maybe to show that different types of games can be good? I think most of us already knew this. Hell, in Zero Dawn Horizon, you shoot mech dinos with a bow."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"Upvote it so he can get his internet points for the day and then move on, I guess. It‚Äôs all pointless information "
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Perhaps Rockstar and Ubisoft are short on money and joined together for a dual advertisement disguised as a post.
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,buy them both lol

9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,I mean. It can‚Äôt be perfect. Imagine a game where you get shot and infection sets in and your character just lays in bed for three weeks and you can‚Äôt do anything. Or they die and it just stops working all together. 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"Yea was thinking the same thing, if it was hyper realistic you'd fall over after getting hit by one bullet."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"I balked at that too, but given the context of what it is compared to, the person who made this didn't mean hyper-realistic gameplay.  They meant the setting and story are authentic Western US in that era, as opposed to AC:O's fantasized version of history."

9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"personally, when I finish RDR2, I think I'll need a break from open world horsey games for a while - the amount of hours I've sunk in RDR2 (I have no idea since oddly the stats don't track hours played unlike GTAV).... i'm only now on Chapter 6.  Seems everytime I've picked up the game to play i've sunk 7 hours each play-through, at least 6 times I reckon.. not sure..  anyway yeh, I'll be taking a break from open world horsey games, prob get Hitman 2.   

 I'm sure AC Odyssey is great and I probably would have got that since I loved Origins, but does go to show IMO, don't release a game at the same time as a GOTY candidate which has similarities!"
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Porque no los dos?

9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Shotguns and melee weapons are the most brutal things in the game.

9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,This is me right now too.
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,They are different enough in design and playstyle that it's easy to jump back and forth.
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Same. Switching back to AC and finishing RDR2 later.
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Have to agree. Rdr2 at the weekend. AC during the week. 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Agreed I love both but RDR2 is do damn slow paced that it gets frustrating at points.
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Odyssey is basically origins with different setting and story 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,For Sparta!
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"Yup same here. RDR2 sure has great music, visuals but ACO has both of those plus a solid open world with better game mechanics that work and RPG elements that I enjoy. "
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,I know ubisoft is getting better nowadays
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"I just finished Origins and I'm in the same boat with this game, not sure to get it. I see it too similar in many way to Origins. Or am I way off in that assumption? In your opinion What sets it apart from that game?"
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,I just wish the leveling wasn't so slow and you're forced to do a handful of side quests before you can continue the story.

9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,And the voice acting is somewhat lacking. None of it makes me want to listen to it. I find myself skipping 90% of the dialogue. 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-15,Me
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"Odysey and Origins are completely different from all the other AC's and honestly I think they are way better. Ezio was dope though, but it just feels so damn different.

Story wise Odyssey is pretty good, its slow at first then you start hitting the RPG elements and realize all the dumb decisions you've made."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"I would say it's pretty ok. If you didn't enjoy origins you probably won't enjoy this too much. The setting is neat, AI is terrible, voice acting and animations are sometimes hilarious. In my opinion, none of the later iterations recaptured the magic of the Ezio series (Black Flag came close) and that holds true for this one. The characters are mostly bland and I'm not given a reason to care about the story much."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"According to the comments on this post, you seem to be in the majority actually. It seems the hype for RDR2 wore off and people are realizing that ""hyper-realistic"" animations aren't as important as good, responsive gameplay."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Didn't seem like it was taking any kind of stance. Seemed like a neutral comparison
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Its you personal preference 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,"I was pretty underwhelmed for the first like 6 hours. Once I really got into crafting stuff, hunting treasure and animals and all the side activities that seem to never end the slower pace bothered me less and less. would recommend explosive rounds

At some point during the story I went from being disappointed in the whole experience to pretty much addicted to the game. Arthur is an amazing character too so I'd at least give the story another shot if I were you.

Sometimes you don't have hours on end to play games so I totally understand how some people aren't really getting hooked by it. Totally fair criticism."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Its slowslowslow paced but still a good game

9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,And in steps Red Dead Online
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,Red dead 2 has microtransaction and ubisoft is giving free dlcs for players the size of spiderman paid dlcs microtransaction don't affect you gameplay though
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"Is that so. Im in the middle of RDR2 and really enjoying being part of that world.
AC:O seems awesome too and will be on my to get list. I fail to see how with the all round high reviews for both and general public love that they are overrated "
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,They are. But I suppose we're on some sort of enthusiasts' website. 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,RDR2 may be a bit overrated but you can't deny that Rockstar has pretty much mastered making single player games. although GTa5 online is literally cancer in my opinion. 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Waybetter than sony games where you can finish it in 15 hours 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Buy it for black friday its only 30 dollars and ubisoft is updating the game free constantly with story dlcs
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"They will probably all be on sale Black Friday except red dead which will maybe get a $10 discount 5 years from now, but only if you buy the Bigfoot card pack edition. "
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,They‚Äôll release it in a few months for the extra revenue just like they did with GTA V
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,You should check origins it has as much details as red dead ubisoft dumbed it down because pc can't handle it
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,Ac odyssey has on lootboxes they all cosmetics and you can get them all by playing the game and ubisoft is giving seven free single players story dlc and hundred dlc mercenary and ships to fight story dlc wait until  red dead online microtransaction and red dead has microtransaction too
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,Buy it in black friday 30 dollars only and microtransaction has no affect on your gameplay

9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,It is
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,It's not actually a vs 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"So you‚Äôve never actually played it, just watched it on streams, and we‚Äôre supposed to care about your opinion?"
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Ac odyssey is an rpg it has 9 different ending side quests affect main story also so
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,And AC Odyssey is amazing.
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,You appear to be in the minority with that opinion.
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,how in the world would you say rdr2 is perfect?
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,origins and odyssey are friggen amazing
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Everything you just said is wrong.
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Oh it was made for 5 years with 800 people talking about odyssey and odyssey bitch slaps entire assassin creed franchise and my opinions i have waymore fun playing odyssey that red dead or witcher 3 combined   
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,If you only do the quests with the ! on the map you skip the pointless quests 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,yeah nothing beats putting some dynamite into a shitpile and blowing it up and cover a npc in it to get him mad 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Because some side quest are procedure created like bethesda game
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"Nothing in RDR2 is hard to fight. The bounty hunters don't act functionally different than any other enemy other than they might have slightly better aim. They ride horses the way other enemies do, they take cover and pop out the way other enemies do and are killed the exact same way other enemies ~~do~~ are.

RDR2, while incredibly fun, is incredibly easy even without aim assist/dead eye."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"AC: Odyssey is much better. With Origins I didn't feel any connection to the storyline, yeah Bayek lost his son, but the targets we hunted down were kind of generic.

I won't spoil anything, but Odyssey is a more personal story involving family.

The graphics are an upgrade to Origins, the main characters look much better IMO, and the regular NPC's are acceptable. Plus the more varied environments look gorgeous."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Ubisoft is better at making ac and odyssey is waymore fun than any rockstar games and red dead redemption 2 is fake hdr ac odyssey graphics > red dead graphics
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Giving you an up vote because what you have described is fairly spot on about the game for me.
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"I'm not too far into AC:O - just got to Athens not too long ago, but the AI in the game is a real problem for me. I'll be taking a fort and trying to stealth kill enemies only to find that an enemy I already killed, respawned. Or I'll be doing a simple kill this person quest, accidentally hit a civilian and before I know it there whole town is after me including their livestock and the bounty hunters just continually roll in.

&#x200B;"
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,You can literally turn it off
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Invasive UI? Wtf you talking about?
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,On the other hand RDR2 is too minimal. Those little circles are hard to read. It's hard to tell your health from a quick glance. Sometimes traditional UI is better.
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"You can set it up to go away when your not in combat. Personally I use the eagle and map and don't track any quests, there is literally 0 UI on screen when I explore and it looks amazing. "
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Which can be tweaked. Just like tweaking this individual item and interact button to be faster than the plot in RDR2.
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,There is a life bar I think. Many games seem to have one of those. 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Red Dead Online is not out yet.

9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,Its an rpg you have to level up before going to next area have you ever played rpg in your life
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,You haven't played odyssey so shut the fuck up and ac 2> red dead 2
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Troll have you even played the game
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Odyssey is fun as shit. But if you like shitty games I guess you might not enjoy it. 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Just finished the game today without ever grinding or buying any micro-transactions. Some folks just like to find something to complain about.
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,Highest rated more like afraid of fanboys and give highest rating the game is bad lol shitty gameplay and shitty controls 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,Have you even played odyssey small islands are bigger than red dead 2 map and red dead 2 is a reskin of red dead 1
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,I wouldn't be that hard on Rockstar
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,Please don't its a game of generation even though it has bad gameplay and shitty controls can't swim under water 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,I can tell you put a lot of thought into this.
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,What? There is so much false information in your whole text... Just what man? It is obvious you never played the game. Don't make things up just so it fits your narrative of RDR2 being best game ever. Jesus man
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,You're high. Haven't spent a penny in the store and have lots of extra cosmetics stuff just have to actually work for it. If it was lame after 10hrs why the fuck you keep playing it. Just as easy to turn your console off as it is to turn in on. Ffs
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,Actually red dead 2 is boring not odyssey and red dead is filled with bugs
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"Rdr2 is absolutely incredible and it has one of the most organic and alive open world that I have ever seen. The npcs are not dummies, they react to your actions. The landscapes are beautiful and it seems that you are inside of a photograph all the time. The story and the main character are amazing. Yeah, sometimes you have to eat to recover your health and feed your horse, but believe me that when you are inside the game you are going to like those mechanics.

Is it a slow game?, yeah
Is it an incredible and immersive experience? Absolutely"
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"you can ignore hunger etc it doesnt really affect the gameplay, bounty system could use some tweaking tho you get bounties way to easy and also bad honor just by looting a corpse when nobody sees you thats dumb but the game is still great especially after you have free roam"

9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Maximum Shilling.  They get 10c from both Ubisoft AND Rockstar!
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,The point being that odyssey is a good game with similar mechanics to red dead and no one is talking about it probably.

9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,Its advertising. They are secretly on reddit too.
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,I was fully expecting that to happen and thought I missed something originally 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Whoever made this is laughing his/her ass off. I know I am reading some of these replies. 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"I feel that GTA games have been growing more forgiving with their health system compared to the original trilogy on the ps2. In those games, you were screwed if you lost some health before you started a mission. And you better make sure you don't take too much damage."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"Honestly, I think Odyssey's wanted system would work well for RDR2. The more notoriety you have, the more bounty hunter are on your tail. If you stay in an area for a while, they hear tell of your presence and start to show up, but are searching for you and don't know exactly where you are, just the general area. If the local guards witness a crime, they'll be on your tail but after you escape it's just the bounty hunter issue. Could probably use some tweaks for RDR2, but I like the general premise."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"What most ruins the 'hyper realism' for me is trying to get a jump on a group of bounty hunters by posting up on a ridge a mile away and picking them off with a sniper, but the fucking ***femtosecond*** that bullet hits the dude's head, all of his buddies are granted celestial omniscience and their arms twist and fire *directly at me* before their heads even turn to look in my direction. Realism my ass."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,">The Law system is not realistic at all.

Kills 7 people in the middle of town

*Bounty: $7.50*"
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"RDR2 really fucked up the law system. Last night I came across one of the two guys who sets up bottles and asks you for a friendly shooting competition. We started, and I shot four bottles. Well, a farm worker saw US shooting and told the law on ME. So suddenly I have like 6 lawmen coming down on me (and my bounty is only about $50 anyway) for what? Friendly competition?

As soon as you do ANYTHING the game will punish you mercilessly. "
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"This!!! I get that they're going for a land that is embracing the law (as said in the intro), but it is kinda odd that the prequel (rdr2) has a lot more lawfulness than the sequel (rdr) set even further ahead. It really makes me mad and pulls me out of the immersion. Guy bumped into me in Saint Denis and so I antagonized him (basically said fuck off) and he goes running to the police. Luckily I got a ""move along"" but it was still bullshit that it happened to begin with. Like what kind of 2nd grade bullshit is this??? I'm going to tell on you for telling me to fuck off.

Your suggestion would make much more sense."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"For paying off your bounty, one guy actually told me ""I'll let everyone know by morning"" which was actualyl kind of cool. I agree with your other points though, despite thoroughly enjoying the game"
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,The stuff you mention early on would heavily detract from gameplay if it were more realistic. 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Ugh. 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,So more like Sentinels than Borg. 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,I actually like that idea
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"I knocked someone over, got a $5 bounty, and the law is shooting at me."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"They didn't mean the gameplay is realistic.  They meant the setting and story are authentic Western US for that era.  The comparison was between RDR's setting, and AC:O's fantasized historical setting."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"Also, everyone is a fucking hero, even if you have the draw on them, it feels like. I will allow that it makes a certain amount of sense for the civvies to ""be brave"" when it is literally the entire town, versus you though. I mean, even if they would individually be afraid, collectively that would seem like pretty good odds. I mean, it's not necessarily because you have dead eye, but it can get hairy. There are times I've simply thought better of it and left because it wasn't fucking worth it. 

&#x200B;

That or I just left for a bit, waited for the lawmen to calm down some, and then rode back into a likely looking spot in town and robbed someone again. I just kind of did that in Valentine to get the Bandit challenge for holding up townsfolk, preying on the ones hanging out near their houses at the edge of town. "
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Yeah the NPCs in both GTA V and RD2 are way more aggressive than in the other games. Like one time I hog tied a dude who pick-pocketed me and then picked him up and they accused me of kidnapping then immediately tried to kill me and I ended up with a $130 bounty.
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"Not to mention I fucked up once badly in valentine and now have a bounty of over 500 dollars which I'm not even gonna pay off cause its retarded high. So everywhere I'm wanted I remain wanted and just deal with the bounty hunters or get killed by them, either way it doesn't really matter. "
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,"See and I've found the opposite. I'm still only in Valentine, probably not even 10 hours on the game. But I've definitely shot and killed 3 men in town and just walked away no problemo.

First time was my mistake. Guy was assaulting a woman. I yell to stop. He comes to attack. I hit R2 cause I had it set to fists. Well. I didn't realize in closeup it changes melee to circle. I drew, shoved the gun under buddies jaw, and blew the top of his head off. Wanted came up, investigating, etc. I just looted him and walked away.

Second was two O'Dirscol boys mugging a guy. I just walked up and blew em both away. I looted em, got just outside the circle, even watched the sheriff walk over and look. Then after the wanted thing went away, rode right past the sheriff saying hello, not a peep.

If anything, it's insanely easy to get away with crimes. "
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,Yeah sure but what about shrinking HoRse BaLLs
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Semi-auto shotgun for the win. Oh I love that baby

9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,We all agree that hyper realistic is a poor description. 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,Yeah just don't call it hyper realistic. 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"Well, semi spoilers, but there absolutely is a part where you get an infection and stay in bed for weeks or months (judging by beard growth) but it just does a time skip though so you're not playing through that part."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,Project Zomboid is more fun than it sounds
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"unless the bullets aren't hitting you, and its like Uncharted where the red indicates your luck is running out and you're going to be shot soon!  

yeh, nah.  

plus I don't know whats going on, I'm later on in the game now and I swear enemies have turned into bullet sponges now that weren't in the earlier part of the game - 5 shots with revolver to the torso and they get right back up and keep shooting at me..  not sure if anyone else has pointed that out or if I am imagining it "
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"I don't think he was bitching, just responding that is not in fact *hyper realistic* which you seem to agree with as well."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"When people talk about realism in games usually it's verisimilitude they're talking about, not actual realism, but that doesn't mean they aren't making worthwhile points about verisimilitude. It is a thing, and in a game like RDR2 it's an important part of the experience. And saying that RDR2 is 'just another fantasy game' is ignoring that this is a spectrum. It's clearly more grounded in a sense of reality and of historical representation than, well, Assassin's Creed Origins.

Verisimilitude and realism is an especially important distinction because in media the appearance or feeling of realism and actual accuracy are often at odds. For example, when gore is represented realistically in movies people often perceive it as fake looking. "
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,I would say it's a historical fiction game.

Project Stream worked great. I finished the entire game with very few hiccups. I was thoroughly impressed by the system - but as long as Comcast is my provider, it's simply not feasible to continue with it. 

We have a fiber provider getting ready to roll out here ""soon"", so we'll see if they offer me a viable alternative. "

9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"Ppl underestimate ubi, they make great games, with alot of bugs, sure, but great nonetheless. Take rainbow six siege, AC. Origins and Odyssey..."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Its builds off of Origins and is all around way better. It's like Origins on steroids. 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"Combat is more in depth, 5 armor slots to equip gear you find in the world, larger world, different setting, good story, rpg mechanics."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"Origins was basically the beta for this game tbh.

They play very similar except odyssey tightened the bolts.  There are more rpg mechanics, more equipment that does different things, more quests, more interesting story even though I enjoyed the story in origins.

Combat feels better and its slightly faster.  They removed almost nothing from origins but added a ton"
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"I finished Origins and were skeptical as you on the same reason, I was pleasantly surprised on how much I am enjoying Odyssey. To put it simply, Odyssey is a huge improvement on Origins gameplay mechanics, also, the world is such an eye candy. However, I find Origins has a more compelling story than Odyssey."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,"If you just finished Origins, wait a little bit to play this one. There won't be an AC coming out in 2019 so unless you're really feeling like playing another long AC, wait a couple of months so you're not so fatigued. The game is pretty damn good but playing these two back2back might feel like a grind since they're both long games that pay similar to each other that are just set in different eras. Odyssey does improve on a lot like combat but they feel quite the same."

9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,You obviously have no idea how PCs work. RDR2 is perhaps the best looking game to be released for console. It's on par with a lot of PC games. I say this as someone who owns a PS4 Pro and a high end PC. Once they release it for PC it's going to be hard to beat.
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,"Not in single player, nor will it affect the game like the shitshow grindfest AC Odyssey is. "

If friends said they could only get one of the two big open world games and asked me which one to choose my answer would definitely change from person to person. Maybe they made this simple cheat sheet for all the people who aren't my friends that still need advice.
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Yeah bit in those games you also didn't die if you fell a few feet. 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Maybe to do with game world size?
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"In saying ""Original Trilogy"" do you think the series *started* with GTA3?"
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"I also love being able to kill the ""bounty payer"" to wipe your bounty away in Odyssey."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"Well I haven't played Odyssey but crime was also treated pretty differently in 430bce compared to the 1890's. Way different for guards to be able to track a person down. But I will say that in RDR2 it's definitely not the most realistic thing. But it's not like lawmen just wander aimlessly for you, they set up roadblocks on roads and bridges. I do agree that it gets annoying how they just know where you are always if you are in the current wanted zone in a chase"
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"That's something I've been wanting for a long time.  In a game like Far Cry or Red Faction: Guerrilla, where there's a large map dotted with enemy bases, that when you get wanted levels the enemies should have to ""spawn"" in those bases and have to converge on your last known location, rather than just magically showing up."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"How is that different from RDR2? That's exactly how it works....

&#x200B;

Step 1: Commit Crime

Step 2: Witness tells lawman.

Step 3: Lawman begins search in area of reported crime.

Step 4: lawman give up and you become wanted.

Step 5: Bounty hunters ride around state, looking for wanted criminals. (they're always doing this)

Step 6: Bounty Hunters see you and try to take you down.

Step 7: The more crimes you commit and bounty hunters you kill, then the higher your bounty, the more bounty hunters looking for you, and the more vicious they become.

&#x200B;"
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"In odyssey they still show up almost immediately after you became wanted and follow you to hell and back, unless you trigger some mission areas"
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,"That'd be cool that the longer you stay in the area, the more likely they are to catch up with you. Esp how in the game Dutch keeps insisting to keep moving to avoid the law and bounty hunters."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,"> The more notoriety you have, the more bounty hunter are on your tail. If you stay in an area for a while, they hear tell of your presence and start to show up, but are searching for you and don't know exactly where you are, just the general area. If the local guards witness a crime, they'll be on your tail but after you escape it's just the bounty hunter issue.

Isn't this exactly how the bounty system works in RDR2?"
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"I thought i was smart getting a scoped rifle and hiding up a cliff...

The moment i shot someone i was wanted and had a bounty placed on me."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"I hate that you get a bounty for assault if you accidentally run into someone, super annoying. Also if someone shoots at you first you shouldn't lose honor for killing them."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,And the wanted system was already a joke in GTAV. Shoot a guy on the top of Mt Chiliad and you still end up with a wanted level. That's stupid enough for modern times so why would they think that it would work for 150 years ago when if someone didn't see you commit the crime you would get away with it?
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"That's something that always got me about games with notoriety systems.

That's ok and fine, but your comment completely missed my point. 

I'm not talking about verisimilitude, or realistic visuals (light refraction, textures, high poly, realistic physics, sounds etc). I'm specifically talking about *historical accuracy*, which is something a lot of ""gamers"" suddenly started to be whiny about recently, gleefully ignoring that ""historical accuracy"" was never a thing at all in the first place - except for a few fringe cases like on Oregon Trail.  
It's almost like they're using ""historical accuracy"" as means to complain about other unrelated things..."

 Neither of them talk like a normal human being. She clearly states that she doesn't believe him when he says that he didn't ""throw her off a fucking cliff"" and then they don't even talk about it.

Crazy nuts. It gets so much worse, if you decided to kill your father she calls you a hypocrite for acting ""all high and mighty"", then all Alexios says is ""I DoNt CaRe wHaT YoU tHiNk"" and doesn't explain a damn thing. He killed his father because he murdered guess who!? KASSANDRA! DON'T YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO MENTION? Just sayin...

The good:

* The story so far is very engaging, I like that it's much less time spent outside of the animus, as the historical bits are the core of the game and those shine through very well.

* I quite like the levelling system and progression, it take the series into a much more traditional bordering on mmo style of rpg. Getting shiny new gear feels rewarding.

* Ship combat is still good, the feel is reasonably close to Black Flag, though of course the lack of cannons reduces you to 'Arrows : Javalins : Ram' but is entertaining enough. The action of cleaving a ship in half with your ram is immensely satisfying.

* The adrenaline combat system is fun and gives you plenty of options both to earn and spend in combat, each skill has a situation that I've found a use for so far.

The bad:

* The 'difficulty' of combat is much more centered around health spongy enemies it feels like. Spending 5 minutes parrying/dodging/countering something because it's 2 levels higher than you isn't a terribly fun time. In spite of it, there isn't any real challenge that I've found. Sure I've died a few times, but most of those have been due to a bug causing my health bar to vanish, and I wasn't aware I was getting low. I'll also add that it's unbelievably disappointing to sneak into someone's tent as they sleep, pull out your spear, slash their throat with all your might, then have them get up and start fighting you. All of my wat.

* In spite of levelling, the zones level with you. It limits the amount of progression that I actually feel, as it seems that levelling is simply a way to gate off certain territories rather than a means to feel like you're improving yourself.

* Bounty hunters seem like an attempt to rip off the best part of Middle Earth: Shadow of War's nemesis system to a degree. It fails to capture what that system did right though, because I can't remember a single one of them and I've killed around 50.

I've not tried Project Stream, but I was an early adopter of OnLive - micro console and all.

It wasn't ready for prime time - it was a concept far ahead of the technology and infrastructure needed to support it.  

Graphics and game play - for most people - were inferior to actual local play.

I wanted it to succeed, but I ended up rebuying everything on Steam.  "

9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,Pretty sure that not killing Nikolaos probably changes that scene. 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"I bought jack shit. My brother bought it, and I decided to give it a try. "
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"Oh, i prefer both, and generally lean more on the Story side of things. I just don't like the story either. I've never found Rockstar's preoccupation with criminal stories particularly engaging and can't get attached to their characters. Their choice in settings also fails to captivate me. "
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"Yeah, but that ""touch"" was in the first game. In fact the core gameplay is almost identical to the first one.

Obviously no mortal can argue that it's bad, but I refuse to jump on the band wagon and call it perfect. If a GTA release innovated that little, people would be outraged. I guess nobody played the first one lol.

(And I get it, it looks amazing, best graphics and physics ever, i get it)"

9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"Here is your problem. You're trying to compare an RPG with action elements, to an action game with RPG elements.

Aside from having huge maps to explore and melee combat, they are different. The Witcher 3 puts more focus on the storylines, and how your decisions can shape the world. AC: Odyssey focuses on action, and the storyline and quests are good, but nothing compared to Witcher 3.

Both games are great, you don't have to shit on W3 just because you didn't like it."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"You sound like your being very biased just because you adore AC, I used to at one point l. Each to their own opinion but you can't slate 2 other games where the public know and the official game companies know they are better than AC"
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,[deleted]
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"I dont see GTA Online on that list. I dont even see Red Dead Online on that list.

I see 2 box priced games, one legitmate, one masquerading in poor attempts to suck the gaming market dry with dumb consumerism."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,No I don't what? From that response I can gather that you're clearly an idiot.
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,Dude I have odyssey and the wanted system is also pretty messed up. As soon as you commit a Crimean front of someone like miles away from civilization it‚Äôs immediately recorded even if you kill the other person. Simply it‚Äôs immediate bounty
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,"I mean arguably, if you're that big of a bounty wouldn't you attract hunters from across the country? "
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,">it's impossible to lose them within the region.

Idk about that at all. I have experienced no trouble escaping from lawmen at all. Bounty Hunters pose a bit different of a challenge, but having to leave a region to get them off your tail doesn't seem like an issue at all with respect to how the game sets up the entire plot based on that premise."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"Maybe you have to play as someone else (son/partner/family member) until you break him out or he is released.   


That would be great fun"
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,I agree.
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Yeah I agree that the lawmen throwing up roadblocks like their badges are cell phones is ridiculous.
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,It's a honest mistake on R* part and it's the only glaring historical inaccuracy in regards to weapons I've seen. Not many people know the A5 wasn't produced until 1902 and the wikipedia page doesnt mention it. The game ends in 1911 so it's not a huge deal anyway.
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Pretty sure he means the Mausers. The Midnight pistol is a variant
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Depending on how you go about 1 of the side missions you can get the Midnight Mauser from a gunslinger before unlocking the ability to buy a Mauser in the shop. 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"haha yeah, pistols are much better than revolvers in this game but the revolvers are much more fun


I mostly went for the midnight and mauser pistols due to the rate of fire and ammo capacity giving me the ability to shoot 20 shots in one deadeye because then i can clear an entire area of enemies in a very short time



Body shots are really bad tho, gonna take a couple of shots then"
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"I know, I meant in general since it seemed like you were defending the use of ""hyper realistic"" in the games description. Like the guy you're referring to when you say ""these people"" didn't say that he wanted it to be hyper realistic either, just that it was a bad term to use in the first place. "
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"Not 100%, but yes it absolutely feels like it. Either that or they have smaller heads or something, but the Murfree guys are pretty strong"
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"In RDR (memory is fresh because I just played through it last week) they absolutely increased potency as the game progressed.  It went from Rookie to All-Madden once I crossed into Mexico. 

Just started RDR2 yesterday but fully expecting a similar increase in NPC difficulty. "
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"I like the bolt action for hunting, but the damage isn't worth it, thats why i actually use another rifle, that sure, it might need to be reloaded every shot, but it kills in 1 shot anyway. "
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"I loved Origins but am less excited about playing Odyssey because the setting isn't as interesting to me. I'll probably pick it up at some point, though."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,"As annoying as I initially found the level scaling the world does, it's grown on me the longer I've played. I'm at about the same level as you are, maybe a little further. The reason I've started to like it is the scaled areas are around two levels below you making them relatively easy but not a waste of time gear/xp wise. 

The last game, origins, didn't have the world scaling and if you got 3-4 levels past a zone there was pretty much no reason to ever go back there. Enemies would be trivial and xp for quests from that zone would be incredibly low compared to what you'd be getting from appropriate quests. But in odyssey since reward xp also scales I find myself going back to earlier areas and doing side quests/camps/forts/whatever that I may have skipped as the reward is still worth your time.  "
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"Agreed, the visuals, story, and just how big and beautiful the world is, I hope they do a version where we can learn about what we are seeing.  The combat is the only jank I have for this game. Ship battles are fun too."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,"I agree with you, the sponginess is my biggest detractor by far, I generally consider that a bad mechanic and it feels extra out of place in an AC game. I would put the mmo-iness of it in the bad category, I don't care for that streamlined feel in my rpgs but that's a matter of taste. Very good game otherwise."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"You could argue it might have been popular if only people had heard of it. They didn't have the marketing budget of big players like PlayStation or Google.

I found it awesome because it let you demo full single player games before buying, totally for free, like Batman. I just wouldn't want to make it my primary gaming experience."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"Yeah most of these games are playable, aside from racing games and competitive shooters, but most people would still rather the 0 lag and perfect crispness, than the 100ms lag and mpeg compression.  But even at 100ms it's not that bad, it's basically equivalent to vsync lag which consoles have built in anyway. 

I can tell you what it's perfect for though, is turn based strategy games. Civ 6 is just begging to be streamed remotely (and I do that all the time with the ""stream your PC games to your tablet"" services)"
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,You were locked at 30fps? I was getting 60 here. 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,"The infrastructure wasn't there before.

I am using 15Gb/hr while playing, it's a ton of bandwidth.  There has been advances in other network tech that helps with latency and load balancing.

OnLive didn't have the infinitely deep pockets of Google bankrolling the service.

Even if Google rolled this it Nationwide for like $5/mo they could sustain it indefinitely no matter how much they are in the red.

With a high enough adoption rate, this could be the push needed get more competition in the ISP space that can deliver this level of service. (fat chance, but hey, I can hope).  Then Google can roll out their fiber network faster with more public demand.

It'll be the bookkeepers that say if it's worth it or not down the road"
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"If RDR2 Online is gonna print money the same way GTAV did, I'm not sure I want to play it."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"You can but it is WAY too brief... just a shame given they're main characters, would like a bit more.... don't mind that with random NPC but just thought there'd be more conversation with the main characters..... It's rare and brief that they come up with more background chit chat.... 

I did enjoy the sing song they did around the table or fire... and everyone getting drunk, but was surprised I couldn't drink myself into unconsciousness or something random like that bar scene"
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"I'm in no way at all in a rush, I'm taking it all in, nowhere near finished yet.... just that one point about walking speed in the camp gets a bit annoying because there is nothing else in there to immerse me, tne dialogie is so thin with the npcs"
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,I didnt dump on it i just said its not much different than origins. And origins is a great game much different than other ac crap. but odyssey is almost same as origin. 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-15,It was a joke about assasins creed origins. Sorry. 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,I wouldn't know and also that's not the point.
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Good save
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"Lol why are you being downvoted? Said something true about the game, and then followed it up with a perfectly fine subjective opinion.

RDR2 is my GOTY, but jesus christ people need to understand it isnt for everyone."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,and yet you still thought people would want to hear your opinion.
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"you do spend a lot of time on a horse, but there's so much to do in the world while you're travelling! if you just ride from point A to point B without stopping, you're gonna miss a huge portion of the game."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,God of war and spiderman is not repetitive said no one ever
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"I never said i didn't like witcher 3, but i like odyssey better"
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,You are just biased towards witcher 3 witcher 3 side quests are better than odyssey otherwise odyssey bitchslap it
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,Nah the site's and quests are all good
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,You dont now odyssey
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-25,Yes because of course they could fast travel from New York IRL back then. 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"And you don't have all the primary's weapons and attributes, a further impetus to bust then out"
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,I was more making a comment on the backlash of Battlefield 5
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"I recently found out that running around and going with the 'up yours, mofucka' attitude gives me the most fun :D Plus yeah, body shots.. With semi-auto, it doesn't really matter what gets hit, even a leg will do. "
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,"I saw it as a sort of relativity thing. Relative to a lot of games it's got more focus on realism, especially compared to this Assassin's creed. If someone asked if RDR2 would be for them I'd ask if they'd enjoy role playing as a cowboy in a Western sim featuring a slower pace and sacrificing some player friendliness in the name of realism. I could see how ""hyper realistic"" seems appropriate to some people, though I also probably think it's a poor term to chose. Just asking to get criticized and reminded of every not realistic thing in the game."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,I reckon I may need to replay RDR after I finished RDR2...
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,The side missions are where Odyssey shines for me. They‚Äôre really interesting and I often get super sidetracked just exploring and doing side quests 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"I think for us it's even far below 100ms. We're about 100 miles from Chicago and I'm guessing some of the servers they're using are located there. If not, then somewhere else nearby. It seems to me we're probably at about 50ms round trip because it's essentially imperceptible. Like I said, I was definitely surprised at the lack of input lag. Of course, that won't apply to everyone. Someone out in Wyoming will probably have a much worse experience for now."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,"Yeah, I was definitely not getting 60. I haven't played it myself in a few weeks though so maybe they've made improvements since then."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"I agree with you, but I've never played red dead online. The single player is worth the price of admission alone"
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-13,I'm not sure you'll want to play it when modders come and ruin the party.
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,True I hope they'll fix it. Walking speed adds nothing to the story or immersive imo
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,But it's actually very different. Which you would know if you played it 
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-15,I know I know..
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"> RDR2 is my GOTY, but jesus christ people need to understand it isnt for everyone.

9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"I started replaying it recently. I too am pretty amazed at how well it holds up after all this time, even coming right off the back of RDR2. 

Usually when I play an old game in a series after playing a new one, the downgraded graphics and gameplay bugs me, but this time it doesn't."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"You're clearly 12 years old, so I'm gonna stop replying to you. Have a great day"
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"I disagree. Outside interests often offer the greatest context, because they aren't really burdened by fandom or brand loyalty. And then if you have a situation where they actually enjoy something outside of their normal interests, it's an even bigger endorsement of the product. "

9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"Exactly.  It's very close, like maybe the biggest difference is the amount of colors and shadows from then to now. Mechanically it's very similar.

‚ÄòHey. I‚Äôm a dog. I don‚Äôt like cats.‚Äô
‚ÄòThis cat is bad. I don‚Äôt like him‚Äô 

Is what people are getting at I think. "
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"yes but in this case you don't like cowboy stuff, you don't like rockstar, and you don't like the game. what a surprise, great insight was gained from your opinion."
9wdy01,2018-11-12,2018-11-12,"well originally you said you didn't like how much time you spent on a horse, which is what i responded to. then you said there werent any interesting locations which i also responded to. now you're saying that it's not your type of game and prefer fantasy settings which is kind of a different discussion. you can't criticise the game for lacking content just because it's not the type of content you enjoy."

d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,BIG. BOAH.
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,PROTIP: Salmon taste awful when they're spawning.
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,Nobody ever accused Rockstar of being lazy. They have a fine attention to detail.
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,"Good old General Sherman. They say he's five hundred pounds of bottom-dwelling fury, don't you know. No one knows how old he is, but if you ask me, and most people do, he's a hundred years if he's a day."
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,[I'll now proceed to pleasure myself with this fish.](https://pm1.narvii.com/6385/6d33e6f647519af6866202f583f3396abcecb258_hq.jpg)
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,"Theres just so much detail and things that are super well researched and thought out. Its just a shame that the gameplay is so weak because it is a game in the end of the day and if it doesnt feel fun to play, it isnt a good *game* at the end of the day.  
  
I just dont get how they hit it out of the park on all these small details and at the same time it feels like they glossed over basic gameplay and were like ""ehhhhh just use the exact same system that we've used for 10 years"""
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,The bears and eagles can also catch salmon in RDR2
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,"Great game, just way too slow. Only ended up playing it a couple times before I sold it"
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,W
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,Yeah that thing is a pain in the ass to catch.
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,Arthur looks  so surprised by the fish
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,Looks like the 3rd ending in bloodborne :D
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,RDR2 is a hunting/fishing sim with occasional gunfights
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,"I really want this on PC, it sounds like a great game. At least I'll have Doom Eternal and Cyberpunk 2077 to tide me over."
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,What other fish can you catch?
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,"The weight and size are way off for a Sockeye. It's just cause it's the legendary, but there has never been a Sockeye that big."
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,A King sized Sockeye? that's pretty rad.
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,Why couldn‚Äôt that game last forever?
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,The ocelot eats the salmon.
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,never wanted to play but now I do
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,"I'm still so mad I didn't catch my last legendary fish. I think the catfish? Out on the prison island. I can not for the life of me get a boat that can get me there. I've spent hours searching for one at the end of the game and post game. Loading, reloading, running up and down the coast. Can't swim that far. The boats that I see people using online simply don't populate for me."
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-13,Do you need the sinking lure?
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-11,Thanks for including the title of the game in your title!
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,that is one thicc salmon
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,"There are also trees, which is really cool because real life has trees!

I don't get the point of this title or why it was upvoted so much."
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-11,spoilers man
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-11,Took break from this...the hunts and all the extra stuff felt like a fucking chore
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-11,Question. What kind of bear is best?
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-11,Salmon don't 'mate' they spawn
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-11,I finally finished the main storyline a couple days ago. After i got to 85% I took a long break. Didn't miss much
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-11,I bought that game because the little details like that really impressed me. Sucks everything else about it is pretty awful.
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-11,Suicide Salmon is my favorite DC comics series
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-11,"This is also accurate. Salmon die after mating at this phase of life and can often be found beached. That's why the bears congregate, the salmon are exhausted before mating and die shortly after."

d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,I shot my legendary Moose in the river and he sank.. very deep.

d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,"Really? In mine it swam so far under the solid ice that I couldn't even bait it out, so I threw in dynamite and blew it up and then it disappeared."
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,It's like the opposite of The Salmon of Wisdom.
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,My legendary moose did the reverse. Ran into deep water and flopped over dead.
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,I was today years old when i realized thats why id come across a mangy animal sometimes
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,Doubt I‚Äôll get to play for a while. What‚Äôs in the cave?
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-11,"I'm still only on chapter 2.  I don't think I'll ever finish the game, I get distracted by gambling and hunting and exploring and enjoying the scenery.  *sigh*"

d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-11,"My ending was him just being left alone on the ridge to watch the sum rise, god damn that was a great ending."
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-11,I think we all did.
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,I cried for his horse too :( RIP sweet boah
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,"*May I . . .*

*Stand unshaken*"
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,"It had the best story, but it‚Äôs open-world just felt kind of flat after that. There‚Äôs a bunch of hunting and random shit to do, but so many places with no story or explanation as to what they are. Definitely not as fun to explore as Skyrim or Oblivion. Prettier, but just less to do. Hopefully Cyberpunk scratches that true open world itch."
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,I cried when my horse died
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,It‚Äôs in my top 3 just behind Witcher 3 and BOTW. Graphics tho red dead is number 1.
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,"I got so attached to Arthur i stopped playing the game because I don't want to see him die.  I still don't know how it ends, stopped at the beginning of Chapter 6."
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,"Is it weird that I didn't get attached to Arthur like I got attached to Marston in RDR1? The entirety of RDR2 just felt like a shoehorn setup to give the reigns to John. You play this guy who's constantly doing what's best for his 'family', but claims he isn't a good person, following a man (Dutch) who trusts a person who literally entered their lifes a few months prior more than Arthur or John who have been in the picture for decades! It just... I don't know, the ending didn't sit well with me. It didn't feel like Arthur received redemption. He helped John escape, sure, and helped people along the way... but I didn't get the same feeling of hurt like when John came out of the barn doors.

That being said, that scene with the horse at the end with Arthur? That made me tear up. I had that horse from when I bought him proper in the stables early on... killed me that the horse died."

d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,I may have played dominoes for an hour last night.
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,"online has just been such a let down.  I have no issue with people being dickheads online, or even some of the money grabbing practices rockstar are forcing into their games more and more.  Its just the absolute lack of anything to do that ruins it for me.  I play with friends online quite a bit, we play for a bit just running around or capture some wagons and then thats it

&#x200B;

could have been such a great thing and they fucked it completely"
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,"Me as well, I thought I enjoyed uncharted 4 when it first came out. I tried to play it again after finishing rdr 2 for the second time. Didn't work. I'm still roaming around even though I've got not much to do anymore"
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-11,Which bear is best?
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,"You need a legendary lure. You won't catch it without it. Once you have that you'll get it pretty easily. I didn't have any trouble catching any of the legendary fish, except that damn channel catfish... Spent hours fishing for that thing before I looked it up."
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,Sockeye turn dark red the most consistently. This is supposed to be a legendary fish remember.
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-11,Both legendary bass are world records.

d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,"I think it's because it's such a dramatic epic, and they tried to go for a historically accurate and realistic setting, that they do not want to turn the game over to the modding community. Skyrim's perennial success might be the last thing Rockstar wants for their Western epic"

d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,I enjoyed it. The mechanics work great and I thought it was better than fishing in Farcry 5. My only complaint is that it's too easy and the fish bite too quickly. I also didn't find much use for the current bait. Lures catch almost anything. I only used cheese when I wanted to specifically catch blue gill for predator bait.
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,No.
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-14,I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought of that.
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-11,Yeah I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to be able to play it now.
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-11,Is this an office joke?
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,They should try mating. After dating. At least twice.
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-11,Excuse me
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-11,Care to elaborate?
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,What do you find awful about it? Cant say this without something to justify

d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,Am I... a salmon?
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,"*sits down at campfire* i got a moose story too .... see i reckon it wasnt as exquisite as yours (in fact it was a regular western moose) however it was my first moose (pristine pelt), and oh boy spottin a moose was hard to come by ........ needed some moose chaps -so i pitched camp near lake owanjila, slightly northwest of strawberry. was on the prowl for a moose waited 6 days; to pass the time each day i hunted some beavers, waterfowl.... then finally a moose showed up, grabbed my bow equipped my improved arrows \*perfect shot, falls into lake\* when i walked away the moose kept on resurfacing, reproach it, it sunk (it did this repeatedly) *spits on ground* see that moose, even in the afterlife, was out for redemption *dramatic clip of moose finally sinking down as Arthur walks away the last time Dead Moose Redemption Fin*"

d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,"Yup. The game was too big for me, as in too much detail. Whenever I wanted to do a mission it took me hours because everything distracted me and I got sidelined all the time.

I really did not play the game for long. Which is a shame really. I'm sure it's a great game."
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-11,The last couple missions with long rides with the music playing out as you ride across the map were some of the strongest moments I‚Äôve felt in gaming.
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-11,Yeah that broke my heart. I haven‚Äôt played any of the epilogue yet because I don‚Äôt want to play as anyone but Arthur.
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,There is a really nice cut scene dedicated to Arthur when you complete 100%. But I was so God damn pissed off from the ridiculousness of the gambler challenges that it didn't have the effect on me I'd hoped for
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-11,Mine too. That's what made me cry like a 5 year old
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,Wait he dies?!?!?!?
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,Dude walk around. I like blasted through the story which is nice because after the epilogue there's a bunch of stranger missions and shit to discover. Plus challenges to meet and tons of neat little details.
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,"Same here. I did most of the stuff except for some legendary animals or fish. The game was 88% complete after I got the epilogue. I worked on mostly challenges, but yeah, it did feel flat pretty quickly since I had to ride across the world to find a damned wild horse or cougar."
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,You have to finish it. Doing the prologue as john makes the game that much better.

It just depends on where you catch them. Out in the ocean they are still good. Once you hit fresh water they are in their spawning mode neglecting their bodies and literally decomposing as they swim up stream. Smells like dead/decomposing fish along streams for quite a while."

d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,"I've been having this problem with other open world games lately. It's like, why am I playing this, in a world where Red Dead Redemption 2 and Breath of the Wild exist? It's like going back to the last generation of games. I've seen what we're capable of in the open world genre, and now everything else just feels simplistic and lazy."

Plus, even on my first play through, I got to a point where I knew what was gonna happen, so I put off the epilogue as long as possible. Just wasn‚Äôt ready. The challenges are tedious after a bit, and the legendaries were pretty formulaic. There where a bunch of seeming mysteries, like the aliens, the giant, the star map, the vampire, and more that were just so surface. I wanted them to be more explored, and have Arthur react more to his strange world."

d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,That and the head injury from the tram crash in St Denis.
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,Nah. Dutch was a self centered narcacist the whole time. That shit only comes out when things go bad though.
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,"The mission getting Micah is one of the most powerful video game scenes I‚Äôve ever experienced. When Micah‚Äôs goons discover you right after Sadie gets hurt.

I was ready to go into battle my damn self after that scene. I hit the gym instead."
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-16,Hey I took your advice and I‚Äôm in the second chapter of the epilogue. It‚Äôs been good so far.
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,"Based on karma. I prefer the bad ending to Arthur on the ridge. It's more brutal, tragic, and befitting of the western tone."
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,Yeah 4 different outcomes you can choose
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,Ahhh. Gotcha. I'm hoping that means there's more to come on those. I thought it was pretty cool to have unexplained mysteries. My biggest curiosity is the panoramic map I found while hunting the bison.
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-11,Identity theft is a crime!
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,Because non of rockstar's previous PC ports have ever allowed mods. GTA V had the controversy for banning people who used mods. Just because games are ported to PC does not automatically mean it will get added mod support either...Porting to PC means porting the game to PC. It doesn't mean adding extra features. PC ports are the exact same game as the console version.
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-13,It‚Äôs part of a quest I think. Where the indian is scamming the mining town.
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,It was so realistic. A guy just being a complete asshole the whole time and well-intentioned people in charge refusing to see it or do anything about it.
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,That's a thing??
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,"The [music](https://youtu.be/9Y9wuCyMkFk) that begins in that very moment is one of my favorite pieces from a AAA game. So powerful and epic, perfect build up to the final showdown."
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,"There are 4 endings. Good, bad, sad and secret. I recommend to play all 4 of them, but if you don't want to spend the time then watch those on youtube, they are pretty much perfect."
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,"Yeah, that was the most major one. The running theory is it leads you to the Mt. Cann Alien."
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-11,MICHAEL?!?
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,">Because non of rockstar's previous PC ports have ever allowed mods.

GTA IV is stacked with mods.

But I wasn't aware that developers and distributors had the ability to control whether a PC game could use mods or not. Thanks for pointing that out"
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,"I don't think it's been confirmed by the writers, but it's a great theory that fits just right. Also the game is so detailed and tight, that any explicit detail like that is typically not a coincidence

Following Dutch commenting on getting his head hit, dizzy, can't see straight, he really starts to spiral out of control from then on"
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-11,MICHAEL!!
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,So is GTA V now but that wasn't rockstar's intention. At least it isn't now. I'm not 100% sure about GTA IV but it was actually pretty controversial that GTA V was anti mods
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,"He starts to spiral out of control once Hosea dies. Hosea was Dutch's moral compass. Once Hosea was out of the picture, Dutch didn't have a second opinion and Micah was feeding him ideas."
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-12,"100%, the whole game is so archetypically sound ! Hosea was wisdom and caution, once he died so did cautious rationale.

This is more of a hypothetical question, but RDR2 illustrates it so perfectly; when do you know an institution or a society is corrupt and dying ? When it starts to consume it's young. When did we start feeling the walls close in around the Dutch Van Der Linde gang? The ambushes in Rhodes and in St Denis"
d2t20g,2019-09-11,2019-09-13,"To be fair, the ambush in Saint Denis was due to a rat, something Dutch probably couldn't have predicted. 

I was really surprised that the Grays knew who the gang was, I genuinely thought Dutch was playing them quite nicely. 

During my second playthrough I noticed that Dutch was very loose almost from the beginning. He's always panicky and doesn't have a concrete plan in place at any stage. In my mind, he made a mistake moving South after Valentine, it was very easy to predict and no one would have seen it coming if they moved closer to Blackwater i.e Strawberry."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"Yeah, it's an amazing game. And it's one of the rare open world games that gets better and better. It truly build and builds to an epic finale of bad assery."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"If you are still on Chapter 2, take your time.  There are quests that can only be done on this chapter from the camp gang members and they‚Äôll ask you to do them from time to time while at camp.  The quest you want to do is Pearson‚Äôs because he gives you something cool you can‚Äôt get any other way in the game.  Not trying to spoil and I might even Google how to activate this quest because it‚Äôs worth getting imo."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"The number of times I accidentally played hunting and fishing simulator in that game for far longer than I‚Äôd like to admit was astounding. 

I‚Äôm gonna redownload it and play it. Thanks OP"
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"A few friends and I used to play it online.  Hysterical.  Having five or six shirtless cowboys all riding on the same Conestoga wagon right off a cliff.  Good memories. 

We would also ""Red Dead"" each other's houses when we visited--leave every cabinet and drawer open in the kitchen...."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,Literally one of the greatest games of all time.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"Honestly, there are enough side quests that you can occupy most of your time without touching the main quest. It's really impressive."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"The animations turned me off at first. Then I realized I've been looking at it the wrong way - I wanted it to be GTA but with cowboys, but it's basically cowboy outlaw life simulator. I learned to appreciate the animations, even skinning became satisfying to me."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,One of the top 5 games  I‚Äôve ever played. And I‚Äôve been gaming for 30 years
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"I just did something similar and was blown away, even with it being 5 years old. Agree with everyone else saying not to rush. 

There are moments where it ascends to a level of high art vs just playing a game in the score, environments and story presentation. 

Easily jumped into my all time greatest games list."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"be careful playing this game. i can no longer enjoy other, similar games. i recently bought Cyberpunk on sale. first thing i did was stare at and even walk into NPC's, and they did nothing. it felt like i was in a room of cardboard cutouts."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,The only game where I sometimes feel bad for shooting npc's
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"What I wouldn‚Äôt give to experience this game for the first time again. Take your time, explore, enjoy."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,Also just purchased and currently waiting for it to download. Pretty dang excited for this one. Idk if a game could get hyped any more
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,Yeah this game makes most other open world games feel like an empty wasteland even in cities.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"I also started playing this game and two of the most memorable moments I had in this game weren‚Äôt even part of any quest but just random events which I could have easily missed if I wasn‚Äôt there. 

The first one‚Äôs I was just riding when I heard someone cry for help and apparently they were being kidnapped. While chasing the riders, I heard one of them shout that I was going to steal their bounty and started shooting at me. I got that dude from those men and instead of freeing him, I took him to the sheriff and actually got paid the bounty. 

The second incident was when I was casually riding during a night-storm when a rider asked for my help and fell off his horse. He was practically begging me to take him to a doctor so I picked him up and did as he asked. When I delivered him to the doctor he paid me after which the doctor told him that he might‚Äôve to amputate his arm and gave him an anaesthetic. Once he passed out, the doctor told me to move along as I did not want to see this, but I stuck around anyways and the doctor actually started amputating that dude‚Äôs hand. Blew my mind. 

Honestly, love this game and I hope there are more moments like this. Sorry for the wall of text but I am just blown away by this game and couldn‚Äôt stop myself from sharing this. Not a native speaking so pardon my english."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"Stay out of the RDR2 forum so you don‚Äôt spoil anything. Do absolutely every side quest, pop up, etc. Take your time, hunt/fish, explore EVERYTHING. There are so many things you can do while you are playing.

This is my favorite game of all time. I only have 2.5 play throughs but I put like 200+ hours in my first one and still didn‚Äôt 100%."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"Remember to smoke as many cigarettes as possible, for realism"
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"Kind of game where I would open the game, look at the map and decide to go to x, 3 hours later I've never made it anywhere close to x!"
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,It truly is a masterpiece. Can‚Äôt wait to see what GTA 6 is gonna bring.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,My favourite game. I am jealous of you
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"The craziest part is you can walk around trying to find every detail or cutscene, and on your second play through you‚Äôll find new details you missed. On your third you‚Äôll find even more you missed. This game never fails to amaze me."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"Free advice, this game takes place before RDR1 and its equally as amazing.  Grab that one on sale too and just play through RDR2 as you are.... when you're done yu.have another amazing adventure ahead of you."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,Enjoy one of the best games ever made.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"Those guys really put a lot of effort on it  
I just hope that GTA6 will get at least 50% of attention to details that RDR2 had"
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"Once I shot a shopkeeper‚Äôs leg off and came back some time later, he was in crutches and if I remember correctly he got his leg amputated."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,Watch out for *that* cabin in the woods!
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,download the mkd so you can run in camps. that part is still hard to understand for me
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"When you find out that you actually need to listen to NPCs side conversations, for clues to solve mysteries.....that's when you really slowdown."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"So far, RDR2 is the peak of video game design. Things come close but nothing beats its. It‚Äôs quite simply incredible in all aspects"
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"I will never forget my first day playing and spending at least an hour just standing on a bridge and lassoing npc's off their horse, while almost pissing myself laughing. Fantastic game."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"I hope you got past the snowy beginning. It's the only thing I didn't like, was that it starts in a snowy mountain. But, after replaying the game again recently, the details in the snow are also amazing. I can't believe Rockstar basically abandoned this game."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,I think they said that the dialogue if in written book form would take up the space of 8 feet high.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"Playing it at the moment too because I never finished it when it came out.

Easily one of my top games ever."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"RDR2 and the Witcher III are still the pinnacle of open world gaming for me, nothing else comes close. So immersive and deep."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,I got TB sister
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,This was the first game I ever played that felt so real and so immersive that I found myself choosing to be an observer/part of the world rather than make progress through the game.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,>!Let us know if you find Gavin!<
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,Best game ever made in my opinion
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"Nice. 

Unless it's some multiplayer game or something, there is no harm in playing games a few years later for less money."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,Just want to say one thing... Don't be a bad guy.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"I've only played it on ps4 but I re purchased it on steam so I can experience it on a high end PC, my days off are about to be lit"
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"The thing which got me is that after the game is fully over it's possible to bump into characters and they have new lives and a bit of reminiscence dialogue.  It seems mad that after they put so much work into the game they said ""lets just do some more"""
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"They sadly just don‚Äôt make purely good games like Rdr2 anymore‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôm fully prepped for gta6 to be one big clusterfuck of mediocre garbage made for ‚ÄúmOdErN aUdIeNcEs‚Äù‚Ä¶

Man I hope im dead wrong but real ones know"
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"Me too! I'm streaming it if anyone wants to join sometimes (info in my profile). I'm a woman who doesn't game often, with bad adhd, so it ends up being kinda entertaining. I have such poor aim lol. 

I find myself just marveling at the world in-game. It's so lovely. 

Is there such a thing as target practice in the game? Some way to practice my aim and shooting?"
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,Gameplay wise it kind of sucks
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,[deleted]
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,It's absolute ass to play.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,It‚Äôs too bed all the missions and hunting encounters were so archaic in design with no flexibility. Standard rockstar missions with ironically no sense of freedom.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,I'll never understand the praise this game gets. It's so incredibly boring.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"Cherish it and beat it before you grow tired of slow animations and a story on ""railroads""."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,[removed]
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"I've been meaning to play it. I got it specifically so my partner and I could play it together online, but hackers were so bad I gave up one the entire thing, with even single player having a bad taste because it reminds me of how disappointing the online experience is.

We just wanted to be goofy, ride around and go fishing in pretty locations."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,It's truly a great game. One of my favorites.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"It took me four pretty lengthy attempts to get into RDR2, but I persevered, and after restarting again and again after long lapses in playing, it finally clicked and I adored it.

I really looked forward to spending my evenings getting lost in that world."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,My favorite scene in ANY game was getting drunk in the first town tavern.  Perfection.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,The difficulty turned me off at first. You can not change the difficulty.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"played it for a total if 2/3 hour on PC since 2021 but with integrated graphics I felt that I was missing a lot.

bought a PS5 Slim last week and it‚Äôs the first time game I ordered in disk version so this time I really need to finish it."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"Nice man enjoy, def one of my favorite single players story driven games I've ever experienced."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,You can the the game all you want but no one can deny that no other open world game has the same level of detail. Most npcs in games are just background and not interactive. You can chase down any npc in this game and they will react. Plus the wild life! There‚Äôs so much going on around you at any time and you can hunt them all. It really is an amazing game
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,Its a damn shame it is not 60fps on PS5
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,I should try this game again. I bailed causeci got bored early on...lassooing bandits and doing what seemed like pointless tiny quests.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"I have gotten like 50% through it three times. I can be a little bit obsessive and refuse to continue the story until my camp and items are fully upgraded. It goes the same way every time:    

1. Reach point where I unlock the 99 items bag.    
2. Get everything but moose antlers.    
3. Spend 10+ hours doing bait tricks in various locations to try and force the spawn of a male moose.    
4. Give up and lose interest in the game.    
5. Restart because I can't remember how to play.    

I  actually am starting to harbor hatred for the game. I've easily clocked in over a full day of trying to force a moose spawn and it's so fucking rare that I can't do it. I can not complete this game because they made Moose way too rare. I mean, not really... but kind of."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"The level of detail is something I haven't seen before in a game. And to such an extent that I picked up on new things going on during my whole playthrough. 

I get that the clunky movement and such was off-putting to some. But to me it just made the immersion so much better. My character couldn't roll or slide across the map or easily parkour things. He just walked, jumped and fell more like a human being would. And that was fine. To each their own."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"I started playing it again like a week ago, and i came back to it on a new video card (GTX 4090).   Everything is on Ultra settings (save for a few settings that can only go up to high) and the game is just....HHHHHgnnnnnnn, its so good.  I even went as far as downloading mods for it and upping the textures of landscape/buildings/animals etc.  Its incredible."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,My favourite ps4 game. It‚Äôs an amazing game.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,If I didn't like the first one..should I bother playing the second one?
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,The previous rdr is so much more fun to play. The unintuitive controls and tedious or even outright annoying nature of this newer one gets forgiven just because it looks so nice.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,The whole buildup after meeting Sadie in Saint Denis to the finale at the top of the ridge with the high honor ending made me ugly cry while I watched the sunrise.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"Id be down for a pa5 remaster to be honest, I haven‚Äôt played it since it first came out.

Saying that, it probably runs good still, even by todays standards- right?"
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"I started yesterday a new game. And my gosh... What a beautiful Game. The snowflakes that reflects the lanterns light. Just wow.

I'm all in again"
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,I've never played another game where I could sit down and completely lose myself for hours and hours doing nothing really. Just kind of riding around on my horse and seeing what happened. I envy you getting to experience this game for the first time.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"It‚Äôs by far the best value for a game sale I‚Äôve ever seen, $15 is criminal"

1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"I just started a new game! I played through almost the entire story and never truly finished it. Now I have to restart, but I don‚Äôt care! It‚Äôs an amazing game"
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,So I missed out by not buying during the sale?
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"I'm so jealous that you get to experience my favorite game for the first time! The finale of the Braithwaite's/Gray's questline (chapter 3) is the most epic moment in gaming history, in my opinion."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,Lol where have you been
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,The PC controls are so bad I quit the game.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"Do. Not. Rush. It

Take your time. Don‚Äôt feel you NEED to do mission after mission. Go explore the world. Go hunting. Go fishing. Go rob trains. 

There‚Äôs so much to explore in this game"
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,Pretty much the only open world game I ever go back to.  It‚Äôs not littered with Ubisoft ‚Äú?‚Äôs‚Äù all over the map.  Exploration and discovery is just spot on.  Which is impressive considering the setting is wide open ‚Äúboring‚Äù prairie land.  I often joke that the squirrels in RDR2 have better AI than npcs in other open world games.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"Hope you can fall down the rabbit hole, friend (: I could Never get into for my own reasons even after playing through it, but I do recognize that it is a beautiful game for sure"
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,It‚Äôs such a detailed and well-made world. It‚Äôs a shame it bores the shit out of me so I can‚Äôt get into it.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,I wish I could erase my memory of that game and play it over again.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"The left and the right cables are managed, the 3 pipes on the floor and the wooden board kinda tell me there's some ""remodeling"" done, and they didn't have the original installers to fix it. DIY handyman saves the day."

1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-03,"I have a lot of games back logged, been trying to figure out what to play next and I've really just been thinking about replaying RDR2 again. This post might be the deciding factor lol. It's just so good."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-03,"If only they would LET ME TURN THE PC SENSITIVITY DOWN!

Its so damn high. But i live red dead."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-03,"Wait until you get bit by a snake. That's a little too much realism for me. But I agree, one of the most awesome games of all time."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-03,"I love RDR2, but the immersion is too much. I don‚Äôt want to have to feed Arthur. Moving feels like walking through sludge. If you could give me RDR2 with the controls, Wanted system, and lack of eating system from RDR1, it would be a perfect video game."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-03,Dang. You managed to hold out this long. Respect.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-03,Still have not pulled the trigger on this game. GTA makes me nauseous. A lot of the open world games make me nauseous and it sucks
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-03,automatic fine gray numerous weary door jobless crowd nutty slap
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-03,"Such a good game. Wish it was longer, enjoyed every minute of it. Need to replay so i can 100% it but those cards are a hassle üòÇ"
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-03,"still deciding if i want to play this on my steamdeck or gaming laptop.

The laptop gets better graphics ofcourse. But i have a hard time finishing games on my laptop. I play my SD more often and its easier to pause and start a game."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,Not capitalizing on the multiplayer platform was one of the worst clusterfucks in gaming history

1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,OP if you read this there's a certain horse ride to a certain town that plays a certain song near the end and you better fucking cry
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"I kinda disagree. I felt the longer I was in the open world, the more frustrating it became. The terrible controls and outdated, boring combat became more highlighted and the incredibly restrictive fast travel was more and more annoying. The world is beautiful, but vastly empty. Having to smash a button over and over again for 10 minutes straight so my horse will move at top speed from point A to point B is such a bad design. Add to it that the only things in between those points are usually just pretty visuals and a few animals, it all became so boring after the first dozen times. 

The game is great and definitely a 9/10 for me, but the opted to exclude so many QOL features in favor of realism and immersion that was just more frustrating and irritating as time went on.

Edit: Jesus people, just because someone shares a different opinion with you doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs some deep personal attack on your entire character."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-03,Its a fucking masterpiece
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,How to trigger it? Tou can use spoiler chat function
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"Definitely look up how to trigger this, as you will never get it if you're not trying to because of the bugginess."

1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,">take your time 

No problem there considering there is no other way to play the game."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,Me but with the poker minigame. I learned how to play poker thanks to it actually
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-03,"Yeah, I unfortunately burned myself out with that and only got like a quarter through the game after a good amount of hours."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-03,"I probably spent more hours hunting, fishing, exploring and gambling than anything else. It is such a good experience."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,The red dead others houses is hilarious üòÇ
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"Its a technical and visual masterpiece with a good story. But the gameplay is slow and monotonous, combat is repetitive af"
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,Lol no
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"It‚Äôs definitely a game that you have to play ‚Äúpatiently‚Äù. Every animation, every little detail was painstakingly crafted. It can be annoying when you want to jump into the game and just speed through a session, but I liken it to a good whisky - you‚Äôre supposed to enjoy it nice and slowly."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,I was looking for a way to say this - my experience improved when I ‚Äòslipped in‚Äô to Arthur‚Äôs skin.  Would have appreciated more Sadie levels too.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"Yup. I remember near launch people were saying the horses were terrible because you couldn't just dart through the forest at a full gallop. Like bruh, that's how real life was. Once you stop with the min/max and/or speed chasing attitude, and just settle into the vibe of the game, it becomes so much more enjoyable"
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"If you park your horse on an animal corpse, it skips the animation. Huge time saver."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,What are your other 4?

1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"They‚Äôre 2 totally different games. Cyberpunk is a faster paced, action RPG. RDR2 is a slow paced, Western Simulator RPG."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"You're in for a treat, starts slow but it just gets better and better, I'm so jealous."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"What do you mean by ""so many things?"" I best the story and side quests and I didn't find much to do."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"About the sidequests, do you also mean the stuff where people shout ‚Äúhey mister!‚Äù in the middle of nowhere?

I usually just continue going where I was going, since I assume you get these quests again at some point. Is that correct?"
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,How do you smoke them
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,Oh rather. What Red Dead Redemption 3 is gonna bring becauze of GTA 6 engine!
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,GTA 6 is probably the most anticipated game of all time lol
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,I just hope GTA6 respects your time more than RDR2 did.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,Omg this was the biggest annoyance for me.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,When?
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"Nah, the gameplay is too monotonous and slow. Everything else is great though. Story also got repetitive in the middle and the combat wasn't very good."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"Like usual in Rockstar games, I spent way too much time just screwing around in the game and not advancing the main story."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-03,"I bought the game when it came out, got frustrated by the snow and I didn‚Äôt take to the controls even in the tutorial part. Ended up quitting during the first gunfight and never played it again. First time I felt ‚Äúold‚Äù while playing a game."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"To expand on that a little: Obviously you *can* be a bad guy, but the honorable path leads to some of the best story moments of any game ever made."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,Honestly this is what kept me from enjoying RDR.  Your character is fundamentally a bad person.  They can try to salvage it with honor etc.  But it‚Äôs pretty hard to avoid doing heinous shit.  I stopped playing after I stumbled in to some side scene where you come upon this house and the dad is abusive etc.  as far as I could tell you had no choice but to kill the dad AND the son.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,Just use a controller and toggle the aim assists in options.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,I'm glad I only paid $8 for it then. Now should I play it or wait for a 60fps patch...
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"There's nothing to understand. It's a slower paced game and  many people love that, some don't."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,Shut up dude let people experience it themselves
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"The online mode is just an afterthought. When people talk about how good rdr2 is, they always mean the story."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-03,LENNY!
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"you can, you can turn off auto-aim, turn off the mini-map so you rely on the pocket compass etc, play in first person only etc etc.  zero HUD is the only way i can play now."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,They could have at least made a single player dlc...
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"Still mad about no zombie mod‚Ä¶ why, Rockstar, why??"
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,Agreed. My friends and I enjoyed tf out of RDO during pandemic lockdowns. The only reason we stopped was because we finished all the content in about 3 weeks and had nothing to do but engage with other Players.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"Nothing to capitalize on. The vast majority of GTA 5 Online action happens within a small part of the map and you have incredibly fast ways to travel, there's always chaos. RDR2 map is far larger, far less dense, and everything is far slower. It just doesn't have the same energy and appeal. If people try to mean some epic RPG experience that's ultra immersive or some such that's likely far too much effort and faaaaaaaaar too niche to ever make sense financially."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,Every time I see R* posts for weekly discount on beans or whatever I just get a little sad.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"Meh, they had their money maker in gta online. 

There is only so much you can add to a western style game like to is."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-03,I didn't mind. I kinda saw it as an extended tutorial
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-03,"Imagine trying to tell people how they should feel about a game.

You cried? Great. Not everyone did. Don‚Äôt be a narcissist."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"I had the complete opposite tbh, the open world full of animals and systems and frequent as hell POIs did it for me. The story was amazing, but the open world was really unreplicated for me"
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"Im almost finished my 2nd play through. I modded it on PC.

Horse runs faster.
Instant travel to anywhere.
More blood/gore.
High jumps for Aurther. Dude can jump like 20cm in the game... Now 20m! LoL. Leaping on top of buildings or jumping off them on top of people is actually fun.
Random gangs attack me.
Law was supposed to be redesigned but the mod was out of date or something. Idk but I have no law now. I can kill a policeman and other cops standing nearby are just like ""oh my"" and then ignore me. LoL.
I can rob banks and duel people.
Take assassination contracts.

God knows what else I installed but it's actually been waaay more fun with mods.

I mod every single player game these days. I don't care what the developers vision was... If I see a mod on Nexus mods that will remove boring (to me) gameplay features I do it. If it adds something that I think sounds good. I'm in! 

Thank you modders!"

1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-03,My point is there‚Äôs a point where you‚Äôll complete all of the side quests and want to move forward with the story missions.  I‚Äôm suggesting they take their time.  I had all of the pelts requested by Pearson and camp upgrades done before Chapter 2.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,You‚Äôve just gave something else to go spend an unreasonable amounts of time doing. Thank you üôè
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,Looks amazing if you can get every openable thing.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"This thread is gathering of Red Dead fanboys, so its no surprise you're being downvoted, but you are right. Being in the world of RDR2 is a treat, but the nitty gritty of movement and combat is a slog. And as much as the story is well written, it kind of repeats the same beats every act: move to new area, do jobs for locals, plan a big heist, fuck up the heist, move to new area.

It's a good game. Not one of the best of all time imo. I think the first Red Dead is a tighter, better-paced experience."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"Amen my guy, I played through the story and the whole time I kept waiting for it to be better but I just never got into it. Details? Incredible! Game play? Alright. Characters? All the good ones died too soon (I don‚Äôt think Arthur is one of the good ones)"
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"It's go here, shoot these people, get chased back, repeat about a hundred times.

The story is also so cliche and repetitive. If you think it's such a great story, wait til you hear about these things called books and movies."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,lol yes
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"It's a cinematic masterpiece held within a gaming medium. 

It's objectively one of the best-looking PS4 games in terms of graphical fidelity and lighting. You may not like the artistic style, but from a hardware perspective and optimisation-wise, it's a thing of pure beauty 

Its writing and dialogue are phenomenal with a script that rivals Quentin Tarantino in talent. 

It has a massive open world that's as deep as it is wide (New Austin aside, in my opinion)

The game came out over half a decade ago and still stands toe to toe with pretty much any game of today's standard.

This is subjectively my own opinion, of course. But the statistics speak for itself. Game had crazy hype and lived up to it. Both critically and monetarily 


Online and the lack of freedom within missions suck ass though"
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,What‚Äôs a better game?

1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"Nah. The game doesn't respect your time and it's one of my biggest issues with it. There's no good reason that you should be forced to watch your character slowly open every single drawer or how looting a dead person takes about 5 seconds. Cooking takes forever, same with crafting bullets or arrows.  
  
Like it's a videogame and they make you pull teeth to do videogame stuff. It's not fun it just wastes time. And before you say it's immersive, I'll ask how ""cooking"" the same looking piece of meat 10 times by just holding down x is supposedly immersive lol. It's not.  
  
I'm not even going to go into how late game the game has you slowly riding up to almost the top of the map from the bottom to begin a mission and you do this several times."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"If literally any other game disrespected your time as much as this game does, then people would shit on it constantly. Every single thing about the game is so incredibly detailed and expertly crafted, but this game does not respect your time at all. Add to it that combat is nothing more than press button to lock on, press button to shoot and sometimes use special ability to incredibly slowly move your recital to target more than 1 enemy at a time.. it gets boring. A beautifully detailed world can only do so much when most of that world is empty.. yeah I get it‚Äôs ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù that you travel for 30 minutes and see nothing but a few animals and random people traveling, but it‚Äôs so goddamn boring and uninteresting. Then when you do find something that looks cool like a creepy cabin in the middle of the woods, you take the incredibly slow time to navigate towards it using the absolute worst controls only to find out you can‚Äôt go inside because the run down, rotten, and decrepit cabin has a fucking super master lock powerful enough to hold back gods and demons in their other worldly realms. 

All of it adds up over time and if you can‚Äôt sit for at least an hour and half per play session then there‚Äôs no point in booting it up because you won‚Äôt get but a half percent of completion towards finishing the game. 

The game is amazing, but so goddamn frustrating."

1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-03,My dad is a big western fan and he loved how realistic the game looked and the freedom to do anything. I had him try it out from the start and he couldn't figure out controls either. I'll agree red dead 2 and gta 5 have some weird and counterintuitive controls. Hopefully gta6 fixes that
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-03,"I actually returned this game from the steam sale for the same reason. I‚Äôve never returned a game from steam even games I‚Äôve never opened, but I was so dissatisfied. I played on the PS4 and the graphics blew me away. The controls were easy to understand. On the PC (everything ultra 3070 TI/5900x) it looked horrible for some reason combined with the controls being horrendous and every NPC in the snowy mining camp having the same identical look, I lost immersion and left. Kind of bummed in a way but I can‚Äôt be alone. Having 25 bandits with an identical outfit may have been fine 25 years ago‚Ä¶now? Nah."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"Yeah it‚Äôs annoying. Why the fuck do I lose massive amounts of honor for looting a random body, but I literally save a starving child and I get a fraction of a boost in honor? Or I have cops shooting at me in a mission and I‚Äôm losing honor each time I kill on? Like wtf?"
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,At first I enjoyed doing bad stuff. Then a buddy told me to play with honor to the end. I am going to play through again and this time will be just being a bad dude since I know the good ending.

1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,There won‚Äôt be a 60FPS patch. If you do ever get to play in 60FPS on console then it‚Äôll be in a cash grab re-release of the game that‚Äôll cost you $40-$60 most likely.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,It was like they just put this banger out knowing just how perfect it was and simply looked at us all in the eyes and dropped the mic.

1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"I see this every time, but there is SO much you can add. They could have had heists, more horses, more western themed clothing instead of the weird shit they did add, continued the online story, added  new stories, build your own homestead. The game had a ton of potential but they just wanted to milk GTAO. Frankly, I think because western setting is more niche than a generic modern setting, they probably weren't selling as much gold as they were shark cards so saw no point in it.

If someone fails to see the potential in the game, I think it's a lack of creativity. Majority of GTAO content is new cars and useless crap to buy anyway. Hell, they still are pumping out random car packs."

1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"The lack of freedom within missions is a really valid criticism to be fair. It‚Äôs potentially my favourite ever game and had so much fun playing I didn‚Äôt really notice initially, but came across a vid of some dude going through how basic the missions really are. Bad guys come at you and you shoot them and there‚Äôs only one real path through the quest. Considering how open the rest of the game and the level of detail, it is odd the missions are so closed off."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"Yeah I won't argue against any of those points, you are absolutely correct.

The story is well-written, but it isn't paced very well, and the middle acts suffer from some repetition. Oddly enough, I feel like I'm one of the only people that liked the epilogue. The quiet, contemplative ending felt nice after the epic adventure we just concluded.

My complaints about the missions being too restrictive and how the movement and combat engines need to be overhauled (I'm getting tired of crashing into civilians because Rockstar refuses to change their running controls) aren't exclusive to Red Dead, as GTA has had this problem for a while too."

1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"I think thats a valid argument, but to me, the games highs just outshadowed its lows so much that I have the game tied with Xenoblade Chronicles 2 as my favorite game of all time. It just tells such an amazing story from start to finish, it has fleshed out areas, and lots of activities to do. Like others have said, patience was a must because of the points you made, but it was a great experience to me overall. Hopefully you give it another shot if you didnt finish it by any chance!"
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"Its a immersive slow paced game, if you want fast, go play GTA?

Also not sure what chapter you're referring to? The Saint Denis chapter has the camp located a short horse ride away from the city, the final chapter where many missions take place in Annesburg has the camp set right next to it?

If you mean certain side missions, then yes, a large map will take time to travel across, this is true of even games with vehicles like GTA, if you don't like open worlds then play linear games?

This just sounds like you tried to play a type of game you don't like then criticize the game for being that very style of game

Also the game has fast travel from any major location"
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,Not sure why you‚Äôre getting downvoted for your opinion. I‚Äôm currently replaying the game for the first time in 5 years and I‚Äôm getting bogged down by these things too. I don‚Äôt really want to explore the crafting or cooking mechanics because they‚Äôre so nauseatingly slow to do.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,Not sure why you are getting downvotes but I 100% agree. I have tried to get a playthrough of this game finished so many times but its just too much. It feels like I am fighting to control arthur and his horse the entire time.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"I had the same issues. I‚Äôm currently playing it again and trying to finish it because I never did.. for those exact reasons. The other night I smashed the A button on my controller for 10 minutes straight so my horse can move at top speed to get to the mission point I needed.. which was in the snow mountains. I was slowly moving up hill when I hit a small rock and flew over my horse and down the side of the mountain for a solid 30 seconds, which was funny at first until I realized I now out of range of my fucking horse to get to me. So I had to move at a snails pace through the snow for 15 goddamn minutes to get back around and up the mountain just so my horse could get to me. After 15 minutes I decided to cut my loses and reload my last checkpoint because it‚Äôd be quicker.. or so I thought. Nope, the fucking game loaded me all the way across the map even further away from where I had started my travel the first time around. 

I honestly don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll try again. It‚Äôs so frustrating and 100% does not respect my time."

1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-03,"I‚Äôm with you. I personally couldn‚Äôt get through RDR2. It‚Äôs so drawn out, rather boring most of the time, I don‚Äôt like the menus and controls, and I keep taking breaks from the game and going back to it. I see posts like this and people saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs the greatest of all time‚Äù and convinces me to pick it back up. I‚Äôll play for a few hours and stop again. It‚Äôs just not for me. 

Cyberpunk however is fast paced, it gives you the dopamine rush on virtually every mission you do, the gameplay is varied, the themes are deep and mature, and there‚Äôs just so much content in the game. I like the aesthetic way more too."

and of course just finishing the mexico section and ""remastering"" RDR1"
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,The game came out in 2018
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,It clearly doesn‚Äôt have the same possibilities as gta online.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,It goes beyond valid imo. It's probably their biggest flaw single-player wise... it's just that everything else is so damn good.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,I think I took too much real world time to play through the game honestly. It was well over 200 days from start to finishing Arthur‚Äôs journey and the epilogue
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"Well, personally, I would *not* say it told an amazing story from start to finish, it told an okay to good story but it also suffers from its own issues. I did play it all the way through, but the point of my post is that this whole stance of ""you need to be patient with the game"" is garbage because people hand wave very real and prominent issues the game has.  
  
Im not sure why gamers do this either. You can like a game or even have it be your favorite and still see that it has flaws. My favorite game has flaws and I can easily point them out, but a lot of people will do these mental gymnastics to spin it into a positive or downplay it."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"Again, theres is nothing immersive over holding down x to cook food. I dont need the game to be fast, but to respect my time. It's not that hard to understand that certain things can be sped up that dont feel deliberate wastes of time.  
  
RDR1 is a superior game to 2 because of this imo."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"I mean, he's got a point that stuff like cooking each individual piece of meat feels like detail for extravagance sake. Considering what we know now about the ungodly crunch time working conditions the development team went through...was it worth it? I appreciate the detail, but what does it add to the game other than slowing it down?

I understand that it's a methodical, slow-paced game, and coming in expecting differently is just asking to be disappointed. But I also think we should be well within our right to question what parts of that methodical design were really necessary. It feels like the game showing off for the sake of its designer's ego, rather than because it serves to make the game better.

There are a lot of things in Red Dead 2 that didn't need to be in there. It's cool that there was so much stuff, and you seemed to like it, so those details clearly have their fans. Personally, I like to subscribe to the old jazz adage that ""its more about the notes you don't play, than the notes you do"". RDR2 feels a bit overstuffed with notes, imo."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-03,I still break out the PS2 to replay the campaign every couple of years. One of the greats for sure

1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"Yeah the way I see it as it‚Äôs just a medium to move the story on really whilst giving you some action to participate in. I mean even things like different plans for heists or train robbery missions would have made quite a big difference. It is what it is, I still think it‚Äôs a masterpiece of a game."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-03,"People aren‚Äôt hand waving things, dude. It‚Äôs just that there really are people who enjoy waking up, having your morning coffee, talking to the camp, doing some chores, and then going out slowly into the open world while Arthur whistles to himself. 

It‚Äôs game unlike anything else, and people are explaining how they get joy out of it and it‚Äôs okay if you don‚Äôt get that same joy."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"For sure. At that point its personal preference. I didnt have an issue with some of the things you pointed out for the simple reason i didnt bother with them (I wanted Arthur to have more stamina). I can see why people say just be patient, but I completely understand your point that it makes it feel like they are sweeping the problems the game has under the rug."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-03,What you describe as flaws are some of what other people describe as immersion. Your opinion does not supercede others.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"Honestly the gameplay is so simple, easy and shallow that it doesn‚Äôt even come close to being a good game."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"In some ways yes, in some ways no for me. Overall I've had more fun with a lot of other games."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-03,"I'm not even talking about that though lmao. That has its own problems like how you can down a whole cup of coffee in 3 sips, or eat a whole plate just as fast. Conversations that are disjointed and simply end with ""well alright then!"". That's not very immersive either because it's so janky."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,Arthur can stay awake forever and never eat while murdering people en masse. He has plenty of stamina haha
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-03,I didn't say it did. I asked how does holding x to cook food is immersive though.
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,Can you elaborate on ‚Äòshallow‚Äô and ‚Äòeasy‚Äô?
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-03,">There's no good reason that you should be forced to watch your character slowly open every single drawer or how looting a dead person takes about 5 seconds. Cooking takes forever, same with crafting bullets or arrows.  
  
You already answered your own question. You just didn't like the answer. Which is fine. It's not like your point isn't valid. But that isn't how everyone sees it.

Searching through drawers takes time. Cooking takes time. Crafting takes time. It adds some immersion to in-game activities by animating them and having it not be instantaneous.

>And before you say it's immersive

Let me stop you right there. It's immersive.

You may not like it, but a lot of people do. I liked the slower pace of the game. The weight of it.

I also liked the balance. I don't want to have to do a QTE mini game to cook meat.

Edit: You also definitely did try to invalidate others' opinions by comparing them to mental gymnastics to justify the games flaws. Having a different opinion than you does not require mental gymnastics."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-02,"The gunplay is point and click, there's no difficulty to it at all. On controller it's all auto-aim, on mouse and keyboard it's point and click. It gets boring after the first gunfight."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-03,"So lets say you are playing a game in which you build a house, you put your character infront of studs to put up the drywall. You press x to put up the drywall and then are simply met with a timer counting down. That, to you, will count as immerisve?  
  
Now im not sure if youve ever put up drywall, but there are a lot of steps to putting it up, not counting the measuring and cutting part, but you dont simply paste it up and its going.  
  
Cooking is the same thing. you dont take a piece of meat, hold it  inches over some fire and it gets cooked. Nevermind the fact that each piece of meat looks the exact same, doesnt matter the size because theres big/small type and different animals. Venison does not look the same as rabbit and they do not cook at the same rate.  
  
This is why I say that calling it immersive is bullshit. Because the game does a small amount into making it a game, all the meat looks the same and takes the same amount to cook? Okay, its a game, but why must I cook every piece one at a time? why is there no cook all option, why must I hold X to cook it? You dont need to make it a QTE, just give me the option to skip the bullshit.  
  
I would argue that a simple looking game, like Plate Up is far more immersive than RDR2 is because cooking food has steps to it. A game like American/European Truck Simulator is *miles* above RDR2 when it comes to immersion. RDR2 is not immersive. It picks and chooses where to waste your time."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-03,"That's why I added the part about balance. I think it strikes a good balance between being too monotonous, such as your example of cutting and measuring drywall, and just the right amount of immersion. Could they have added different meat types for cooking? Sure, but I was happy with what they made.

It's not surprising to me that a simulator does immersion better. I've never played that game, though, but I'll trust your synopsis.

I'm not sure if I've ever played a game where the world felt more complete than RDR2. That is immersion. It felt like stepping into a world that was just already there. Every little thing that you viewed as wasting time to me felt as if it added weight to its world.

It's funny now that I think about the part where you mentioned ignoring the games flaws and then using an example of putting up drywall. My least favorite part of that whole game was building that damn house at the end. Oh, and whoever had the idea to have us spend the first 1-2 hours stranded in snowy mountains drove a lot of people not to play the game, too."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-03,"I feel like youre missing my point a bit here. I dont mind, like another post mentioned, waking up, getting some coffee and talking with the camp and doing chores. That's cool, but its so shallow. Its not deep enough to be enjoyable. Cooking/crafting feels that way, its so shallow that it in turn feels like a waste of time because they added an arbitrary timer to get them done. Looting is the same thing, having Arthur slightly crouch, wave his hand over a downed person to loot them, would be far better than the current 5 second animation thats in the game, because its so long it feels like its just wasting time. It doesnt add to immersion.  
  
Take a look at a game like Cyberpunk, where you dont have any of that. You can craft 900 bullets in 1 go from 1 screen. Because of how the game's world is crafted, I would argue that, that game is far more immersive than RDR2.   
  
You can gamify, if thats a word, the annoying bits of a video game and have it be immersive. Deliberately making things slow that dont need to be, or have them have some timer associated with an action, does not add to immersion, it makes things more frustrating. Like for example you dont need to go shit or piss at all, why not? Wouldnt that add to the immersion? No. Its not there because its a waste of time lol.  
  
TBH theres a lot of small things that add up to making RDR2 feel so close, yet so far away to being an immersive game."
1890heq,2023-12-02,2023-12-03,"It seems as if you made up your mind regardless of the examples you gave.

Manipulating menu screens to make ammunition contributes to cyberpunk being more immersive?

Do you have to urinate in cyberpunk?

You criticize the immersion type things that aren't in the game while at the same time criticizing the immersion type things that are in the game. It's not enough immersion for your standards, but the immersion in the game is a ""waste of time""?

Would you rather have to hit square for salt, triangle to flip meat, tap x to chew? And all of that take 30+sec? Is it too much? Or not enough?

This is why I mentioned things like balance. Your whole post is just contradictory. You can gamify annoying bits of video games and have them be immersive. That is exactly what is happening when you hold x to cook meat. When you loot, you're not rolling them over, turning their pockets inside out. Skinning animals takes much longer than a few seconds in real life as well.

All of that is gamifying activities for immersion. And it is definitely more immersive to have them animated out than to make 900 bullets in a menu.

I guess all of this just begs the question, what is it that you think immersion is?"

9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-22,"That's often said among Marines, and is broadly applicable to lots of tasks. If you rush something, you increase your risk of making mistakes and then wasting time redoing it. Often, rushing through a task will result in taking more time due to do-overs than slowing down a bit to do it right the first time.

In a shootout, you rarely have time to redo anything."

9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,"That's amazing. One of my only, and very small, complaints about this game is that it leaves SO much for you to just figure out. 

Dont get me wrong, I appreciate not having a tutorial or even guide for every little thing. Like I spent a long time lining up perfect shots for perfect pelts before I realized you could lasso a lot of animals and just stab them in the throat. That just happened because I tried it and that was a fun learning experience. 

But some stuff like the out of duel quick draw i would have never thought of unless told. I feel like I'm going to complete the game without realizing cool little things that would have made it more enjoyable."

9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-22,"The reason Bat said that was because guns of the period weren't built to mitigate recoil. They were primarily sidearms built at the request of the army to be able to shoot as many cartridge rounds as possible without the possibility of the guns blowing up in the shooter's hand, which would happen in the days of cap and ball pistols. 
 
Take the Colt 1873, for instance. I've shot accurate reproductions of this gun a lot. I always missed high until I got used to the gun. That one in particular, if the manufacturer stays true to the original design, has a pretty tall front blade sight. The sights don't adjust so lining up the front blade with the rear sight the correct way forces you to aim a bit lower than you would with other, modern guns with adjustable sights. After I did this, making myself aim low, my accuracy improved dramatically. "
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-22,"90 degree grip angle is bad for recoil mitigation. You see that in early semiauto pistols like the [Borchardt C-93](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borchardt_C-93) that‚Äôs in the game as the ‚Äúsemi auto pistol‚Äù or John Browning‚Äôs (of 1911 fame) [M1900](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_M1900). 

EDIT: misread your comment. You asked about why the sight alignment, not the grip angle. My best guess, it would have to do with his barrel length and method of draw. Does he pull high and draw the barrel down into sight picture or does he pull low and bring the sights into view. "
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-22,It's said amongst pretty much the entire military and all law enforcement

9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,How else can you get perfect pelts as a general matter? That part of the game has been driving me fucking nuts because I loved the hunting challenges in the first game but can't get past even the first one in this RDR2 because I can't ever get a perfect rabbit pelt. I read somewhere you have to use the right guns and ammo and I was bummed because I'm not buying guns just to kill a rabbit. Is it really that much work? I was holding out hope that I was being mislead and really it's about shooting them in a certain place or something like that. 
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,"It‚Äôs good to do while you are getting robbed or something, they give you time to charge up your dead eye. I don‚Äôt think you have to wait until it‚Äôs fully charged either, just the fuller the circle, the more time you have in dead eye. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. "
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,"Time gradually slows until it reaches dead eye on full pull, but it does appreciably give you an advantage. You‚Äôre only vulnerable if you‚Äôre already in a shootout.

The big issue with it is that it will aggro NPCs, even with the circle half (hand on holster) full."

9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-22,"Thx, I'll check it out, looks awesome"
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,This guy fucks.
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,"It is called Aim Assist, and does not guarantee a hit. Don't talk shite."
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,I just finished chapter 5 and thinking about loading a save from right before robbing the big bank just to spend my money and finish all the secondary missions
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-22,A lot of people powered through the story the first go so as to avoid spoilers. 
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,I dont know how you can do a second walkthrough. I loved the game but I cant go through all the emotions again.
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,Please tell me there‚Äôs a new game plus
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,^^^it ^^^was ^^^a ^^^^joke
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,They‚Äôre nihilists Donnie
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,Holy shit
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,I needed this.
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-22,"I'm asking if the angle is the reason I'm told to aim for groin area when I want to hit the stomach.

Either way, you gave me interesting read. Thanks buddy."
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,"Oh shit, Omar coming!

*Farmer in the Dell intensifies*"
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-22,I can come back the next day or the next day. 
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,But what about the honey-nut?
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,Well you just fucked on me too because I did not know either :|
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,"How does that mechanic actually work then? I always half ignored it. Slowly pressing slows time, and when the bar fills I press it and have more time to react? Is it like a free dead eye?

&#x200B;"
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,"Let's you shoot the gun out of their hands, which may increase honor but I haven't personally tried it."
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,"Yeah I know! You just hold them there and if you get close enough it gives you a prompt and you just slit their throat. 
Obviously only if the animal is a 3 star. So far I've done it on things as small as a deer up to an elk. Doesnt work on small animals."
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,When you study or aim at an animal it gives you an option to show info. If you do that it'll give you some trivia about the animal and list the best weapon to kill it with. Small animals like rabbits you need to headshot with a bow *with small animal arrows* or use the varmint rifle 
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,you're probably gonna hafta buy the varmint rifle for that. its only about 60 bucks tho 
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,"It also really helps to ""Call"" the animal and immediately drop into deadeye to guarantee the headshot. "
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-22,"Depending on the size of the animals different weapons will keep the pelts better quality, also the area you inflict damage on will change the quality.  Don't wanna buy weapons?  The varmint rifle is super cheap and can be used on most small critters, but you can craft ""small game arrows"" as well if you wanna just use the bow.  You can hunt pretty much everything effectively with a combo of a normal rifle and a bow."
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,I got my first perfect rabbit pelt by running over the poor thing with my horse. Could not be bothered to shoot at the little jiggly bastard.
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-22,"Mostly correct. There is a certain threshold you have to meet, it won‚Äôt work if you just lightly hold it for 0.25 sec and get free dead eye. I‚Äôve found 1/3 or 1/2 full is the minimum for successful dead eye activation from draw."
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-22,Same here. I‚Äôve been doing the gunslinger missions with my sawn off in the offhand holster because I thought that was the only way to fix it. Never occurred to me to swap the guns around. 
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-22,Holy Jesus this is WAY better. I save so much dead eye by doing this.  
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,"Should be an automatic ban, no questions asked."
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,"To be honest people really shouldn't be digging this far into the comments for a game they haven't finished yet. As much as people should mark spoilers, avoiding them is a lot like defensive driving."
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,Ain‚Äôt that the truth my man
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,[deleted]
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,"Aim hacks dont guarantee hits too, they still increase your odds exponentially "
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,"pretty much all the secondary missions can be done after you complete the game, just so you know."
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,"Nope, but there is a FULL DLC worth of epilogue after the main story ends. I had a good 10 hours of more story missions, after the actual story ended. It truly is impressive."
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,There‚Äôs a endgame+
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,"Hit start and go to ""Story"" to manually save the game. Shocked how many people don't know it."
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,"Every single time I see a box of regular Cheerios to this day.

""What, they ain't got no honey nut?"""
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,Yeah pretty much. When you‚Äôve filled the bar you then press down on the trigger to pull and shoot but the longer you wait the more time in deadeye you‚Äôll have I think. 
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-22,I think that is scripted once or twice but I'm not 100% on it working day to day
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,3 Star animals? What does that mean?
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,So they just make another account?
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,"No, the whole posse is dead because you kill them all in RDR1"
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,"Aim Assist = literally a feature of the game, which you can turn off if you don‚Äôt like it.

Aimbots = illegal hacks, not a feature of the game, used by cheaters in multiplayer games. 

I‚Äôm not sure what point you‚Äôre attempting to make. "
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,I feel like the world is SO much more empty after completing the game. 
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-22,"How do you go back and do them? All of them disappeared at the beginning of the epilogue, and I just finished part 2 of the epilogue and nothing came back, just one secondary side quest of meeting a painter at a bar."
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,not all of them though. i was dissapointed. 
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,And you can keep playing after you beat all the story missions right? Like Witcher 3?
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,"Whenever I play a single player game I always spend a few minutes traveling through the menu to find the manual save. 

I don't trust autosave. "
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,Bought rdr2 last night. Got to a little bit after chapter 2. Never found this save. It didn't save. Woke up and had to spend 2 and a half hours getting to where I was before. Sad days. 
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-22,"To be fair, save data being put under story feels like it doesnt make sense when it should be under ""progression"" category or I dunno, data."
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,"I've run into times where i've been in a scene like this, but I think i'm holding R2 for too long since the dude will shoot his hostage or whatever.

"
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-22,You can shoot the gun out of the hands of most people. I'm not sure if it affects honor outside of duels but you can definitely do it. There's a sharpshooter challenge that's a pain the ass. In my experience I couldn't shoot guns out of the hands of lawmen.
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,"When you aim at an animal or look at its tracks in hunter vision there are three little stars next to the name. The number of stars lit up is the highest quality pelt you can get from it, and they go down if you do too much damage to it. So you can shoot a deer in the head with an arrow perfectly but if it's a two star you'll still only get a good pelt. This is also something that took me a while to figure out haha"
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,Technically you can leave javier alive but he probably gets hanged anyway. 
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,[deleted]
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,"in what way? all the random encounters and stranger missions are still there, nothings been removed. it feels empty plot wise, if thats what you mean."
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,This is why I never rush through a game like this. I'm on chapter 2 but have been playing all the side stuff before doing too many main missions. The only downside is the stuff that only happens after you finish some missions.
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-22,"the ones you've already started should be on the map, but a lot of them you just have to discover in the world. i'm not sure what would have disappeared after beating the game."
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,Yep
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,"I quit without manually saving and I lost the challenge for winning five blackjack hands doubling down. It remembered what I bought right after, but I had to get all five wins again. "
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,"Given how many times I have messed up and aimed at someone instead of greeting, or accidentally committed a crime, I tend to manual save regularly."
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-22,You can do it anytime. Doesn‚Äôt have to be a scripted scene. We just discovered that lol. 
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,"To add to this, you have to study the type of animal at least one time before. Then you'll start to see stars next to the animals name. In my experience anyway"
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,"Appreciate the heads up, thanks!"
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,"Rdr2 was a perfect prequel sequel, in that it made the experience of Rdr1 even better, even in a bittersweet kind of way."
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,"Sure you don‚Äôt, that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre arguing with a stranger on the internet! "
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,"I feel like all the side missions dissapeared when before there was a ton of shit to do in between the story (then again the sides were given by the camp a lot of times)

Specifically the gunslinger quest where you have to find the four fastest shooters or something"
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,"Smart move, im going to have to reload an older save."
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,Great. Thanks!
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-22,I just bet the minimum and doubled down every time. I know blackjack strategy but I just wanted to get it out of the way and that's the best way to do it even you're showing a 17 (which I succeeded on once). I think it still took me like half and hour...
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,"*tips hat* ""Howdy pardn --"" **BLAM!**"

9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,I‚Äôm pretty sure you can still complete the gunslinger side missions. You just have to open up your satchel and find and flip the photo of the gunslinger that you wanna pop
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,"yeah the gunslinger, the debt collecting, the optional missions where you go off with someone from the camp, those become unavailable. but i think nearly all the side missions and random encounters are still there after you finish."
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,Not helping the whole ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care‚Äù argument here my dude. Call it a day. 
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,"Ooh I'll try that, thanks for the tip!"
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,you can't. 
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,"I did the gunslinger missions after the epilogue.  You just have to open the pictures up from the satchel, and the gunslinger locations show up on the map."
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,I've exhausted the game then haha
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-22,What about the getting party member x item missions?
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,[deleted]
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,lol idk man I completed story mode and playing as John and I just blew shit all over one of the gunslingers to confirm 
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-22,true i forgot about those. definitely can't do those afterwards.
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,"Sure, bud. "
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,did you start the gunslinger mission as john? cause i started it as arthur but never actually went to kill the gunslingers and it wouldn't let me finish as john
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-22,Crap.  Thanks
9z36bs,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,I only did the Billy one as Arthur and did the other gunslinger missions as John

f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,Never went their as Arthur( as I remember at least ) in first playthrough.  but fell in love with the place when playing as John.   Now on second playthrough im gona explore so much more.   First place that I got to on second playthrough   :)
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,"the perfect place to hold a contest of Donkey Jousting

f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,How do I turn up the rendering resolution?
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,Yeehaw Skyrim
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,A big empty field with no animals? I am assuming you went to RDO for this one.
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,This is my favourite location to view from midair as my horse swerves into a tree rather than going straight through the empty space next to it.
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,Beautiful! Makes me wanna go back...
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,Best area to find pronghorn
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,That‚Äôs a good gurrrl.
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,This is one of those games I keep telling myself I must get around to playing one day but as yet I never have. I heard the scenery in the game looks good.
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,Absolutely amazing! Is this on a physical canvas or in Adobe software?
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,Big valley? I love that place too
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,this game is perfect
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,My favorite location is Valentine
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,"Before I read the title, I felt like I have been there. 

Oh joy of video games!"
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,"This is just gorgeous, the strokes on the sky remind me of a Monet"
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,"I still remember the first time I came upon that view when I first played it, I was blown away and just stopped there for a few minutes to take it all in."
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,You mean Yeehaw Skyrim?
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,"Awww, that's lovely.   


New wallpaper now :P"
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,This is very beautiful.
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,"No animals, just the like how R* intended!"
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,ok Dolores
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,I used to go to the top of mountains in the area where you find the legendary ram and stop to read a book listening to the ambient noise.  by a lake is nice too.
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,You are very talented. Beautiful scenery.
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,"Are those Indian Paintbrush flowers? I live in Wyoming, so this painting looks like something I'd see out here, near Yellowstone. Those flowers are beautiful to see, especially a whole field of them."
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-15,I think I know the game well enough to guess that this is the open prairie area where the homestead spawns for the epilogue right?
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-15,"Shouldn't the lavender fields be a tad bit more purple? By just a smidge? Or, I'd you already test it and it didn't look good?"
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-13,"The painting is beautiful, but you're even more stunning, sweatheart."
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-13,Looks amazing! Is this a digital painting or canvas?
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,Bob Ross would be proud of your pretty little trees
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-13,I was chilling in that meadow cleaning my guns when I heard a cougar roar and I spun around just in time to see it take down a deer about 200ft away. I love that game.
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-13,"Thank you, I'm glad you like it!"
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-13,Same
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,Fuck Micah.
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,"Although >!Micah was the real villain and undisputably a piece of shit,!< the moment that hit me much harder than >!Micah's betrayal!< was when >!Dutch sees Arthur in trouble in the refinery but turns and leaves him to die. They hadn't been seeing eye-to-eye for a long time, but when that happened I had this sudden pang in my stomach, and felt complete disgust for this character. Everything he and Arthur had gone through, and he just leaves him to die because he's no longer needed. I know he redeems himself in the end, but Dutch's soul was gone by that point.!<"

f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,I actually believe it's part of West Elizabeth. My favorite spot by far though
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,Thats a bit north of the ranch john worked at right?
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,A devoted redditor.
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-13,"Haha there were some deer waaay down in the distance, too small to include though (I honestly thought they were rocks until they moved)"
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-13,Thank you so much!
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,Man that looks sick! Good job!
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-13,"Thank you! What's the first?

This is the result of me green screening myself into the game to make a video series where I paint videogame landscapes ""from life"", so I'm on the lookout more cool locations to paint :)"
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,"Haha thank you, I usually work on a small scale so the photos would have a weird 9 to 1 dude to painting ratio anyway lol"
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,I thought the PS4 came with a 500GB HDD at minimum?
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,"Arthur survived his TB, he's just hiding in the mountains"
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-13,Thanks!
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-13,Thank you!
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,"Sent you a DM, I was gonna share a link to the listing but I'm not sure if it's allowed"
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,"I shared it on r/reddeadredemption shortly before I posted it here, could've been that?"
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,"[This is the best I got right now](https://i.imgur.com/6F81VaR.jpg), I greenscreened myself into the game and recorded the painting process to make a video out of it, still working on it but that's the location I painted"
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,Thank you! It's gouache (opaque watercolor) on illustration board :)

f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-13,i know my red dead geography better tgan i know my fucking hometown
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-13,"I assume that's near the ranch where the epilogue starts, right? I miss that game. Might have to throw it back in. Nice painting btw :)"
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-13,"Rockstar realised a 3.5G update today to ""fix"" animal spawns for CERTAIN servers but people are still experiencing no animal spawns, I really love the game but rockstar is only paying attention to GTA and red dead is a huge bug fest."
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-13,Large area west of Emerald Ranch. From the wetlands to the north (Heartland Overflow) down to dried out creek bed to the south (Dewberry Creek).
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,"Mine has 408 for some reason, as well as a glitch that makes download files twice as large. I think it‚Äôs a faulty ps4"

f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,Yea I think its right outside the ranch you work at.

f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,RD online seems so dead compared to single player.
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-15,Has to be. That is a serious defect.
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,Thanks!

f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-14,"Yea I love the game and I wish it was as packet and fun like a GTA lobby but rockstar has red dead as a lower priority while GTA is #1, in bug fixes, content drops, and it takes the communitys problems seriously. But with red dead they take months to ""fix"" a problem and sometimes it doesn't work and even adds problems"
f3gobd,2020-02-13,2020-02-15,"The only games I have are modern warfare, titanfall 2 and apex. And minecraft ofc but I have to uninstall games when I want anything else"

8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Still looking awesome. But hoped for some gameplay.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,IGN said that they'll release some exclusive information on the game tomorrow 7 AM PT. 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"*Coming October 26, 2018 to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One systems.*

Well this can't happen soon enough."

8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,People in this thread acting like rockstar ever shows gameplay outside of the occasional gameplay series of videos
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"It was a good trailer, but didn't really seem to add much"
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"I know it‚Äôs not gonna happen, but imagine if the end of this game just picked up with a remastered version of the first RDR. Again, not gonna happen but a guy can dream can‚Äôt he"
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Anyone else planning on calling in sick for at least a week when that thing drops?
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,PC version coming 2021 lul
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Beyond excited for the game, and quite happy they're showing the single player campaign without any mention of multiplayer which makes me think the focus is still largely on single player"

8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Oh my yes! I‚Äôm so ready for this game!

R* always does a gameplay series leading up to release. They will not be at E3. I'm at least hoping for some special edition news at E3."

Kind of takes the fun out of it knowing how his story ends. "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,So do we know who we are playing as? Is it Bill from the first game?
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,The time has nearly come! Can't wait for this game. The first was one of the most memorable stories I've ever played.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Nice nod to The Assassination of Jesse James at the start there.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,the fuck is that font at the start

I've been playing the new Far Cry and that game looks gorgeous compared to this"
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,"I can‚Äôt emphasize how dangerous it is to put your beloved main character in a prequel IMO. Putting a character that all the fanbase loves and has so much empathy for in this game as an NPC, is just SO dangerous. I trust Rockstar, but let‚Äôs see how this rolls out"
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Damn those graphics are insane considering it's a large open world game running on consoles!

8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,it seemed like a more story driven trailer to show that they are focusing on a heavy story so if that is so it better have single player DLC
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,[removed]
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Bummed, no PC announced."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,This will be available on PC right?!
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Not gonna lie, none of the trailers so far have done much to excite me. I'll still be watching the game pretty closely to see if it's worth it, but I feel like they could have done a much better job with promotion."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Rockstar still makes new games?  
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,too bad it wont launch on pc at the same time.....  :-(
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Title still irks me. It's the third installment with the Red Dead name and it takes place before the second game. I mean, I'm probably still pre-ordering the collectors edition but I still can't get over that title."

8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Looks good
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,So is this a prequel within a sequel? Like some Godfather part 2 action. 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Late 2018 is gonna be an exciting time.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,IGN have exclusive coverage starting tomorrow

8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"I'm sure this game will be fun, but what the hell is the story? These trailers are the most ambiguous thing I've ever seen trying to promote a single player narrative."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,I'm buying the shit out of that.

8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,All I see is there will be no red dead redemption 3
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,I‚Äôm kind of annoyed they put in Marston like he‚Äôs just another character. I was hoping for some dramatic scene with him saying something badass
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"But what about RDROnline?

^^^thelastthinganyonewantstohearbutareexpectingto"
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Loved the original. I‚Äôm just concerned with the business practices of GTA5 how this will actually turn out.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"I'm calling it now: it will have a multiplayer mode and people won't care if the plot is bad for single player.  Yes I do realize RockStar does quality games.. but that hasn't stopped them from micro-transactions in multiplayer games: easier for them to push those nowadays. Popular game + multiplayer = easy money for them, so they will do nearly anything it takes to cash in on it unfortunately.  I hope I'm proven wrong here.. and RDR 2 has a good single player experience.. but I'm doubtful."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Can‚Äôt wait to pirate the single player on pc and not give one cent to whatever online scam take-two decides to milk for the next 5 years. 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"It pains me that the single player will be so good,yet the online will be a carbon copy of GTA Online, with all its grinding and microtransactions"
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Will I have to play RDR1 to understand this one?
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Can't wait for all the DLC horses and buggys
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"I hope this game is not at shitty 30 fps.

8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Why is this just not linked from fucking youtube.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Still want my PC release
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,"THAT'S IT, JOHN WAS IN THE TRAILER, GUYS, TIME TO PACK IT UP"
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,"ooohhwee, looking forward to this game. Hope it lives up to the hype."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,But can you swim?
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,"Gotta admit, I've said in the past I refuse to give Rockstar anymore of my money.  This looks really promising so far.  If they give PC a concurrent release I will get it.  I will even consider it with a delay for PC under a month.  If they jerk us around again, though... then no, I refuse to give anymore than that."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,I don't think RDR online could compete with GTA onlines popularity. Even several years after its release Rockstar is still milking it. Ask a non gamer and they most likely will have heard of GTA and not RDR. I see no reason for Rockstar to try and compete with themselves here. Here's hoping for a strongly single player focused release in October.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,"Don't expect Marston too much in this game, if you notice in the story info they say the gang is reeling in after a botched robbery in Blackwater, I believe this is the robbery where John was left for dead, and may very well be the first mission. "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,"my excitement for this game died when GTA,O became the cash cow it became

i know the single player for this game will be a lesser product at the very best, realistically just a mediocre platform for the multiplayer, i 100% guarantee they'll try to copy GTA,O for this, and make it the thing most focused on instead of an amazing single player "

8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"The trailer was fine I guess but obviously people want to see gameplay, and presumably they're still working on it and don't wanna reveal that until it's perfected. Someone said Rockstar was overestimating the story element of the game but I doubt that lol, i'm sure they're just perfecting the gameplay and multiplayer since that will be the biggest draw at the end of the day."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Really hope they release this on PC some day.

Don't want to have to rely on emulation to play it like RDR."

8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,A little disappointing. I already want the game... but I was hoping for gameplay here.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,They aren't showing the features they keep telling us we want.  Where are the m~~i~~acrotransaction features?

8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,totally forgot this game was comming out.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,"Honestly, the first game didn't blow me away, and it looks like this one won't either. I still don't get the insane hype. is it just because it's cowboys? Cause that's really the only difference between Redemption and GTA."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,"Fuck, Xbox One and PS4, no mention of PC..."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Another trailer with little to no actual gameplay. As much as I loved the first one and GTA V, this combined with the new focus on online play isn't really getting me too hyped. No doubt I'll still love it when it's out, but they could do so much more with the marketing!"
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,End of wild west again? Why couldn't they have set it at it's prime instead. I thought it was going to be set a long time before. Not just a few years. Disappointing. They could've done so much more with a game set during the prime years. Kinda wish this wasn't a prequel. 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,My one issue here is that the horse animation looks really bad
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"As an historian with a love for games set in the past, it was honestly a bit underwhelming. Something about the aesthetic makes it look more like the next cowboy flick with Brad Pitt than a historically set gritty old western tale. For one no one back then wore the clothes the characters in the trailer wore. [I mean they couldnt even get the flat brimmed cowboy hats right?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_of_the_Plains)"
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Such a shame the game will be bogged down with microtransactions and a focus on multiplayer.

8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Hate me if you want but as someone who didn't play the first one. This game looks like it was made back in 2010 and the trailer doesnt really show the game as interesting at all..
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Looks like it!

Edit: Actually the line can be found earlier in the trailer, too. "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,The general feeling is that this marks the beginning of the 6 month marketing period before the games release so I'm sure we'll see gameplay surface relatively soon :)
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"There were some gameplay-looking shots when the guy tackled the other guy, the guy crouching/crawling through the burning building, and the fist fight."

8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Rockstar rarely shows actual gameplay until a few weeks before release. It was the same with GTA V and GTA IV.

8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,They noticed how many of us bitched and moaned about the delays upon delays and still bought it. They're happy to screw us again.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,And this is the reason I won't play it. Not having a PC version is really inexcusable from a company like Rockstar. They wanna ignore me then I'll ignore them.

8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,I think you're kidding yourself. Of course they're showing the single player. Theyre not gonna show this early all the microtransactions you can do.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,One can hope. It would have been nice to see some gameplay though.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,For both RDR 1 and Gta 5 they started with the single player trailers and showing the multiplayer ones a few months before release.

8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Likely the GTAV approach; release on consoles first because that's where most of the sales are gonna come from, then the PC folks/double dippers afterward."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,I'm guessing it'll release on the PS5 before it releases on PC.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Or it was for a better game
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,No one cares. Pc gaming is dying for a reason. 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,[deleted]
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Just imagine:

There are really 7 playable characters in the game as the cover suggests, but you get only one with the game.

Every other character needs a different type of ""energy"" to be used, consumed by playing time, similar to how some mobile games are monetized.

To advance the story on the other characters you need to consume energy that you need to buy using real money."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Those scars are fresh. This is a prequel.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"I expect it to play like RDR. But a bigger map, and better graphics and even more stuff to do. "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,[deleted]
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,E3 perhaps?
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,RDR1 wasn't on PC because they couldn't figure out how to get it to work right. I don't play on PC personally but it really is a shame that you guys are missing out on it. 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Expect a staggered release pattern, like gta v. They can make more money that way. Simple as that. The original rdr didn't get a pc release because the game was a mess and hard to port. Rdr2 will definitely be coming to PC. "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Like most people I'm pretty cynical about this. With GTA 5 they successfully managed to get large amounts of people to double dip or triple dip by staggering the releases. If they release it on consoles exclusively at first then a lot of PC gamers will cave in and buy it on Xbox or PS4, then buy it again when it releases on PC a year later so that they can mess around with mods."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,How so? It‚Äôs a different story with a different character?
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"We don't know the end of this story, though. John Marston is in this game, but this isn't his story. It's Arthur Morgan's story and no one here knows how that will end."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"It‚Äôs not really about Marston as much as it is about Dutch and his gang and their downfall. There was a whole story that began and ended before RDR, and that‚Äôs what this game is about."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"So far we only know of one playable character, and that's Arthur, not JM. Seems like this game will be about Dutch's gang falling apart, however that happens. Hoping for lots of heavy moments. 

Also, I'm sure they'll have something completely jarring happen again. Another user posted the theory that maybe we start as Arthur, and are killed by JM himself, who is then the playable character. Can't even imagine how cool that would be. Plenty of possibilities! "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,I'm positive it's the guy looking at Marston 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,[deleted]
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,First. 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,You can play it on PS Now.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Why...id rather have them put the full game out without us having to pay again for the other 1/3 of it 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Nope, but they will create new heists, clothing, guns, etc. for online :)"
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Would you rather call it Red Dead Redemption-1 ?
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Red Dead Revolver, the first Red Dead game, takes place in the 1880s.

Red Dead Redemption, the second Red Dead game, takes place in 1911 with a completely different cast of characters than Revolver

Red Dead Redemption 2, the third Red Dead game, takes place before Redemption 1 but later than Revolver, is a prequel story about the same characters from Redemption 1 and probably no link at all to Revolver \(I can hope though; I still really want Red to be an aged bounty hunter that is constantly hunting you and your gang throughout the story. Just connect all the games dammit\)"
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Oh sweet summer child. A PC release probably won't even be considered until like a year after console release. 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,They're promoting it the same way they did with GTA V and look how that turned out in terms of popularity. 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,I have to agree 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Yeah, does anyone in this subreddit understand the amount of work that goes into creating games these days? There is a reason years pass between their releases. No doubt it will be worth it because they put so much into each of these."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Yeah, like Valve does. "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Remember what?
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Prequel. First game was in 1911, this trailer just confirmed the sequel is in 1899."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Or a good guy in a bad gang
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"This is the third game in the Red Dead series, though."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Why can't there be a third RDR game?
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,I feel like there might be less of a microtransaction presence in RDR2 considering the fact that it's the wild west. I can't imagine many things that will be worth the Red Dead equivalent of shark cards in Red Dead Online. 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"This is a prequel, so no. But this will likely set up events from RDR1 so I definitely recommend playing that game at some point. It still holds up remarkably well!"
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,"unfortunately i have a feeling it won't happen.

rdr1 was never ported to the PC, and that was after gta4 had already been ported to the PC.

the rockstar studios that work on RDR just seem to not like porting games to the pc."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"These are literally the same comments that I‚Äôve read for years about the first RDR and that never came out for PC, so..."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Rockstar at E3? Stranger things have happened, but I wouldn't count on it."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Same
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"I am indifferent to the story so far though I am glad to see Marston involved. Exploration, weapons, travel, activities, that's what i am really curious about "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Same. Maybe E3?
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"that was all in the in game engine, not cgi pre rendered stuff....

the bank heist is the only gameplay you see in that trailer, the rest are cutscences, but the graphics will be the same in game and in cutscene"
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,E3 is in a month logical one. Why would they?
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,"Well will laugh when we play this game with true 4k resolution instead of checkboard rendering and with 60 FPS or more instead of < 30 FPS :D

Not to mention keyboard and mouse and maybe even mods, so who cares about that delay ? And we get less bugs than you console beta testers, so win win :) "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Why? We just wanna play games too.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Or you could buy a PS4. It's probably the same price and has better exclusives. The Xbox One has backwards compatibility going for it, but that's about it."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Yep, show us some gameplay! :( "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,To be fair they usually say when it's a trailer vs gameplay trailer. How much different could it look than gta v?
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,They didn't show GTA V gameplay until 2 months out from release.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Agreed. The hook of the first games story was all about how the West was dying and the world was changing. And this trailer shows.... the same thing?
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,you aren't a historian.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Because Rockstar is known for that?
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"The very first Red Dead game, Red Dead Revolver, was much more of a spaghetti western with some pretty weird elements. Before Rockstar took over development of it it was being made by Capcom \(I believe\) and it was even more batshit, including a guy in a bird costume that could flap his arms and fly and the game overall had a more arcade style approach to gameplay."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Is was announced a couple days ago that it was going to be released...

I guess if you don‚Äôt pay attention to news, everything comes out of nowhere "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"The first game I ever had the privilege of pre-ordering was the original Red Dead Redemption and I never regretted it. It's a fantastic game as was Max Payne3 and Grand Theft Auto V. Rockstar is a solid developer and as someone who still plays GTA Online and never once bought a shark card, I still have fun there. I'm pre-ordering Red Dead Redemption II because I trust Rockstar to deliver a great game as they always do."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Hey guys this wizard somehow knows the entire story from a 2 minute teaser trailer. Tell us more wizard.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Looks like Uncle sitting around the fire, too."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Has to be.  The scars match up
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,We all know I didn't get these by falling down in church. 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,No. The one with stitches in his face. There was no audio of Marston here.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,I don't think so. But it sounds like it's Marston yelling when they enter the bank at [**1:13**](https://youtu.be/ObyEoWBYk0g?t=73)
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,I think that's dutch
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,I don't recall GTA V showing any raw gameplay in the trailers.. I doubt RDR will be different.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Not likely.  Rockstar stays away from E3, as a general rule."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Now introducing loot boxes for gun upgrades!
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Are you who I send money to to get a good review of my game?
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Who do I beg to bring this to PC
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Haha expecting them to bring it to PC! Good joke!
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,I see you are young and full of hope.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Switch in 2019. Xbox Two and PS5 in 2020. PC in 2021.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Releases in 2019, multiplayer finally loads up in 2020."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,It's not coming to the PCMR bruda :'(  we're gonna have to go buy a Xbox one x/ps4 pro
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,They didn't even bring RDR1 to PC... I'd say the chances are slim.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,So naive!
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,PC a few months after most people already paid for it on console.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,It's great as I'm about to finish my final year of college (read: Uni) and likely will have all the time in the world to play it until Christmas.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,So does rdr2 take place before rdr1?
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,You think we will finally find out if he got those scars from falling over in church? 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"> Cuts clearly confirm its him.



cue CSI Miami john carusso signature put on shades and Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaa!"
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Is he the playable character? Has there been any word on that?
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"It'll be GTA Online 2: Electric Boogaloo in terms of absolutely throttling the online experience with microtransactions. The CEO of Take-Two has made it very clear they're going to be an integral part of every online experience from Rockstar going forward. 

I ain't excited. "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"I dunno man, I think this game might be a wild west platformer. That's why I was hoping to see some gameplay for confirmation! Pre-order still on hold... /s"
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,"Exactly. I want to see gameplay too, but we know exactly the kind of game it is going to be. A damn Rockstar game!"
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,It's gonna have a 2 hour single-player gameplay and an ever expanding multiplayer experience which is clearly where the developers put the main focus. Also lots and lots of ~~shark~~ buffalo cards.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,ya but the horse animation still is off
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"If there is a god, we‚Äôll be getting [this](https://i.imgur.com/VW584t3.jpg)

If there isn‚Äôt, we‚Äôll be getting [this](https://i.imgur.com/YS9vFsP.jpg)"
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Looks like the sutures are fresh. We'll probably witness rgw scarring. Also that's his characteristic grunt when the guy puts him on his knees. 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"From the post on Rockstar's website:

America, 1899. The end of the wild west era has begun as lawmen hunt down the last remaining outlaw gangs. Those who will not surrender or succumb are killed. After a robbery goes badly wrong in the western town of Blackwater, Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde gang are forced to flee. With federal agents and the best bounty hunters in the nation massing on their heels, the gang must rob, steal and fight their way across the rugged heartland of America in order to survive. As deepening internal divisions threaten to tear the gang apart, Arthur must make a choice between his own ideals and loyalty to the gang who raised him."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,It's May. Plenty of months and news to go. 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Cant we just be happy it looks like a compelling story with an obvious focus on single player. 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Rockstar and E3? Since when do they attend?
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Yeah that's a good point
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Everyone!
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,They're hoping you'll buy it for console then buy it for PC a year later. With all the PC sales they have had they can fuck off. I bet they looked at how many people bought it for both last time and decided to capitalise on it again.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,They will be missing out on A LOT of revenue from PC players.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Exactly how I feel. They should notice how well GTA V did on PC, so why not continue on that path "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Have you done that since 2001? Because that's how long this has been their business practice.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,"How are you expecting us to believe, that you're going to ignore RDR2, when you couldn't even ignore reddit post about new trailer of RDR2? PC-kids are hilarious!"
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"In case you're not joking, please find someone to talk to."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,">this game is my reason to stay alive a little bit longer.

This was my realization why I got depressed somewhere after GTA 5 premiere, there were less and less games I cared about to the point I had nothing to do in my life, now there's no game I'm excited about, I replay old shit and browse Internet all day. GTA and The Sims were the biggest games in my life and The Sims 4 got destroyed and there's no new GTA for 5 years now."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Gotta hold on to those reasons where we can find them.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,The Last of Us Part 2 and this game for me. At least this game has a release date! Who knows when TLOU 2 will ever come out.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"You‚Äôre right. But GTAV still had a fleshed out story worth full price, and I paid it then. The multiplayer was just a bonus where they made their money back. 

What I‚Äôm hoping is it‚Äôll be the same case for this game. The full game is well worth the 60, the multiplayer is just extra where they make even more money. As long as it doesn‚Äôt go crazy with it like everyone fears I‚Äôm sure we will be fine"
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Had they known GTA Online would secure their finances forever they would've probably allocated a lot more resources and marketing to it. When GTA V was being developed, GTA was still all about the singleplayer. "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,"That was before they discovered microtransactions though. I'm very skeptical about these trailers, considering the game is just guaranteed to be a vessel for microtransactions."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"I just like to know in which ways I will find my pride and accomplishment in this title

just being facetious....I've been looking forward to this game since I beat the first one, bring it on!"
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Absolutely, but that probably needs to be more fine tuned. We've got 5 months to go and also E3 coming up next month so they need something to show then."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,I really enjoyed Fallout 4. 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,More like triple dip. Most of the console bros bought the game twice +maybe PC later
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"What the fuck are you talking about? PC gaming earned more money than ps and xbox together last year. Just these companies are run by greedy cunts who think people will go and buy consoles+ game and than buy same game for PC. Well fuck them i would rather not play it than be milked by sony,xbox and greedy gaming companies like rockstar."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,[removed]
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"How much of GTA V was ruined because of microtransactions?  The single player was amazing and well worth the price of entry.  I expect the same here, even if they saddle (hah, see what I did there?) RDR2: Online with MTs.

"
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,If they implement it like gta v I don't mind. I had hundreds of hours of fun in gta online and never spent a penny on shark cards. Yes it may be a bit grindy if you realllly give a shit about having the newest gun/vehicle but otherwise it won't affect your game surely. 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,That's a pretty pathetic outlook. 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Calm down Satan
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,That's been known for some time now.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"RDR2 is set in 1899 and RDR1 was set in 1911, definitely a prequel"
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,This has been known
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Bold prediction.

8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,this /\
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,People just like complaining man. Let the game come out and then decide if it‚Äôs shit
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,I think there were a few shots spattered in there that were probably gameplay (like the bit at 1:31 where Arthur tackles a guy).
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Rockstar don‚Äôt go to E3, except once for the unveiling of GTA IV."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"No, I mean the main character we are controller. It can‚Äôt be Marston. He looks much different. "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"I dunno, games like Battlefield 1, Horizon Zero Dawn, God of War look better than this does. these could be in-game cut scenes."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Most likely running on an Xbox One X considering it can do 4k, and Rockstar don't pre-render. It will be all in-game footage, and if they are cutscenes, the cutscenes will be using in-game assets. 

Exactly the same as GTA V."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"You haven't seen games on the Xbox one X, assassins creed origins, far cry, the division to name a few look insane on it.

I wasn't a fan of the whole 4k thing, I preferred 1080p 60fps to start with. But those resolutions make a BIG difference, even on a 1080p tv with supersampling. 

Can't wait to play this on the X"
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Yup. Congrats! You won the karma jackpot!
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02, well we need that online has to evolve 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,[removed]
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"I think part of yearly release expectation comes from enormous companies like Ubisoft who pump out AAA games (Assassin‚Äôs Creed, among others) every single year, for years now. Ubi has so many different studios around the world, they can work on multiple games at once, releasing them yearly."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,There is no PC version.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,It's the second game in the Red Dead Redemption series. Red Dead Revolver is a very seperate game and it isn't a part of the RDR series.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,"*white stallion that goes faster*

8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Thank you
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Rockstar doesn't go to E3. 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"dude, you shared the trailer for a game you don't really have any additional information on. you don't need to reply to everyone in this thread with your unreasonable theories. people are not commenting to gain your limited insight. "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,"In the game engine or not, it‚Äôs not a video of real gameplay. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm interested in seeing."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"I'm not sure what one has to do with the other.

They can obviously do whatever they want. It's their game. I was hoping for gameplay."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,Jesus. Get triggered much? 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"I'm not too bothered about visuals, they show plenty of that off here. I just want to see what they're doing with the gameplay, like are they keeping the shooting mechanics from GTAV? It also looks like we might play as the entire crew, so that would be cool! Either that or it's going to be co-op missions similar to GTA Online Heists, which were cool but it was a NIGHTMARE to find a crew good enough to do it."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,It doesn't stop me wanting to see gameplay for RDR2! It's just hard to get excited by story trailers alone.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Yep exactly. So i hope the story is good at least. I just think it's a missed opportunity not setting it during it's ""prime""."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,A good amount of people on here are bitching alot about a game they barely know anything about...will you people learn to be patient and give shit a chance?
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"*BUTTHURT ALERT**

Must take a small mind to extrapolate from what I actually said, to thinking I said I know the entire story.  Maybe I'm giving you guys too much credit. Allow me to clarify.... The story SHOWN is just a joke. "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Except for his trademark grunt.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"I saw the stitches, and recognized Marston immediately. I'm talking about the voiceover. It sounds similar to JM, and actually sounds similar to the grunt Marston makes in the trailer as he is shoved to the ground. "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,They had 2 or 3 gameplay trailers in the months leading up to release explaining single player and multiplayer gameplay 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,We just want some gameplay :( 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Bullshit, GTA 5 was at E5 2013 & E3 2014"
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Sshhh they'll hear you 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Haha sure why not, a bitcoin should do the trick."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,are you kidding me.. You see how many whales they have in GTAV on PC? I expect this to be GTA Online with horses honestly. I'm hoping for a great single player campaign but I have a feeling that will take a backseat to online
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Why they should not make pc port?Take Two loves money, why exclude one platform and make less money?"
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,what? They already confirmed PC.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,"It will be delayed, but there's no way they won't bring out a PC version, the amount of people double dipping it will be insane."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,:(
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,"I'm very envious of you, both for having the time to play RDR2 and that you've finished uni/college. "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Yes. RDR1 takes place in 1911, RDR2 is 1899."

8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,We've never known if he would even be in the game at all until now.  I hope he's playable.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"As long as the single player game is good I don't give a damn, people that play these sorts of games exclusively for the online aspect confuse me. "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"As long as the story is as good as RDR1, I couldn't give a fuck less about Online and whatever sort of Cowboy Cash they'll be pimping. "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,You don‚Äôt have to play online

8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,So just play the single player then. That‚Äôs what Rockstar gets right. 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Listen bitch,it will be 25-30 hours of amazing single player action and millions maybe even billions of buffalo bills***"

8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Why the downvotes? Those manes sure look strange.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"both maps combined would be amazing. especially if they could remaster RDR as a dlc for you to play after arthur's story ends. probably a pipe dream, but its fun to imagine"
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Honestly thatd be too big off a map for me,the new map looks bigger then the old map atleast.id be okay with it like that"
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"I believe there was talk about Armadillo being in the game so the map will atleast expand to there, hopefully!"

8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,I would love the large map but realistically speaking it seems outside the scope of development 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Where did that new map come from?  Is that a leaked image or something?
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,I don't think we'll get them combined for the main game but i could imagine them being joined together for the online gameplay.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,Pretty sure it will be everything north of the river that separates the US from Mexico.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Yeah the trailer seemed pretty straightforward. It's a story about the disintegration of Dutch's gang and a little bit of Marston origin on the side. All of this through the lense of Arthur. 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"They already did the ""dying west"" theme in RDR. I was hoping for a ""golden age"" western :("
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"So, it's the plot of ""Godless""."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,It sounds like watching The Wild Bunch could be a good way to get ready for the game.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,But when rockstar talks about the game once a year we really don‚Äôt learn much. The release date is only like 6 months away 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,"I truly love your optimism, but I think it's unfounded."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,GTA V for next gen was unveiled in E3
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"They don't, but you can dream"
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Joke's on them, i don't own a Playstation or Xbox so it's just lost sales."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"I think they're taking the GTAV approach with this one as well; it's gonna come out first on the X1 and PS4, then several months later on PC.  I'm sure there will be those that double dip to play it as soon as it comes out on consoles, then again on PC due to much better performance/graphics."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,I think it's likely to come out for PC. But they'll give it a year or two in order to bring an influx of revenue to help TTWO's stock.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,I'm pretty sure GTA V still sold very well on PC. 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,They don't want to miss out on the people who will buy it on console and then again later on PC. I fell for it with GTAV but I learned my lesson.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Yup
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,"I came here to see if they had announced anything for the PC. I haven't even watched the trailer since the page it's on clearly doesn't list the PC as a system... No need.

"
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Nobody really knows for sure yet, but evidence shows it will be sooner than later "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,[deleted]
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"The difference being now with RDR2, they're fully aware of the money to be made from Online. I'm fully expecting a good story but shorter than normal and all the Online and microtransactions and add ons for Online only that we can handle."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,That‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm saying
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Well GTAV was an odd circumstance...cause it was 2 console generations + PC.  I mean, I absolutely triple dipped on GTAV after I get a PC powerful enough to handle it without an issue and don't regret it at all (seeing as I waited until it was on sale for half price on both X1 and PC), but I really doubt people are gonna be buying RDR2 on both X1 and PS4, then again on PC.  We're too far out from PS5 and Xbox One 2 for that to matter on this game.  GTA6 on the other hand..."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Tupac was an untalented hack, and a criminal. "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"The thing is they didn't realize how much the could make from MTs when making gta 5, now that gta online has been a a huge success afterwards, take two has said it's the way forward."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"I haven't played GTA in a while, but is Rockstar still restricting the DLC cars to online mode only? That's what made me lose faith in Rockstar and GTA. What reason would they have to do something like that?"
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,[deleted]
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"I don't know, I'm not sure, I think we need more data to decide if it's a prequel or not, maybe it's just a dream sequence or a flashback."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,I expect it to be a game made by Rockstar that will debut in October.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"The gameplay is clearly going to be like every other rockstar game, essentially the same, but improved. GTA IV was excellent gameplay for the time, RDR improved that, then GTA V improved that. I'm sure RDR2 will be GTAV style mechanics, except even better. And GTA V had excellent gameplay, as did RDR. I'm not even slightly worried about gameplay. Even if it was only as good as the original RDR I'd still buy it. "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"spoiler alert. It will be a open world 3rd person shooter. 

Like every other fucking R* game. What do you want dude? It's gonna be like red dead 1 but prettier."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,dude can't you fucking wait you'll see it eventually 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,[deleted]
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Yeah they are clearly better but none of them have the size of RDR2 
i can tell that RDR2 will have a massive world with rich details and alive cities with lots of activities unlike BF1 which is a multiplayer game, HZD which actually has an open world but it's mostly open empty areas, GOW is a semi-liner game so they have more room for graphics

8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,A man can dream...
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,I don't know how well **Red Dead Redemption: Something Else** would go over with fans of the original game...
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Also because they were just reskinning the games for the most part
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,"I imagine there will be things that could almost be considered easter eggs since this is a prequel, but you'd be fine jumping straight into this. On a personal note, try your best to find a way to play the first one. It's legitimately one of my favorite gaming experiences. "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Dude I will comment as much as a like.

Plus, commenting increases Reddit's algorithm for rising hot and top."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,"me too, but this is what rockstar does. they release 2 or 3 story trailer like this, and then a month or two before release we get the narriated ""welcome to los santos"" types of gameplay trailers that explain how the world is and what you can do.

so it will come just give it time."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,"Not at all, just stating facts ;-) "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"I don't think Multiplayer gameplay was shown until ages after release.. It didn't even come with the game at release, we had to wait a few months / 6 months"
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,It's rdr. What kinda game do you think it'll be? 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Do you know what ‚Äúas a general rule‚Äù means?

I never said that Rockstar NEVER shows anything at E3, just that they usually don‚Äôt."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,also buy ingame currency to minimize grinding in the single player! We've also decided to add rpg elements so that you can play more game!
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,"I want to get my game positively reviewed as well, but my game is pretty difficult can I send you cheat codes or something so that whoever plays it doesn't complain about the difficulty?  "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,They'll probably put it out on PC when there's new console and they can re-release it again. Same shit with GTA V
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,They haven't even released a PC version of the first red dead.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,I'll believe they'll release it on PC when they release it on PC.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Where?
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Lemme turn that frown upsidedown friend  

):  

    wait no"
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,"Well I'm on year 5 now so it's about time! Don't worry I've been there before though, many great games have collected dust while I focused on school. The silver lining is you can wait until it gets cheaper!"
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,1899 is the year my grandfather was born. It's amazing to think the world was so different just 2 generations ago.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Maybe they're going for a prequel/sequel story, like Godfather II?"
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,">Yes. RDR1 takes place in 1911, RDR2 is 1899.

Kind of sucks because I would really want to see the transition between horses and cars more like in RDR1 when there we be the first cars on the streets and horses along, those were very interesting times. Can you imagine your character learning in a driving school how to drive those cars? lmao"
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-11,Yes I did but it was years ago so maybe I'm not remembering correctly but didn't the game pick up with his son Jack after John was killed?
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,I'm pretty sure they've established that there's one playable character: Arthur Morgan.

8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Holy shit. Didn't notice that at first. Nice.... 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,All the visuals look a bit dated. The optimist in me hopes that means they focused on story and gameplay!
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Yeah, I wouldn't count on that. From what I remember, RDR was an absolute mess of code and they don't even know how it worked."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,The site that leaked new screenshots also leaked that info.  The screens had never been seen prior so there's some credibility.  Fingers crossed!
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Area on top is the leaked map for RDR 2. People doubted it because of the original RDR locations like Blackwater, but this trailer basically confirmed that it‚Äôs legit "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Why? They've been developing for years, and it's not like R* is particularity small or adverse to large maps"
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"RDR 2 map leaked a long time ago, but nobody believed it due to the fact that it had locations from the original RDR. This trailer pretty much confirmed that it‚Äôs legit. 

Here‚Äôs a thread I made a while back with evidence that it‚Äôs the real deal https://reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/731wuy/the_leaked_map_is_real/"
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,And it's getting me pretty fucking hyped
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"If you think about it the idea of a western set in 1911 is absolutely ridiculous, I still don't know if it made sense, historically. 1899 though is much more like it."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Yeah, it's hard to hype a game you know so little about. "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,I'm not doubting you but I did have a few PC gamer friends who said exactly this about GTA 5 and then ended up buying it as soon as it launched on PC.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Naw, for every one of you there is like three people who will buy both. 

Src: me and my brothers are the three. I'm sorry :("
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,It sucks though because I seriously want to play it
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Or 2 years later.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"The theory someone mentioned in this post about the game having the RDR1 map and the RDR1 game as a remastered DLC/addon to this game, where you continue after finishing RDR2, maybe they do both as a package on pc for a single purchase, fuuuuuuuuuck I'd throw money at the screen to play the RDR1 story again in this new engine."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"I recall reading on here recently that while the game costs like, $250 million, it had make something like 2 billion in a very short period of time (before online was a thing)."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Well I for one can't wait to purchase my rockethorse to use online.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,You're not very good at trolling. You need to be more subtle with it for it to be really effective and not immediately obvious
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,I take that to mean they will repeat what they did with GTA: O with RDR2: O.  But that doesn't mean RDR2 single player will suffer (just as GTA V's single player didn't suffer)
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"to make people play online and most likely pay money for shark cards to get those cool cars to play with. if they allowed them all in singleplayer, no one would bother getting them in multiplayer so badly cause they already enjoyed playing with them in single player."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,"It's the exact word I meant to use. Very apt. 

Why even pay attention to the game at that point?"

8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03, And who the heck is that? I have been trying to stay away from extra information to leave most of it as a surprise.  I figured you were someone from Ductch‚Äôs gang. 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"I mean, most of the world in Red Dead is empty desert type land too.."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,I wasn't comparing them directly. I was just pointing out that there are games out there that look better than this RDR2 trailer does using their in-game engines. So it's not out of the question that this trailer was all in-game engine cut scenes. 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Now make the no preorders meme and sit back 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"You did get 60 points in twenty minutes, and it‚Äôs only going to go up from here."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Well he said Red Dead Something else. I mean it would have made sense really. You had Red Dead Revolver followed by Red Dead Redemption. It's a bit illogical that the third game in the series is a prequel to the second game and called Red Dead Redemption 2. 

At the end of the day I don't really care but it did strike me as pretty odd when it was first announced."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"lol what? this isn't youtube...you attempts to game the algorithm are pointless. it's the rdr2 trailer and you got to put it on gaming first. it's not, not going to the front page.  
  

also, commenting and replying to everyone in a thread is cool, if you've provided some OC or have some additional insight into the topic, but you don't and as of right now your just adding the same ill-informed comments all over the place. just chill."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,Well my Xbox One X can easily run the game in 4K and 60FPS. So get good kid.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"You are incorrect entirely. There was a multiplayer trailer on August 15, 2013. Game came out September 17, 2013. GTA online was released 2 weeks later on October 1, 2013. "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,It was about 2 weeks from release until Online came out.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,I hope it's a post apocalyptic RPG. 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,I'm thinking post apocalyptic dystopian horror with some RPG elements. 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"I'm sure people want to see how it looks is all. Things like the new HUD, how the character moves around, are there new aiming mechanics, what maybe the map flow looks like, etc. Everyone knows it's going to be like RDR... but it's cool to see what things have maybe changed from an actual controlling the character perspective and not just cinematic angles on in game graphics. "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Obviously everyone knows what type of game it'll be, we'd just like to see how the game actually looks when playing it rather than loads of cinematics. "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,we just want conformation that it will play similarly to the first RDR. None of that gta 5 crap 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,VR Futanari dating sim
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Since they showed up for every last release, that rule is bullshit yea and they should be there again this year."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"This is exactly with what I came up, they gonna release their biggest seller GTA VI few months before new consoles 100&#37; so they can milk suckers twice for some slightly better graphics and new shit in the Online game, I bet my dick on it this is how it will be. So we're probably 1\-2 years before the new gen at least since there's not even annoucement about 6."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"I figure after RDR2 sales start to slow down they'll say ""Hey RDR 2 coming to PC! And if you preorder...you get RDR 1 remastered!!"" 

Their sales will skyrocket "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-04,"GTA released after this gens consoles were out, they ALSO released it to the 360/PS3 gen. Then PC released like a year and half later."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"It's because RAGE (Their engine) was in a really shitty stage (Everything wasn't in 1 place, every editor window was a different application) and they were surprised that the first RDR even worked on consoles, now that RDR2 is being made on the same (Or upgraded) version of the GTA 5 engine there's a possibility that we'll see a PC port."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"That doesnt mean anything.GTAV was successful on pc, there is no reason to not release pc version, especially if they will focus on online."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,But Red Dead Revolver did come out on PC :P I know what you meant.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,"My bad, maybe i‚Äôm crazy, I thought they had a trailer a few months ago with a PC logo, I remember it being a big deal. I have to dig."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,"That's a good point, waiting until the Christmas sales might be a better move anyway. Also, 5 years? What are you studying, if you don't mind my asking?"

8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,Jack Marston should actually be in this game. It takes place twelve years before RDR and he was a teenager in that. He should be around four years old.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,I never spent a dime on GTA Online and still had a blast with my friends. It's totally possible to do.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"I paid for the single player and enjoyed it. $60 seemed a fair price. If you don't like the multiplayer, don't play it. They won't get your money if you don't buy microtransactions. The same thing applies here. Is the campaign worth $60? If you don't think so, don't buy it. "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"I bought that game for the single player on my PS and thoroughly enjoyed it; then my buddy gifted it to me on Steam and I play only with my friends from time to time. I've really not invested myself in it to the extent that I really have any complaints, I have fun getting stoned and screwing around with my buds online. That's pretty much it."

Also never bought any Shark Cards "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Believe it or not, there's an older generation of players that might not be that interested in it. Or at the very least not so much so that their entire opinion of the game is centered around the online experience.  "

THATS what motivated me to not get the most out GTA V. "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"If I'm able to I jump onto multiplayer as quick as possible to run around and have fun with my friends when the game first releases. Usually I'll start the campaign the next day when nobody else is on and play that until some buddies get on and then we go fuck around. Eventually people drift away from the multiplayer for other games or life and then I play the single player for as long as I feel like. I'm a bit of an odd gamer though because I don't particularly care about finishing a game, I usually just play them until I'm not enjoying myself anymore or something comes along that I'd rather enjoy. I think it's far more important to have fun and enjoy your time playing, however you feel like doing that, than to force myself to finish a game once my enthusiasm has waned. I'm definitely the outlier among my peers for this mentality though."

8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,You can‚Äôt blame rockstar for focusing on the biggest source of revenue of the game. That‚Äôs how you run a business. They would be stupid to not capitalize on profits when people are basically throwing money at them. 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"I feel like graphics have hit a point now where they are all pretty gorgeous, and I don't really mind if a developer decides not to make them ultra-realistic like God of War or Detroit: Become Human or something. The game is going to be gorgeous regardless, I'm more interested in it running well and feeling good than having the latest and greatest graphics on a game that has been in development for 4-6 years."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"After playing God of War, the visuals in this trailer definitely stand out in a bad way. It's the animation more than anything and I know Rockstar has always had these rigid arm movement and stuff, but it's the subtle details they need to improve to keep up visually. 

But for the love of god they need to get the horse animations down. They absolutely killed it with the first game, so they need to at least maintain that level of excellence with the sequel."

>When Red Dead Redemption was in production, the Housers were in charge. Benzies had no role in its making until, he says, things started to fall apart

>Benzies alleges that Sam Houser sent him the following email message. ""PLEASE help me/us get [Read Dead Redemption] into shape. I am a jabbering wreck right now. I need The Benz!"" The way he tells it, 'the Benz' stepped in and saved the day.

Suddenly them not knowing how it works makes sense--Rockstar can't lose face by trying to bring the expert who fixed the game back to help with the code he or his team were responsible for because they're involved in a protracted legal battle with him over how they told him to take a sabbatical then fired him and revoked his clearances while he was gone. They also shafted him out of his royalties.

Frankly, if all this shakes out out, *fuck the Housers*, and, by extension, this game."

Now they know about how munch money they can make from online from the start of development so it may hamper single player content. Because now they most likely put more resources into MP rather than SP because they make way more money off MP.

""In God of War‚Äôs case, the increased resolution isn‚Äôt worth the frame rate trade-off. We tried the 4K mode during our review period, and found that the game sometimes failed to maintain its 30 fps target. The drops happened often enough ‚Äî both in combat and in merely exploring the world ‚Äî to make us want to switch to Performance mode. The frame rate was more variable there; it didn‚Äôt stay locked at 60 fps, which would be a lot to ask.

8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"When I think of my grandfather who lived from 1899-1983, I realize he was born 4 years before the Wright brothers took flight, and died 14 years after the moon landing.

I really makes me think what the world will be like by the end of my lifetime. It feels mundane, but with the advent of (household) internet and cell phones alone, the world is already so different."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Imagine being a kid and seeing A Trip to the Moon in 1902 then living to see the first men to land on it 66 years later.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Obviously there were large military tech advancements from the 1860s to 1914 (e.g. smokeless powder) but the gap is over exaggerated. Civil War muskets had rifled barrels, and the French Army began using [bolt action breechloading rifles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chassepot) in 1866. Also, the Gatling gun was used for the first time during the Civil War, so rapid-firing guns were already a thing in the 1860s (what changed was how militaries used rapid-firing guns)."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,"I always think about this when I see people my parents' age (60's) using a cell phone.

They won't get your money if you don't buy microtransactions. The same thing applies here. Is the campaign worth $60? If you don't think so, don't buy it.

Yeah, it sucks they didn't release SP DLC's but oh well they won't get my money, I can't say there weren't enough great GTA's during all those years, it had to end at one point, nothing lasts forever.

GTA was a major part of my gaming experience but I accepted the fact that it will never be the same at it was."

8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Exactly. Like, I‚Äôve seen games with way better visuals than they‚Äôre showing in these trailers, and I could not care less. It looks fine, it‚Äôs good enough."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,"Absolutely. At this stage, it's more important to maintain a good and consistent aesthetic than strive always for photorealism. That tends to be more the R* way."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"I have a feeling God of War is going to affect my thoughts on many games going forward.  I finished GoW a few days ago and since I was in need of something to play I finally decided to start playing The Witcher III which I have owned for about 2 years but never started.  Now, I have heard nothing but great feedback about The Witcher, but I can say, my first impression after playing it for about 3 hours last night was that it was extremely buggy, awkward and no where near as pretty as I had heard.

Granted, this is an older gamer, it is open world so there is a lot the game has to account for, etc., but starting it right after GoW was probably a mistake. GoW was just so polished and those visuals are unmatched."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Whenever a rockstar game comes out I always feel it‚Äôs a little behind other games as far as graphics. Like vice city and shit looked hideous to me even when it first came out. But they make up for it in every other aspect of a video game. They focus more on innovation in physics and gameplay, story and characters etc."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Well I think from the very beginning since release they have gone on the record to say they couldn't bring it to any other platform. Considering Benzies left at least 4 years later I don't think he was the limiting factor on bringing it over to pc and other consoles. 

I'm not really commenting on his allegations because, well, none of us know the truth ATM. But I think this is a separate issue to porting it."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,"Also the weaponry. Not a huge difference I suppose but it's something to consider with a shooter. I felt like it was alright though, they were definitely pushing the boundaries historically but the story made sense. The entire theme of the game was based around a modern world pushing its way into the antiquated wild west, and Marston being a symbol of it and having one last hurrah. 

I mean, nowadays we have very popular games doing things like giving WW1 soldiers SMG's and LMG's, or putting wrist crossbows on super-assassins or something. Extending an era by 10 years is a drop in the bucket compared to what many games have done."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"It's a theory but does make sense I think. Gta v has consistently been the top seller on steam for the last three years, rdr1 isn't out on pc, Rockstar have not mentioned a peep about rdr2 for pc. Maybe they do rdr2 later with rdr1 as an addon or separate pc game to maximise profits, but they've got to be coming. 

From a pure money perspective, and Rockstar is one of the richest game dev companies out there, it is a loss move to not put it out on pc, considering the pc version was responsible for a decent chunk of all gta v revenue. Money drives these decisions and this decision is plain and simple. They might delay it but its definitely coming. "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,Not really. Don't forget Red Dead Redemption is open world with Multiplayer support unlike God of war and HZA.
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Bro, I'm not COMPARING the graphics directly.

All that I'm saying is that since those games look great and have fantastic in-game cut scenes that it isn't out of the realm of possibility that THIS TRAILER is all in-game. Did you even read the beginning of this comment chain?

Quit trying to get offended at something that isn't there."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,good luck with that. 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-03,"Do you even know how much more powerful an X is compared to a Pro? It‚Äôs a night and day difference in between the two..

Edit: Did you also just say that RDR2 is going to be a PS4 exclusive?....."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"They released a few narrated videos explaining different aspects of the game such as multiplayer free roam etc for the first Red dead such as [this one](https://youtu.be/fYaC2cDxor8)

Can't remember if they did the same for GtaV, but I hope we'll have those longer narrated videos for this one as well. Wouldn't surprise me if they popped up in the months leading to launch.

But in reality, that's all hidden behind ridiculous prices. The issue is your expectations/desires not meeting reality. I'd pay insane amounts of money for the game you imagine, but that game doesn't exist. Instead, I'll pay $60 for a game from a company that has reliably given us quality SP content. Until they no longer do that, I'll keep supporting their work. If this game fails to do that, I won't purchase their next title. "
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Fucking over their customers? Wow, you are delusional. For $60 we got one of the greatest single player games ever made, plus a tacked-on free-to-play MMO. It‚Äôs not a global phenomenon because of the fucking online mode, people buy Rockstar games for their outstanding singleplayer, and they once again delivered with GTAV. So you didn‚Äôt get your precious SP DLC? First of all, they have done that *once*, with GTA4, a game that was *clearly* designed from the beginning to be told from three different perspectives. Second, the story in V was done, there was nothing more to be told. I would have liked more too, but it would just be filler. I cannot fathom how much this bothers some people, how long you keep this grudge. It‚Äôs been years, get over it.
  
They decided not to do SP DLC, and the team went to other projects most likely RDR2 and GTA6. Meaning those games will be higher quality, because the content they produce for GTAO is the work of a fraction of all their devs. They take 5-6 years to make their games now, and the quality will be fucking fantastic like it always is. So go ahead and whine about the fucking online mode while the rest of the world enjoys their amazing singleplayer experience."

8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"Me too. It‚Äôs not terribly sound and my mind is still formulating a bigger theory, but we can tell from the other trailers Arthur‚Äôs loyalties are obviously torn between himself and the gang, possibly this arises after leaving Marston for dead after that botched bank robbery. Maybe Marston kills Arthur due to a misunderstanding of Arthur‚Äôs involvement. Leaving us once again sad over the fate of our protag, but at least we get to be killed by John fucking Marston."
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,I don't think people are buying GTA V for SP anymore. I would only play SP. But I bet majority of players just skip SP completely.

8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,So that means their focus on MP (post release) makes even more sense... 
8gi1uf,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,"It broke six Guiness World Records before online was even released, including fastest selling entertainment launch in history. They have built the series up over two decades to the point that it‚Äôs now a global cultural phenomenon. And it‚Äôs not because of the goddamn multiplayer.

hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,"New homescreen, thank you talented stranger!"
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,Absolutly stunning. Im going to use it as my background
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,Amazing. That is now my lockscreen haha!
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,Damn that's amazing
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,Shame you could only sit to fish from a boat. They had so much of the minutia down in that game but they overlooked how most people fish (not fly fishers).
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,I love it. How much?
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,No words
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,"This gives me so much feels and I have yet to play Red Ded 2, you've really done well to capture that night feel (coming from a big time night-lover) and the  textures are really nice, I hope you have more works somewhere on the interwebs."
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,Well that's not my home screen. What paint did you use?
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,Wow this looks amazing! The colours are so perfect üëå
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,"I would buy this. In fact, I wanna buy this, but I'm broke"
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,"Damn, that‚Äôs talent. You captured the lighting so well. Big pp!"
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,You litterially posted this same picture with the credits of the real artist on r/art
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,I'd buy this
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,"Fun fact, if you fish in a full moon you most likely won‚Äôt catch any fish"
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,Truly beautiful!
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,Adorable!!!!!!!
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,"You, sir, are a fish."
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,"When i First Saw It thought It was a photography, then i looked at the moon and noticed It is a painting"
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,Try a contrasting vignette for the corners and compare it to the black. The painting is beyond awesome I'm just curious if a lighter vignette will tone down the horror vibe I'm getting.
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,"Saving this, coming back soon!! I love it"
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,Are you the same person who posted it on r/art? If so then good job. It looks beautiful.
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,"Already wallpaper, amazing work"
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,Looks very realistic.
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,I'm stunned. Wow. Just wow.
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,More

hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,Jesus this is incredible holy shit.
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,Honestly it's gorgeous. You should be proud that it came out so well. Love the contrast of the moon colors with everything else. Draws the eye in.
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,I fucking love it bro/sis
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,"First of all, thanks for posting it, I was searching for some kind of art like this because fishing is my hobby and I love it so much, because my dad thought me when I was little and I'm still into it, and I might tattoo this on my arm or somthing."
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,I‚Äôd totally buy this. Gorgeous painting!
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,So beautiful.
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,That's the DreamWorks guy?
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,"Be careful tho, there are bots who take the pictures from Reddit to sell them as plates in their shady websites"
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,This is now my new permanent phone wallpaper.
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,that is such a cool painting
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,That's my phone wallpaper now. Stunning work friend!
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,You are too powerful.
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,Your Stress painting looks like the 12th Doctor. If you paint a Doctor Who inspired painting. Let me know.
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,Incredible! I love the way you did the lighting.
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,How much would you sell it for? It‚Äôs absolutely stunning!
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,The moonlight is extremely realistic. Absolutely fantastic.
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,You should crosspost this to /r/ImaginarySliceOfLife.
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,Wow

hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,I didn't know that Freddy Krueger likes fishing
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,"And now I want to play the game , just for fishing and hunting and camping. SO SATISFYING"
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,"Looks a bit like the cover of some Cosmic Horror story.

Nice."
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,Dark
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,The fish asleep
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,"I want this in my home and I‚Äôm not even a RDR fan. I love the feelings evoked, great stuff man"
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,Awesome work !

hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,*a fine addition to my collection*

hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-07,He was visited by old Greg
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-07,Wow! O_O
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-07,Alternate title: Fishing at noon after Yellowstone explosion.
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-07,is nice
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,"As someone who has fished in a situation very similar to this, I love it. I don't think it quite captures the wonderful feeling of fishing at the end of a dock on a perfectly still lake where the water looks almost the same as the sky, but I still live the painting

I've never played rdr2 tho"
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,Thank you!
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,"

Thanks! Should be prints available here: https://joseph-feely.pixels.com/featured/under-the-temples-shadow-joseph-feely.html"
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,Exactly!
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,Marketing 101: know your audience
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,"I was about to say the exact same thing. Its a stunning painting, the fisherman is too dark though when you see the reflected moon on the water beside him, he'd be more lit up than that.
Beautiful painting though OP, fantastic work."
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,Thank you so much
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,"Yeah, I am the real artist :P"
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,"Yep right here!

hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,Freakin internet critics... ;)
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,Are you the same person that did the painting of Yharnam?
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,Thanks!
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,What‚Äôs the difference between the art print and poster?
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,Bingo
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,"Oh okay, that makes sense"
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,Yeah
hm261s,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,"Generally the difference is in the level of quality. Wall posters are typically printed in large volume on less expensive paper, fine-art posters are printed on high-quality paper, and fine-art prints are printed with careful attention to true color reproduction on high-quality paper."
