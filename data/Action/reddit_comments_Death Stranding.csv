17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Same exact thing happened to me!

Bought the game bc I LOVE Kojima but I got bored 4 hours in.

2 years later, played it again and experienced a masterpiece"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Yep. I was immediately engaged by the scenery but at the same time was like WTAF is this? I stuck with it and it’s a masterpiece, easily one of favourites."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Maybe I’m in the wrong but the more I replayed it the more I enjoyed the first few hours.

When you crest over the hill going down to the ship-port outside the initial area and that music drop kicks in is legitimately one of my favorite moments I’ve had in gaming."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,One of my favorite gaming experiences in the last few years.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I played the pc version at the beginning of the first lockdown. 

Jesus the story hit hard at that time."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Death Stranding is absolutely fantastic. One of the best games in the past 5 years
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Oh man this thread makes me want to pick it back up again. Now I'm worried I forgot everything or what's even going on and I dread starting over
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,[removed]
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I’ve told my friends that Death Stranding is a truly fantastic experience that I will never play again lol. There was something so oddly engaging about the gameplay loop in DS combined with the typical Kojima flare that made for a great time. 

That being said I am excited for DS2"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I was mesmerised by death stranding.

A lot of the complaints I hear are surrounding things that appear deliberate.

Some complaint that its slow. Monotonous and labourious at times. Especially the beginning. I would argue that that is deliberate. 

It gives you a real sense if progress as you traverse the world and you have all these new tools at your disposal. 

It also gives you great contrast between the action scenes and BT attacks.

I loved the freedom of forging my own path. Literally."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I think the draw of Death Stranding is that it's an actual 3D platformer. Most open world games (Farcry etc) you just take the quickest path between two points, but in Death Stranding you actually have to consider terrain and hazards in a way you normally never do."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Keep on, keeping on! The game is fantastic."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"It’s extremely atmospheric, and for a game that is so strongly themed around isolation, it made you feel extremely connected to other players, both from finding helpful builds when you needed it most, and for thoughtful constructions to benefit others. I got a lot more pride than I would have expected when my constructions would amass hundreds of thousands of likes during the early weeks of release."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Time to bring back BB Theme https://youtu.be/Ghk1RFr51xo?si=sKYw6aj4XUCpeI8H
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,One of my favorite games of all time. There's just so much to it that it would take some time to say what makes this one of the best games ever. I'm glad you discovered that. 👍
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I sadly could not get into it, even though I tried for a longer while. The pile of games I would like to play is just so big at this point, so after trying for 15 hours to get caught by it, I gave up. The story seems interesting, but the gameplay loop still did not click. I rather settle for a game that catches me in the first 1-2 hours, even if it means I miss out on the odd masterpiece."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"There was something surreal about playing this in the first year of the pandemic, where the surface plot was about uniting individually-isolated families and communities with necessities and humanity."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I picked up the game after a few years passed, when i picked it up .. goddamn, the game was amazing. I even form a bond with the cute Baby. Cannot wait for the sequel.. i will buy it, might preorder it."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,The chiral bandwidth at the later stages of the game was amazing. And the weather systems. I may play the directors cut again.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"It’s great! It’s one of those games that plays way better than it looks. What you don’t pick up from watching videos about is, is just how enjoyable the walking mechanic actually is. That it puts you in a constant state of gaming, just walking from A-to-B, trying to stay upright. It’s a hugely enjoyable and incredibly tactile game to play. It’s genius!"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,One of my favorite games of all time!
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,One of my favorite games ever. Loved all the MGS games and was stoked for this. Was put off by initial reviews but decided to heck with. Got completely absorbed and loved it all. Story can be a bit wacky but the moment to moment gameplay is truly wonderful. Not for everyone but the open world exploration with asynchronous online play made if truly special.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Last year I was driving to StMoritz in my car. The last part of the trip is the Julier Pass. It was a rainy and foggy day and the scenery around me was 100% Death Stranding. So I streamed the Song ""Don't Be So Serious"" from Low Roar and boy, I was literally in that game. Kojima sure knows Switzerland."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Death Stranding gives me the same vibes as RDR2 when you just set off and explore, or even Nier: Automata. 

It's very much about the journey and the deliberate movement and traversal tools and decisions you have to make along the way. It forces you to engage with the world in a very different way. 

Such a unique game. Everything from the world, the sci-fi elements, the narrative, the animations, the audio system, etc.  It's all absolutely Kojima levels of perfected insanity. Loved every minute of it."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Hot take: Writing that's *meant* to be silly isn't actually silly, it's just good writing. Things should be judged based on how well they accomplish the thing they are trying to do."

17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I wish Death stranding didn't have the monsters and other action sequences. 

No monsters, no guns, just difficult terrain and more gameplay mechanics revolving around stamina management and land navigation."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Looking at the PS trophies(DS ps4) you can see more than half of the players give up before reaching chapter 3. So they couldn't pull through the tutorial and called it a walking simulation with nothing happened whatsoever. Half of the players didn't even complete one (1) standard order.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,I think re-treking through familiar terrain was my “click” moment. The first time I traveled through sucked but knowing how to traverse back my second time was awesome
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Same with me, I played 2 hours and was like no thanks. Went away from it about 6 weeks, hit a gaming lul and played it by time I got to chp 3 I was hooked and realized how great that game was."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I knew it was a game for me, it's still in my top ten of all time list. But it's absolutely a title not meant for everybody."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,40 hours in and I am not even halfway through the story. Even then it doesn't feel like a slog at all. This game is a gem.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I'm not a Kojima fan, I never gave any shit about who makes a game, I just play the game as I like it. And Death Stranding is one of the most memorable gaming experience for me.

- fresh idea, not random copy-paste ARPG again.
- most open world games are boring when you are travelling from A to B. But this game makes that travel as the mission.
- the story is unique, weird, and fascinating. like Silent hill.
- the atmosphere is really relaxing."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Thanks man, I might revisit it myself now"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,Such a perfect and unique game. Kojima is a genius.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,Mads Mikkelsen's character might be my favorite videogame performance of all time. The scene where those guys are trying to bust into the room is probably the most compelling cutscene I've seen in a videogame period.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"The getting into the game takes hours yeah. But once you do you get sucked into a masterpiece.        
       
As abstract the story may be, they built upon different real world concepts and beliefs."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Kojima heard ""it's about the journey and not the destination"" and then made a game about that. The traversal is so goddamn calming it's mindblowing. Also if Death Stranding is a ""walking simulator"" then actual walking simulators need a new name. Personally i would classify the gameplay as simulating hiking or mountaineering even"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Awh man. Join the subreddit we will love you!  Its one of the most amazing stories ever!
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I've been gaming since 1987. 36 years and going. Death Stranding is the greatest game of the 21st century to me. Yes, it's a delivery simulator. But the story is jaw dropping the first time you see it through. My OCD loves doing the deliveries.... My thirst for good stories makes me glad I played through it 3 times in 2 years. Fantastic game and I am crawling up the walls for the sequel. Good thing I'm playing Final Fantasy 14 right now.... It'll definitely keep me busy until DS 2 is here."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I really really like the story telling and the world building in this game. The first opening hour was phenomenal. I was instantly hooked on the game and wanted to know more about the games story.

Game is much better to play online as you will have access to the things built by other players."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"This game only delivered in story for me.
Everything else about it really didn’t capture my attention at all.
I was relieved when I finished it but also mind blown by the story.
With that said I hope DS2 ditches the package delivery to a certain extent."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,Exact same now death stranding is in my top 5
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I love Death Stranding

I'm just finishing my first postman run. No ziplines, no vehicles, no skeletons. Only gear you can use is ladders, ropes and floating trolleys

I have enjoyed playing this way immensely."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,I unapologetically love all things Kojima. I love rain and (I don't really know how to describe it) the sensation of being under an open overpass and rain coming down in front of me. That coupled with the bases being a secured safe refuge where you can have a brief respite from the storming struggles outside triggered some ASMR type psychological feeling in me that really made me enjoy the game above and beyond being a Kojima fan boy and enjoying the game in general.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I enjoyed the gameplay and the story.  The game actually does communicate, I think, the tactile pleasure of hiking and mountaineering, of placing your footing and balance and tools just so in order to overcome an obstacle."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"It seems really similar to Witcher 3 in that, a lot of people have false starts, but upon revisiting it, end up *loving* it."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,Absolute technical masterpiece!
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I played it for like 4 hours and really liked it last year but just moved onto other games, may go back to it after seeing this bc I didn’t get to Chapter 3"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,This is why its called the best game you cant recommend to anyone
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,I had so much fun unlocking road and building a zip line network once I realized they are bidirectional
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"The way ive told people to play it, is skip all the extra little mission and plough through the main stuff. It was get too tedious if you do every mission."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I typically like linear story based games and the more linear the better for me usually but this game really was enjoyable for me. I normally get bored with large open worlds because I get so focused on the missions. Getting to the waypoint is a waste of time for me usually, but this game made the traversal between pieces the mission itself. That’s what made me actually have a ton a fun."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Loved it, yes it has the Kojima cheese but the vistas, music, atmosphere, gameplay/controls are just top class. At the end of the day it tried something different and i commend it for that."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I really love that game! The atmosphere and characters plus gameplay were something refreshing for me at that time when released. It's definitely a solid game, but it's very misunderstood by many."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-22,"Fantastic game, there’s nothing like it. Glad to know anytime someone gets into DS."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-11-19,"Your post is what lead me to download the game and the first 3 hours, I was blown away from the BGM, the suspense, the world."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2024-01-03,"Played it at the junction of the 2022-2023. Each day for at least 3 hours. Some deliveries actually can take up to 50 minutes :) 

Then felt burned out and just dropped it. Though all the time it was always in the back of my head, that I must see the end of this. 

Tried to continue at the end of this August, but the skills have already been lost. Thought that moving to the beginning of the map and doing some side deliveries will help to retrain myself to all the intricacies of the game. Didn't work out, so I started from the beginning last week - and never looked back. 

This is a real Masterpiece!"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2024-03-04,"I just finished the game yesterday after giving up on it 1 years back. Now I understand why people say that the game becomes easy after Chapter 3.

Sure the first time I played this game was on hard and I gave up during Chapter 2. After that I played a lot of games but this was always at the back of my mind. I gave it a try a week back and thought of playing it on normal difficulty.

In my opinion, the gameplay is bad but the story and the acting is top notch which keeps you hooked. And the music is just (chef's kiss). 

I played **Director's Cut** so not sure what is different from normal version.

The star of the show are Mads Mikkelsen and Lea Seydoux for me. The mystery surrounding both just works.

Right now I am torn between Platinuming the game or leaving it.

Have alot of questions which are still unanswered and will keep on researching about it."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"""walking simulator"" was way overblown. One of the most unique games till this day. The vibe with the music and everything was just top notch. The BT's are so terrifying too."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,[deleted]
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Meh I played for hours and the only thing I liked was the cutscenes and music.
I don't want a 10h tutorial."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,This was actually my first Kojima game.  Something about the music and the way it kicks in as you come over the hill.  I played it for the first time last year and your post makes me want to play it again
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,This is why I hate it when people said they got bored with it and couldn't finish it. The first few hours is setting up the gameplay and the world so you have to be patient with it because it gets absolutely amazing pretty much all the way until the credits roll. Dunkey basically said it best when he said something compelled him to go back to it because it takes a bit to click.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Hmm I think I just might after reading that. Thank you 

Initially I probably played 3 hours of it and thought I couldn’t be fucked playing if it wasn’t going to change"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"What had bothered me when I first tried it was the length and amount of cutscenes in the beginning combined with just walking around like you said.
  
Should I have played with the online community things on? Idk, I wanted to experience the game and figure shit out for myself. Anyway, your post is making me consider jumping back in as well…"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,">The first few hours in which you laboriously walk back and forth are just a tutorial

*Oh well in that case…* /s

Lol I mean fine if you ended up enjoying it but it sounds like hilariously bad game design to me if that’s how you describe it."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"It's a pretty fun game, but I do think the writing is honestly kinda bad"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"""Not for everyone"" is an understatement and a half. The worldbuilding is solid. It's an extremely interesting concept to see get fleshed out throughout the game's different aspects. There are some real kernels of potential in there but the main story just turns out to be a massive overproduced turd.     
   
NPC's personalities feel flat but, appropriately, the game's main character never really takes a shine to any of them anyways (and neither did I, in fact the main character is the only character in the game that actually seems to make any sense and he doesn't seem to care that much about the game world's future either).     
    
The combat system feels underdeveloped, clunky and overencumbered. Fortunately, you're only ever really forced into combat to get through the game's storyline.    
   
Having said that, the game's core gameplay loop is a fun and refreshing take on the usual ""take the macguffin from point A to point B"" quest. Too bad it never really builds on that and just ends up overstaying it's welcome with too long a grind for completionists.     
    
The only reason I forced myself to make the push to complete every achievement was to feel I got my money's worth of entertainment. Hardly a masterpiece but might be worth considering the purchase at an 80%+ discount."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"In the wake of Starfields release, I've been thinking a lot about Death Stranding. The two games have a lot on common, with approach being the only real difference. That and the story, obviously. 

I don't really have a point. Just a thought."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2024-02-25,"It’s absolutely phenomenal oh my god I slept on it for so long and recently gave it a try was slow for a while then absolutely picked up so fast I’m so hooked, I finally understand hideos message it’s about connections and working together with some action and cinematics but it’s nothing like anything Iv ever experienced it’s wild"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I loved it immediately. My only real criticisms are that Zipline become available too early, and the ending has way too much unskippable bullshit."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"It really is a wonderful game.

The 'walking simulator' part is my favourite. Stick on a podcast and do some deliveries.

The game looks incredible, especially if you have an ultra wide monitor.

Despite Kojima being a terrible writer, it has a surprisingly coherent story which comes to a satisfying conclusion."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I still own this game, haven't played it yet and still not sure.
Who can convince me with a short sentence that gives anything other than 'walling simulator' lol"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"There was a massive campaign to criticize the game and ""make"" it unpopular after it was released. This was the game which opened my eyes to how useless most ratings are.

The current Metacritic user score for Death Stranding is 7.4. That's after Metacritic removed a huge amount of fake votes; it was \~5.7 before that.

On Steam, where only the people **who actually played the game** can vote, the user score is 93%.

I don't remember another game launched in the last 20 years in such a polished, bug-free condition. Seriously, if you look a patch notes, there are literally only a few bug fixes, and some QoL updates requested by the community. I've never had a single bug happen in the game, even though I've completed it fully, three times. (caveat - I'm not counting minor graphical glitches, which aren't really related to the game itself, but to FSR, DLSS, and similar technologies)

In the current times, when it's usual that games launch unfinished, and then are also often being left unfinished/unfixed, launching such a complex AAA game with virtually no bugs at all is unprecedented. The game should have been praised and set as the golden standard for the foreseeable future based on that fact alone. Yet I haven't read a single article from ""gaming journalists"" about this."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I just finished watching all the cutscenes on YouTube, pretty happy with that ‘play through’. I’m sure all the back and forth travel added to the atmosphere and tension but I was just interested in the world building and narrative. Quite liked it."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I think this is one of those divisive games. My favourite spoiler review of this game I can't find right now, but was basically ""oh boy is this game wierd!"" And judging by the evidence presented, man is it wierd.

Maybe it's not for everyone. I've never been able to get over some of the core parts of the game, like the intro where someone dies because the main character doesn't like to be touched or something? That whole hospital scene. It's just awkward to me.

Then all the stuff with the babies, the rain that ages stuff, using your own urine as a grenade, it's like the designer had several ideas that could have carried a game alone and decided to put all of them in anyway, in a way that to me feels jarring.

It might be a great game if you can get into it. But I never could."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Damn Im in the same boat you were in prior to picking it up again. I played it for a few hours a couple years ago, very much appreciated the idea, plot and general artistry of it but was just not hooked. And I still feel I should get back on it at some point"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"This was me with Fallout 3. That was my first Fallout game and I started it and stopped playing so many times, that I lost count. Then one day I had gone through my PS3 backlog and had the game sitting on the shelf looking at me. So I said, ""fuck it. This time I'm forcing my self to at least play for 3 days.""

And I was hooked. And this was the PS3 version we're talking about here. That version froze and crashed so much, it was ridiculous. I put up with all the crashing and finished the game because I liked it so much, that I went and got New Vegas right away."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,[deleted]
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I felt next to zero challenge with mules or avoiding BTs for most of my playthrough, would let the BTs drag me to fight monsters because I was doing nothing else but dropping off packages and sneaking. Never drove anything off road 90% of the game because vehicles didn’t control that well for so long in the game that I didn’t change up my routine later. I’d just print pairs of shoes, stock up on spray can cargo heals, and the bola gun. I remember thinking after the ending of what felt like an eternity at the beach segment with your mom/sister, that DS had to be the worst delivery of a story and tutorial for any game I have ever played to completion. I still have yet to have the plot be explained in any form that is interesting or entertaining. I straight up do not know how Kojima Productions was happy with the gameplay loop."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Gave this game 20+ hours. If it didn't have the big names attached to it, it would have gotten a 2/10 score."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,Would replay it I think if you could skip all the nonsensical cut scenes.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"The first couple hours feel like they were made as the Gate Keeper. If you can't be bothered to go past it the games not really for you. It also weeds out all the ""journalists"" that said it was just a walking simulator or an Amazon delivery simulator."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Super long cutscenes with super uninteresting dialogue killed it for me. While I was actually playing though, 100% it's wonderful."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,[deleted]
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Hated every second of it. No, wait. I take that back. It had great score. Lovely music. 
BUT the story telling.. the writing is just horrible, dialogue and story. Pretentious and objectively bad."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I find the ""praise"" people give this ""masterpiece"" incredibly humorous. I mean they're very clearly flaws if you read between the lines but that presentation paint it in such a majestic light.

Only Kojima can pull off having fans reframe what in other games would simply be called bad pacing, boring gameplay loop and tacky writing into positive things with such flowery language. 

I'm actually genuinely enjoying what people are coming up with in this thread. People should test their limits and try this for even worse stinkers like redfall or gollum. In case they have sequels in desperate need of marketing image rehabilitation as well."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,When DS came out I decided to go to University. Now I have a degree in Game Design.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Went through mostly the same journey. Stuck in a loop at the beggining, it subsided in my gaming habits. Then a friend started playing it and enjoying it and I thought to myself ""maybe I just didn't get to the point where it takes off."" And so it was.

To be fair, I was a little ""burnt"" by MGSV."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I just wish they didnt go with the walking for gameplay. You can't argue this game wouldnt be better with any other type of gameplay.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,I played through the whole game and was dissapointed af. I want some of that you guys smoked
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I played this game for like 200 hours or more. I fought things, I explored, I fought bosses, I watched story, I took my time, I built entire highways and other conveniences to help out my fellow players, some of which got many thousands of likes... all of that time I was trying to answer the question 'is this a good game?'

At the end of those 200 hours I came to the conclusion that 'no, it is not', and then Hideo Kojima blamed it on people not getting it. Ymmv."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I have this game and I also gave up on it after a few hours. My question is, why did Kojima make a game that is off-putting at the beginning? I don't see the reason to make the player trudge along with nothing."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Played it for 4 hours then uninstalled, I'm glad I waited for it to be on PS Plus, would have been pissed if I had payed actual money, and now there's gonna be a second one. I really hope Kojima gets the rights for MGS back one day."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Lol this sub is becoming a playstation propaganda
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"My GF and I pissed my roommate off one time while he was playing it. We were intoxicated and sang “Norman Reedus’s Fetus” to the tune of Ed, Edd and Eddy. I still do sometimes. Good times."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,I got the game and was going to try it out but it won't launch on my computer. You need DirectX 12. I have it. Needs some specific feature which my system does not support. Oh well.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I got it free on Epic and the servers were down, so I did the entire game offline, took a week. Then I found out that the servers are supposed to work so I bought the Directors cut for a 100% playthrough, having roads rocks. Can't wait for #2."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,I’m definitely in minority here but that’s how it is with me and Cyberpunk. I’ve had it since day 1 but I can’t get myself to beat it
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,It came out at the perfect time for the message it carries to be delivered with maximum effect. I haven't beat it yet but I've been slowly grinding it out on my Steam Deck lately on breaks at work and it just hits right.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,I played this game while around the time I had a kid and it was really awkward and made me reflect a lot lol.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,I should revisit this game as this whole thread was my initial reaction.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Same, my friend, same."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Came here to say look up Low Roar's music, it adds such depth and emotion to the game, the story of how Kojima found them (or vice versa) is pretty cool too. Unfortunately their singer passed last year though.

My DS playtbrough was peak pandemic... It hit so differently and apparently pre-pandemic the world seemed nonsensical to most, weird how some perspective changes things. I agree that the sweet spot of the game is before you get the overpowered tools / vehicles, and some of the plot reveals are amazing. The DLC is a must too, the trailer for 2 was a wombo combo in the feels"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I played for a while and I didn't hate it but it really didn't grab me.
Maybe I should give it another kick, if it actually starts getting better that would be nice because I can't imagine grinding through the rest of it if there isn't some big steps forward."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,the story huh? Like Mario and princes beach(I don't think I've ever laughed that hard in a video game)
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,[removed]
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Think I was hooked start.
Trust in Kojima."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Death Stranding is like The Witcher 3 for me. I love the game, lore, characters, world. But I always get sidetracked with side quests and stop playing before even finishing the main story."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I am the same, I saw the hype when it came out, I got it and played it a little and didn’t get into it so have left it unfinished. But it sounds like I need to give it another go."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I got it free on Epic Games and i played it for a few hours, i loved the music and the setting but i could not stand the whole just walking, your post pumps me up to play it again, but i hate that Epic application so much that i cannot even stand it."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,There's a reason why I call Death Stranding a 48h blockbuster movie
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,Really dont agree at all. I have tried two times and I have got tired of it after the bomb section each time. Its good in the start when you are in beautiful environmentw and the game is fresh. Once get past the «tutorial»(as you put ut) it quickly gets boring. Please update the thread when you get to bores status
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,Alright I’ll try it again I guess. I’m in the same boat. I had just opened up vehicles I think.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,Gotta check some YT to fully understand the story tho
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I read a tips and tricks thing... it told me not to worry about the ghosts.. after reading that and the first mission with them I'm like men not feeling anything. The camera angle and trying to see them while you move was just meh. 

Please prove me wrong and tell me to try it again."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,I kinda got stuck in one of thr chapters just because i just wanted to build roads and connects for everyone
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"for me DS is one of the best games ever made. The emotions it gave have been unparalleled. The feeling of isolation, of the struggle, of preparing for a long trip. I felt so dragged in, so captured. People should have given this game a real chance instead of judging the book by its cover."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I love listening to a podcast and deliver packages… so chill, to me thats what death stranding is all about, a chill game."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I have tried and stopped Death Stranding three times. The first few hours are actually pretty damn cool, but it never hooks me after that and I just kind of feel intimidated to learn all the mechanics, and I drop it. I do plan to give it a serious shot some day - maybe before the second one releases. But I just can't bring myself to do so."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,Oooh I glossed over this on PS plus but this is the second time in two days I’ve randomly heard terrific things about this game. Brb gonna go download it
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,i still have fond memories of building something that got a bunch of thumbs up. felt good to create something that other people found useful
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,I found Zipline Simulator to be an extremely relaxing experience.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"The directors cut was great, I played it right after it went on sale on Epic. People were finishing highways in a day lol"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,Yep it's a strand type game
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,Because the majority of people are poor
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,It’s basically ups/fedex extreme. But surprisingly fun
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-22,Of course
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-22,"Well, it's a Hideo Kojima game, silly writing is to be expected"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-22,Always felt lost with this game (ironic right?) but reading this post and the reactions make me want to pick it back up again. It seems the Directors Cut is the way to go?
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-12-21,I just started on PS5 and I am really digging it!
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-12-26,"weird...I'm about..I dunno I just finished the scene where he met his mother...

and...my first thought is...why are there containers of useful stuff scattered out in desolate waste land that I chalked up to...'hopefully will be explained later'...

and my second thought is...hideo's story telling is still the same.  He doesn't present cohesive stories.  He puts dreams on display that gain focus and then go out of focus of making sense.

It reminds me of dreaming.  I'm in a memory of a place.  Now I'm in another place but I don't remember getting in a car or walking there.  Now I'm experiencing something else.

I'm this far in there's a lot of interesting concepts and ideas at play here solid and abstract but the man is fucking nothing without his production because it's the only thing that's solid in all of this thus far.

I've read sci-fi manga that explained nothing that was more interesting in the first half of the first book.  It's been all production value.

End of the day I think Hideo will do better if he had material to work with or collabbed with because Hideo has great moments but my god this is like listening to a dude drugged out of their mind telling a story.  There's great points but getting from point to point makes zero sense and you gotta just not think if you wanna stick around for the ride..."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I think I'm gonna have to do this. You are not the first to claim that it makes for a very interesting experience when you are left to do everything yourself.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Trying to drive on top of the snowy mountains was so much fun. Also reaching the first outpost listening to ""don't be so serious"" soundtrack is one of my best gaming moment, i can't really say why but i recall all the way down the hill rock by rock"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I mean, I get the ""challenging"" part of playing offline, but that's a way to play the game and not actually understand its purpose."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Same, the hiking an planning is the best part. Played through the game offline twice before I did an online playthrough."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I would actually love a game that is only that, no supernatural or save the world story, no annoying af BTs. 

Just deliver packages safely/timely across massive distances and dangerous terrain.  Maybe some scavenger camps to sneak past or clear out. Dangerous wild animals too. Along with some survival elements like hunger, thirst, and camping. 

I wouldn't mind vehicles that get you A to B and walk to C, the terrain should limit use though. Building a path as you go and using for return should be the idea regardless of on foot or vehicle.

I imagine you'd start with just a backpack, and by the end of the game you've created log bridges over rivers, cleared driving trails through forests, and maybe even mined tunnels through mountains, but maybe that's too much.

Like a post apocalyptic package delivery game."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"The last trek down to the coast was absolutely brutal, barely made it.

Having to use three of the long ropes to get down a cliff really sold how rugged that part of the map was.

I really should play that game again..."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,I liked building up to the point where I can use the grapple to teleport miles in a second.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"How did you manage long treks in the snow without a vehicle? I never built the roads beyond the beginning of the second map, but I NEEDED a van or trike in the snow because my packages degraded so quickly. Did you build multiple rest stops/checkpoints?"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Playing offline is indeed a challenge, but I think the intention was to use the online features. 

This is just my interpretation, and I could definitely be wrong, but here's my takeaway after playing the game. Death Stranding is ostensibly a story about how people have lost contact with each other and it's your job to basically save the world by rebuilding connections. Isolation = bad, connections/friendships/relationships = good. But I got the feeling there was a more subtle, meta point being made, where players were encouraged to help each other out by leaving structures that would appear in other people's game, leaving footprints, and sending/receiving likes (and the likes aren't just for vanity, they help you level up, iirc). By helping others and being helped, or in other words connecting with other real life people, everyone benefits in the game. So the point is kinda made in a diegetic and a non-diegetic way. 

Does that kinda make sense?"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,">I LOVE Kojima but I got bored 4 hours in.

Brought to you by the same man who made a 7 minute ladder climbing sequence.

Kojima has the uncanny ability to make you bored one minute and the next minute have the most intense exciting experience ever.

It's pacing and his storytelling is so chaotic that it just works so well."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"this just happens sometimes, you pick up a game at the wrong time in your life."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I'm glad I'm not the only one who felt that way! It's amazing how revisiting a game can completely change our perspective. Sometimes, it just takes a little time and a fresh mindset to truly appreciate the genius behind a masterpiece like Death Stranding."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,Probably because we were expecting a more action packed game. Not what we originally expected but an amazing game in its own world.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Wait I forgot I own this game too! 

I will try again soon. Is a beautiful game. I just only started onetime."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I totally get what you mean! I had the same initial reaction, but once I gave it another shot, I was completely hooked. Death Stranding is a masterpiece and definitely one of my favorites too. It's amazing how a game that"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Low Roar is not my kind of music, but it fit this game so well."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Yeah that bit feels absolutely amazing, especially if you struggle through the BT area before it."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,If I remember right he said he's rewriting the entire DS2 script because of how DS1 predicted lockdown in a way.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Kojima is a prophet, just waiting for the Snatchers to invade."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,Is it worth to play? I have ps plus extra so i can download it but i played for like 2 hours before but stopped since i got afraid to die. Does it get easier with a little bit of time?
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,As is tradition.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"It's good game. A bit slow paced, but still good. It is only a walking simular early game. When you reach midgame, it becomes more of infrastructure simulator where you build infrastructure to get faster around. Oddly, it feels very rewarding to build roads and laser ziplines."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Literally skip every opening cutscene to get to the Central Region, thats where the game actually takes place tbh. The start is just plot bloat imo"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,Indeed.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,Trailer came out last year at TGA. should be a new one this year in December
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Yeah, I did 100 hours to platinum it, and never replayed it (including the director’s cut)"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"It didn't feel monotonous to me. There's something very zen about plotting the routes and navigating the terrain. It felt like a video game equivalent of taking long hikes through Norway and Iceland, which I loved to do. I was rather engrossed by the game and that doesn't happen too often. I find open world games focussed on clearing endless bandit camps to be more laborious and boring to be honest."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-12-26,man that sounds really interesting
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I've sung this as a lullaby to my son since he was born. This game helped me so much moving through a miscarriage before he was born, and it means so much to me on a deeper level than a game I really enjoyed with a soundtrack I loved."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"That is ok. I believe everyone has games which they feel even a bit guilty that they do not enjoy them.  As an RPG fan, for me, it is Witcher 3. I just could not get into it, even after forcing myself to play more than 10 hours. After a couple years of therapy, I can finally accept that.

For me, DS is a masterpiece but I can easily understand that it is not interesting for everyone."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"You're not alone, I've tried three times and just can't stick with it."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,I can’t get past the first bit on Mass Effect where you drive the mako. I’ve tried 3 times. It’s awful.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Sam's starting max carry weight was my working squat weight. Getting stronger in game in terms of carry capacity, then getting the exo-assistance and seeing Sam's new strength was gratifying."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"You sure about that princess beach?

(DS is in my top favorite like 5 games of all time)"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,I love the silly shit. You can piss on the enemies and they take damage haha that’s badass and funny.  BB gives you a thumbs up. You can get Connan o Brian a cool otter hat. But they do this far off the serious moments so I don’t mind it.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,I see where you’re coming from but I have to disagree. To me the writing is so bad it’s funny but I don’t think the writer should actually get credit for that. When lines sound awkward or are repetitive it’s still bad writing. I wondered if maybe it was a translation issue
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Silly writing is only good writing if it's good writing. Douglas Adams writes silly. Kojima is a great game designer trapped inside the body of a truly terrible writer that has Nicholas Cage as his spirit animal. That combination can be entertaining, but it doesn't retroactively make the writing good."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"It's a joke because the core mechanics of DS literally simulate walking. People who call it one are either being tongue-in-cheek or derogatory. I typically hear people say ""it''s a _literal_ walking simulator"" to emphasise the distinction."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,Kojima was inspired by games like qwop.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,What else do you struggle to understand‽
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,I argue that DS is the ONLY walking simulator.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Kinda agree, but BTs and the factions enrich the world quite a lot. They contribute a lot to the vibe, especially BTs and MULEs"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I disagree but I understand.

Side question : have you played Snowrunner? I feel like it satisfies the desire you expressed."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"That’s a game design and player engagement failure, no different than the people who chose not to slog through the first several hours of rdr2."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"That just means the tutorial was too long, which I maintain it is.   
     
You get the sense that the entire game is going to be like that and good lord is it LONG.    
     
By the time I got the end of the chapter, I was frustrated as fuck and only remarked that of course it’s a convoluted Kojima boss fight that belongs in Metal Gear Solid but the fuck had to put them in this game.    
     
I get some action that’s not some stupid wannabe jump scare that drags my ass in random directions to where the real penalty is all the time I just lost having to cover the ground those enemies just tossed me over on.     
     
Except it’s a straight up Metal Gear Solid fight. Great.    
     
It takes so long, you see parallels to the other games and realize the game isn’t as original as you thought.       
    
Like the Sam loadout screen? Replace the music with the MGS 5 Phantom Pain Loadout ready music. It’s the exact same shit except you don’t get to choose between a dog or a sniper.     
     
Then you realize that the MULE combat is basically MGS, except you HAVE to stealth and non lethal everything because for story reasons you can’t murder an entire camp of them.     
      
Then the lore dumps just become grating. Like you’re a delivery man who now has to read the Safety Data Sheet for everything you’re delivering, except those are sometimes exciting. And about as cryptic.    
     
Chapter 2 takes so fucking long that as you’re walking in the literal minutes where nothing happens, you’re left with time to think to yourself. I bet that’s handy for those trying to process wtf is going on in the story or vibe but if you’re not digging the game, it just gives you time to think about the reasons you’re currently disliking the game. Or why are you still playing. Is the entire game going to be delivery, lore dump, la li Lu Le lo boss fights.    
    
Then it hits you. Oh god they’re gonna added more. Jesus fuck vehicles mean they’re gonna expect you to have to use all this shit because the deliveries are gonna need to cover more distance.    
     
Only way for me to describe my experience was punching my face to spite my hands.   
I paid $60 on release, my dipshit ass choosing to pre order and play on launch because Kojima so I was gonna make myself play through the entire game so I’d be justified in bitching.     
      
Jfc, I hate Konami more after playing DS.   
Had they not fucked over Kojima, he’d never made DS and we’d have gotten more MSG."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-22,And Diehardman breaking down in front of Sam near the end of the game… such good performances all-around. Def in my top 3 games ever played. Can’t wait for DS2.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Same- before Nintendo, actually. That story was so batshit I just had to see where it went, how it could POSSIBLY make sense.  Loved every bit of it, even the super long ending"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"As soon as you have the opportunity to build an infrastructure through ziplines, roads, delivery bots etc. you can still get 5 stars everywhere. The first chapters in particular should be played as you say."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-22,"Anyone who says it’s a walking simulator either is too stupid to know what the term means, or they haven’t played the game. Either way their opinion can be ignored."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,That's the game's great failing. It is wonderful but it is very inaccessible.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Play MGSVTPP.  The first level (hospital) is garbage, the story and chapter structure are garbage, the boss fights are garbage, but the mechanics and level design and systems and maneuvers and enemy patterns and animations are incredibly finely crafted excellence."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,Bro Dunkey's original review is partially why dummies with no taste wrote it off and memed it so hard.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,The online component is extremely important mechanically and thematically. You're kind of not playing the game if you turn it off (at least on your first playthrough)
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I ended up loving it, but it does have a rough beginning. It doesn't really get fun for a number of hours.

A comparison to make would be any Souls game, with the time it takes to ""click.""

But calling it a walking simulator would be like calling any Mario side scroller a running right simulator. There's a lot more going on there."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Play it.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,Kojima is probably my favorite dev of all time but the combat in ALL of his games is clunky. The giant BB Metal gear near the end was so dumb.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Omg yes, the ending is just ridiculous, I thought it would never end"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Every first and third person game where you walk around is a walking simulator if you want to boil it down.

Take Starfield. You eventually land on the planet and spend half of the fucking time walking to your destination for a short action sequence, and if you're lucky, you can fast travel afterwards.

Same with Cyberpunk because the vehicle physics are so absolutely bonkers that it practically forces you to walk most places. Or, again if you're lucky, you fast travel everywhere.

Death Stranding makes traversal by foot a bit more interesting by giving you finer control over how and where you walk/run. Giving you actual obstacles to overcome instead of just throwing barriers in your face.

But even then the walking isn't a focal point, which people have latched on to just to deride it. You get vehicles, weapons, and bad guys to shoot just like any other action title.

All this to say, watch some gameplay that isn't the intro and make up your own mind.   
And stop buying shit you don't plan on playing/using without the opinions of others.  
Live for yourself."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"It's more like a truck simulator with some fights against bandits, terrorists, ghosts, lovecraftian tar monsters and revived skeleton soldiers from the world wars."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"You are delusional if you say people hated it for bugs. The truth is the gameplay is not for everyone and the tutorial is extremely slow for most people. Literally hours of cutscenes in the tutorial.

Theres more to games that bugs, if bugs really mattered that much skyrim wouldnt have been considered the masterpiece that it is"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"What was the motive for making it unpopular?  Was it just people who were disappointed and therefore gamer-rage terrorism?  I don’t get it.

Anyway about the bug-free thing, judging from MGSVTPP Kojima and his team oversee and manage incredibly good programmers, programming, code architecture.  All the different systems and overlapping mechanics in MGSVTPP are finely crafted in a way that no other big game ever is.  (The original IW Respawn team is on a similar level.)"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"It's not a walking simulator, that would be gone home, what happened to edith finch, firewatch etc. There is gameplay and action. It is a very slow burn at the start though, with an intense amount of cutscenes. I would say it's a masterpiece of a game, but still an acquired taste. I didn't even finish it and I still consider it a piece of art. 

Perhaps that's a good way of looking at Death Stranding, it delivers something completely new from normal gameplay loops. Some people will hate it, others (like me) will get burned out (but still return). But Death Stranding is doing/being what Death Stranding wants to be. Without looking at trends and what's popular on the market. As a game, it's incredibly unique. 

I love it for it's message of connection and the co-orperation of other players mixing single- and multiplayer."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Many will argue, but I feel it's one of those ""it's so bad/crazy that it circles to being good"" games.

Expect to be confused and roll your eyes for a good 4-6 hours, then it'll start to come together."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,It is. Dont bother
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"DS intro isn't boring or particularly long, the game just continuously unfolds with new tools, challenges, and spectacle. It's phenomenally well-paced."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Yeah there's a reason I never got into EU or Crusader Kings. I do not have time for that shit.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,the story is absolutely brilliant. But there are people who think the story of Last of Us is lame and who say that FIFA has a good story. So nothing surprises me anymore.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,I'd be more impressed if it was a job in game design.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"What? No. There's vehicles, stealth, building, gun play. It's not ""just walking"" and even when it is, navigating the terrain, especially when you're being rushed, is as engaging as any other type of gameplay.

It's a rare game where I think ""hard"" was the right level of difficulty. The standard is too easy, where the terrain and the timefall (equipment wear) are inconsequential."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,It's a filter. Game is weird and not for most people. Those who are put off by the beginning aren't likely to change their view later on. Of course it's not perfect so some players who would like the later stuff get turned away too early and some people trudge through miserable the whole time.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,I too would get annoyed by two drunk assholes bothering me while I just wanted to play a video game.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Yeah, like I said: some of the writing is really silly. But behind it there is a story that really captivated me like no other game since Last of Us 1."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"It's like OP says: it's too chill and lonely up until a point...then suddenly it isn't. Traversal gets cooler, you start to understand BT and boss behavior, combat gets more enjoyable and the story really takes off."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Well, actually I've already played through the game and now started a new run on the most difficult level and offline. (chapter 4 atm)"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,only the first encounters are like that. later you get strong weapons against them. From chapter 3 onwards I often just run into the areas armed with blood bags and blood grenades and let them grab me. they then drag you into a boss fight. A few grenades on it and the rain disappears. It's a good way to farm chiralium.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-12-27,I can totally understand you. I was at that point back then and that's why I stopped at some point. I can only recommend that you play at least until chapter 3 because that's where the game really opens up. the story is like a dream but makes sense later.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I played it offline because I didn't have PS Plus. It was quite the challenge to build the entire highway system myself but it felt so good to finish it. As someone who enjoyed Euro Truck, it was nice driving materials back and forth."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,Playing without help is definitely the way. It's like day and night.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Playing Death Stranding offline and embracing the challenging treks on foot can offer a unique and isolating experience. It allows you to fully immerse yourself in the game's world and appreciate the laborious journey it presents. Give it a try, and you might discover a new level of fascination."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Two sides of the same coin, the isolation as you enter a new area for first time, then the connectedness after you’ve turned on the WiFi.
So I don’t think it’s fair to say they don’t understand its purpose. The lonely bit is just as important an element as the online bit"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I know what you mean but that’s not actually true.  Voluntarily not using something in a game has the effect of drawing out a different experience with other things….and therefore draws out the *purpose* of those other things, in this case level design and mechanics, just not the online community ones.

For example playing MGSVTPP with no weapons but only hand to hand. Or the DS thing above."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I just built a shitload of zip lines everywhere between every location, I played it pretty regularly so I didn't need to maintain them since I finished the game before most of them deteriorated. It took a while to set up but made everything super easy around the mountains."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"It sounds hilarious, but I wish I could experience climbing that 7 min long ladder for the first time again."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,What a thrill
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,Been a day one fan of kojima. There is no one I trust more to deliver a finished masterpiece.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Kojima is a an idiot savant... 

I pay full.price for every one of his games"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,Ooooh what a thrill....
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,🎶What a thrrriiiillllll…🎶
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,I reeeeeeally need to give the game another go!
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I never played Kojima game before Phantom Pain because I only play on PC

The moment where you just sit in the back of a jeep and stare at the bad guy for 5 minutes while an epic music goes on was so fking weird, I didn't expect it.

Also the constant intro sequences of every mission, where they introduce the characters, like the XY soviet battalion and such. Very random"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,What a thrill....
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,So true!
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,I also really like Death Stranding. My favorite part is when the
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,Kojima just seems to predict the future in his games.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,You ain't wrong haha
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,>Death Stranding is absolutely fantastic. One of the best games in the past 5 years
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,Yeah... I've played the game. You're commenting as if I never played it at all. I got to I think more than halfway and stopped
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,You went to therapy because of a video game?
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"What you're referring to when you say it's so bad it's funny is camp, and Kojima has always participated in a bit of campy writing. Thing is, if you want to write camp, and it comes off as camp, then it's good writing. Saying it's bad is like going into a comedy film, laughing hysterically all the way through, and then saying the writing was bad because it's ""just funny."""
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I have Spintires, but no mud/snowrunner"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"People dont understand that the game isnt for everyone. Like yes now that the gameplay loop is known most people that get into it (and buy it discounted) dont get their expectations subverted.

But this wasnt known for people that bought it at lunch which definitely expected something like MGS and the game couldnt be any more different.

I also think the game is pretty bad in telling the story. Basically the story doesnt show you but it just tells you. Continuously. Thats why the story and the gameplay are disconnected."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,Yup. Buckle up future players of Death Stranding. The ending is almost as long as Infinity Wars Endgame. Lol
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"> But calling it a walking simulator would be like calling any Mario side scroller a running right simulator. There's a lot more going on there.

That's the entire point of the joke. Calling it a walking simulator is funny because that's an unrelated established genre, but DS _actually_ simulates walking. The point is that it's tongue-in-cheek and overly reductive."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"I mean, having an brutally long and boring walking back and forth tutorial you have to power through is not exactly a great point to sell people curious about trying the game on.

And if even someone who actually enjoyed the game is actively warning us how tedious and bad the first few hours are, I’d rather spend what little free time I have to enjoy myself on a different game that doesn’t have that issue.

I’ll just have to miss this one I guess lol"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I might be misremembering, it’s been a while, but I don’t remember being too bothered by the combat in the Metal Gear series. I’m a fan of the series and have fond memories of having a great time with all of them.    
   
But the amount of buttons you have to press and hold during the combat sequences of Death Stranding is something else. I feel it’s trying to be too clever for its own sake and just gets in the way of what could have been a cool fight."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Got it for free in epic. 

Was intrigued pre release but never really got sold after but as many say here it's an acquired taste. Still I will most likely indulge eventually. Just gotta finish bg3 first.

Thanks for your input and saltiness at the end. I don't buy shit I don't plan on playing. 

Cheers"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,">You are delusional if you say people hated it for bugs.

Please quote where I said anything of the sort. And you have the audacity to call *me* delusional, lmao."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Kojima was inspired by games like qwop, the other kind of walking simulator.  I’m sure there’s a name for the whole, “doing this simple task is difficult” genre."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,"Also, some of the early cinematics in Death Stranding are just spectacular and really made me want to continue on... err I mean keep on keeping on!

Since Starfield was mentioned, this is something Starfield severely lacks in my opinion."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"New low-bar set for ""brilliant"" 😂😂
Whats next, u gonna say Marvel-movies have ""BRILLIANT"" story?? Hahaha. Ur cute"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,The degree was its own accomplishment 😉. I do work for a studio also.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,You didn't need to do him like that (though he kinda deserved it)
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,We are for hire if you’re looking!

17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,Oh what... so it not just avoiding them the whole game... hmm sounds like fun
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-12-27,"Yeah, I kept playing and hooked up knot port/harbour city.

Realized the game is a fedex oh boy let's unlock and increase territory deliver things survival game...

It makes me laugh that he got so much money, production and actors to get on board with this.  I can't be bothered with the story at this point with the bread crumb feed.  The post apocalypse fed ex game play is just...wow.

You see a deer in the first trailer but I haven't seen any wild life since that.

Honestly there's better IP's that deserved this kind of attention.  Just glad I got the game for free because holy crap if I paid over 80$ for this I'd be doing some hard drugs drinking that copium koolaid I realize everyone has been drinking.

Aside from the production value this game has one thing going for it.  It's different.  But so was crazy taxi and crazy taxi is amazing.  This?  I wish they just gave the love to biomega or something."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,You should be able to play online without ps plus. Unless it changed between ps4 and 5
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,How long did that take? It always seemed to me like building bridges and roads were ridiculously expensive and time consuming and then they deteriorate... When you're first playing through the game not really knowing where all your most travelled areas will be it completely discouraged me from doing it.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I played during peak playtime and while my road sections got all sorts of points, I only ever had 1 section fully completed by other players during my entire game time. I didn't realize other players were supposed to be a significant help."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,you don't need ps plus for online
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-22,That’s exactly what I did. Fantastic experience although I do wonder what it would have been like with faster travel (the motorcycles were fast enough)?
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,Same! MGS3 was a masterpiece I remember exactly where I was when I fist climbed that ladder core memory lol.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,i feel sorry for the NPCs that had to build a place that could support such a ladder
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,Snaaaake eater!
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Apart from MGS5, which was literally unfinished"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Or a genius, the dull climb of the latter makes what comes next that much more exciting. Especially since you **worked** for it."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Even Zone of the Enders?

17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Idiot Savant is kind of true, because of the extreme dumbness of so many things in his games, but he and team bring extreme *quality* and craft to mechanics and level design and most everything else. So it’s not really idiot savant."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Get a PS2 emulator and play the original MGS trilogy.

The plot is fucking insane. I'm a fan of the series and even I don't fully understand the plot and the lore. It's bonkers.

MGS3 legit has a scene where you climb a ladder for like 8 minutes solid. For some reason it works really well. I don't want to spoil it too much. It just works"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,I actually dislike Death Stranding. I couldn’t stand having to always
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,One of the funniest review
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"I'm glad you gave Death Stranding another chance! It's definitely a game that takes some time to fully appreciate. The walking mechanics may seem tedious at first, but as you progress, the story, characters, and unique gameplay mechanics really start to shine. It's a game that rewards patience and exploration, and I'm glad I stuck with it."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"He's like ""I can't do this shit again! Gotta write something happier."""
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"The game is poorly designed and drives players away. I tried playing it and was mad id never get that time back. It looked great, I just didn’t know or care why things were being done.

I’m not playing a game for 3 hours just to get to the real game. That’s rewarding bad behavior 😆"
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-20,The tutorial is neither brutal nor long. Play it.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"""brutally long""? No. I think the problem is it gives access to too much side stuff to quickly and people get side tracked and that bogs them down. Like OP said, you need to head straight through the main deliveries to chapter 3 when vehicles and other aids become available (actually, you get a vehicle in Ch 2, but only one. They become reliably accessible in Ch 3)."

17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"That’s the way his games are. I remember one sequence in MGS, in order to peek around a corner, draw, and shoot (remember, no analog sticks) required almost all the buttons in a certain order."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-22,Stick to COD or something kid

17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Actually no. I think the notion that it is indeed just an intro, and after that it becomes a proper game experience makes most of the difference, really."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-12-27,"Well, luckily tastes are different. Death Stranding definitely landed in the top 5 of my favorite games but it took some time for it to click"

17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,It took a very long time. The hardest part was getting the resources but luckily there were a few good missions for that which I repeated over and over.
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,I got hooked into mgs with Guns of the patriots. Played every game after it 100+ hours. I skioord out on mgs3 because gfx looked to dated and i always had the faint hope of them te releasing it. I'm so excited!
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"Best in the series and it's high, high praise."
17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,"There’s a long long ladder under the spooky Stormveil castle in Elden Ring, I was wondering to myself how anyone built it and how the structural forces would be tearing it apart (or something).  It’s not mounted to wall, it’s like free-floating from an extremely high ledge!

Like how a submarine gets crushed by water pressure at an extreme depth, think of the bottom parts of that poor ladder!"

17cku0h,2023-10-20,2023-10-21,He made so awful narrative choices and over embraced open world to the point of killing a narrative flow

11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"Video games have come a long way. 

You used to only hear about stuff like this in video games from some lucky kid who had an uncle that worked at Nintendo. 

""Yeah dude, I swear. Keep looking at his dick, and then he flips you off, and then he punches you. It's so funny."""
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,Only kojima
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"My favourite thing about this is that this functionality had to be prioritised during development. There were probably some debates about how important the ""Sam Porter Bridges reacts when player stares at his crotch"" userstory is.

Then a developer had to spend some time making sure that if the camera was pointed at his crotch for long enough, the right animation kicked in, etc. Probably used a 'crotchStareTime' variable or something. 

Finally, a serious, professional QA engineer had to verify that if you stared at Sam's crotch for the right amount of time, the right reaction occurred. But not if you stare at his bicep. Or during a different scene. Etc.

Serious work went into this. All just so we can have this gif."
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"Hi, you're probably looking for a useful nugget of information to fix a niche problem, or some enjoyable content I posted sometime in the last 11 years. Well, after 11 years and over 330k combined, organic karma, a cowardly, pathetic and facist minded moderator filed a false harassment report and had my account suspended, after threatening to do so which is a clear violation of the #1 rule of reddit's content policy. However, after filing a ticket before this even happened, my account was permanently banned within 12 hours and the spineless moderator is still allowed to operate in one of the top reddits, after having clearly used intimidation against me to silence someone with a differing opinion on their conflicting, poorly thought out rules. Every appeal method gets nothing but bot replies, zendesk tickets are unanswered for a month, clearly showing that reddit voluntarily supports the facist, cowardly and pathetic abuse of power by moderators, and only enforces the content policy against regular users while allowing the blatant violation of rules by moderators and their sock puppet accounts managing every top sub on the site. Also, due to the rapist mentality of reddit's administration, spez and it's moderators, you can't delete all of your content, if you delete your account, reddit will restore your comments to maintain SEO rankings and earn money from your content without your permission. So, I've used power delete suite to delete everything that I have ever contributed, to say a giant fuck you to reddit, it's moderators, and it's shareholders. From your friends at reddit following every bot message, and an account suspension after over a decade in good standing is a slap in the face and shows how rotten reddit is to the very fucking core."
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,Omg I never noticed that lol. And yet he's perfectly happy to be all kinds of naked in the shower.
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,It's those little details in kojima games👌
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,Great game. Weird game
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,No looking at the peepee.
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,Reminds me of 2B covering her ass if u look up at it AND u get an achievement lol
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,Do any western games have similar perv prevention techniques. I've seen several variations of this gif and it's always on a Japanese game.
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,A meme once referred to this game as Norman Reedus and the funky fetus and that's all i can think about when this comes up
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,The worst part is how he sensually lifts your chin before punching. Always makes me feel weird lol
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"Dude the PT shadow in the shower scared the FUCK out of me when I saw it.

Back when it first came out all of these little easter eggs were a complete mystery and random as fuck.

Theres also one where BB tabs on the glass and you tap back and then he just fucking rams his head through the glass and jumpscares the shit out of you.

Every time I went back to the room   after that I was always so damn paranoid."
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"Man, what a game. Recently started replaying, on the DC version on PC. Im so excited for DS2"
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,Meanwhile Quiet has an endless loop of animations in different seductive poses while you stare at her in the helicopter in mgs5
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"I know ""walking simulator"" gets made fun of a lot, but I really enjoyed this game. 

It's definitely worth another playthrough, I think."
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,Crazy. I never noticed that.
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,Death Stranding is definitely my favorite Normal Reedus simulator.
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"Actually this is a very early throw back to MGS2 when sneaking around big shell, you come across the hostages and if youre sneaking around prone you can peek up some of the females panties and when they sense you theyll close their legs and do this. Its a Hideo Kojima easter egg."
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,My favorite Strand type game
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"I enjoy little shit like this that draws attention to the player being a bit too nosey.  
I'm reminded of a part in the Witcher 3 where there's a rare instance of asking the same question a second time gets you different dialogue. You're performing an autopsy, ask to check the corpse's genitals, guy helping you says it's pointless but you insist. If you do it again bro just says ""While you seem to be fascinated with gonads I'm afraid I don't share are similar interest""."
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"That's the ""bro wtf"" look"
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,Amazing that the game designers sensed that players would actually do this.
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,I love stupid little easter eggs like this.
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"thanks to reddit, i am more aware of this feature than any other aspect of DS."

11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,still pissed i missed this for free on epic games for christmas.  Was prob the only time i forgot to check the free games
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"I’m so confused, is this game a masterpiece, or a monotonous UPS simulator?"
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,Tits are okay but dongs aren't. I demand equality!
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"There so many things I missed in the 10 years I've been playing phantom pain. Just the little things like this that makes kojima a legend in video games. He's like the Kubrick of video games, no detail is too much. Still learning weird details in rdr2."
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,When the developers know their fan base.
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"His face when he's looking down at the camera, he knows what he's doing"

11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,I'm surprised he hasn't made it into Days Gone as a DLC playable character somehow. Seems like a game Norman would like based off of shows he has been it
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,bruh seriously
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"Reminds me of HZD, climbing up the bitter climb she says “don’t look down don’t look down” so I look down and she says “dammit!!”"
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,Haha I love the little *concerned grunt* Norman gives when you look there 😄
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"The way he points at the wall when you decide to check the shelf behind him is still my favourite cutscene in ALL of gaming, hands down."
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,Daryl?
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"So, stupid question: is this game fun? I’ve heard that it’s cool, and unique and has a bunch of interesting systems and things it does, but is it fun/good? I’m 40 now with a wife, kids etc. Due to investments, I’m no longer a free time millionaire lol."
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,I need to check it now
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,Probably just knows OP's user name.
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,Is he from walking dead?
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,Daryl from walking dead?!!!
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-11,I love how they just modeled him after how he actually looks like irl
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-11,Cock shame
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-11,Someone should mod his dick into the game.

11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,Is Death Stranding better then Days Gone  ?
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,I really want to play this again but I don't feel like hooking up my PS4 because I'm lazy as fuck.

11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,Is this game any good? I saw a few people say it was quite boring / frustrating on release.
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,True gender equality for the upskirt gag.
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,That's hilarious 😆😅😆

11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,Very Kojima. Reminds me so much of Metal Gear Solid games
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,That's just funny.
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,At the beginning of the game don't look at his feet. He rips his toe nail off.
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"I still hold that death stranding was a great game when it came out.

it did precisely what it wanted, what it wanted was just not what some people wanted.

It was winter, it was cold, and i played it over the course of 5 days, including roughly 20 hours of doing so while using my ergometer.

I will never forget some of the moments where they really hit a stride with the music, or the characters. like when you cross over that ridge and Asylums for the feeling starts up - or when you finally meet heartman.

it's a surreal memory."

11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,Is it me or is that dude supposed to look like that biker guy from the walking dead?
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"With all the small little details and interactions in this game, I really cannot wait to see what PlayStation & KojiPro do with DS2 on PS5. Easily one of my most anticipated games right now."

I’m playing DS at this right moment and going onto the EAST for the final Blow!

11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-11,"O wow , what game is this?"
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-11,for this to exist that means someone at Kojima knew players would try to look a Norman's junk

11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,I bought the game and played it for an hour. I kinda got turned off by all the worthless trash left around by other players. Is it worth a finish?

11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"I remember there were a few stupid dumbfucks were actually angry at this (angry at Kojima) because they brought up that you could ogle Quiet from MGSV and the beauties from MGS4. 

Completely different games that have nothing to do with this game. Just because a dude character doesn't want you staring at his junk, while a female character eggs you own to stare at her body in a totally separate game, does not mean that it's a statement saying that people are only allowed to sexualize/objectify women."
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"In my 2 hours with this game, I interacted with it for less than 5 minutes and walked away more confused than when I went in. Why do y'all keep giving Kojima money for this crap?"

11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,Great game. But the actual ads for his tv show really took me out of it.

11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,I want a character that shows off more when you do this.

11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-11,"So the programmers really sat there for minutes programming Norman covering his penis if you stare at it, and the artists sat there for hours making that possible?"
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-11,Probably because he has none.

11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-11,"In the horror game White Day: A Labyrinth named School, you can crouch down and look up the girls skirts. The girls will try to cover up with one even kicking you (which causes damage and could even kill you if you're at low health). 

The worst part is the game has an invisible affection/relationship meter with them that goes up or down depending on your dialogue choices and actions in the game and looking up their skirts will reduce this meter which can lead to a bad ending (and there's a limited number of opportunities to raise this meter)."

You have sections with a female companion ""Farah"" which gets closer to you the more you progress the story. You can go to first person camera mode in that game if you stand still.

The 13 year old me used that camera mode to stare at Farah from up close lmao...if you stare for too long she would get angry and the camera was forced to go back into 3rd person view in early game, as the story progresses, she starts to blush if we stare and then near the end she just says that she doesn't mind us staring at her lol. 13 year old me was blown away by that little attention to detail."

Like yeah walking is a big part of it, but there’s also fighting thieves, sneaking through fields of ghosts, battles with tentacle monsters, and building structures.

Plus once you get the  power trike the need to walk goes way down, and that’s early in the game."

11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-11,"It's completely outstanding if it gets to be your cup of tea., and quite the opposite if you play it expecting a traditional action game or something like the author's previous works, something that happened to many people who jumped on the hype train at launch without even investigate what the game was about.

The gameplay is a logistics simulator through rugged terrain, you start traveling on foot with only ropes and ladders and progressively end up with a lot of futuristic gadgets, vehicles, weapons and infrastructure. Reaching your destination is a puzzle and is the highlight of the gameplay, there's also horror and traditional action sequences but that is not the focus all the time. The performances, soundtrack and landscapes are amazing.

11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,Stranding genre is gonna pop off any day now.
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"I mean it is a walking simulator and a damn good one, that's what you would be doing most of the time, the first trip to a location even in late game will be walking, you will be walking to most camps especially on higher altitude until the zip lines come into play 

Other things like the shooting and sneaking fighting are pretty bad, sneaking more than fighting, the combat is serviceable but the BT zones are by far the worst part of the game, never scary, with no tension (especially after you get blood grenades) just tedium

The Walking is along with the plot the most important and enjoyable part of the game and it is what the game will be sold on and why I love the game, the sense of adventure and wandering, the preparation for that walk

Not for shooting and Crouch walking"
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"I didn’t realize this until fairly late, but you can automatically arrange your cargo and it helps a ton. Not sure if that’s helpful but I thought I’d pass it on in case it is."

11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,There was one ladder in the game where you could without her noticing but you needed a rifle scope. (Source I was a pervert back in my early teen years)
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,Which can be hilarious if you aren’t trying to look up and are just suplexing an enemy near her only for her to get offended by the up skirt rather than you slamming a zombie into her face.

11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-11,There's a video on youtube where Leon suplexes an enemy with Ashley standing behind him causing her to call him a pervert.

11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,It's called Deadly Silence. It's actually a port of the original game.

11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,Explaining everything and still not making sense. The game was interesting but the story was something... 🙄
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"And shit bombs and they are called EX Grenade No. 1 and No. 2, respectively."

11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"It's not an rpg, although that classification is kinda meaningless now due to being misused for so long. I love the game, it's a very unique and beautiful experience. When i dont know what else to play, i can always jump back into death stranding to trek across the wild again making some deliveries. 

If the game loop appeals to you, it can be a very relaxing game, or have you involved and stressed during tougher sequences. Managing the amount of gear and supplies you are carrying out to a settlement, avoiding enemy camps and the anomalies of the apocalyptic world. And then running into timefall and having to navigate past invisible ghosts while your supplies are being quickly destroyed in the destructive rain. And then trekking over the next rise and seeing your destination out on the distance as the soundtrack kicks in.. the game uses its' atmosphere very well. 

Story wise it is very much a kojima game. Long cutscenes, bizarre characters, random actors having parts in the game because kojima can't control himself. Themes can be hamfisted and disjointed. But the story had me engrossed the whole way through. Set up as a mix between Escape from New York and Neon Genesis Evangelion, i was very interested in seeing more of the bizzare world and uncovering all the mysteries of it from the start."
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"It's not really an RPG in the sense that you don't have control over your character stats and there are no dialogue trees. It's a delivery mission and exploration game. There is combat, but you're really not meant to kill anyone. You have to reconnect post-apocalyptic America from city to city and find people hiding out in the world and bring them back online. You essentially play as a superhero who cannot die and who has a sensitivity to detecting and avoiding the angry ghosts of people who died and are still stranded on Earth, while terrorists try to wipe out the rest of humanity by bringing on an extinction event. But is the new government you're working for trustworthy? Do people even want to be connected?

All of this while listening to some of Kojima's favorite songs. The game is awesome, but it's really not for everyone. The beginning is pretty rough as they barrage you with a bunch of names and weird stuff that is explained more later on, but it can turn some folks off of the game right off the bat. If you stick with it until chapter 3, this is where the real game begins (in my opinion) and you start to get a sense of what the game will be, and each chapter unlocks more and more tools to make getting around the world less tedious."
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"I was initially really into the game. It's beautiful and atmospheric and the music is amazing. But after awhile it became a bit of a grind. Felt like just a bunch of fetch quests, and I spent a lot of time planning the logistics of my journeys. Started to feel like my job. When I had to check my emails between outings and realised I wasn't keeping up with my emails, that's when I lost it. I did not need a second job as Norman Reedus 🤣 that said I might go back to the game eventually when I feel less triggered lol."
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"As others have said, not an RPG, more like a weird hybrid of stealth action and open world exploration. I think it's worth it at pretty much any discounted  price. For me the best parts were exploring the gorgeous and spooky terrain, building roads with other players, and building zipline routes. Especially over mountains - there was something so viscerally satisfying about figuring out the best way to maximize distance between pylons and minimize power consumption, so that I could zip over a previously impassable range.

Also the atmosphere is so incredibly weird and unsettling and aesthetic. 

However, once I had fully optimized all my routes and had complete mastery of the terrain it stopped being fun, so I finished the nonsense plot in like an hour and was done."
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"Death Stranding is anything but an RPG, good game tho, really liked it."
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"it's kind of strange.  a lot of the missions are auto-generated filler, so don't get caught up in them 

the landscapes are crazy and unique.  it's more of an open world terrain traversal game than an rpg"
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,It was pretty fun.  It's essentially an offroading simulator.
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"I have a weird relationship with this game. I feel like I think about it all the time... But I hated most of my time with it. There is a really chill and beautiful walking simulator type delivery game buried under piles of intentionally frustrating combat where the punishment for just wanting to get through a BT area without it taking forever... Is to fight a frustrating boss to make things take longer. Then pile on the horseshittiest of plots and characters and you have Death Stranding or as it should be called ""Kojima doesn't respect your time!""

All that said... Game still lives rent free in my brain. And the moments when you are trying to balance your deliveries and crest a hill and Radiohead We Have At Home starts playing as you make your way down to the destination you can see at the bottom are truly awesome... But I honestly don't think it is worth it."
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,I just started and I’m loving it!
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"In addition to what was said, I’ll just say this:

Out of all the games I’ve played in the past five years, only three have me pondering to this day on the unique emotional journey and story they took me through.

Outer Wilds, Disco Elysium, and Death Stranding.

The mix of environments, soundtracks, stories, sense of dread and humor, characters, and philosophies presented in these games left me with one of those unique feelings. Like how you just finished something special, and you’ll never experience it for the first time ever again.

If that sounds like something you’d like to experience, I’d highly recommend any of those three games, but as a DS thread I’ll wholeheartedly recommend it. Just make sure you get to Chapter 3, the beginning two chapters can be a slog."
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"It's on playstation plus at the moment if you have that. Just picked it up recently, excellent game so far. Weird yes, but still good."
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,">ould you recommend the game? I thinking of buying it since it looks like a nice RP

I didn't like it and just did my best to finish ASAP cause I felt bad about leaving games unfinished. Afterwards, i sold it to Gamestop."
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,If you live in the United States you can go to your local library and rent it for free.
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"Bro, get the game. It's fun. At first you're like ""Ohh ahh pretty!"" Then as it goes on you're like ""okay, what's going on here? Is this all of it?"" 

But pay attention to the story. That's where the real magic is. Each mission is just a goal to get you to the next part of the story. Use it as such. I didn't do a ton of side missions. Pretty much burned through the main thing, but JFC. I'd recommend this to anyone in a heart beat. I'm not a huge fanboy either. I RARELY complete/beat my games. I'm not an achievement hunter or anything. I beat this one though. Then I cried like an ugly bastard. Holy shit. Just do it. Get the game and thank me later."
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"I loved it but I guess it's not for everyone.

It has some of the coolest cutscenes I have ever seen. The gameplay is also very refreshingly different than anything else I have ever played.

It was actually my first Kojima game so I was not prepared for some of the goofiness but I learned to love it quickly. 

Would definitely recommend playing and just see for yourself"
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"It’s a really weird game. The traveling is only tedious at the beginning, then you get all sorts of tools to make it easy. The story is batshit insane. The characters have dumb names. There’s a lot of intentionally funny stuff mixed in with the serious. The combat is amazing.

I think it’s a fantastic experience, and I ended up throwing all of my resource hoarding tactics built up from years of survival horror games and RPGs out the window. Use all of your resources. Buy silly equipment and use it in silly ways; dumping it when you’re done. Use all of the weapons in the weirdest ways you can think of, and you’ll be rewarded. The best way to have the most fun in this game is to be as wasteful as possible. Play it!"
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"Barely... Read the reviews. It was worth my time, but I'm glad I didn't pay for it. (PS Game pass or whatever its called) 

The mechanics are fun-ish, but you have to wade through a LOT of droll content. A LOT.

The story is almost childish. It beats you over the head with its messaging and does weird things like... Spend 15 minutes in a cut scene, you get back to the game, your comms thing immediately has a character jump on and tell you what just happened in excruciating detail.

Make sure you have something else to do for the last few missions... Hold crap is it a lot of terrible unskippable content."
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"I picked it up for free during an Epic Games Store sale and put 140 hours in it.  I probably wouldn't buy it at retail but for $20 or less, it's totally worth it just for the story line alone."
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,That was Mei Ling not Meryl
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"Never knew of this as MSG was a little before my generation, but I remember my dad loved those games. I just watched the scene you’re talking about and I can only imagine what that’s like experiencing the first time when it was current!"
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,Yep all of those were in the PS1 version too. Very fun game that was.
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"I'm way too young to have played all these games, but, that looked amazing! Would have totally freaked me the hell out!

Why don't games do this these days? Mess with players?"
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-11,"Heh, just grabbed the game from my shelf and yep, I remember the PS1 version breaking the fourth wall and telling you to look at the back of the case.

The Psycho Mantis fight also broke the fourth wall but there wasn't vibration on the original PS1 controller, so that scene wasn't included (AFAIK). Mantis *would* comment on your play style by how many times you've saved, either calling you reckless or a coward. The unplugging the controller thing *was* there, too... if you called the Colonel enough times for help he'd straight up tell you to unplug the controller and put it into the other side.

Revolver Ocelot also warned you not to use a ""turbo"" button on an aftermarket controller while he's torturing you, because **he'd know.**"

A lot of anime go from gritty grounded setting, they trip over a rock and suddenly running fighting God then becoming God, and realizing what life love and happiness was a long the way."

11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"I remember the first time I played in the starter zone I picked up some sandalweed and was all ""Oh, I should take advantage to save on some resources"".  

All that kind of thing is for people who didn't prepare, since resources are inanely easy to acquire and by extension, gear easy to acquire and equally easily discardable.  There's no reason to ever use a pair of mule boots as anything but a weapon."

11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"You could almost call any game an RPG, in that you're playing a role that isn't you.

I like to think of it as ""roll"" playing game, which is to say any game with stats and odds applying to actions. Then again, that's just how you balance a game and define a character these days, so it's arguable that most games are still RPGs by that definition"
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,">It's not an rpg, although that classification is kinda meaningless now due to being misused for so long.

It's meaningless because of how broad and all-encompassing just ""RPG"" is. At its root, RPG is simply any game that fits the phrase. This is obviously useless because it includes basically any game where you can say (and play) ""I am playing (as) 'X' character"", and that fits games from (arguably) Civilization where you play as Cleopatra, Teddy Roosevelt, or others, to DND, where you play as anyone you can imagine. Nobody would ever classify civ as an RPG, and there are a lot of games in the middle that people also wouldn't call RPGs, despite meeting the root definition. 

I've been pushing for people to drop the idea of what is and isn't an RPG, because the term is useless by itself, and to start using descriptors. For example, action/adventure RPG (recent tomb raider, far cry) versus cinematic rpg (tell tales). Or to use features to define it, such as saying it lacks ""XYZ"" RPG elements so it's a weak ""x-rpg"".

The problem with using features to define what is and isn't an RPG is that different kinds of games have different emphases on features, and what is ""meaningful character choices"" to one player might be something else to a different player."
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"Started it recently and only a few missions in, wound up with like 50 packages and overencumbered slowly walking across the world. I have a feeling thats not how you're supposed to play it lol but the temptation to pick up everything you see is real"
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"It’s more of a strand type game. Playing it online also makes the game very easy for those who feel like the challenges are daunting. Very fun game, it gets more fun as you progress and upgrade things."
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,You play the role of Sam. Therefore it's a role playing game.
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,I’m hoping it makes it’s way to gamepass on the Xbox.
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"The game play loop is compelling, but the story is straight nonsense from beginning to end. Classic kojima"

11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"> There is combat, but you're really not meant to kill anyone.

Hmm, we must have played different games, I cleared every MULE camp I came near, I must have gone through 100s of BOLA guns and dozens of rubber bullet shotties.  I also did so many missions for the Craftsman that I had nearly infinite Custom Hematic Grenades so any time it started raining I just stashed my cargo and killed the big BT to clear it."

11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,">so I finished the nonsense plot in like an hour and was done.

Nonsense plot? The story is like 90% of the reason to play unless you really love fetch quests. One of the best video game stories I've ever experienced.

The ending takes like 3-4 hours too with all the cutscenes, so I'm not sure how you managed it in an hour."
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,How would you describe it then?
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,That doesn't really sound fun to be honest.
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"I’d highly recommend ROMing the games if you’re ever up for trying the series. They’re iconic for good reason. I loved the story and the cinematic cutscenes.

You can also get away with playing MGS3 (my vote for the best game of all time) and MGSV (current gen), they canonically take place earliest in the series and either are great as standalone stories.

MGSV has the best stealth action gameplay ever, and Konami keeping the FOX engine for themselves and abandoning game development might be the greatest sin in the modern video game era."
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"The games were out when I was a kid, but I never played them. The closest thing I've had to that is relatively recent. Played a new racing game on Xbox, and after I got my first car, the announcer said aloud ""Welcome (my real name)..."".

Took me a moment to realize that it got my name from the system because I never put that info into the game itself. Through me for a loop"
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-11,"I played it 20 years ago, and it did freak me out! Lol then figuring out I had to put the controller in the second slot to beat Psycho Mantis was a wild experience. It was all very cool at the time and I have very fond memories of the MGS series. 

MGS 1-3 were very unique even during their time (part of why the series is so iconic). Not many other games did stuff quite like this, which are a common thread in Kojima’s games in particular."

11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,I used the sandalweed exactly once to see if it actually helped with stealth and then wore the Chiral boots the rest of the game.
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-11,I played about 20 hours of it.  Had just finished most of the Midwest region I think.
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"That's not unusual for game length, and is challenge you to find another (non-Kojima) game that offers so little player agency in the opening hours. That's when you're meant to draw people in, show them how to play. In 2 hours, I learned how to add something to my bookbag and that balance was important. And that's literally it. Everything else was nonsensical cutscenes. There was no substance to those first few hours, so I'm not wasting my time with the rest. It's lucky I gave it that long, tbh"

11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,Fair warning. When they said long cutscenes they meant it. Cutscenes are long and *frequent*. I actually liked the gameplay and story and still stopped playing after like 5 hours because it felt like I'd gotten 1 hour of gameplay and 4 hours of cutscene.

11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"Yeah, i wouldn't really deny that. It was atleast interesting nonsense to me and i really loved the whole idea of the beach and how it was used. But I do really wish Kojima brought in a writing team that could keep his worst tendencies in check."
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-11,"Yeah but you weren't killing them, you were just knocking them out. I mostly punched and kicked my way through camps, but later on the non-lethal AR and riot shotgun were a lot more efficient. If you actually killed one of them you had to deal with that immediately which was not always convenient and if you ignored it, it would eventually be game-ending.

The flying knee move in the Director's Cut is awesome, very satisfying when it connects. That and the body slam were pretty effective even in the late game."

11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,I personally got bored after a few hours and stopped playing.
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"Naw it’s so much more than that. There’s combat, stealth, boss fights, character upgrades, and more, and all of that us woven in between the memed on “fed ex simulator” part of the game, which is actually quite fun. It’s all about using the tools they give you like ladders, ropes, ziplines, etc. to navigate your way around the terrain. Also the music is phenomenal and adds a huge amount to the atmosphere of the game."
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"As someone who put over 80 hours into it...it's really not that fun. 

Sure you might get a little bit of a dopamine rush actually successfully completing a delivery. However, your enjoyment of the game relies entirely on that possibility. Combat and stealth is there, but the main meat of the game is still entirely in its traveling mechanic. While I played, I used my other monitor to play shows and movies."
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"Eh; lots of route selection and reward mechanics, opportunities for optimization.  Social highway building system was neat.  It surprised me.  I didn't think I'd like it as much as I did.

11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"Because it is not fun. What it is… is… interesting. You keep on going doing absolutely soul wreckingly boring chores on a barren land trying to avoid enemies you can’t see. The whole game is a chore. There is no other quest other than fetch quests. The basic premise is so boring that, the real gameplay is essentially unlocked after a few chapters into the game ans that is… drumroll please… trying your hardest to not engage in base gameplay. So in this game the gameplay is traversal while delivering packages. But it is so boring that just before you rage quit, the game unlocks structures that would avail you skip parts of that boredom. At that point you are gathering materials and building structures so that you wouldn’t spend more time doing actual base gameplay and the only enjoyable element in the game is this: shortening the time it takes you to do chores.

The only thing keeps you going is the very interesting story but to that to unfold you gotta pay the blood debt and suffer the gameplay while praying to your abductors health because he gave you a chance to skip parts of the game he made."
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"> There’s also like Soulsborne-ish MP aspects where objects from another game can appear in yours and vice versa but I’m not exactly sure how that works out.

I played back on release, but the way it worked back then was that any time a player dropped a piece of cargo and abandoned it, it would get flagged as ""lost cargo"" and distributed to other players' games to be picked up and delivered or used.

Structures work in a similar vein, you contribute to a road and it gets completed and the server/community you are connected to would gain access to the road until it degrades to the point of destruction. Same concept for ziplines and such."
11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,"Oh true on the atmosphere bit.  The vibe of it was great.  I might hunt up the sound track.

I wasn't that big on the combat, personally, but I stand by my hyper-redux, since that's the core mechanic.  All the upgrades, tools, social building aspects, deliveries, progression, etc, all center around the offroading simulator mechanic.

The person originally thought it was an RPG, but in terms of where you spend your time it's much closer to an OR sim with combat.  It's just a very good OR sim, even when you're walking.  If you're not familiar with OR titles, they all center around deliveries and upgrades to make the deliveries easier, fuel, unlocking new areas, etc."

11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-13,"The game gives you lots of hints, but the first time was mostly trial and error. Since Mantis can read your mind, he dodges most of your attacks, but not ALL of your attacks. I thought since I could still hurt him sometimes that I was just losing due to a skill issue (he is supposed to be psychic after all), so I kept trying without help. The Colonel gives you hints if you call him but for whatever reason I ignored my codec at the time. After a long time of fighting it finally clicked that maybe I was doing something wrong. 

The whole Mantis “fourth wall break” thing where he reads your memory card, coupled with him moving your controller (I played it on PS2 so it worked), and him dodging you while saying he could read your mind repeatedly (i.e. he knows your controls) got me thinking that maybe the solution had to do with the playstation itself, so I plugged the controller into port 2 just to experiment and it actually worked lol. 

That was not at all the easy way of figuring it out tho. If you call the Colonel multiple times for help he just straight up tells you to do it, which would’ve saved me a lot of time."

11nmi0r,2023-03-10,2023-03-11,"Don't see how you got that. The premise of the game is Norman Reedus walking around with a tall backpack. In 2 hours, I got to put 2 whole things on that backpack, and watched 1 hour and 55 minutes in cutscenes. What is so hard to understand about this? The game takes FOREVER to take off, so why would I waste my time when there are hundreds of games that take off immediately? I shouldn't have to research whether a game is going to give me agency in the first half hour. It should be obvious to a game developer that the players need to PLAY the game, the sooner the better. And a good storyteller would recognize that the most important moment in their story is when they convince their audience that they can't turn away from this story. Being obtuse, weird, vague, and confusing is just that -- it's not some ultra-mature take on narrative, it's just had storytelling. He fails immediately out of the gate."

But playing on normal, the game really isnt hard, and as you do the first few missions you quickly learn the ropes. Everyone always says just wait till you get to chapter 3, in the larger ""main"" map area. But the first section of the game does well to adjust you into things since it's smaller and not too hard to navigate around"

Think about it , motherfucker seems to hate it but spent 80 hours playing it. If you hate something do you spend that much time on it ?

That's how it was for me , looking at the game on paper i was like nahhhh but there is a strange quality to it that make people unable to stop playing it even if they dont like it. 

It has one of the best graphic in any game i ever played and the option to play with black bars on an OLED tv in widescreen mode make it one of the most visually impessive game i ever saw."

People who are that level of timid and scared of the world to this degree deserve nothing but scorn, expressing it in public is INVITING people to criticize your lack of worldliness.  

Think about it like this, if you are a red blooded human being, man or woman, you've probably wondered about what people you've run into look like under their clothes.  Norman Reedus with his amount of fame, probably has fifty million people out there drooling over a faked photo of him complete naked.  

Looking at a loving recreation of his crotch is just normal curiosity for some, ribald fun for other.  The reaction is funny and endearing, like Sam here is aware of us, it's a fourth wall break meant to be humorous.  So when you say ""I get surprised when I get downvoted"" in this context, it means you are literally surprised that better adjusted people who aren't perpetually offended, on their own or someone else's behalf, are annoyed or dislike hearing someone with poor social reasoning and conditioning lecture them on what the proper way to behave."

Looking under someone's skirt to check what genitals they have *is* gross, and it's explicitly referenced as ""discovering her secret"". So yeah, no thanks from someone who actually is intersex.

As far as games are concerned. Too many shitty ""blockbusters"" that don't sell well (enough), but have way too high of a budget. Oversaturation of the market, especially when money is tighter. It's not even worth reporting all that much, to be honest.  
  
People blaming capitalism are a bit short-sighted. It's not capitalism itself that's the issue. It's people buying shitty products. Of course companies will focus on that which (on paper) makes them the most money. You'd act exactly the same. If you make enough money you can afford some other games as passion projects or to branch out and diversify your portfolio. I guarantee you ""we"" will be having this discussion again in a few years, only then it's going to be Larian in the spotlight. Sooner or later this always happens.

Every big game company today is standing on the shoulders of risk and innovation from their predecessors, but instead of making mad new games they're whiney little cowards that only rerelease past bangers or make half arsed sequels and fill them with microtransactions because it's ""safe"".  

I hate basically every AAA that exists today, you're all fat trash tier trust fund babies of your mega chad ancestors.  

Sure, there's exceptions, but you throw $100 million at a game of course it's going to look pretty and seem decent. But on their end it's nothing but investment vs return calculations, and that's why Baldur's Gate 3 blew everyone out of the water because **they actually cared about the game** like Bungie and Blizzard and the likes used to 20 years ago when they actually made good games."

That is just console/PC gaming and ignores the FPS/RPG/Sports/Racing categories. 5 years will see probably another 2-3 generations of VR/AR, and things like motion tracking and the Omni pad will only get better.

And then, there's video gaming. Terrified of letting go of its dated tabletop and coin op mechanics. Afraid or unable to grow into its own medium. Graphics have never been prettier...and yet, tabletop RPGs without them are experiencing a huge resurgence even as video game sales decline once more post Covid.

17vhepm,2023-11-15,2023-11-15,"Its more likely the shift in funding models. The Silicon Valley boom made everyone get into the investment model, which is designed to create boom and bust.

Basically, if you form a company to do one thing and magically find the money from nowhere, you can continue to do that thing as long as the income matches or exceeds the operating costs. 

Maybe you have to take a bank loan to get started - okay, so the repayments become part of the operating costs, and nothing changes.

But! What if you go with an investment model, and sell 43% of the company to someone who will give you all the funding you need (and mentorship, support, etc)?

Well, the issue is they don't actually care about the output of what you do. They care about GROWTH on their investment. So even if your income is above your operating costs, they don't care. They didn't give you that money altruistically, they need GROWTH. So you have to scale up, every time. You have to keep the company on a thin line between profit and loss, and the moment the profit dips it all collapses.

The example I always pull out here is Hello Games, who for years have just happily made little updates to No Man's Sky. The key thing is they resisted offers of investment and instead took lump sums for deals (PS exclusivity, PSVR exclusivity, Game Pass) and notably didn't substantially scale up after any of them. They still work out a small building in the UK, still maintain a small team, but they don't have anyone breathing down their neck about growth-on-investment so it's fine."

Again, Elden Ring is a good game, a beautiful game, but it isn't a unique game by any means. And that isn't a bad thing, but it does prove this point that the most successful games are from successful IPs and franchises."

17vhepm,2023-11-15,2023-11-15,"Problem isn't new IPs, it's crap games. Forspoken was a new IP and a crap game, while Gollum was a fucking well known IP with a crap game.

Elden Ring was a new IP and look at what it has become. AC Valhalla wasn't a new IP and it was a bad game.

Devs should stick to what they can do best, not necesarily the same IPs. If Miyazaki starts making FPS games, he will most likely make worse games than his previous works, but look at his other games: Bloodborne, Sekiro, Elden Ring were all new IPs, not part of the Dark Souls, and they were awesome. When he directed his first game, AC4, people said that he destroyed the game with all the changes, and it happened because he wasn't that good at that kind of game."

This is purely just my speculation.

Edit: added words for clarity"
17vhepm,2023-11-15,2023-11-15,"The question is, how much money have they lost on games no one has ever heard of that they've published?

Yeah, Control, Death Stranding, and Ghostrunner were all very successful games, but it doesn't tell us anything about how their *unsuccessful* games were, nor how numerous they were. If you shoot five times, and get three hits, you're probably doing well. If you shoot fifty times, and get three hits, you're probably way in the red.

Also worth noting: I'm not sure if any of those studios whose games we just listed will end up working with 505 again, either. Remedy has worked with a number of publishers over the years, and Ghostrunner's creator was bought by Microsoft."

Once they get promoted to a role they can't do well, they get stuck there, because they won't be promoted again, but their superiors won't demote them either, because that would require them to admit that the initial promotion was a mistake they made.

Nobody is going to force you to buy a game, nor is it being bought for you without your consent. If you don't like a game, you simply keep your money and don't buy it. There's plenty of information to make an informed decision. If a game you don't like succeeds, it's because other people like it.

But it also often doesn't pay to make the best game ever. That requires passion and a willingness to push into diminishing returns. It's often said that it's not about making the best product, just a product good enough that they'd still buy another."

17vhepm,2023-11-15,2023-11-15,Yeah death stranding attracted a ton of players due to koj8ma alone. There's a good chance it wouldn't have been as successful until a sequel happened.
17vhepm,2023-11-15,2023-11-15,"Conceptually maybe. I thought it was very boring to play, it felt like playing Skyrim after you've finished all of the quest lines and only have the randomly generated Radiant quests left."
17vhepm,2023-11-15,2023-11-15,If that's the case then their expectations were absurd since Death Stranding has sold over 10 million copies.
17vhepm,2023-11-15,2023-11-15,"It’s not dying. There is a shit ton of games to play. Good ones too. That’s not the problem at all.

Game sequels and reboots are much higher quality than Movies. I was just saying that they are both doing the same thing. I was not commenting on the quality which is much better in the gaming industry."
17vhepm,2023-11-15,2023-11-15,"Hell I've been so jaded with AAA for so long... I think Elden Ring might be the only *new* AAA title I've played in the last 5+ years.

17vhepm,2023-11-15,2023-11-15,"We've been in triple A 3rd person action-adventure open world hell since gta 3 released basically.  It started as GTA clones then evolved into the ubisoft formula.  I think AA games have become too expensive to make for them to take any risks, so they kind of all just copy each others ideas until it no longer becomes profitable.  So we're in this weird place where basically indie and maybe AA developers have to do the inovating until someone strikes gold and then the AAA companies will pick it up and milk it until it is no longer fun or profitable."
17vhepm,2023-11-15,2023-11-15,"AAA gaming might not even survive the next decade. The games were already too costly to be sustainable. Now, with US students paying loans, inflation and other entertainment competing for time, recycling sequels may be the deathknell of an already stagnant industry."

The occassional sleeper hit comes once in a while, but the biggest games are from established publishers iterating on their work, not taking huge financial chances with new stuff (even if that new stuff if successful, the money could have been better spent on remaking Resident Evil, for example)"
17vhepm,2023-11-15,2023-11-15,"XD in a few years time when they’ve fed you the same shit soup for the fourth time maybe you’ll have some perspective.

These are not games made by people who want to make games these are games made because the business people know that people will give them free money for the same thing over and over. Same people who bought Skyrim multiple times because it’s “got all the dlc now”.

You are the reason this industry is going down the wrong path and the sad part is you won’t see it until the companies have killed themselves and the IPs that you care so much about."

No

>that didn't add anything overall to the experience?

Yes"
17vhepm,2023-11-15,2023-11-16,It added some things. But it's still the same story and half the work for the game was effectively already done because they didn't need writers or a need to come up with anything new. They just made RE4 again with some new mechanics and better graphics. That's decidedly less work than an original game with a whole new story and brand new gameplay.
17vhepm,2023-11-15,2023-11-15,"As someone who has being playing FF since the first one, I tell you that the actual travesty is FF16 itself. With the last mainline FF games, Squareenix insist on pandering to what's hip and alienate their core fans. 

Another way to look at that is that a new mainline FF launch used to be almost a national holiday, a really big event that everyone was watching closely, and with FF16 nobody really cares.

The remake was nominated before, now FF16 does not even get nominated. At this point the only thing keeping the FF brand alive is the FFVII remake fuelled by nostalgia. I know I'm going to get downvoted for saying this, and it's sad for the fans, but is what it is."
17vhepm,2023-11-15,2023-11-15,"in my circles, very few people liked ff16, while many enjoyed re4make. maybe its like that for  others."

17vhepm,2023-11-15,2023-11-15,"> Yeah, Control, Death Stranding, and Ghostrunner were all very successful games, but it doesn't tell us anything about how their unsuccessful games were,

Honestly, it doesn't even say how much money their successful games brought. Sure, Death Stranding sold 5 million. But how many of those were full price, and how much did Kojima (who is known to like to spend money) spent on the game?

I wouldn't be surprised if the company isn't that happy with the returns."

Alan Wake 2 is basically the sequel to Control. It's insane how much of AW2's gameplay and gimmicks are stuff Remedy first developed for Control, and that game was published by EA.

But 505 wants to poop out a multiplayer shooter with the Control branding on it for some reason, as if the logo is why people want to play that game, not the creative design the Remedy team put in."

They keep the overall margins and stockholders happy, chalk it up as a win on their resume and leave the company within 1-3 years to go to another company.

17vhepm,2023-11-15,2023-11-15,"My factory didn't have that problem. No, they aligned managements' bonuses to directly conflict, resulting in multi-front shadow wars where we competed against each other (at the cost of profit and reputation).

Inventory guy gets money based on inventory ""turns"". If he stocks 10 routinely and sells through 100 a year that's just-in-time agile lean sigma six black belt good manufacturing. But wait...

If we don't stock a hundred of those we can't promise good lead times for our industrial machine sales. So sales will miss their bonus.

The factory can't ship on time... they never had what they needed in time.

Spare parts? They'll buy third party rather than wait for us. Our machines out in the world last an obscene amount of time, margin is highest on spare parts, but you know, the planning guy knows the inventory guy, and they know the factory workers, and to keep overhead comparatively low per-item they emphasize new builds in their way, still neglecting lead times that choke our sales and therefore our throughput.

Speaking of which, absolutely the average gamer was doing some dumb shit to level himself up in tactics.  Did I throw rocks at my own guys?  Yes, yes I did.  

 At some point later I spent dozens of hours collecting hundreds of powers in the veldt for one character because why the fuck not.  Also, let's include limit breaks for every character, most of which the average player will never fucking see.  Also this one dude is going to do moves like he's from street fighter.  Why not?

Then in one of the worst game mechanics I've ever been exposed to we were drawing spells from the enemies.  And can we just admit that every game that has ever made you try to steal 30 times from a boss before succeeding is obnoxious?  

I'd complain about dress-spheres, but that was just jobs with more barbie dress up.

Then what the hell, let's make the next game a MMO.  Just for shits and giggles, let's have a 8-second cast time for some spells where the entire party has to coordinate around when the spell will go off. 

And then our next game is going to be a single player MMO designed around writing AI scripts for combat.  The grid system which pretended to be way more than it was.

By the way, I hope you all like minigames.  You're gonna spend a bazillion hours doing something or another with chocobos.  Do you remember dodging 100 lightning bolts?  Of course you do.  Snowboarding.  Blitzball.  Jumping puzzles.  Tower defense.  Survival. Triple fucking triad.

That ten hour tutorial.  Bro road trip that somehow makes being assaulted by fifty guys combat dropping on you boring because you're playing a shitty version of kingdom hearts.

Alienating fans was always part of Final Fantasy, you just got old."

FF16 is nothing short of a masterpiece from a cinematic and storytelling perspective, it has some minor pacing issues with some petty fetch tasks in-between big story moments, but the rest is fire

I think people are confusing those games being successful with those games being popular or well-liked. COD for example sells well, sure, but it's player count tanks almost immediately after launch and never recovers until the next COD release. People not valuing $70 enough to care about wasting it on something they'll play for a month isn't necessarily an indication that those are the types of games people want."

Even if the remake doesn’t slap, people will still pre order it on name and nostalgia alone. How often do we see “please remake this game” posts on Reddit? All the time. It’s a guaranteed fan base, guaranteed pre orders.

It makes perfect sense to me why publishers would want to stick with what they know and bring in guaranteed sales, rather than risk it all. 

Look at Robocop. Detach the established IP from that game and it wouldn’t do half as well. 

Detach Bethesda from Starfield and I just know it would have done even worse.

17vhepm,2023-11-15,2023-11-16,"It doesn't actually work like that tho. Consumer psychology, manipulative tactics, brand loyalty. The least comfy shoes become the most successful because the brand it displays is popular. People don't buy Nike because they simply make better shoes than anyone else, they buy it because Nike is popular and trendy and cool. They buy it because their favorite basketball player has a signature shoe. They buy it because it has a perceived value to other people which they can then brag about. The idea that people simply buy the most high quality product is a naive take, that's never been how it works and it ignores the reality of how humans brains work. Psychologically things are far more complex than what you described and very few people actually engage with products in that way."
17vhepm,2023-11-15,2023-11-15,sure it does. Good luck getting a couple hundred people to grind out someone else's vision if there isn't a motivator like money. Making a big game is hard.

I do, however, fail to see how this is relevant to Baldur's Gate 3 reportedly having a minimum of 300 staffs over 6 studios (this part confirmed by Larian themselves) and a budget of at least 100 million dollars. 30% of Larian is owned by Tencent, which occured after Divinity: Original Sin II. I think that stuff like that or specifically having Wizards of the Coast allow them to use their liscense after DOS:II ( https://www.pcgamer.com/larian-was-shot-down-the-first-time-it-wanted-to-make-baldurs-gate-3/ ) suggests that, yes, there were large monetary players who were willing to take a look at what Larian would do, and that Larian itself has grown into at minimum a modestly sized developer.

I also think it really came at the perfect time. It's a game about connecting with people and exploring the human conditions of isolation and dilapidated societies that came out just before the pandemic started.

FF16 combat is very much an above average Hack n Slash, not at the level of DMC, but better than many other

FF16 a flop is quite the stretch honestly, and pretending it was because of the gameplay is so disingenuous holy shit, it’s pretty clear it was hurt mostly by the console exclusivity, I can guaran-fucking-tee you it’s gonna get triple or quadruple the amount of sales the day it releases on PC and Xbox"

1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,"Kojima games are the embodiment of lucid dreaming. He just does whatever the fuck he wants, no matter how weird."
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,"I legit would never imagine what I saw even being possible. I wonder what drugs Kojibro was on when making this.

I'm here for it lol"
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,I have only ever played an hour of death stranding and I am gonna have to finish it because that preview had me hyped and I don't even know WTF is happening
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,I would rather play as this guy tbh
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,The Trailer blew me away.  I always love a Hideo Kojima trailer because he edits them himself.  You see and hear exactly what he wants you to in order to tease you and leave you proper confused at the same time.  Death Stranding blew me away I can not wait to see where he takes this bat shit insane series.
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,I'm getting metal gear rising vibes for some reason. It has to be this way.
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,Then he uses it as an axe and fights some robot lord with it. Has a team of clicker robots with him though so I guess he’s protected from the demon thingys. Fuck I gotta replay death stranding
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,This reminds me the Jack Black game Brutal Legend 2009.
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,This game looks sick
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,This trailer blew me away. Has switched me from not wanting to play the fist game to being hyped to play it.
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,That’s why the named him Video Game Kojima!
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,"Hideo must have played Brütal Legend and thought ""yes, i want that in my game"", legit the first thing it came to my mind when i saw that part of the trailer was Brütal Legend lol"
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,He's a spaceship superstar with his solar-powered laser beam guitar
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,Can someone just tell me to play this game? I've been in the fence since it came out
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,It’s really hard to tell if Kojima is a genius beyond our comprehension or just fucking crazy
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,Troy Baker as Kefka. Awesome.
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,"Even when i try to expect the most absurd thing i can think of, i get outdone by him in glorious HD.

I wouldn't have it any other way."
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,I said hell yes out loud when I first saw it
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,The strands on the guitar activate strands of electricity that strand out and strand you.
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,"IDK. While kooky, this trailer did absolutely nothing for me. I guess Kojima really isn't my kind of thing generally. MGS1 was solid, but after that not so much."
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,Hideo is a Titan of the industry
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,I'm not too thrown because I played DMC3.
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,Hideooooo!  Explain this!

1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,This shit made me not want to play DS2.
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,Nice. Can’t wait to walk to him
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,That looks so cringy im shocked its not from an japanese cartoon.
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,"I have no idea who this is, I have no idea what they're about, but I have a reasonable idea of who their favorite Devil May Cry 3 boss is..."
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,"My first impression seeing this still with Death Stranding 2 name attached was like ""huh, wha?"" but then watched the trailer and oh goodness me. Kojima does Kojima and it always works!"
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,"On one hand, it looks unique and fun...and on the other, I wonder if Kojima has crawled too far up his own ass."
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-03,I see think and think the opposite. I wont touch anything he is a part of.
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,This game looks like absolute garbage.  Kojima is over rated.
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,Someone get me what Hideo is smoking cause that shit must be strong.
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,"I actually hate the character design, and that’s the dumbest weapon I’ve ever seen. 

But just because it’s Kojima, I kinda like it. It makes no sense."
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,He’s no Johnny Silverhand.
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,"In his scene, after he slides on the ground, he blocks his opponent's blade while putting his guitarblade on his back, all the way back. It was goofier then the Kylo Ren's scene. It immediately broke my immersion. 

Look, you can wield your weapon however the f you want, but your opponent is experienced with the blade enough to stop your projectiles with it. 

You think the fighting style you pulled out from your ass, can work against a proper blademaster. I'll make sure to play the guitar on your funeral."
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,The one thing from the trailer I didn't like. Guitar gun just seems overly cheesy and ridiculous
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,Ain't that the guy from School of Rock?
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,what in the fuck
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,I Love musical instrument weapons in games. Hideo has my golden star of approval that he can redeem at my mind palace.
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,Yup. That’s definitely Kojima’s doing. Still don’t know where he gets it but that’s totally him.
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,"Kojima hit the blunt and said, ""What if Raiden was also a vampire with a plasma axegun guitar and orange?"""
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,That’s what I wished I looked like when I play my electric guitar. 😁
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,this mf looks so cool it really makes me wanna try the first game
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,SOMEONE PLEASE GIVE ME THE LINK FOR THE MUSIC DURING THIS SCENE. ITS FKIN AWESOME
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,"So far i don't like this goofy batshit insane elements it looks like a parody for me. I had high hopes with Kojima, he has the resource and now full creative control and he comes up with ideas like this."
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,This trailer was so badass lol hands down the best villain in gaming since Handsome Jack
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,"As always, Kojima never fails to surprise me.

Looking forward to the game!"
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,"Konami held this man back for years. Now, he is free."
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,That looks pretty lame tbh.
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,"Am I the only person who just finds Hideo Kojima utterly irritating? 

Hes not a good story teller - everything he writes is convoluted, meandering nonsense, causing his otherwise fun games to get bogged down in too much tedious narrative drivel. His plots are like something a 10 year old would write. 

I think its safe to say you can just skip literally every cutscene in his games because its a waste of your precious time watching that extended tripe and its not even remotely good or satisfying.

Also hes got terminal anime brain and horny codes too much  - I just want to play a fun stealth action game not jerk off to some pair of animated tits with poorly written dialogue. I uninstalled MGV after I recruited Quiet to the team out of the fear of potentially being caught playing the game by my family and dying of shame when they think Im some kind of serial coomer."
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,So at what point do we get Death Stranding Revengence?
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,"I love Kojima’s craziness, but the game needs to be fun this time"
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,Really hoped he would drop Death Stranding and do something else...
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,cringe game

1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,"Now if he just had a story editor to help make cohesive plots. Love his imagery, hate his storytelling."
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,"""Lives rent free in my head"" - tell me you're a Gen-Z with less than stellar vocabulary without actually telling me that."
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,This new Metroid looks amazing! Making Samus trans is a bold move for Nintendo.
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,Liberals want to bury this image and keep living in their fantasy that metroid is a girl.
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,That’s exactly what I hear when I think of this lol
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,"It does.

Now that I recognize this secret reason, truly, I am now ashamed of my words and deeds."
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,"It is also an Axe, because of course it is, why wouldn't it be?"

1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,"I've played DMC3 where you get a guitar that fires electric bats that's made out of a witch, so this is pretty standard fare."
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,*...and his music was electric*
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,Being Kojima that kind of weird is pretty fun.

1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,Also the guitar is an energy axe that he was using to fight 8 foot tall samurai. Hope that explains the premise.
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,An electric guitar?
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,This confirmes that Kojima is a Jojo fan
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,And it's Alice Cooper cloned or something
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,That’s the level of depth I expect from Kojima writing tbh
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,"I really love Kojima and Baker collaborating. Troy just seems down for anything, especially if it’s wild, so it just makes sense lol"
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,I mean being a badass is being a badass!
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,"I really hate how I just couldn't get into the first one. This trailer just screams amazing, and yet I know that if I buy it I'll have the same reaction I did with Death Stranding of just not being able to continue."
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,While wearing the absolute douchiest hat you can conceive of.
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-04,I think the world really needs to see the bare motion capture footage for this scene
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,"This is way and also why Joel does as well.

Before pursuing acting, Baker was the lead singer and rhythm guitarist for the alternative rock band Tripp Fontaine, which released the radio single ""Burning Out"" from their debut album Random Thoughts on a Paper Napkin in 2004. Baker's first solo album, Sitting in the Fire, was released on October 14, 2014."

1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,There's a huge difference between weird and random.
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,"like a cyber Doof Warrior from Fury Road.  Speaking of, was that George Miller as a character in the trailer?"
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,Dmc3 is best dmc.
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,Mocap?
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,Only just watched the ... trailer? Presentation? Because of this thread. I have no idea what I just watched. I am very stoked.
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,"This feels like new Kojima. A man who is doing EXACTLY what he wants. Personally, I'm not a fan of it. 

I'm a huge fan of Metal Gear. Easily my favorite series of all time. What I liked about it was how grounded in reality most things were, then out of nowhere you got a vampire running vertically up a wall. 

I feel like Kojima is a great ""Ideas"" guy, but you need someone reigning him in and saying ""Kojima, we can't make the game disc bleed when you get shot in the game. That is absurd"". 

I tried so hard to get through Death Stranding. I feel like the only person on this planet who truly understands Death Stranding is Kojima. Even so, if you asked him to explain Death Stranding, I don't think he could lol. 

This trailer LOOKS cool, but seriously, what in the actual fuck is happening in terms of story?"
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,Jesus that is an old penny arcade comic. Wow
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,Really? For me it was the weird little puppet man. I liked his purposefully choppy animation though. Curious to see what the fuck he's all about.
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,"Going off topic because you brought it up, would it really be so hard for Activision to release some kind of Guitar Hero HD collection? They like money don’t they? Maybe someday 😢"

I should play MGS2 again."
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,"I beat DS1 four or five times and I still can't explain DS1 to anybody even if my life depended on it. Playing it is legitimately like dream logic. Everything makes perfect sense and you get it while you're playing it.

When you stop playing it, you've woken up and realize none of what you just witnessed and did make any damn sense."
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,I'm really excited to get back into the world and start making piss mushrooms with you all!
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,"Between having filmmakers like Guillermo Del Toro, George Miller, and various big name actors like Norman Reedus and Elle Fanning star in his video games, he seems to be pretty well regarded amongst Hollywood as well as the video game industry.

I’m very excited for his new IP that he announced after this presentation, an espionage thriller that he says will attempt to “transcend what we think of video games and movies”."

1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,"I literally just reinstalled to finally finish it, had no idea where I was and almost died 😅 but after that altercation I'm back to me, Lou, and another song by Silent Poets. This game is a vibe lol"
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-04,"I finally beat it the other night and I found it to be a rewarding experience, even if the story is a bit meandering. My least favorite bits were when I would get stopped dead in my tracks so Guillermo del Toro can explain the convoluted plot points. Otherwise once I gave in to its atmosphere I found myself enjoying figuring out paths that were best for traversal on foot, I felt smart and capable when I would find the best uses for my ropes and ladders, finding things other players left behind that helped your journey was a neat way to interact with the online community, avoiding the ghoulish BT’s suddenly made things demanding and filled the air with tension, and the more I played the more I unlocked things that made the journey more palatable as the game progressed.

I’m not gonna say this game’s for everyone though, definitely not, it’s a niche experience that asks for your attention at all times if you wanna follow along with the narrative, AND it’s QUITE long, but it does all culminate into a bonkers climax that attempts to make sense of all the madness and it offered some of the most insane visuals I’ve seen in a game."
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,Kojima fanboys. He could shit on a plate and they'd eat it up and thank him for the opportunity to enjoy his latest masterpiece.
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,"I would say the basic plot makes enough sense: You’re a glorified delivery man tasked with reconnecting a dystopian America using sci-fi internet. A lot of it is just world building, the entity known as the Death Stranding created ghoulish spirits that have taken over most of the land, rain is called “time fall” and exposure to it causes rapid aging on your skin, and the baby you carry sound is called a Breach Baby (BB for short) and it’s meant to help you detect the nearby danger that is the Death Stranding.

The rest really is just crazy sci-fi shit lol I’m not gonna sit here and pretend it all makes sense or that I understand most of how it works, but the motives make enough sense to follow along imo. Just don’t go into it with the mindset that it’s an action game, there *is* more to the gameplay than some people would have you believe but it’s definitely just vibing with Norm to some nice music a lot of the time lol"
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,I wouldn't bother with it honestly. He said with Death Stranding 2 he wants to blend the medium of video games and film farther than it's ever been taken or something along those lines. So expect 80% of the game to be nonsensical cinematics

It just shows how little empathy people have these days - that they just make fun of anyone who tries to take anything seriously. Yeah, Quiet isn't a perfect character, and her design is definitely some over the top T&A, but it's clear that Kojima had hopes that, over the course of the game, players would be able to eventually look past that and see the character underneath. But due to a language barrier in some random tweet he didn't convey that very well, and now she's just thought of as a joke and an excuse him to be horny."

1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,Definitely mocap but animators often have to go back in and tweak/touch up afterwards
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,Mocap only results in a raw data stream made out of dots. In order to use it a good animator still has to translate and work on it to make it look good. But it simply means you don’t have to do every single frame by hand moving body parts around.
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,Don't think the best moves were mocap. This was Vamp/Raiden/Grey Fox type stuff.

Death Stranding isn't for everyone, but real art never is.

Plus a lot of it is so poorly written and titled. 

“Beach thing”? 

“Death Stranding”? 

“Death Stranding 2: On the Beach”? 

“Die Hardman”? 

“Hot Coldman”? 

Even the ever-popular “Metal Gear Solid” is really poorly named if you think about it. It sounds like a bad translation

Shit sounds like a 5 year old trying to come up with names for his imaginary video game, only it’s a 60 year old inverse-weeb who’s so full of himself you’d think he had a shrine to himself in his home. 

He’s not a good author, he’s just weird."

1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,I actually saw that and am not interested at all. I was a pretty big fan of metal gear and it's too bad that's a dead series now. Even mgsV's story was tough to get into. But that's just my opinion.
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,"Nah, we all know everyone circle jerking kojima right now is like Jeff at TGA when kojima shows up on stage.

It legit personifies every American white boy weeb that creams their pants when they hear his name

Dude isn't a genius. He writes great stories and makes cool games. Hardly a genius.


This elevating him above others because of some games is sad and pathetic.

Besides, DS was a purely fan funded circle jerk. So is ds2 lols"
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,"No but you're such a circle jerker for kojima.

Let me guess, Caucasian, American millennial male? 😂"
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,its a fresh gameplay loop in an age where every game is a creatively bankrupt checklist of other successful games. i would rather play DS than basically any other AAA game.
1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,"Agreed. It's a straight circle jerk.

Ask anybody what they liked about DS and they can't tell you anything. Just statements.

They'll say shit like 'combat' when thay accounts for lkke a total of maybe 2 hrs of a 30 hr game lols

It's a fan funded circle jerk. It's why he's going back to espionage. Games for ppl that don't circle jerk his name like he's some God

It's sad AF. The kojima cult is real and it's grown ass men too lols"

1agmp6g,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,"That isn't what he said at all though, and is just the same shitty reading of how and why the character was designed the way she was that everyone who parrots that quote has. Again, there is some shameless T&A, no denying that, but for one that isn't necessarily a bad thing - there's nothing wrong with some sexuality in your media unless you're a total prude. And for another, the quote says more to me that Kojima had the faith in humanity that people would look beyond their (IMO deliberately engineered) first impressions of the character, even look beyond the in-universe explanation for her design and see the symbolism in a character that is simultaneous vulnerable and exposed yet stoic and hardened - but of course it didn't work out that way because by and large people are quick to judge, slow to change first impressions, and love to make fun of anyone who's trying to make a statement."

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Always my biggest concern with this game the unfortunate side of it all is if it does turn out to be a boring walking simulator the Kojima hardcore fans will still class it a masterpiece.

>its a walking simulator 

And Mario is a jumping  simulator. Journey is a walking simulator. 

>he just wants to make movies

And /r/ gaming wants to circle jerk 90% of the bioware/ naughty dog titles that do little more than translate the weakest aspects of Indiana Jones/Star Trek/28 Days Later giving a reach around To I am Legend and getting worshipped as the second coming of christ for video game narratives. The only thing you can say isn't unique about DS so far is ""...well, its a  hideo kojima game""

>yeah, well the reviewers aren't sure they had ""fun""

It is literally the difference between walking out of a fucking marvel movie vs no country for old men  or The Nun vs The Lighthouse. If any of you bother to actually read the reviews, while there are a few that ride on this ""I'm not sure how I really felt about it"" line there are tons that talk about this game being a literal slow burn experience that ultimately pays off. If your ADHD can't fucking handle it, fine. It's not the game for you. But let's stop pretending a game with as much back and forth ""10/10 vs 3/10"" and at a comfortable 85 is a bad sign or that the game is somehow tanking. 


Its showing this is going to have to take some investment from the player beyond instant gratification and isn't tying to be Call of Duty 16. Yet here a game tries something, anything that isn't the same yearly grind and the only critical attack I see ""I'm not sure its fun"".

 God damn."

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I just wanna say this game is totally going to be an art game. Yes with walking but you walk in nearly every game so I dont see the deal breaker here. The best and most memorable games I've played were out-there games with a message. Stanley's Parable comes to mind. That game did nothing but walking and we dont discredit it with the term ""walking simulator"". I've watched the reviews too and the game reviewers seem to be holding back one MAJOR DETAIL. They were not allowed to talk about the events after chapter 3, and the story wasn't spoiled. I'm strapping in. Kojima has always brought me to places I never imagined before in his games. I'm sure that walking from point a to point b over and over has something to say about the narrative. And the focus on the characters and the story is what I'm looking for. I'm sure most of the people complaining about the game didn't appreciate the metal gear games either. The cutscenes are too long they cry! I'm here for the cutscenes just like many other players will be. MGSIV was the best game completing a story I've ever seen. Yes it was long but we the fans wanted it that way, we needed closure for Snake and Raiden. I'm confident the story in Death Stranding will have as much careful attention to the characters."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"A lot of the people in this thread seem upset that it's gonna be more of a walking simulator as if that's a bad thing.

I love those types of games so seeing one of this caliber is super exciting."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"To be fair a walking simulator can be fun if it's really what you want at the time and it's done perfectly, e.g. I loved ""What Remains of Edith Finch"", but I don't think it's worth the price of a more complex game."

A game that's not about action in any way, and actually makes the player character mostly powerless is bound to be a turn off for the majority of gamers. There's virtually no killing, even most the enemies don't actually want to kill you, combat just takes up time and risks your equipment's durability so it's better to avoid fighting.

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"From what I've read, this sounds like what would happen if Lars von Trier made a video game. There was a great review by a film critic about Death Stranding and it made the whole experience seem, 1) very Kojima, and 2) very unconventional. Lots of ""put down your controller and watch"" moments.

I feel pretty conflicted on how much of a game this will actually be, but either way it'll be interesting. Kojima likes movies, he's always wanted to make movies, and he's always wanted to bridge the gap between movies and games. It's probably going to be a pretty uncomfortable experience if you're expecting something that will feed your pleasure sensors with colorful lights and loot rewards. I think that's where a lot of the hate is coming from - the role of pleasure/fun in an interactive ""game""."

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I'm pretty sure this is just Little Nightmares and Inside Out all over again, except that the majority of people don't resonate with the experience Death Stranding is offering instead of nearly *everyone* resonating with it.

Also much more expansive and gameplay intensive but you know. Splitting hairs."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I've yet to figure out what this game is about
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I just started playing No Man's Sky and I have to say that I'm very impressed by how robust all the systems and mechanics in that game are now, after a LOT of content patches and improvements. If Death Stranding's walking simulator components equal a new genre or gaming paradigm according to Kojima, I think No Man's Sky has already achieved that apex and its actually fun and engaging to discover new planets and set up bases, and they're continually adding to the game. I might try this out on PC once it comes around, but it really depends if the gameplay is engaging enough for me to want to trek through the dystopia in Death Stranding."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Haven’t played the game so can’t say if it’s for me. Big Kojima fan though. I have a kid now and a full-time job, so I only have energy for max 2 hours in the evening before I go to bed. And I heard this game hits the 80 hour mark with (obviously) Kojima-length cutscenes. I just don’t know if I have it in me. Maybe I should get Luigi’s Mansion 3 instead. I dunno."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,amazing.

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Is that Gilly from Game of Thrones?
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"What is this, Randall from Clerks 2?"
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I feel like RDR 2 has prepared me for lots of traveling.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Where is this from?
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Kojima is a God-level troll
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Lmao he looks so happy in this picture. Kojima my hero!
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,People really didn't realize that this game is about making players rebuild the world after the stranding incident
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Lol what video is this from?
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Can anybody tell me what kind of chairs are in that office? I want to get one
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,The trailer for this game looks incredibly interesting... Worth picking up or nah?
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Not even square backpack delivery service farmers with electric hoes or canned fetus wearing strangers or norman reedus look like fellows?The trailer was a lie

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Was death stranding good? I never hear anyone talk about it.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Death stranding is the best walking simulator ever!!!
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Death Stranding helping me get to my daily 10000 step goal.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I still can’t work out what the game is about! Maybe I’m just too old.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"what did you say?

&#x200B;

are you talkin to me?"
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I cant wait to fucking walk
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Can't wait for it :)
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"From reading around the internets and a good number of comments here, I can safely say that a) I'm not going to play this game and b) I still love that it exists.

It doesn't sound like something I would like but it does sound interesting and it will appeal to a number of people.

Basically all I'm saying is that I'm glad we are getting a high profile release isn't made ""for a wider audience"" and is confident in occupying its own niche, even if it's not for me."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Since when was Kojima a cinnamon roll?
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,How cute.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Is that Gilly
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Well so was journey and people ate that up
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Because I can walk

(they can walk!)"
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"After watching the SkillUp review, I have roughly established its a single player / community collaboration courier delivery game with ghosts.

I need to play it and I don't know why."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Been years since I played any MSG but I somehow remember so incredibly good how odd it was that you pause the game against that ""sniper boss"" and if you come back a few days later he is dead. Heart attack or so? 

&#x200B;

We found it out by accident and that was so.. strange."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Hey, how about what the fuck is that girl wearing?"
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Death is pretty cute
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I was told the same thing in P.T.   
....F*CKIN LIES"
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,If you've played the game how do you feel about the ign review
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"We wanted innovation, and this is it. It could be amazing or horrible, but lets wait for the full launch."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"First reviews I read say it’s really good. Probably not a game for everyone, seems rather extreme in its world building and story telling. I think I‘m gonna give it a shot."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Sometimes I’m okay with Walking Simulators.  Pretty much only if it is an amazing story.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Regardless of the situation, I’m putting Death Stranding on my game wishlist if ever I get a PS4. Aside from “Tekken” and “Ratchet and Clank”, this game tempts me to wish to have the console ever since I watched the first trailer."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I dont really care that it will be a ""walking simulator"".... When I get home tired and dont want some action packed game I can boot it up on the easy mode and enjoy the story. Im not SUPER HYPED about the game but I think it would be interesting. Dont see all the hate when nobody has even gotten a full release yet"
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I want to be excited for this. I love kojima and I think the man can tell some killer stories. I fear that I and many other people just wont be engaged enough with this game. Not saying it shouldn't be made, just that it appeals to a niche crowd"
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"It’s hilarious how divisive it is. I listen to 4 gaming podcasts and 2 said it was total trash with a few positives but still a contender for worst game of the year, and the other 2 are praising it as a must-play masterpiece with *some* reservations."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"That's what his head, in the paper bag, in P.T. said.

*""I walked.  I could do nothing but walk.""*"
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I love that what began as some jerk thinking he knows why a game that releases in three days is going to be shitty quickly turned into a Kojima lovefest among people who spent time actually _exploring_ his games instead of making themselves sandwiches.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,big if true
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,His face becomes so evil with this quote!
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Gilly scrubs up well!
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Is it out?
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Kojima is gaming legacy's troll. Don't forget Metal Gear Solid 2 was another Solid Snake adventure, MGSV was a helicopter game and now Death Stranding is a walking game. I'll be*lie*ve it when I've beaten the game watched the credits and seen every last ounce of post game story content.

I need scissors! 61!"
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Who Is sHe?!!!
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I still want to know if I can eat the baby.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Esther in a nutshell.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Well, i have 800 hours in No Man's Sky....most of which are just wandering around doing nothing other than taking screenshot of some alien vistas....I think i'm ready for this game."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Just got done with your job at USPS? Was it not exciting enough for you? Good news then! Now you can come home and do the same fucking thing but with blow up ghosts and also a baby that you keep in a jar
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"From what i heard, the game gets better after chapter3(there's 14) but it's still a 10 hours play through to get to the ""fun part"" I'm still undecided about thisnl game. I need to see more gameplay about combat against Mules and Higgs to see if it's worth going through 10 hours of walking. [Playstation Access showed a little about combat against Mules and it was nice]"
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Wish this game would run on my laptop lmao
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,His face looks like he's trolling.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,OverEncumber the game
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Is it a good game tho?
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I am kind of interested in Death Stranding, but I wonder how fast it will get stale. At least the story should be interesting, Kojima knows how to tell a great story."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Hahahaha! Damn, this is cold."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Source please? Maybe?
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"Kojima on Death Stranding ""He just walks""."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-07,Who is the girl?
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Some of my favorite parts of games are where you just walk, and enjoy the view. Seems like this will be great game for me!"
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,My take is that this game is just the best way Kojima found to troll his fan base and the gaming community in general. It is just him taking a huge dump on millions of people.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Reddit: *praises RDR2, am game where you literally can't take two steps without needing to wipe your horse's ass or having to watch a 35 minute animation of Arthur skinning the 47th deer he hunted that day*

Also reddit: ""Death Stranding is gonna be boring slog because it appears to be slow paced and even tedious at times!!!"""
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I kind of wanted this to fail, fans like it, which is cool, but maybe half of that is not wanting to admit that they waited breathlessly for years only to get this.  


Reason I wanted it to fail was so that Kojima could humble himself for once, realise that you can't sell a video game on hype and 'celebrity developer's name' alone."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Kojima is the Kanye West of video games. He’s not gonna make games for the public that they necessarily want. But he’ll make a game that will get people talking and change the status quo going forward.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Eh, it's Kojima.
It's going to look beautiful. There will be hilarious shit to do that makes the game fun, be it core gameplay or stuff you just find. There's gonna be a semi nude chick at some point. And the story is gonna be an entertaining clusterfuck. Imma get it and play it, because one way or the other is going to be interesting. Battle of Duty: Vehicular Warfare is still gonna be out there if I just wanna shoot stuff."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I'm sorry but this game looks horrible.  Like I get that there is a cult like appreciation of Konjima...  but come on this is barely a video game.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"From the reviews this sounds interesting but not something that appeals to most gamers. I think it will find it’s life when it’s cheap or free on game pass or something and people give it a shot.

Kojima should have done something safe for the first game then whatever after."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Delivery guy simulator
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Didn't a lot of people love ""Getting Over it With Bennett Foddy""? This seems to be a similar style of gameplay, paired with really nice art, and in depth storytelling and characters. I could be talking out of my ass though"
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I think what really draws me into wanting to play this is the game's simple take on things. I'm not by any means calling a Kojima game easy to understand but just the fact that it's a game about normal people leading as close to normal lives as possible doing mundane things like package deliveries with the threat of a possible world ending apocalypse looming over them. Idk what it is about that that gets me jittery to try it out for myself
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Hideo Kojima seems like such a wholesome guy, idk why. I'd love to hang out with him lol"
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"One long, tedious, womb escort mission."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Looking forward to this one. May use this as an excuse to finally grab a PS4 and be able to also play Uncharted, Bloodborne, RDR2, and other PS4 optimized titles/exclusives as a nice side effect. I’m all about visual novels and story heavy games, so this looks to be right up my alley."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"At first I thought this was a joke, then I looked into the game."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"uh oh looks like the Tencent shills are shitting on another non-chinese-approved product. watch where you get your ""cutting edge game critique"" from"
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Shadow of Colossus basically was a walking simulator where combat was sparse and it had an overly artistic premise. It was fantastic game. I don't see how it is fair to equate the words ""walking simulator"" with a negative context."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,This game was overhyped and turned to be trash
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I think they could have picked an actor who actually has charisma to be the focal point of the game.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I mean.. he left Konami and was banking on this game so hard... The ambiance and staging of the game is great... But this game is so fn boring. Such a let down.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"""...and stumble a lot...."" or so i saw...."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I appreciate we can get so much variety of gamestyles and gameplays these days.  And this sure looks boring but I figure it will appeal to some if not a lot and that is all that matters. Assuming of course they sell enough.  Some people may find it relaxing.  I could be one of them for all I know.  Point is that it's good that people can find something they are interested in.  Like McKamey Manor they are trying to always shut down.  Some people eat it up and they love it.  No one seems to be really getting hurt.  So why not let them?  If I had an itch for something like that I would appreciate the fact that it existed.  I can think of a lot of things I wish existed that could be considered odd.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I'm fine with that
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,whatever
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,WTF does stranding mean anyway??
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Buying it because it's a Kojima production, staying for the single player story experience.

Gameplay be damned this is gonna be trippy as fuck and I love a good narrative.

Now whether or not you like Kojima's psychedelic horror show writing is entirely up to you. But that shit is my jam."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Yes, and you must keep walking if you don't want to be dragged into the underworld by.... ""things"".

Yeah, I don't know either."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,wtf is she wearing?
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Yea I'm definitely holding off buying this game out the gate, but I'm interested in hearing how it plays out. In the meantime, I still have a shit load of Outer World's to play."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,The more I read into this game the more random it gets and I’m here wondering wtf people see in this.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Games need gameplay, good atmosphere is just not enough."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I’m pissed. This was gonna be my B-day present from my fiancé and now I’ve gotta come up with another one.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Why would I want to play as Daryl Dixon in a non walking dead game. Just seems weird.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Death stranding does not look fun
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Idk why everyone is bashing death stranding, the game hasn't even come out yet and kojima has one of the most solid track records in industry. Even if it doesnt turn out to be the masterpiece we all wanted, shouldn't we at least wait till the game comes out to determine that?"
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,How'd everyone on /r/gaming get the game before it's out? You think everyones played it with this thread lmao
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,How far are we from pressing X once and having the game play itself for the next 8-12 hours?
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Sorry Koji. I am going to wait for sale.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,u/OscarWinnerSeanPenn
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,But damn did he make walking good
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Death stranding is really not for a lot of people. It's basically like watching a movie , but where 70% of the gaming fans enjoy Avengers style of movies , complete action , amazing suspenseful storylines and lore, death stranding goes for something slow 

It's hand made and to be dazzled with scenery at the start , and the game will get better as far as you go along

It's about rebuilding in every sense be it characters or America itself

Also Kojima wants to specify to make a good worlds you do good and return good , which definitely didn't happen with him and Konami. Kojima kind of made a game for himself"
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Walking you say......
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Should stopped after MGS4. Which I really do think was his last ""I give a fuck"" game. That game is a masterpiece. How the fuck we got every remaster in the fucking world from gen 7 but not MGS4 is still shocking to me. That game just graves a 4K remaster."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,better than anything konami is currently doing
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Wait, i thought everyone liked Skyrim?"
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I am a simple person so i am going to ask a very simple question

is the game good?"
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Honestly I was very excited about this game at first when we knew fuck all about it, but the more I see the less excited I get and that sucks. Honestly probably won’t be buying it until the price drops, when at first I planned on preordering. Come on delivering packages? Limited combat? Who wants to do that. If I wanted to deliver packages and have limited combat I’d go work for Canada post. I say limited because some of those poor bastards do get into combat situations, but I digress. 

Hideo Kojima; post apocalyptic Purolator simulator."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Even though it's a dogshit game, there are still fanboys who just won't admit that it's dogshit. How predictable..."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Guys watch the documentary this was screenshotted from on BBC Iplayer, it’s called Newsbeat Documentaries: Death Stranding. It’s 26 minutes long, spoiler free and you get the why’s and the how’s answered by Kojima himself. It’s very informative!

Edit: Kojima said on purpose he wanted the game to be one that focuses on isolation and journeying solo across the America due to Trump Building a wall, Brexit and all the horrible violence you can see online."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I'm only buying it because of DARYL
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Because people dont understand the message of the game. Remember the topic. What you are trying to achieve.
What he wants you to see and feel is the isolation and loneliness from the disconnection of humanity through technology. A thing that could possibly happen in our future.
Everyone is looking at games and immediately wants to shoot and kill, action here, explosion there. This isn't call of duty or metal gear. People have become so apathetic and lost the ability to comprehend something that doesn't jump right in their face."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Factually actually correct
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I loved MGS 3, but I couldn't finish 4 and didn't even play 5 because of how up his own ass Kojima has become. The cutscenes in 4 were *insane* and, at least in my own opinion, it's not anywhere near as profound and interesting as Kojima thinks it is. He says he wants to make movies eventually. That's probably the best move."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,[deleted]
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"It worked for DayZ back on the day. I don't see why it can't here.

I'm willing to give it a shot... Once it's on PC"
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I cancelled my pre-order on Sunday. I just haven’t heard anything positive in the reviews.  I really wanted to be excited for this.  :/
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,This game looks really dumb.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I am so hyped for the PC release!!!
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Yeah like how the Rick and Morty decided to eat up the tube baby 🙄
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Itt: r/gaming reaches peak circlejerk
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"This is exactly how Shadow Of The Colossus was and everyone loves that game. This is the same, with waaaaay more gameplay elements."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,God that dress she has is so fucked.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,So now everyone hates the game? Okay
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,The GameStop review convinced me. I like the mechanic where other players can leave useful tools to help you along. It gives me a warm Dark Souls feeling
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"People seem ready to call the game bad when they haven't even played it. It could be crap, but apparently there is a lot of fun to be had in the gameplay and story. I'll play it before passing judgement."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Kojima has NEVER made a good game, I have no faith in him. Every game Kojima has ever worked on has been TRASHHHH and this one will be no different.                                                       /s"
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,So many morons in one thread. I’m still excited for the game. I never pay attention to any reviews.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I think the game will disappoint many who is hyped for it. From what I've seen so far, it doesn't look good...at all. Seems like a very boring game."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,This game looks terrible. Hiking simulator ummm no thanks.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"This game sounds like Euro Truck Simulator + Mud Runner + Dark Souls, which actually sounds fun to me. I wasn't even really interested in the game until I heard about the ""walking simulator"" comparisons."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Seems like it’s going to be a divisive game, but from what I’ve seen it’ll drive some innovation in terms of how we interact with the environment in future games. 

Right now most games like this you just walk to where you want to be, and maybe you’ll jump or fly occasionally. This game looks like you are constantly thinking about your route and how to best reach your destination. Hopefully future games will make the journey to where you’re heading more interactive so we have less of this feeling of emptiness in between places of interest."

I ended up getting Resident Evil 7, and that acted as great intro for newcomers to RE and survival horror. It's a shame Silent Hill couldn't do the same thing."

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"> Sounds... exciting. So stoked to walk and trip sometimes.

That reviewer was trying really hard to ""sell"" the game.  Yeah, so once you get past the intense boredom of the FIRST TEN FUCKING HOURS OF THE GAME it actually becomes interesting because you have to walk places, and the game is apparently easier because other people are using resources that appear in your worlds.  And don't trip over rocks.  Fun!"
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Actually seems mostly positive. Most reviews I've read are giving high praise, so maybe people should actually try it before complaining."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"> Sounds... exciting. So stoked to walk and trip sometimes.   


Listen man... I'm actually super into it and I'm not sure if you're serious but... I actually look forward to that part of the game maybe the most.     


I don't think I'm even that strange, I bet a lot of people will like that part."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"You joke but that is actually what makes me the most excited. I've always enjoyed the exploration and walking simulator games and this is one of the first on the AAA game scale, I can't wait."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Hmm this review is like the opposite of some of the other postive reviews I've read yet is still pretty positive. Makes me think different people will take away very different things from this game.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"He adds the ""but actually it's kind of fun"" and then describes the least fun thing possible."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I'm actually a fan of walking simulators, but most are full of interesting sights, narrative,  notes, and things to interact with virtually every minute. I heard one reviewer mention spending a few hours just to make an area safer to explore in the future on this game, like err, okay, fun? I honestly haven't understood any of the reviews I read due to them being purposely vague about story and events that occur, and talk of the gameplay seemed non existent or just was going over my head.  The only thing that stood out to me was a mention of epic boss fights,  and even then I havent seen enough gameplay to grasp what combat is like and what would make for an epic boss fight. 

I would've rented this game but it sounds *painfully* long for the average gamer that only spends an hour or so a night playing. Hoping it hits the bargain bins soon..."

The nail in the coffin was when I found out that you have to manually balance yourself while jogging up hills or else you'll topple over because of all the shit you're carrying on your back.

I don't know what world that's considered a good time in, but it sure as hell isn't mine.

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I don’t know anything about it other than it’s been in development for years and you play as the walking dead guy who carries baby around in a bag. I don’t know if I should be hyped or not but it’s a Kojima game so it probably isn’t terrible.

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"In a way, RDR2 did this as well. The minutia of travel; picking every item up with a very slow animation; having to sleep, bathe, shave, and go all the way back to the camp to do anything; all of these things felt like Rockstar was commenting on the state of video games and how EVERYTHING is done for you. I welcome more of this and how you are describing Death Stranding.

EDIT: It was also so amazing how ALIVE the camp felt. The people there were telling stories, playing guitars, and really living their lives. Not sure how many other games have had entire sets of characters that feel so alive."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Yea. Same. Throw on some headphones, listen to that killer soundtrack and just get immersed in the world."

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"If I’m going to spend $60+ on a brand new game, I need to *know* what it’s like. The IGN review and the overall reception from people is pretty clear, it mostly being walking until you get somewhere then walk some more. This is what had me put down games like RDR2 and Skyrim, if I’m being honest. I’m just not a fan of this type of gameplay, and I can see why others aren’t."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"This. I might not enjoy RTS games, but i sure as shit won't criticise them or their fanbase. Not everybody likes walking simulators, but we have to respect Kojima's decision to push boundaries. It may not be for everyone, and that's okay."

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I feel like it's going to be a very uncompromised vision. Like it's definitely not going to appeal to everyone, but the people who are into it are gonna find it revolutionary. 

I'm seeing all this shit about it being a ""walking simulator"" which is pretty callous and dismissive, not only of death stranding but of actual first person narrative games, which death stranding definitely isn't."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I'm not saying Metacritic is the end all be all, but out of 75 reviews they have aggregated only one is negative. Things are looking fairly good for the game."

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Almost any game can be summed up in a ridiculously reductive way. Half the bloody industry could be summed up as “you just run around and shoot stuff,” which sounds insanely boring but the reality is there’s lots of games that can be boiled down like that but are insatiably fun."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Fuck the community, it's always been cancer. Do yourself a favour and play whatever the hell you want."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I honestly love how uncompromising Kojima is with this game. He's taking the biggest risk making a game about traversal and connecting people and rebuilding the world together... rather than just doing what's expected of him and making another game about killing people.

He's made the game that HE wanted to make, during a time of his life where he felt the most alone. And he did it in the hopes of bringing people together, and to feel a little bit more connected with eachother. You can tell just from the way he talks about the game that he's poured his heart and soul into it.

It's pretty disappointing, and rather upsetting seeing all these people wanting to tear it apart before they've even played it."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"There is, occasionally. You get to fling your turds at ghost whales, punch some dudes and later in the game they actually give you some guns... But it's mostly walking."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I love the “fun?” stuff as a knock against DS.  Take the soulsborne series for example, I love those games they are great but goddamn there is an overriding theme from the art/world design to the gameplay is self that is based entirely on being oppressive and doing everything it can to make shit harder for you...they are not designed to be fun, they are designed to try to beat you down and the reward isn’t fun, its conquering the challenges it sets before you....I don’t really know how much “fun” I’ve had playing any of them but I have sunk probably 60-80 hours into every one.....also in general the world/enemy designs just creep me the fuck out and I am not a horror guy so I don’t find being creeped out fun.  When I am playing those I am constantly on edge as I am exploring or just straight up frustrated when I’m stuck on a shitty boss(Fuck you to Hell Capra Demon!!!).   I don’t think I would ever describe those games as fun to anyone yet I have probably  spent a couple weeks of my life playing them.

So yeah I don’t really care if DS is “fun”...Im going to get it to support something that is at least trying to do something different/new/unique with the medium outside of the repeated yearly franchises and live services bull shit and if I don’t end up liking it that’s fine.  I at least want to try and experience it to decide for myself."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,That's honestly what happened with me. That video of gameplay that came out a couple of months ago was the nail in the coffin. I was so fucking bored watching that I cancelled my CE. I consider myself a big Kojima fan but this doesn't look like anything I would want to play.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand death stranding."

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I personally think its more about proper pre mission planning as in how to set yourself up to make the journey as safe, or quick as possible.

Gave up for a few weeks, tried to get over the shitty horse riding mechanics and appreciate the scenery.

Norman Reedus is a terrible actor who is only popular because his CHARACTER in the walking dead was popular and well-liked. His character has no emotional range, and very little dialogue. His whole character boils down to ""is badass"" ""keeps his mouth shut"" and ""always does the right thing"". In a show where nearly all the characters won't shut the fuck up, and constantly make a mess of everything, those qualities made him stand out."

The industry needs more new ideas to make it to AAA levels. The mix of indie creativity and AAA level talent and resources reminds me of the older days of game development, and I would love for somebody to take on Silent Hills in the same fashion.

Still.. it hurts that a studio can lay claim to an IP that they aren't even going to use... Just in case they might monetize it later. It's their right though, and if they want to squander their own profits, we can just turn to the next fad and watch them sweep up the ashes."

But then, they wonder to themselves what the fuck they think of it, too."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Reviews I’ve read have liked a lot of the game for what it is, but disliked other parts.

For instance I want to condense one review I read (obviously spoilers):

Much of the game is a very, very detailed delivery simulator, and it’s good at that. Stock up too much on your pack while climbing a mountain? Gust of wind catches your pack, you fall down. Never fear if you’re down a ladder, perhaps a friendly neighbor has one!

You also never kill people, it’s unheard of because when people die, their spirits remain and become more dangerous than the person could’ve been. So you have to find ways around that - you sneak, or disable people. Until, eventually, you get like a slug machine gun/shotgun that does so with excessive force.

But then, all of it’s different in the ending sequence. The ending is apparently sort of a boss rush, and if you weren’t prepping for it you’ll be stressed for resources.

Review summary done, my own words now, all of this *could* just be a bigger Kojima allegory that we’re not big-brain enough to understand. Really though I’m still gonna play it when I get the chance. Has a lot of good actors and the story is still intriguing. The existence of this game, regardless of how good it fundamentally is, tells me that games as an art form aren’t dead, and that’s a nice thought."

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I’m not trying to convince you, but as someone who is very into this kind of concept, I’ll try and explain the appeal.

For me, video games are at their most fun when they put you into a mindset with a feeling intended by their creator. I care way less about mechanics, any technical stuff, or “satisfying” gameplay. I’m not looking for a sense of achievement or even to win. I’m looking to be emotionally manipulated like I am with movies and TV shows.

The way you’ve described traversing hills makes it sound frustrating and cumbersome, but that is from the point of view of a person playing a game. I play games as if I’m the character in the game, not someone playing them. Im not just trying to get through it. If I put myself in the character’s shoes, then I’m super determined to get up that hill (assuming the story has given me motivation) and all the fumbling and struggle is part of the journey. Once I get to the top, the feeling of relief is incredible. That makes it all worth it.

I’m the type of person that never fast travels in any game. I walk when I enter buildings and even take off hats or shoes. For me, it is all about immersion to the point where controls and mechanics don’t even really matter. A walking sim set in a well thought out world (even one that is just empty landscapes) and an engrossing story could be amazing to me.

I guess the tldr version is that if the game has intended for me to feel exasperated and dread hills then that is how i want to feel when playing it. Forcing me to manually balance myself helps me achieve that and that is what i find enjoyable."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,You haven't played QWOP? Absolute classic.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"The legacy of this game is rather unfortunate in retrospect. I haven't played it yet, but the reviews seem to be scattered across the board. Overall though it seems to have let down most, marketing itself as being super deep and mysterious and then just ending up being the complete opposite (Jeff Gerstmann's rant is hilarious).

I'll still give it a try though as I'm curious. There's still value in a game that's experimental, even if to deconstruct it and see what went wrong. In that odd way it has a new appeal, and if I end up liking it, awesome."

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I'm pretty sure Kojima knew that wouldn't necessarily be fun, but he still made that design decision because of the artistic message the game as a whole is trying to get across.

The game will be divisive because it's more than just a game, but a message about society and people in real life."

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,It's interesting because I loved some of the realism and found other aspects of it tedious. Some of the biggest criticisms of the game is that the dedication to realism sometimes made the game feel less intuitive and more sluggish. Like when I first looted a dead body the animation blew me away. By the 100th time I looted a body I was beyond tired of the feature.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"yea but in red dead u get to play as arthur fuckin morgan, and we as the player get to make our own version of him with how he looks and what he does in game, and make choices as him

that was a large part of what made that game so special, regarding the minutia, for me anyway"
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I'm glad to read that the game has animations for everything. I've always craved a game like that. Pick up a weapon? It shouldn't just disappear from the ground then magically appear in your hands/inventory. 

While I want an animation for *every* option you have in-game, they should also include a setting for those impatient gamers that turns them off/speeds them up significantly. Maybe include acheivements for playing the full game with default animations on so people are more inclined to give the devs extra work the time of day, but still allow people to enjoy the game without being bogged down by ""too much realism""

I can't wait to play rdr2 (in like....idk 4 months? Lol)"
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,i think its gonna be perfect for podcasts
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I’ve not been interested in the game at all since it was announced, and I’m still completely indifferent. All of these comments from both sides are so interesting to read as someone with no stake either way.

That being said, I find the comments claiming that Kojima is trying to reinvent open world games, or trying to revolutionize the industry, to be much more cringeworthy than those just being pessimistic.

It’s one thing to be excited about a game, but to go so far to claim that it’s going to shake up the industry is just a setup for disappointment."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"This is how I exactly feel, down to the part of me not enjoying RTS games lol."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"It seems like the 10/10s are *""This is art! The gameplay might be a bit repetitive and boring""* and the 3/10s are *""This might be art, but it's not fun""*.

From what I've seen and from what I've heard about it, your enjoyment/opinion of the game will stem from where you fall on the scale between ""Games are Art"" and ""Games are Entertainment""."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Then you read what the reviewers have to say and very few actually sound positive IMO
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,This. I don't even like to go threads about games anymore.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,*strokes neckbeard
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I don’t understand this, but to each their own. I hope you enjoy the game."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"MGS was fun to play though, this doesn't look anywhere close."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"That's why I said ""sounds"". I didnt say it ""is"". Different words mean different things."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"This is my worry for this. I like MGS games, but I get concerned at the idea of an artist given full reign on a project like this, as it's hard to predict how it will turn out. Often people in his position *need* someone to tell them no, as while they may have this wondrous idea to make a reference to something in life in a situation, it might not be a good place for it or even a good idea in general to include if it doesn't fit things at all thematically.  It's like tempering and for some is kind of necessary and might even drive more creativity at times. 

But so many practically worship him it's concerning."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Lmao

Boring setting, boring characters ,painfully slow animations, travel methods, painfully slow everything really. ""Bbbbut immersion"". Auto aim shooting.

Yea ill stick with death stranding thank you very much."

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I added more info on why. It was an insightful documentary, the interviewer talks to all sorts of employees ranging from Yoji Shinkawa to Ludwig Forsen who can speak Japanese."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-10,"Like it or hate it, he’s a brand and I for one am curious enough to buy and play what he’s made. Sure the 60 hour gameplay sounds like a slog but I’m down.

Ps I wonder how much he got from the Monster Energy product placement? I mean, it’s clever considering he’s basically an indie studio now."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I'd say most preorders are risky. Best to just sit and wait until it releases to decide if it's worth it.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I mean, I've watched a lot of gameplay and it does not look fun. Very well made however. Here is a video, idk what you count as a spoiler tho. They do show story just gameplay and discuss the systems and gameplay loops.
https://youtu.be/ltYRUvBiZ0k"
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"The ""positive"" reviews admit the game is a walking simulator with loads of slowly-paced cutscenes. In other words, they say the same thing as the 3/10 reviews, so it's very clear what the game is at this point, and it's pretty obvious that it will be boring as shit to anyone who isn't a Kojima fanboi."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,">Lol there's a tonne of positive reviews, even some absolutely glowing ones.

In form, not substance. 

From a 10/10 review:
>The problem is, in trying to explain why Death Stranding’s gameplay ends up feeling so unique, it might sound like anything but. Fetch quests, exploration, loot hunting, stealth, resource management, escort missions—lots of things we’ve seen and done countless times before.

>it actually gets down to sim levels of complexity just to determine how you will walk around. Every inch of ground has a rating for how easy or hard it is to traverse. Sam can lose his balance if he’s carrying too much or going too fast, and momentum is important when going up or down steep slopes.

another 10/10:

>If you get bored with too many cutscenes, this game is definitely not for you. 

>The story isn't the only thing that will have people divided. The gameplay will be too slow for many

>There's been a lot of talk about the game being a **'walking simulator' and** while **that's not entirely wrong**,

These are the 10/10 reviews, and they basically say the same thing as the 3/10 reviews. The only difference is that the 10/10s are Kojima fanbois and the 3/10s aren't."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Fanboys gotta fanboy. Kojima isn't here to ""did yu rike iiit?"" himself, so they have to defend his honor with their blind fanboyism."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"You roll a 3. You wipe your ass with it, just barely not cutting yourself, but your ass is still covered in shit. You then go to throw the sword off a cliff, but you realise that your still in town and there are no cliffs nearby. Also the police just watched you wipe your ass with a sword in public and want to arrest you."

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"There is, but the inconsistency makes it really hard to get through, in comparison to what Seasons 1-3 gave us.

Edit: It’s like The 70s Show past Season 3. Sure, seasons 4 and 5 are still pretty damn good, and 6 has moments, but it lost some of it’s touch."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Facts. It got SO dark and meta at times I felt like it was peak Harmon.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,It was a show that celebrated outcasts and weirdos and didn't look down on them. Unlike BigBangTheory where the audience is meant to have mostly Penny's POV and the nerds serve as the punchline.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I love Frankie too!  She's got some great moments.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I strongly believe S6 is just as good as S1-3. The finale is perfect and S6 has the best ""stingers"" at the end.  The one with the Japanese kid never fails to make me laugh. S5 is good but not as good.  S4 I don't remember.  Gas leak."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Yes.  That line right there.

So much vitriol attached to a silly one syllable word."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,MGS 4 is the one of the best movies I’ve ever played.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Then you never stopped playing? MGS 5 had barely any cutscenes, and the ones that did show up were skippable.

Edit: I have indeed played through MGS 4, just wanted to say that Kojima cut down the cutscenes by a fuck ton for The Phanton Pain."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,You stopped at 1?
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Do you have a recipe for that cured ham?

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Not every game has to be for everyone. Death Stranding is a game that is most definitely not for everyone, in fact I'd say it is for a minority. That does not make it a bad game, it just makes it a niche game, which is perfectly fine. 

Main issue is the hype surrounding Death Stranding is/was way too much, this outcome was a certainty."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Reddit now is just a bunch of kids trying to get the approval from each other, they have not played the game yet but they like to think they're better than kojima  - he's so pretentious right? and what did he do? games like movies right? that's stupid lol, and metal gear? lol there are a million games like that - is just sad, I used to think there were some value in their opinions but the game hasn't even come out and everyone already have their mind set, that alone should tell you how much do they care about playing and/or games."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"That's art, dude. It's not always going to be the best but it's worth trying, checking out, and critiquing. The issue with AAA titles us that they're not trying new things, they're pumping out the same stale vomit until people stop giving into the hype.

And that's why this game came out swinging. Hype."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Did people really expect the preacher of videogames to deliver an action-packed thriller? His videogames are all about why nuclear weapons, superweapons, and war itself is awful. Like the whole theme of MGSV was how wars are just transactions between nations in blood, and how war plasters over your personality and transforms you into a monster, or a literal Dog of War."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I think people just wanted it to be Kojima Fallout with Norman Reedus.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"two words i'd never have thought to use to describe hideo kojima by the end of his konami tenure: ""restrained"" or ""focused.""

compared to his peers then (or even now) he's always been a ""maverick."""
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Yeah I don’t know, I’ve been excited the whole time and everything I’m hearing about it kind of just confirms what I was expecting. It will not be for everyone. If you saw those trailers and thought it would be praised by everyone across the board, I don’t think we saw the same trailers."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Which is freakin stupid Kojima himself said that there wasn't a good way to describe what the gameplay was. People should have known it was going to be an experimental game like MGS was when he made it.

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Honestly I liked the ending of MGS5

Not the one we got from the game. The unfinished one where it ends with a big boss fight on that island, the ""everything goes blue when injured"" feature plays a role in the story where you just happen to shoot a kid. Then it just goes full circle for the metal gear series."

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Franchises suck. The reason games get stale is because of franchises.

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Which is not a good sign.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"They are probably wanting and trying to enjoy it

Sometimes everyone says a game is so great or it is so hyped that you need to love it. I feel like that applies a lot to Japanese games and RPGs, Fallout or The Witcher just isn't for some people, but you feel like you need to enjoy it because of the hype

You lie to yourself into enjoying it, so eventually you kinda do but you have that feeling of ""Did I actually like this?""

Imo, a game either clicks or doesn't click.

Fallout New Vegas just clicked for me, I felt like I really loved that game and just enjoyed it, but on the other hand, Fallout 3 felt completely unenjoyable."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I was talking to a person who had to review this game. At the start they were intrigued, they liked that it was just this ""walking simulator"" and that it was less conventional and they were generally quite open to the game and thought it had some interesting thematic implications. I saw a bit of their gameplay and I agreed that it looked like something worth looking into. 

I talked to them a week later and... all bad. Apparently the ending is BAD. Not just Kojima ending bad. Bad bad. If I remember correctly its an issue of poor story-telling, tons of exposition and very bad and predictable twists. That person didn't *hate* the game but it came across as a very aggravating experience for them. They said that if you were curious about the story then you should just watch all the cutscenes on youtube."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"And on the flipside, there's going to be people who haven't and won't play it, yet will spend every opportunity to try to shit on it and trying to convince people that like the game that they actually don't."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Watch the GameSpot review, they talk a lot about how the gameplay is designed to be uplifting and gratifying"
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I imagine they’re scared of giving this a “real” review due to inevitable backlash.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"How many games have a better story than gameplay? I'd think a lot. I thought the game play on all 3 Mass Effects to be pretty... I mean, ok, nothing great. But the story is why I played it, the story was phenomenal, and the characters is why I'll always remember it as an amazing game, even if it isn't 10/10 fun with the gameplay itself."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Every review I can find basically says this is a great game to watch someone else play on YouTube.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Hey Alan Wake is a good game
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Well it's a Kojima game, so you know it does have them. How realistic they are is debatable."

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,This completely changes the narrative of this thread
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I saw months ago that you can place packages etc in different places for weight distribution which will effect how you manage hills etc. Not as crazy as someone misinformed above, but not a fallout mechanic either. Not defending because I haven't experienced it yet, but people calling it a walking simulator probably didn't pay attention leading up to the release date. It showed a lot of walking lol. Idk why people are acting surprised.

E: misread your comment my bad. So the weight distribution you set up only takes effect if you're overweight? Then why does it let you manage placement of different weighted packages? Is my above comment false ? Correct me if I'm wrong please."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"It’s not the same as balancing per se, but a similar point of contention for me was “eating” in RDR2... like c’mon I really have to feed my character for them to stay “healthy”... just let me enjoy the world for what it is.

Edit: don't get the downvotes here, it's an opinion about a piece of realism in a game that was not enjoyable to me"
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Reminds me of when the Endgame plot leaked and everyone on the spoilers sub was pissed. Then the movie comes out and everyone ended up loving it. It's easier to marginalize things based on a description or general idea.

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Goes without saying but that is important in all artistic mediums. Nothing is more frustrating than when a film has such a unique and compelling concept, yet the direction, writing, production etc. is completely fumbled."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Papers Please worked because it was a small game. You get in, it makes its point, you get out."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Yeah I’d read a synopsis but knowing Kojima that probably won’t clear up anything.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"As a Kojima and Kanye stan, this hurts."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,...I just realized that all the things I do for fun and that I want to do for a career can be summed up this way.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"“Papers, Please” is a game where you check passports and other documents of incoming immigrants to make sure all their papers are in order.


Game is fantastic"
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Lol, I know what you're getting at, but ""games aren't all about fun"" sounds funny. Games aren't all about action may be what you're looking for"
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"At the same time, there's immersion, then a button to breath in/out to keep you alive, in a game where your character should be doing so automatically. 

It goes from immersive to unnecessarily complex. Fun is often had with immersion, but immersion isn't simply a control scheme, it's a combination of story, atmosphere and freedoms within the game, where appropriate. I don't find it immersive to need to hold a button to not trip on my feet while running in a game, even a simulator game. That's just annoying, and a button I'd immediately bind to my sprint key as well, to eliminate poor game-play decisions. 

And I enjoy simulator games, especially mil-sim and ""boring"" ones that can be relaxing."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"> not all games are supposed to be fun.

Just from a pure semantics point of view, it does. That's the definition of a game. I'm all for people enjoying interactive experiences that aren't games, but they're not actually games in that case. The term walking simulator is a little pejorative, but it's the closest thing we have to a good term for it."

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,">I think it's supposed to be more of a pseudo-cerebral journey than a good time.

I can totally get onboard with that when it's performance art, an ambient drone album, an episode of Black Mirror, Requiem for a Dream, ect, but I'm hearing talk of a 50 hour campaign? That's a really really long fucking time to be reflecting on Kojima's poignant social commentary and sharp realism."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"OH, not even close. The Kojimadness will continue to escalate with his next game, bet on it."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Yeah and that's totally cool.  Contrary to what other people on this thread may think, it's not my intention to shit on this game or the people who enjoy the game.  It's just pretty much the polar opposite of what I personally consider to be a fun experience."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"So...you're basing your dislike of the game on an inverse reaction to fanboys/girls' reaction?

Rather than something as silly as, say, playing it?"
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"At the same time, it's perfectly reasonable to be skeptical of something that sounds like a poor idea. 

It's OK to be proven wrong if it turns out to be good. But this sub is praying to holy kojima and saying it's a great idea because he did it, rather than forming their own ideas, which is a lot less OK. 

All I can objectively say, is that we know little about a lot of the game, but what has been shown so far is weird and honestly rather boring, personally. Walking simulators can be alright. Walking simulators with unnecessary mechanics and trying to be edgy aren't likely to be. 

Like why does bodily fluid harm these monsters? Why do I not just sweat a lot, piss on myself or otherwise cover myself in it and simply charge the fuckers, as apparently it kills them. Sanitary or no, it seems like a good idea thus far with the descriptions we have  known to us at this time."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Oh shush.  Go enjoy the game if you like it.  I’m not stopping you.

Uh ohhhhhh the gamers are mad."

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,You're right my bad.  I've seen this exact mechanic in countless other games.  Playing QWOP has always been the standard and I've never realized it until now.

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"> The game will be divisive because it's more than just a game, but a message about society and people in real life.

This could be, but that doesn't mean criticism of it being bad isn't objectively correct if it's a bad game. 

A game with a message, like Spec Ops: The Line, was highly divisive, as it >!gives an illusion of choices to make, and is entirely about having the player feel upset and uncomfortable with what is going on, because it's an anti-war shooter, and tries to show you that you effectively control how much terrible things your character does, by simply how far you go in the game!<. It can be full of itself to an extent with this, but it's an OK game from a game-play aspect, but the art-ness and theme of the game is very strong with a deep meaning and inflection.



But making a bad game for the sake of art is just poor art. That's like an artist claiming a shitty painting of a house is all about ""lost innocence"" or something, when it might just be shitty art they wanted to peddle. 

I will properly judge it when it releases, but thus far for a game it's not looking strong, and for art, with how subjective that is alone, it's not looking bright for reception outside of simply the Kojima name, which is half of all I hear about the game, not any merit of the game itself which is concerning. Art typically stands on itself, and isn't art because of who made it."

So many different types of animals had different skinning animations. Fishing could be done for hours. You could customize and clean guns to your heart's content. You could stick up stores, banks, etc. but it would KILL your notoriety and those people would remember you so I basically only ever did it once. There was truly just too much to do.

Great game."

Final Fantasy 15 is one of those cases. Good story, eye catching visuals and light effects but bad gameplay. Still put in over 120 hours in FF15. I can see myself doing the same with Death Stranding. Putting my mouse sensitivity on low, graphics maxed out, and enjoying the ride. When it comes to PC of course"

This comment just doesn't make any sense. It's well-intentioned, but the artist/developer should absolutely have total control over their project. The majority of consumer problems with games happen at the publisher level. Also, certainly nobody knows what fits a project thematically better that the developer. Your comparison is like telling a painter they shouldn't paint the sky yellow because... what? Others know better? It might not fit into what's been commercially successful?"

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I am not a fanboy for Kojima as I never had a playstation/xbox or played any of his games before this year. This game looks interesting and fun if it had a great story. Seems like a bigger open world with more stuff to do game like until dawn and becoming human. My friend has a playstation 4 and those are the only two console games I played besides super smash whatever the new one is on switch is once earlier this year. I normally only play PC games and I bought a PS4 last black friday on sale for Death Stranding specifically except now it's coming to PC so I am planning on selling the PS4.

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Well of course watching a story can be ""fun"" as well. Going to the movies can be fun. But what I mean by fun here is the concept of creating diversion by challenge. Which isn't always the main way to create diversion in games.   
Horror games are the best example of it. They aren't hard most of the time. They are just walking simulators mostly. They aren't fun cause they're challenging, they're fun because of the athmosphere they create. Just like a movie.   
Some games are basically just interactive movies and there is nothing wrong with that. Of course there is spectrum here as well. Point is you can't judge a game only by how ""fun"" the mechanics are. The connection between gameplay and story and immersion can be just as much a source for entertainment as the diversion gained from the mechanics alone."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,How is it possible to immerse yourself in a world where you have to take gimp-mask vice president seriously?
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"It's immersive if it supports the story yes and in a game where you play as a courier who has to travel through harsh environments to get to its destination and creatively find ways to get over obsactles, a game mechanic that actually underlines that is immersive to me.   
Basically as long as it's hard and underlines the story it is a good mechanic. Breathing could be fun if it fits the story. Like a horror game where you have to breath very quitely by pressing buttons with good timing. How would that not be adrenaline pumping.   
And I think having to use skill not to trip over makes you feel like a real courier and I think in the context of the story and athmosphere that sounds like an exciting role to inhabit in this world."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"> That's the definition of a game

Well, kind of. The fact is that ""computer game"" and ""video game,"" often shortened to ""game,"" have both become terms which encompass *all* forms of interactive, digital media, regardless of whether that media has to do with more traditional elements of non-digital games. 

The majority of video games *are* plainly games, but when the term originated and took hold, it was even more so the case. ""Walking simulators"" (or mass market simulators of any real depth), visual novels, other genres which similarly had a smaller role for gameplay challenges, and even complex storytelling in games were not widespread. 

The medium has grown far beyond its initial boundaries, and the words we use to describe *have* to capture that. The medium outpaced, too, the ability for society to, perhaps, more accurately describe it with a label. It's easier for a word to grow in meaning than for society to change what it labels something so broad as video games."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,">That's the definition of a game.

But it's not. I've never seen any definition that stipulates fun is a requirement. Games are usually defined as a structured activity, often competitive. Though they are often performed for entertainment, it is not strictly a requirement. If you are going to be pedantically semantic, at least be right."

I don't ""hate"" it. I don't care enough about it to hate it. I always thought this game was massively overhyped. I always disliked the cult of personality around Kojima, as I dislike ALL cults of personalities.

I'm actually pretty happy that the game has turned out to have massively overpromised and massively underdelivered, because it confirms my pre-existing beliefs that hype is bullshit that consistently leads to disappointment, and that cults of personality are just begging to ruin creatives and cause them to lose the self-criticism they need, resulting in pretentious, self-indulgent inferior products, which is very much what this looks like it will be.

I'm just sitting back with my popcorn watching the shitshow. I enjoyed No Man's Sky's implosion, too.

It just doesn't sound like a fun game. Kojima kinda forgot that video games are supposed to be about entertainment, not some kind of pretentious ""artistic"" bullshit."

Kojima games are okay at best. They're just full of bullshit that most other games avoid. For some reason people think they're good. He got popular because MGS was an okay game at a time of loads of shit games. His ego is was bigger than his talent. All of the MGS games are boring. The only good thing about MSGV was attacking the bases, and even that got old fast. He writes shitty scripts for games because he wants to LARP at making movies. But, all the dumb fanboys think he's an genius or an auteur or something.

If DS was released with his name hidden and distanced from it, by an unknown studio, it would be fucking panned as a boring, pretentious game.

So no, it's nothing like SotC other than it being a video game.

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I honestly don’t dislike season 4 as much as other community fans appear to and may even like it about as much as season 6. There’s some great episodes in there (I still can’t get the balloon ride song out of my head).
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Here's some fun stuff I did in MGS3 from just fucking around:

-Tranq and capture venomous spiders, scorpions and snakes.  Throw them at enemies to kill them.

-Use C4 to destroy food storage rooms and soon enough the enemy soldiers will be visibly and audibly hungry.  Let your own personal cans of food become spoiled and then throw it at the hungry soldiers.  Watch them eat and and get dry heaves.  Now they're too sick to care about you.

-Throw a grenade into water thats filled with fish and frogs.  The explosion sends them flying into the air and when they land, they turn into cans of food you can pick up. Pretty awesome surprise when I tried it.

Edit: wow this blew up, here's some more I remember

-You knock out the character Ocelot during a cutscene. When it get back to the game, Ocelot is just laying there knocked out like any regular enemy.   If you kill him it's an automatic game over and your told you've created a time  paradox since Ocelot appears in every other MGS game and MGS3 is the first in the timeline. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me-WHitlw8A

-At some point you can dress up like a high ranking Soviet officer that looks like Raiden from MGS2.  From that point you can backtrack across all the areas you've been in and all the enemies will salute you.  You can slap them and they'll cower, salute and thank you iirc

-You can get a uniform that has the US flag on one side and Soviet flag on the other.  The enemies wont attack the side showing the Soviet flag."

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Being able to headshot The End in his wheelchair in MGS3  just after a cut-scene from across the map is hands down one of the most hilarious fucking ways to sidestep a boss fight I have ever seen
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I throughly enjoyed MGS4 because I was so invested in MGS one and snake eater. Sigint being the DARPA chief blew my fucking mind. Eva showing back up was awesome. It’s been some years but I remember eating up all of those cutscenes.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Yeah I played MGS-3 at least once just using the patriot and having Snake Rambo everyone in the balls. 10/10 would recommend. Trying to ricochet with the SAA in 3 was also great.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Right?

MGSV was one of the best sandbox games I’ve ever played."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,There's so much shenanigans to be had in 5. It's like 50% of the greatest game ever made. Shame Kojima wasn't allowed to finish it.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Beat the game with just porn mags in your inventory sans boss fights.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"MGS3 is one of the greatest fuck around games ever. Luring guards into a trap with pornography, beating them unconscious with CQC, and then tossing them into an electric fence will never not be amazing."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,It was but lord was there a lot of cutscenes. 8+ hours of them iirc

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"MGS2 and 3 had some pretty god damn long cut scenes explaining secret societies and shit as well.

Nowhere near the lenght of MGS4, but I could still cook some spaghetti and meatballs and still be on the same cut scene when Otacon was explaining nano machines in MGS2."

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,They did kind of over saturate the gadgets. Dont worry about not knowing wtf is happening. Thats all Kojima games
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Eh I'd say that it wasn't ""advancements in gameplay"" though. More like a total departure from established gameplay. Things like re-using the mother-base system from Peace Walker and having allies like Quiet or D-walker just weren't Metal Gear IMO. It was still a pretty good game, but it never really felt like MGS to me."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"This is the real answer. Why spend money on something New which might flop Hard, when you can just create an established formula game and make money"
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"It came out the month after 9/11, so the story was definitely written before then.

It was released so soon after 9/11, they actually had to make last-minute changes to a few cutscenes in the climax to avoid controversy."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"'Brave New World' was published in 1932. Not saying Kojima didn't come up with it independently, but by the '00s it wasn't a concept; it was the zeitgeist."

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I love games and movies like this. Guess I'll be the person that buys this game because of these memes.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,It ain't Knack 2 that's for sure.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,It makes you feel like Norman Reedus
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Honestly, no. The gameplay seems to be very repetitive, with walking, climbing ladders, and... not much else. I just don’t see how anyone would like that.

>!That said, I give it a 9.5. It has a little something for everybody.!<"
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Looking at most metal gears, but especially peace walker, you can see how the game starts as a reasonable war game and then descends into lunacy as Kojima breaks free from his handlers at Konami and starts adding bipedal robots that walk in 4 legs and act like dogs, the most powerful weapon is a 4-man giant slingshot where one man is the bullet, monster hunter levels, questionable box sessions and whatnot."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Would you elaborate a little more?
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I think it's included with the game.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Wonder what item would grant you Unlimited Ass Ammo.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,It's true. You use weapons made of Norman's waste to fight the supernatural enemies.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,As is tradition
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I always imagine a kojima game being an example of out of the frying pan and into the fire
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"That but with ghosts, babies and lovecraftian horrors. 

All the reviews say it starts incredibly slow and fetch questy and very slowly you get better and better until fetching is a side to interesting characters and boss fights. The slow start is designed to juxtapose how much better/faster things are once connected, and how you progress and improve as you help people and they help you in return (better stats and gear)."

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Me neither... but it shows that your character is super underweight the entire time
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Sure. It's an outgrowth of videogames and the producers might be similar people, but it doesn't attract the same audience. I really don't like walking simulators and I feel it's perfectly valid to shun them as games entirely. If people want to play them, so be it."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Technically, ""video games"" or ""games"" are supposed to entertain people who play it (i mean, they are a media for entertainment)

If ""Death Stranding"" entertain some people, it would still be true to its definition

Of course fun is not necessary but it's a good parameter for judging how entertaining a game is"
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"At the same time, it should be fun, be that enjoying a good story or good gameplay. Bad gameplay will detract from fun and doesn't just make it art automatically. 

As that's kind of a cop out. That's like saying FIFA titles are justified because they're art, not because they're gambling with soccer, or that Brink was art, despite being a total flop of a game."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Stop applying relativism when there’s absolutely no basis for it. Games are absolutely supposed to be fun or at the very least entertaining. If you really want to say games are just “structured activities” then technically writing an essay with a prompt, or doing homework is a game."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Fun is also subjective. Like I don’t think farming simulator and train simulator would be fun but others do. It’s all about the person. Mirrors edge is pretty much a running simulator and I enjoyed that.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,And what part of walking around and tripping is entertaining?
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Do people actually say ""oldfag"" non-ironically?"
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Sounds like you need some goddamn faith.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Same reason I found games like until dawn and Becoming Human fun. The stuff you do changes the outcome of the story
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I wouldn't call an 85 metacritic ""underdelivered"" and basing opinions on critics without playing the game yourself is ridiculous. But also remember games don't always have to be entertainment to an extend that you can define, people find enjoyment from different genres and styles. There will be people who enjoy Death Stranding and people who don't. And that's fine. Video games are art regardless on what you see as ""pretentious"". Just remember that some people didn't enjoy other games that might be deemed as good. It's all about opinion."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,How has it underdelievered? It's not out. Until it hits the shelves it can't be underdelievered. It needs to have not sold well or have bad reviews for it to be underdelievered. Cult doesn't automatically mean something is bad. Something can be cult and have hype and be good. Cult is just something that didn't become mainstream popular. Your also saying that this causes pretentiousness but that also classes you as being pretentious for not even trying it yourself. You think it's a 'shitshow' before it could even be one.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Lol you're inferring that the game is bad, they're not saying it's bad. Very very different.

The original point being that there are a bunch of positive reviews about the game lol. OP said there was a sea of negative reviews, which is blatantly bullshit.

Are you mentally deficient or just stoned?"
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Just because you didn't like a game series doesn't mean it's bad.

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,and had absolutely superb mechanics too. it was the best gameplay version of mgs ever. it really should've been the start of a new mgs era. i cant believe konami did that. they had a money making machine there.

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,FFXIV pushes that quite a bit. The game warns you before long cut scenes to make sure you have a long time to play.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Well rumor has it Death Stranding has a cutscene that is approximately 2 hours long
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Its 27 for 1 cut scene, the problem is its smashed in there with a bunch of other cut scenes totaling over an hour."

There are also some *8 whole hours worth of cutscenes across the entire game*. Just in cutscenes alone, you're marathoning the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy, using the Director's Cut versions for each film."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"It holds the record for longest single cutscene (27 mins), as you said. But it also holds the record for longest *string* of cutscenes, at over 1hr 40mins."

Obviously the common convention is that games should be fun, otherwise people would generally not play them. I'm not making a comment on death stranding at all.

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,">it should be fun

That's entirely up to whoever is making it. If their goal is to sell a lot, then yeah making it ""fun"" and appealing to the widest possible audience makes sense. But if you really just want to make something that has X features to see if you can, and because you yourself like it, then there isn't anything ""wrong"" with that. 

""art"" is a meaningless term that we apply to things. Anything that the person(s) who created the piece consider to be expressive of something to them is technically art. There is no metric by which anyone else can say it is or isn't art. I say that as a person that finds most modern art to be tremendously lacking in substance or worth. 

Again, the key point to my first statement is that if you are going purely on semantics (as u/AllenKCarlson insisted on doing for some reason) then no, fun is not inherent or mandatory."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,">At the same time, it should be fun, be that enjoying a good story or good gameplay. Bad gameplay will detract from fun and doesn't just make it art automatically. 

Gameplay can be as subjective as art, believe it or not. What someone considers annoying and ""bad gameplay"" could be considered as a different experience to others.

I really hated Kingdom Come: Deliverance at first because I thought it had bad game mechanics, but my friend couldn't get enough of it because he likes the change from standard RPGs, and the learning curve it presented to him. I don't agree with him but I can appreciate how someone can enjoy something that I may find frustrating.

&#x200B;

>That's like saying FIFA titles are justified because they're art,   not because they're gambling with soccer, or that Brink was art, despite being a total flop of a game 

The problem with that argument is that FIFA titles don't pretend to be art. EA knows exactly the type of demographic they are catering to; sports fans and people who like to play arcade-type games. The same with Brink (as much of a flop as it was), it was made for those who like competitive shooters as opposed to those who were looking for an artistic game.

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"If we're looking for words, I think engaging would be a good fit here. A game doesn't necessarily need to be fun, but it should engage the player, capture their interest, and impact them in such a way that they want to keep playing."

>Lol you're inferring that the game is bad, they're not saying it's bad. Very very different.

I am using the FACTS reported by reviewers to CONCLUDE that the game is tedious and boring, and therefore bad. I can form my own opinions based on the facts, I don't need a reviewer to do my thinking for me.

>The original point being that there are a bunch of positive reviews about the game lol.

That doesn't make the game good for anyone except the person writing the ""positive"" review, and even for those people, many are giving high ratings and praise even though they didn't particularly like the game, out of personal devotion to Kojima, or to suck up to his company because reviewers do that to gain access and benefits with developers all the time.

>OP said there was a sea of negative reviews, which is blatantly bullshit.

There are many negative reviews, including the famously bad review from IGN, a major reviewer that carries far more weight than some little foreign web site that doesn't even publish in english.

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,This gives you 1/200th of an inkling as to why it’s my favorite game ever.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,It's literally one of the best PS2 games ever made and probably considered one of the best MGS games in the series as well especially when they remade it and changed the camera to over the shoulder instead of the projected camera views. Subsitance was the shit.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,....... you do realize the only limitation of an older system is processing power and graphics right? What you quoted is just game design. Some older games are SUPER complex in their design.
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"MGS3 has huge amounts of detail because its, like all older NGS games, a bunch of very tiny environments in seperated zones."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Way back in MGS 1 on the OG PlayStation, my mind was blown by the clever use of the system’s hardware during the Psycho Mantis boss fight."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,There's a boss fight where the enemy can literally die of old age if you quit the game and don't return to it for a couple of weeks (or if you set the PS clock time a few weeks into the future).
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Don't let the setting fool ya. Deeply systemic games (MGS3 and 5 are especially strong at sandbox gameplay) with oodles of both stealth and/or action possibilities.

And because its Kojima, boatloads of all sorts of fan service, secrets, extras, memery, challenges, etc.

For all his auteur profile he likes to play up, Kojima is a nerd gamer at heart."

drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"There’s a lot of depth in terms of how you can approach clearing out or avoiding guards. Guns blazing is still fun and viable, but stealth and tactics is what the series is famous for.

Distraction, camouflage, disabling security systems, finding alternative routes, using the environment for you or against them, weapon and item variety, lethal and non-lethal approaches... all tools at your disposal that you can chain together and approach the game however you want.

For example: Crawl through an air vent, sneak up behind a guard, draw your weapon to interrogate him for intel, knock him out, destroy his radio so if he wakes up he can’t call HQ for backup, place explosives on his body, make a noise to lure his buddies over, hide in a cardboard box so you can watch, detonate c4."

You are literally asking what is the meaning of the word game? I just explained it above. If you don't believe me, feel free to look it up yourself. As far as ""fun"", yes entertainment is often a part of games but it isn't required to make something a ""game"". Particularly because fun is so inherently subjective. You can't remember a time when you played a game and had a bad time? 

If fun is required, then what you are saying is if you play volleyball and hate it, then it is no longer a game. If you play monopoly and are bored to tears, and get so angry you flip the board...then it isn't a game anymore. Does that make more sense?"

I sent my GI Joe's on stealth missions, even named my favorite one Snake. I learned everything I could about the lore of that universe that when I cleared MGSV and went over all the flavor dialogue and audio tapes, I was so satisfied that it was wrapped up with 0 plot holes. So many works of art with darting time settings and so many entries fuck that up, but Kojima and Konami kept that shit air tight."
drqqww,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"When it comes to analyzing video games, I think game theory is only a small part of the pool of knowledge we can learn from.

I took a college course in games studies– literally the study of video games. My professor was really bright and took the subject extremely seriously.

Lol, that's not an explanation. You didn't define or explain anything. You just made a strong statement.

>If fun is required, then what you are saying is if you play volleyball and hate it, then it is no longer a game. If you play monopoly and are bored to tears, and get so angry you flip the board...then it isn't a game anymore. Does that make more sense?

I think that's rather silly. It's like saying the color green isn't always different from blue. Some people are color blind can't tell the difference, so it's not a prerequisite for the color. That's ridiculous. Just because you can't see it or you're not having fun doesn't mean it's not a fundamental part of the definition.

In fact, if you are not having fun you call a game a bad game. Because it lacks the key component that makes a game a game, fun.

Why even take this angle? It's so stupid. Why not just say words grow and change and video game is encompassing more than just a fun experience? That's way more compelling."

When the water was rushing forward from the river and Sam had to start running to avoid it I audibly said ""that's so cool"" even though it's such a relatively small thing. That plus the avalanches made me excited for the dynamic weather and terrain effects you'll have to maneuver through. 

The fact that robots are more common and have replaced porters in the world, it seems combat is definitely going to be more frequent which I don't mind either way. 

A good balance of those slower moments traversing through difficult terrain juxtaposed to higher intensity combat/cinematic set pieces plus a wild story to keep you hooked makes me believe this has great potential to surpass the first game.

1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,omg Im currently reading through the novelization of the first game! talk about timing
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Kojima just hit a new standard of “wtf just happen”
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Is no one going to say anything about the creepy  puppet guy? I am also confused by this trailer.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Anyone catch the god of war mimir reference? So good!
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,I love Kojima because of the mysterious aspect of not knowing what’s going on & trying to figure it out. Where the facts aren’t all laid out and you have to play the game and actually listen to dialogue or you will be extremely confused. I feel like this increases immersion. For me at least
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"I'm not ashamed to admit i'm a Kojima fanboy because everything he does is fucking mental and a proper head fuck. I wish more developers would push the envelope and try something wacky from time to time but no, gotta keep churning out the same crap over and over again"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-02,"No thanks, first one was boring"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,What the fuck did I just watch..
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Fuckin awesome
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"God dammit, I'm in."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Ohh looking nice
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"This game is the definition of a vibe. I played it and realized I wasn't in the right headspace for it, so I waited. 3 years later, I gave it a real try and fell in love. I can't wait for this"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Woo! I can't wait. I loved the first one(I feel like there's not many of us lol)
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"I’ve played every mgs multiple times and it is forever my favorite series of all time. When he left Konami and the first Death Stranding trailer came out I remember thinking it looks cool and weird, but it’s not my style. Being a father I don’t really have time to venture out of my comfort zone with my minimal gaming time. This trailer cranked the weirdness up to 11 and now I’m more than intrigued. Kojima easily could have been a renowned movie director had he ventured down that path instead."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Kojima is the most overrated game dev cant wait to not play this pretentious bullshit
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,I just couldnt get into it.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"lol @ the COD bros in here shitting on this while not even having finished the first one.

“Bruh, who can I shoot in the face? What is this shit bruh? I don’t like anything unique or strange or different. Need my military bro shooter to help get me hard. Bruh.”

Like, would it kill you fuckers to keep an open mind?

Having said that, Kojima is clearly dropping acid."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,So I think I need to go watch the 7 hour long review of the first game and then watch this
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,What the fuck did I watch. I have such a headache but I am also enthralled.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"Soooo, I'm guessing this one was not sponsored by Monster Energy Drink?"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"2025 is gonna be so fucking good for gaming, at least for me, I know these ain't for everyone but I fucking love Death Stranding."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Kojima just needs to make movies.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Hes just making shit up as he goes again
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"Loved the first one and def getting this as well

so dope that part of it is in Mexico too"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,This. Can't wait to not understand shit.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,People who haven’t played the first game will be confused as fuck by this trailer and I can’t wait to see it lol.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Looks incredible and incredibly absurd… Love it.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Never go full Kojima…
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,I'm good thanks...
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,"Kojima so fucking desperately needs some people around him that will say ""hmm, maybe not for THIS game, let's shelve it for the next""

Hes undoubtedly a visionary, but my fucking god some of this shit is so incoherent and nonsensical.

Edit: Gotta give big props to the dev team though, graphically looks incredible."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,I sleep
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,I miss Metal Gear Solid
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,I'm sorry but the guitar scene was pretty bad ass
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Absolutely amazing. Cannot wait.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Hey can we all stop pretending this guy makes great games??
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,If “I’m so random” was a game developer.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Was hoping for something from Naughty Dog. Maybe the next one
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Is that Gary Oldman as the start?
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,His job is beach
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"I still can't believe KojiPro went with this subtitle, but I'm also very glad they went with it."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,They actually made another?
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"I’m excited, but did they need the subtitle?"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Does anyone know the name of the music that starts when Higgs touches the baby container and when the guitar music kicks in during the fight?
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"I didn’t play the first game, but were there always these Final Fantasy like creatures and equipment? I don’t remember ever seeing anything like that in gameplays or trailers
(e.g. those magic blue hands around the collar of that one lady that can create fire, the thrashing big hand in the swamp)"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,I really want to play the first one. Can you disable all the multiplayer building? I feel like if I play it now it’s probably tons of stuff people have already put up. I want to play it like it just came out.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,2025 is gonna be a big year for games.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"humanity is in danger, you need to PORTER so hard that you save the world!"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,They have a flying ship that can resist the time rain? Cool. Better send a guy out on foot to do all this shit.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,I feel like it is weird and there are things about it that bug me and I also think I'll likely play it and enjoy it.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"Nice little nod to the Decima engine logo in the beginning there, with the spikes on the arm, and dripping black liquid"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,can't wait to play as an amazon worker again.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"Brilliant!

...I have absolutely no idea what's going on."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,this looks so gooood.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Watching Maximilian Dood tear up at Sam kissing the baby was wholesome as fuck. Dude became a dad and has all the feels for father figures in games now.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,That closeup shot of the woman's eyes who is on the table near the start. I think those are some of the best eyes I've ever seen in a videogame.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"Don’t have a clue what the games are about or play like, but the previous one put me on to some banger music so hoping for a repeat."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,It was an Amazon simulator
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"He really is batshit, I love it."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"I was like why is this woman wearing two gloves for a mask, wait..... WAIT WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Well guess I gotta finish the first game now 😅
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Norman Reedus in just the two of us
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,DoorDash simulator looks crazy
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"I fucking love Kojima.

1) Robot dog with a gun dick.

2) Lady in a sludge egg.

3) A guitar/gun/sword

4) A low FPS automaton that talks like an old timey sports announcer.

5) A scarf that's just extra hands to smoke cigarettes with.

I can't wait to be a post-apocalyptic post man gleefully making piss mushrooms with the community."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"I already beat it, I did my rounds this morning with my nephew and will go this afternoon as well.  Might go up this hill and slip on this ice but I’ll make sure to overpack."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"i played the first one for like 4-5 hours or so, then i got bored. at least it was free on epic.

will probably skip this one."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"The only thing I appreciate about this series is the work/tech going into landscapes. Truly the most real looking landscapes I've seen. The landslide in the trailer was looking incredible. 

I'm a giant MGS fan but this shit is just too crazy, even for me lmao"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"First was beyond boring, but I’m all for another one since I assume people loved it lol"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"I'm really starting to believe kojima is a name that's overrated because this is stuff and the first one look like, I don't even know what it looks like but it's not good to me. Don't get me wrong, I like weird and creative games, Conkers bad fur day is one of my favorite games and if you played that you know how weird it is but this is just something else"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"the game was all over the place, but the gameplay was very calming and got you into a good flow state."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"I lost the plot when the baby in the vagina burped the spaceship that Norman Reedus is on and then the joker showed up and fought off another guy with his guitar gun that he fires by shredding on the guitar. 


Also puppets, I think."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"Really enjoyed the first game. So trippy and crazy, made me a huge fan of Kojima. Weird poetic semi connected thoughts all patched together to make a very strange story and universe. I’ve had a blast with the first game, I’m sure the second will be just as fun plus a lot more."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,time for some more [https://i.imgur.com/UCHjejl.png](https://i.imgur.com/UCHjejl.png) the video game
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Haven't played these games are they worth it?
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Is this a joke?  A bit early for April fools.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,This got a sequel before Ghost of Tsushima?
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"If this one is actually in Scandinavia rather than ""America"" I'll buy it."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"the guitar gun thing is so cringe. and a puppet that talks to you also is very strange. wtf is this game, maybe i should play the first one. the enemies in the red looked fuckin sick tho lmao"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Locked at 30fps
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"This looks so weird and stupid and ridiculous.

Imma play it."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Kojima is off the chain! I love it. Bonkers.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"JFC Kojima can be cringe af, but I still love it"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Looks awesome! Can't wait to play this
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Is the first one worth playing? I just watched this trailer and it definitely has me intrigued.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"Lol, the baby coughing up a spaceship was pretty much where I stopped.  LMFAO"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"On one hand in glad things like this can exist, on the other omg what a waste of everything "
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Kojima learned that people love long walks on the beach.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,i tried playing it but damn its slow paced.  i just returned some body up a mountain to link it to the network and had to trudge back home to the main base.  ill try again.  it looks amazing but its hard to sit and get into it. the stupid acid rain always in the way.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"Why? Why do we need a sequel? The world was utterly fucked. Then it was saved. Why must it be destroyed again?

The storyline was perfect already."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,I thought the guy in the cover was daryl from the walking dead 💀
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,im done with the over indulgent walking sims myself. i knew better than to try walking stranding but gave it a shot and was disappointed.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-02,"Since the GTA VI reveal, I haven't been this impressed with a games visuals. Agree with John Linneman, it's one of the best looking unreleased titles I've seen yet and more impressive than anything released thus far. 2025 looking sharp."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,First one had a bad story and they double down with that shit in this trailer. I would say they should just show the gameplay but then again the entire trailer was gameplay since you don't do anything anyway 
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Classic Kojima trash people watch and say it’s amazing gameplay when in reality it’s garbage.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Walking Sim 2
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,DS1's gameplay and story never clicked with me so im excited to see what they do different in this one
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,"Kojima game trailer's always get me hyped because they're always spectacular, until I play the game and just lose interest very quickly."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"I need to get my hands on the zaza that Kojima smokes. This is batshit insane and I was completely glued to the screen for its near 10 minutes runtime.    

I’m confused, I’m scared, I’m hyped, but 2025… oh man…"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Is death stranding worth the play?
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"This trailer was like the final cutscene in DS1, just kept going."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"So hype, but also what is happening?"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"I never finished the first game because I got so wrapped up with making deliveries back and forth on the second or third level. 

Amazing game but I got so distracted by the gameplay I forgot about the story."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"Everything I didn't know I needed from a sequel, also Lou being dead is depressing asf, but I really hope the baby voiced Ronin is her coming back to fuck shit up"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"i don't care at all, but it's nice that you guys enjoy it !"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Looks bonkers
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"I couldn’t decide who that was, was leaning towards Sam Rockwell but something seemed off.  Troy Baker should’ve known"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,d-daddy???
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"Cooould it be a little but of “Tactical” infront of Action Espionage 😅

Physint Motor Chemical lol"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Kojima and not name everything so literally challenge impossible.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,The second strand-type game
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Walking simulator part 2
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"Kojima's mind is like a creative kafkaesque nightmare paradise where strange but good ideas collide with each other until they become absurd mental cronenberg monsters reflected upon humanity from the mirrored subconscious pysche of all parallell universes outwards from Kojima's soul which is trapped in the womb of an eldritch horror which won't be born before after the end of time.   
  
It's the only reasonable explanation I can come up with."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,All I wanna know is can we cause avalanches and rockslides with explosives...😏
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"Want the reception of Death Stranding not that great? I wonder why they made a second. I guess if they already put so much development into first, taking the game engine and assets to make a second wasn’t that big a jump (still looks like tons of dev time, but still better than building from scratch)."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"Kojima is like Kanye of this industry. There is a vision, we just dont get it"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,So is this the second stranding type game?
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Loved the electric guitar version of BB's Theme
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"Bro just make a movie already, Kojima. Gameplay is unnecessary at this point"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Can’t wait
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Kojima is a dipshit with 0 original ideas
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,Game looks ridiculous. Electric guitar battle scene was over the top for me
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Ah yes walking simulator 2
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Is this real? lol. Am I being trolled by AI? I can’t tell anymore.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Let Kojima cook
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,I have no clue who the fuck funds these drug infused garbage projects.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"Everything else aside, the ""On the Beach"" part of the title is so fucking stupid."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,Not a fan.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"Look I'm not saying his games are bad but can we all agree the Kojimbo's stories are completely nonsensical? Again, I'm not saying the game is/will be bad. I'm saying that plot wise it's like a toddler playing with action figures."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,This is horrible. Just a spam of nonsensical gibberish and 10 million ideas that go no where for a game where you walk places and deliver stuff. If this wasn't such high quality I do not think anyone who be ok with how nonsensical these games are.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Really tried to get into this but I found it to be the most boring 3 hours of my life. I'm excited for OD and his next espionage project tho
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Cool. Now do days gone 2
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,I hope it’s a real game this time. My favorite part of DS 1 is rewatching the trailers and not any of the game
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Delivery man simulator 2
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,where bloodborne
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"Utter, utter UTTER bollocks."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"looks Like This Kojima guy ran out of Ideas...why is an enemy using a musical instrument to fight, 

this is not HI-FI rush man"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,There was enough people who liked the first to merit a second?
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,"Keeping my expectations low, as others are saying Kojima is indeed looking desperate."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,"So much walking, too much walking"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,I want the first game on Xbox man. I loved playing it but I don’t know my I just CANT play my PS4 for more than an hour
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"A crying baby game mechanic is a deal breaker, otherwise I'm in for the weirdness."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,"The first game was boring and included very concerning monetising methods which ruined the immersion

This one feels like hideo kojima is trying to make it as weird as possible just to see if he will ever face criticism from his dilluded fan base 

Also, who the heck releases a 10 min trailer and speech for a gaming coming our in 2025.. it's Jan 2024 ffs!"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,“You know how I got these guitars?”
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,That's 100% The Crow.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Tbf Troy baker has played both Higgs and the joker so the guy does have some of that energy lol
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"He said ""Childhood's over the moment you know you're gonna die"""
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Maybe but face paint like that is also common for black metal bands.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"Yes 100% , higgs is even brought back from the dead like Eric"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,">Eric Draven

Oh damn, yeah of course!"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"Seriously... and I even finished the first one. I'll buy this simply because I did enjoy delivering and connecting the world together. But you can ask me about the story and I have 0 fucking clue what happend in ds1. That shot of the sand dunes sold the gsme for me. IDK why but I love deserts. Even if they are empty I just love it. Mad max, horizon forbiden west, cyberpunk 2077. I love deserts

Edit: I honestly remember loving building roads and ziplines. I had a whole network of ziplines up and running in the mountains. You could level up every delivery point in a day using my ziplines. I think I ended up getting all roads up as well. But my favorite part was seing people use my paths from before i had setup my traversals. Going through the mountains and climbing and seeing someone else having used it later. Great feeling. Loved the multiplayer aspect"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"Honestly, that was most of the first game for me, but damn did I enjoy walking around the map."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"That's ok, bro."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Yet I freakin love it.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,I like the dolls
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"That’s why Kojima is such and incredible and talented artist. His work makes zero sense whatsoever, it is guaranteed to be tedious to play, and the writing is always lower than B-movie quality. He’s a god. At least that’s what everyone else says"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,Dueling a samurai robot possessed by a ghost baby!
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"Pretty sure there will be at least 20 minute long audio file with massive lore dump, that will explain in convoluted terms that coolness affects performance."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,I'm still along for the ride because I loved the ridiculousness of the first one.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Because Kojima.

1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"My friend asked if there's spoilers for Death Stranding 1 in this trailer since he never played it. I told him yes, but you wouldn't know which is which since there's so much stuff in this trailer lol."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,Classic death stranding
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"Its a drunk single dad walking simulator where you throw glass jars of human shit at ghosts and zipline 

Whats so confusing about that"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,It's a Kojima game. Being confused is part of the experience.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"I got the first Death Stranding for free on Epic store (PC), but it wasn’t really for me. It was a lot different than I first thought, with mostly just walking around and delivering packages.

The DS trailers looks cool, but then you end up playing the game, and.. yeah.

But that’s just my opinion."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"All that, but now in Mexico.  With a guitar and a talking mini ventriloquist doll."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Hey the good news is genetic rng is in your favor and even if you blow up you can come back to life and you also don't blow up big like other people.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"Love Kojima or hate him, no one gets the opportunity to make super high budget weird shit like this."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,yup and he announced a new action espionage ip…omg metal gear spiritual successor???
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,I’m super into it. A semi original story just because it’s diving so far into the weird it’s becoming a meme of itself. And transcending all of it at the same time. Thank you kojima for at least being imaginative
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,That's why Kojima is my favourite game-maker.  You never know what you're going to get from him.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"I'm not into the latest of Kojima's creations, but considering the state of modern gaming, I'd rather we get weird games than blatantly consumer-unfriendly ones."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Keep on keeping on.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,I am fucking EXCITED. Absolutely loved the first one.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,First one is legit one of my favourite games of all time. I’ve played it like 4 times. I cannot fucking wait for this game.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,Absolutely loved Death Stranding 1!
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"Kind of in this boat, I just cannot get into the Kojima nonsense but if you’re into it then more power to you."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Is that meant to be Darryl from the Walking Dead?
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"ok so is the world the baby? why did it spit up a matrix hovership?

and why are they blue"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,YES!
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"It's more creative than ""weird"""
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Walking simulator
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"Lol, that's what I was thinking. Then he made the joke, and I was like, ""I see you poking fun at God of War, Kojima. You're a funny guy"""
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,We’re reaching levels of Kojima that shouldn’t be possible
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Does it fire rockets?
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,It's not a gun it's a pisstol
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,I’m imagining a slow mo cgi shot where the dog Max Paynes a handful of BTs

1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,..I think it was 😳
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"So sorry officer, he saw a fire hydrant in the same color that he was, started humping it and that's how an entire mag got emptied into the side of the school bus."

1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Voiced by Troy Baker it sounds like.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,"I have no interest in death stranding, but god damn this sounds amazing :D"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,I get kind of a David Bowie vibe
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,with a splash of David Bowie
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,So Joker Sting from TNA 😂?
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,i dunno in typical Kojima way its probably wont even end up being the bad guy ...more like an early antagonist that may or may not become an ally based on your own grey morals
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,is he not the same guy from the first game? He still sounds like hes voice by  Troy Baker
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,"I’m not crying, you’re crying

Seriously, really hit me in the feels. Like dad feels."

1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"I didn't play much but I got curious and chatted with bing copilot. The man really did plan out so have details I didn't think I could just ask questions and get answers.


A web of concepts all linked together and explained. The information exists. But just playing the game you don't really think about all the mechanics the game has regarding BTs."

LETS GIVE HIM MORE DRUGS"

1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,No kidding! I don't even play Death Stranding. I don't even have PS5. I watched the whole thing. Kinda wish I knew the ending. I noticed the girl that was eavesdropping looks a lot like Elle Fanning.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,">Can’t wait to throw my bottled up piss at Troy Baker’s take on The Crow



*HAVE SOME BLOOD BULLETS, EMO BOY!*"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"Shouldn’t have said anything, now Kojima is going throw in extra comic book style names, just for youuuuuuuuuuu"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"I feel the opposite. First game had me hooked from the first teaser. This one is equally weird, but in an entirely different unappealing way. I'll probably still play it though."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,Agreed
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,It's actually why I bought death stranding... Still never got into it simply because I'm just not interested in the core delivery mechanic... Then again I never got to chapter 4 which I hear is important.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Exactly. I didn't think I would be so into Death Stranding as I was. I got it for the Kojima story and then left pretty satisfied with the community building on Steam launch.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,The first games trailer was completely nonsensical as well until you played through the story and you find that it reveals a bunch of major plot points. Im assuming it will be the same here
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-02,And that's a problem?
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,"I agree, the soft social features of the ""strand"" system that they made allow for a very interesting gameplay element when playing online.  The idea that a bridge you made or a rainfall shelter you built or a charging station may have helped another player on their journey is very cool."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,It's one of my favorite games. So much fun building a network of ziplines and seeing how quickly I could finish deliveries.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"and the best thing for kojima.

sure we might’ve gotten a good silent hill revival out of it, but i’d take everything kojima has announced recently over that i think. def hoping OD gets to see some of that horror fully fleshed out though.

also if the new “action espionage” game is anything like a good spiritual successor to mgs then konami really lost lmao."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,This game is legit a walking simulator. Is everyone going insane or is this an inside joke
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"Yep! The first game was populated with movie directors along with a few of the actors, I imagine the 2nd with be the same. If you follow kojima on social media he has soooo many famous directors coming through his studio right now."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,">The fact that robots are more common and have replaced porters in the world, it seems combat is definitely going to be more frequent which I don't mind either way. 



It'll be nice to freely use lethal ammunition without having to worry about incinerating corpses afterwards. 


*Oh god* he's gonna give the robots a self destruct sequence, isn't he??"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"If I ever met Kojima, I'd ask him to hook me up with his drug guy, cuz he's definitely getting the primo shit."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Hold my piss and shit grenades
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,The original is on PC too now if you'd like to play it.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"If you're a father, you will *love* the first Death Stranding. You will absolutely be bawling your eyes out at some of the story beats.

I don't even have a kid, and I was even tearing up at points."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,If you’re a dad you should absolutely give DS a chance.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"OK, that was always allowed..."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Ok.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,it’s a glorified walking simulator.  Probably the worst gameplay I have ever experienced.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"It still won't make sense. 


And that's okay."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"People who *have* played the first one are confused as fuck by this trailer, the fuck you mean? Lol"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,I played the first one and I have no clue wtf is going on here :D I will say it's been a while so I may have forgotten some story details that could explain some things in this trailer...
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,"People are weird, when they see something wild and creative like Death Stranding 2 they recoil, when they see something derivative like Palworld, they love it"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,I never played the first one and watching this was like having a fever dream.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,I didn’t understand half the story of death stranding but I loved it
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,You wouldn't get it man. In all seriousness I agree tho. I'm still here for the ride cause I loved the ridiculousness of the first one.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,"its a trailer, ofc it doesnt make sense now..."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,There’s no “pretending” going on here.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,George Miller director of mad max! Not sure on who did the voice though.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"The way instances are generated is weird. You won’t just pop into a world with everything built. In fact, you won’t see any player creations until you connect a base. After that some structures spawn. Trust me after a few hours you’ll look forward to seeing player structures."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,I got a couple hours into it and think I overloaded myself.  Are you supposed to always trying to be keeping your balance so you dont fall over?  I got annoyed and stopped playing but It seemed like I needed to carry all that shit for the mission.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"While I'm a bit sceptical of what I've seen narratively in DS2, I think gameplay is where Kojima hugely succeeds."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"It’s not for everyone. The biggest DS fans will tell you that. Calling it garbage is just absurd, though."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Depends. I’m a huge fan. Calling it a walking simulator is disingenuous. I would do some research before picking it up. If it clicks with you then it’s an amazing game but I also don’t want you to waste your money.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Nope it’s a walking simulator.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,Me: *sold*
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,First Kojima game?
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,"The funny part is its in the trailer but it probably wont be in the game. 

He made entirely fake trailers for MGS2 right up until release (I think?)"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,amazing Neil Young album though
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"Death Stranding 3: Suns Out, Buns Out."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,You're getting down voted but he is getting less and less comprehensible. I liked the human element of DS well enough but the beach stuff is complete nonsense
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"I mean P.T. was scary weird, but there was still a logic to it that got me way more excited for Silent Hills than any of his other games. "
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"It… does make sense though? At least it did in the first game, you just had to pay attention to the story. All the elements come together eventually, and I’d bet money that’s true for DS2 also"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Yup!
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,Looking desperate? How?
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,"given the massive backlash and disappointment after the MASSIVE online presence they had last time. expect pretty much everything to be positive about kojima until release, then he'll disappear again for a few years.

like it was on the level of elon musk sort of presence, it was on the front page CONSTANTLY. then right after, next to no-one gave a shit because it was a... mediocre? but interesting game."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Monetising???
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"I'm genuinely glad my post was down voted , because it proved my point. Not saying that people aren't entitled to disagree with me, but when this game comes out and its shit, the dilluded fan base will still down vote everyone"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,I look forward to a directors cut commentary where Troy Baker talks over everyone else because he thinks he's the absolute shit.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"It's pretty obvious what's happening if you've played the first one...

They've found a humanoid in the shell, and as per DS1, the ""oil"" is actually a primordial soup for life. The Death Stranding is the convergence of life & death [the beach] and it was going to be the final cataclysm, but Sam stopped it. But it begs the question of what is Lou and what is the person in the shell, as they're clearly connected. But the person in the shell somehow has blood made of timefall, so it's clearly another lifeform altogether.

Sam's mission is to keep connecting the Chiral network, but this time internationally.

But on the key answers to the main questions, Sam is also in-the-dark. And it has to do with BB.

And I'm pretty sure Ellie Fanning is Lou as a teenager."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Check out Dune Awakening if you like dessert
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Have you played Journey? That might be a great 4-5h game for you.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"Nier Automata has a great desert environment. 

Also, I’m with you on the story. I try so hard to keep up and it’s all just over my head lol. But honestly, it’s no different than any FromSoft game I’ve ever played. I literally have no idea what’s happening in any of them despite my hundreds of hours and trawling all of the subs."

1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Such an awesome gameplay loop. Can't understand why so many tought the game was boring. I loved every second of it. Even though i don't 100% the game i enjoyed my time and was sad after it was over.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,More like chit chat with the low fps doll. It's Sam's own Metal Gear Mk. II.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"It reminds me in Ghostrunner, the MC asks his head voice why he was created without ranged equipment and only a sword.  The voice does a long explaination why despite getting a ranged attack later, and you could probably just paraphrase to ""Because it's cool."""
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"I just started the first one last night and I didn't expect to be lugging my dead mom, who is apparently the President of the old US and that needed to be explained to me, on my back to some incinerator in secret because new America is like some shogunate dynasty that will fall apart should the leader die."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,No I’ve been confused before

1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"I've seen bits of gameplay of the first one, I've had some - I don't even know if major or minor spoilers..? - told to me, and have had some people try to explain it.

I also watched the trailer for the first one before it came out, multiple times, and now I've seen the second trailer.

I have _absolutely no idea_ what the game's plot is about at all at this point, but I was already planning on finally playing the first one this year so I can find myself even more confused."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Honestly it would be funny if someone thought the axe guitar is in the first game and was looking for that scene specificly.

1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Don't forget pissing on tar ghosts. That's one of favorite things to do!
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"It's a slog in the beginning, but it's meant to be. Once you unlock new transportation options it becomes a lot more fun and engaging. I spent stupid amounts of time building a web of ziplines around the mountains lol. But initially I stopped playing after a few hours and it took over a year before I picked it back up after someone suggested pushing through the early part of the game. Totally worth it."

There is always layers of progression systems feeding into each other and it just feels so good.


Seriously imagine getting to explain before death standing. Someone was going to make a big budget game about delivering packages and be successful.


His ability to create and weave together a huge number of systems is incredible.



The game is held up purely by master class design imo and that comes from kojima."

1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"He's one of the few game creators we all know by name.  He's practically a genre on to himself, like Tarantino is to films.  You either love his games or you don't, but nobody can deny his unique presence and firm foothold in the history of the medium.  There are what, 4 or 5 rockstar game creators that every hardcore gamer knows by name?  Shigeru Miyamoto, Hideo Kojima, Sid Meier, Gabe Newell (Who barely makes games anymore) and John Carmack?  I dunno who's after that.  Cliff B maybe?  Tim Schafer?  There are some making a name for themselves like the No Man's Sky guy whose name escapes me right now, but none of those guys are as well known as the godfathers of gaming at the top.  Far into the future when the exhaustive recap of all gaming is compiled, Kojima will be a historical figure with full chapters devoted just to him and his legacy, both good and bad."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,">metal gear spiritual successor?

I know you meant that as a description, but now I really would like to play Metal Gear Spiritual Successor. ""Who can be the dominant spiritualist!"""
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"Yeah I'm a little surprised there isn't more chatter about this. MGSV was peak in terms of gameplay, so seeing Hideo go back that genre without Konami's fetters and as a new IP is incredibly exciting. Even with that project being at least 6 years away, I can't wait to see more on that."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,But it’s an interactive game. When he said it was action espionage I was so hyped till they showed the Sony Columbia thing and I went yep it’s one of those games isn’t it.

1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-02,"I think the game is like Marmite... you love it or you hate it

For me, the gameplay loop is just amazing for some reason, I love trudging about, there are some really breathtaking moments in the game where it feels like you're playing a movie... going over the crest of the hill towards Port Knot City and *Asylums for the Feeling* starts playing is incredbile"

1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,His character returning from the first game
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"He played the same character in the first game, looks like he mutilated his face to look like his crush"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,It's his face too. Fully performance captured by him.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,"On paper, the gameplay sucks. In practice it's fucking amazing and addicting."

1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,"man thats not going to be even the tip of the iceberg in terms of actors and people involved. 

Two main characters from the last one were Nicolas Winding Refn (Drive) and Guillermo del Toro (pans labyrinth)

If you follow him on insta there is all kinds of wild people coming through his studio."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Noooooooooooo!!!!!!!
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,If you loved the first trailer I don’t quite see how this is unappealing- seems like a solid progression of the previous level of weird
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-02,Nope. Just an observation.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"Coming back to the game to find that somebody helped expand your ziplines network was such a cool feeling. 


Except when it's in an awkward spot and interrupted my flow across the mountains lol"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"Have you played it? It's surprisingly fun and the story is weird but cool. The gameplay and mechanics are so unique and it's stunning to look at. It's like if an indie game got a massive budget to do whatever they wanted. 

To be fair, the gameplay doesn't hold up after the credits roll for me unfortunately. I'm mostly excited for his horror game and whatever this could be than DS2."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,The PC version also just got a remaster so there's that :)
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Will do man! Downloading as we speak.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-02,"damn did ya come up with that all by yourself or did ya have to watch rick and morty to come up with it? imagine having your own opinion, oh wait you cant"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,OK
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,What if I've got no interest in Palworld and I'm cautiously sceptical about DS2?
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"I mean, this trailer alone has so much weird in it that I'm sure only the bare minimum will actually have a satisfying explanation in-game.

And say what you will about Palworld, but as I hear it the gameplay loop is straight-up fun, and you don't get that without people who have a passion for it.

That said, I do hope Death Stranding 2 succeeds because game studios need to take more risks."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,It does make more sense if you know what’s going on in the first game. Not much but some.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,"that's literally the point though. Its like telling a surrealist painter that the things they paint make no sense. Its not supposed to make any real sense beyond ""this is the world I made""."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,I'm sure the stop motion talking puppet and the guitar that shoots lightning will be thoroughly explained.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,No.  It’s called an opinion.   Mine is it was garbage.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,Seriously. This thread reads like people have never seen a Kojima game before. The weirdness is a huge part of the appeal. 
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"Dude, MGS2 was 23 years ago. He's been the director of 7 games since then, none of which have had fake trailers. If ""probably"" is informed by what we've seen previously, it probably will be in the game."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Well P.T. wasn't even a game it was a teaser demo
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"What a weird hysteria. The game literally makes no sense. Its literally nonsense. Just because they give exposition about some insane gibberish it doesn't mean it makes any sense. They just explain a thing and you go ""uhuh yep ok sure yeah... babies uhuh whales ... yet the beach ok uhuh death alright sure"" it doesn't actually make any sense. Its literally obtuse abstract psuedo-philosophical gibberish.  


The explanations for the story and the nonsense with the poop bombs just explains away the nonsensical nature of the game. The game doesn't make sense. The game just gives you lines of exposition that explain away the need for it to make any sense."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,I think they’re talking about the Monster product placement 😂😂
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,He is the absolute shit at what he does thou 😄 if being a voice actor for video games was the same as being an actor in movies - guy has a better lineup than Leo Dicaprio
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,I'm actually concerned this all makes a semblance of sense to me.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,What?
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,This... this made sense.  God I loved the 1st game so much because of how crazy the story is but the fact that what you said actually makes sense in a way.  Super pumped to get lost in this again :)
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"It's really not as dense as people make it out to be, it seems it's basically just a meme to pretend to not understand it."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,I was confused by Higgs also coming out of a casket thingi with a face mask thinking he was the casket guy from the start but it seems not.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"People keep saying that last bit, but I can't see it. Especially since Sam outright said ""Was it you, Higgs? Huh? Was it you that killed Lou?"" If Ellie was Lou, then why would Sam think Lou is dead?"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Pretty obvious really
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,I saw a few snippets. I hope it's good. I loved the movie. Currently playing ac mirage. You guessed it..because of the desert. Also loved origins. Shame mirage is so short and lacks secrets like origins had in the desert

1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"Hell I played the first one and I’m not entirely sure what the plot is about. Weird stuff just kept happening and almost none of it made sense.  

But I had a ton of fun."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"The first one will be convulted for a while. It's a Kojima style: Not explaining *anything* until right before the end. Stick with it, if you enjoy the Fed Ex walking simulator/Euro Truck Simulator gameplay, you'll get an amazing game."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Classic.
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"The quick pitch meeting on that must been like this

OK so its basically Kevin Costner's the postman - But we are going to throw in some weird paranormal stuff and then mix in some like crazy Sci Fi stuff too. Yea know ghost demons ,different dimensions but like hover carts and exo suits and power armor bad guys

O and its all going to be about a coming apocalypse while living through the middle of a current apocalypse

O ya and some morally grey shit about using baby as magic tools and uncovering messed up conspiracys...

So can have like hundred of millions of dollars now please and take years to make this......"
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"Yeah, Kojima is basically Kubrick levels of respect in the industry.  Few other creators, if any other creators, could get away with what he's doing lately.

His departure from Konami is was one of the worst and best things to happen to gaming in my lifetime.  We lost Silent Hill, got a half completed Metal Gear 5, so that he could make not one but two Death Stranding games.

Pretty solid trade off."

1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,"Yeah it somehow works. What he created was a continuous sense of accomplishment of “connecting” waypoints on the network. And honestly there’s so many different ways you could do it. Cross a stream using a ladder? Try to cross it on foot, fall in and lose half your gear? The possibilities were endless. 

Did I understand all of it? Of course not but you didn’t have to “get” it all. The overall point of the story was pretty clear."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,"Definitely. It's one of those games I was sure I was going to hate, great story and acting be damned, but it was the gameplay that kept me going. The amazing vibes of trekking through these stunning landscapes, keeping your balance, building infrastructure to improve the quality of life for you and other players around the world. It captured the feeling and challenges of hiking in a way no other game has managed to before or since."

1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"The fact Kojima made a world that is basically dead and empty feel so alive is a testament to his genius.

The connection you have with other plays you never see is pretty fascinating."
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"Myself and many others felt the opposite, thought it sounded awesome on paper. In practice I found it incredibly easy to deliver packages without any obstacles and almost never found myself needing any of the tools available to you."

I'll never forget when he did an interview, did a Q&A and one aspiring VA asked him how to go about building your career to get bigger roles.

His response was (I shit you not)... ""don't even bother, those roles come to me. Next question.""

Always thought he was an arrogant fuck after that, and it comes through in his VA work.

Hearing his commentary then on TLOU podcast and the game commentary confirmed it for me. He did nothing but talk all over Ashley Johnson (who does a FAR better job) so she couldn't get a word in."

But when I can watch a trailer and be completely bewildered on what the game is even about I feel like we've lost the plot a little
1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,"I own the game. It was boring. So I watched a full playthrough. Its a bunch of nonsense.

A good story doesn't tell you what happened. It lets things happen and you understand them. Death Stranding just says some shit that doesn't make sense and using exposition to just explain away how silly and nonsensical everything is. Its like bad art. You need it explained to you for anything to make sense and then you are left going .. um but why this... and what about this and you could have just done this etc etc etc. The game makes no sense and I think people just say they understand it because they think it makes them look smart.  


Its an acid trip of unconnected nonsense and people who like it seem to think leaving everything unexplained because it has some moral about connecting people makes it make sense.. it does not make a statement or explain in a philosophical way how to bridge connection and connect people... it is literally the physical act of connecting shit in an apocalypse that makes no sense. In D&D you can understand the why and how because the paranormal fantasy aspects have logic behind them. The ""logic"" of death stranding is a bunch of pseudophilosophy and because-the-exposition-said-sos."

1afv3hr,2024-01-31,2024-02-01,Me physically pressing the forward button through a slog of walking and meaningless actions doesn't change  the fact I heard all the dialogue in the game. The game in the end is nonsense. The gameplay is your a mailman in Kojimas DMT trip. Thats understandable. The actual story and logic of the game makes no sense. Its all a big because-the-exposition-said-so for everything. The unanswered questions are a sea of loose threads and a fantasy/sci fi whatever element that is a fragmented mess .. because its Kojimas DMT trip. Its an attempt at making some grand statement or something and it just turns into every piece of major dialogue being a terrible unconnected mess of statements that are illogical and pseudo-philosophical. Then you have to watch Norman Reedus do weird shit and unexplainable disconnected plot lines. Its a total mess but it looks really good and they paid a lot for really good actors. If this was on the PS2 with random actors it would have flopped hard.

Was playing RE2 remake and saw all the others on the box sale again at $23. Just decided to buy that and beat those with my backlog during the holiday season. Shame there's not many new games I'm interested in coming up end of year. Usually there's at least one. Looks like the beginning of next year will be good though, with last of us 2 and a few others. Noticed they pushed back watch dogs for next gen launch. Shame because I loved picking those up in December on sale, and having a fun mindless play with them."

ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,While scrolling I thought this was something about Ghost Recon Breakpoint. Movement there is just as hilarious when it goes slightly down hill.
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"That’s right, QWOP your way up the hill. Your suffering builds character"
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,How are you all enjoying the game? Waiting for the PC launch

ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Shit it's not coming out till 2020 for windows. Guess maybe i'll just watch the cinematic story of the game when it comes out on PS4.

ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,Should play dayz. It’s a constant walk eat drink repeat.

ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"Death stranding looks like the most pretentious pile of dog shit ever released. The gameplay or lack there of is just walking around and trying to find the best path to get to your destination. Its like they made an open world game and forget to put everything that makes open world games fum to play in the trash. And not to mention the incoherent stories that kojima makes. Like we got a game called metal gear where the things that the game is named after isn't even in much of the game, there is like 20 different snake look alikes and the incredible torch decided to make a cameo because how else are you supposed to confuse the player. And death stranding holds up the same confusing mantle that the other kojima games made. The only praise the game deserves is the fact that it has some balls to try something so different but different doesn't mean its good."
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Bwahahaha
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I'm going to be totally frank about it I at this time have absolutely no interest in Death stranding at all not because I don't have faith in kohjima which I do but simply because I haven't been shown enough to be impressed! It does not look like it's going to be fun and I feel like I'm going to be waiting until after release when I can see actual gameplay that isn't just walking and talking before making my decision on whether I want to buy it or not.
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I laughed my fucking ass off at this
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"Honestly, this still sounds like fun . A walking sim made by Kojima featuring Norman Reedus ? Sounds amazing"

this game has been hyped to death, and now it just looks massively disappointing.

I want to know the story, sure, but a walking simulator it just ain’t for me, I was expecting at least a little bit more MGSV- like combat."
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,IGN = 6.8.
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-07,"Imagine that, a game where people are intrigued with walking rather than just going around killing things."

ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,But is simulating walking *fun* though? Why is this a “feature”?
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Sounds like r/gaming only plays fortnite, witcher, and call of duty."
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I don't care if it's a walking simulator, I'll still play the shit out of anything Kojima creates."
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"I liked the metal gears as much as everyone. Minus the recent one.  ( Story was too underwhelming, didn't care about base building)

But honestly I dont even think I can give this a try. You can't just develop an awesome world and interesting characters and then forget to design engaging gameplay. We want bosses, challenging and unique missions in-between. Not slowly walk around trying to not wake invisible monsters, while stacking a pyramid of supplies on back. Who wants to waste their free time doing that?"
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"I swear this Death Stranding game looks so stupid. The pretentious fan base of Kojima never fails to surprise me. Has this been designed by any other developer, the hype wouldn’t even exist."
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,this game looks so bad
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Rule of Kojima. 

10 hours of actual gameplay. 20 hours of cutscenes. 

""Great game"". 

The sole exception is MS1 and MGS3. I'd say it's probably close to 50/50 with gameplay/cutscene ratio."
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,Not sure why there is any hype around this game. It looks boring as shit
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,This is set to be the biggest bust of the year.
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,No wonder Konami fired Kojima

ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,DayZ is a better walking simulator
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I have no hype for death stranding, but then again I've never played a single kojima game so I'm not the target audience."

ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"This reminds me of a machine learning assignment where we had to get a neural network or something to get a walker across a map. The walker was essentially a box with two legs, if I remember correctly. The idea was for the AI to try a bunch of different inputs until it managed to figure out how to wiggle those legs to the other side.

I didn't manage to finish the assignment, before anyone asks me follow-up questions."

ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I actually figured it out my senior year of high school. I had lots of computer classes and I would zoom through my assignments and then jump onto QWOP ASAP. 

I could finish the race about half the time. But then they had hurdles and fuck that. Its impossible I'm pretty sure."

ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,There’s a method that works fairly well which was to flip flop between pressing the Q and the P simultaneously and then the W and the O simultaneously (it may be the QO and the WP but pretty sure the former) that if you bounced between the two key presses it let you run fairly easily.

ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"Let me tell you kids, back in my day, we had it so rough... or so much better, i can't tell anymore. anyway, every day, we would wake up at 2 in the morning and go to the table for breakfast. we all lived in a closet, you see, so it was one room. and we would ask, me and my 64 brothers and 27 sisters, ""what's for breakfast mum?"". she would smack us all with a shoe and say ""cold beans"". and if we complained and said ""but we had cold beans yesterday"" - because we had cold beans every day - she would smack us all five times with a shoe and say ""tough its all we can afford. i'm trying to feed a family of 93 with just half a silver buckington"", a silver buckington was about the same as half a penny back in the day. then we would head to school. we met up with the johnson kids from down the road, and walked the 1674 miles to school. on the way to school, we had to walk up a mountain so tall it extended to outer space. when we got to the top of the mountain, we would see the peterson boys on their fancy bikes - which they dont make like they used to, and we would race them down the mountain. then, when we got to school at 4 in the morning, the headmaster would come up to us and say ""you bloody kids are late"", then he would smack us all with the cane 10 times and tell us we had 7 years of detention. then, we went to class, and mr stevenson would say ""ok line up kids"", then he would spank us each 60 times, then hit us each with the cane 40 times each. then it was 7 at night and we had to walk home. then, when we got home, we'd ask ""whats for dinner mum?"", and she'd smack us each 50 times with a pan and say ""rotten cabage"". and if we complained, she would smack us each 100 times with a broom and say ""im trying to feed a family of 154 on just one islet sliver, just you wait until your dad gets home"" - now an islet silver was worth about as much as a grain of sand. then, when our dad got home from his job at the soot factory, he would hit us all 180 times with his belt. if we had been naughty, we would hit us all another 600 times. then, at 1:58, mum would say ""ok time for bed"". then, we got into our potato sacks, and she would hit us each with a shoe 8 times before we went to sleep. on saturdays, we went down to uncle bob's farm to work. we would have to walk 345 miles to the bus stop, then catch the route 4 bus for 56 stops. we would get on the bus and pay our fare of 3 teddy roses - now a teddy rose is worth about the same as a flake of skin. then, if the ticket inspector came to us, he would hit us all 4 times with his baton. if any of us had lost our ticket, we would hit us all 10 times again and throw us off the bus and we had to walk the rest of the way. when we got to the farm, uncle bob would drive to the gate in his tractor, hit us all 780 times with his crowbar, and tell us to get in his trailer so he could drive us to the farm house. then, we had to plow the fields with a toothbrush in the blazing summer heat - now, they dont make summers like they used to, so it was about 1345.4 degrees spencer, or 67 degrees centigrade using your new-fangled metric system. then, we would have to milk the cows - now, they dont make cows like they used to, so each cow weighed about 459 hog's heads, or 3.2 tonnes in your new-fangled metric system. if you touched a cows udder, it would kick you and you would die, so you had to be really careful when you milked the cows. then, when we were done, uncle bob would say ""ok kids time for your pocket money"". he would give us each 9 copper jemimahs - which are worth about one political promise each - and beat us each 6 times with his tractor before we left. on sundays, we would meet the johnson boys and go down to the river - now, they don't make rivers like they used to, so this river was about as wide as the whole of america, and as deep as the marianas trench, and it was filled with liquid tungsten. we would play by the old oak tree near the river, climbing on it and building tree houses and such. now - they don't make trees like they used to, so this tree had a trunk as thick as a city, and was tall enough that the branches on the top could scrape the moon. one day, little jimmy fell from the top of the tree. when he hit the ground, the only bit of his body we could recognise was his left eyeball. we picked up all his bits and rushed him to the doctors surgery. dr james said ""oh its just a scratch little jimmy dont worry pop a plaster on it and you'll be right"" and he gave little jimmy a plaster and a lollipop and he was ok. after we finished playing by the river, we would go into town and get some candy. now, back in the day, you could give the shopkeeper one bronze winglet - which is worth about as much as a ciggarette butt - and he would give you the entire stock of the store. so we would go and get our candy, and we'd go into the town square and eat it. now, we didn't have any of your fancy food laws back in the day, so there was all kinds of stuff in our candy. bleach, rust, bones--you name it. so we would always get a little hyper after our candy. one day, when we were hyper, we went up the mr boris's car, the only car in the town, and touched it. as we touched it, we saw dad storming down the street holding his belt. ""you kids, having fun while i work all day in the soot factory just so you can have grilled water for tea every night, i oughta smack you all"". we were sure he was going to smack us, but then he said ""no, i got a better idea, ill take you to see mr henderson, he'll set ya right"". now, dad had told us about mr henderson. mr henderson was a veteran from the great war, where he got a really bad injury, but we never knew what it was. dad walked us all down to the pub, and we saw a left testicle propped up on a pegleg. ""mr henderson,"" said dad, ""i have some kids here who need a good whooping"". then, mr henderson picked up the entire pub, and hit us each 4006 times with it. then, dad said ""right, i gotta go back to the soot factory, you kids run on home now"". now, by now it was 1pm, which meant it was curfew. while we were walking out of the town square, we heard a man shout ""oi you bloody kids, its curfew"". we turned around and saw the constable holding his baton. he hit us each 160265 times with his baton, then put us in gaol for 60123865 years. now - they don't make gaols like they used to - this one had 5 mile thick steel walls, and a single hole in the top let in some light. we were in there for about 13526 years, until mum baked the constable some cardboard pie so he would let us out. then, she hit us all 1292 times with a washboard, and grounded us for the rest of our lives. so don't you come complaining to me about nonsense like not having tv while hiking 25 miles to school."

ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Hideo Kojima and Guillermo del Toro teamed up to make a Silent Hill game.  They created [this test concept video for it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVylTfkDP5c)  Kojima then created a test game off of that, which is the [infamous PT demo/game.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbDkQPxlmac).  One of the secrets, which you see at the end of PT, is that Norman Reedus was going to work with them on the new Silent Hill, fresh off his fame resurgence from Walking Dead (this is when WD was in it's prime).

At some point this new Silent Hill game got cancelled and Kojima's working relationship with Konami was terminated.  Reedus, Kojima, and, to a lesser extent, del Toro still wanted to create something.  That creation became Death Stranding."

ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Lots of reviews out there if you're curious. Simple version is it's a game where the primary gameplay loop is traveling cross-country with supplies/packages, in order to connect disparate human settlements into a network/society. There's a lot more complexity to the movement system (balancing your load, building ladders/bridges, etc) than you get in most games."
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I've heard it has to do with whales beaching themselves. Maybe it's an alternate way to say ""beaching"""
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,">What even is Death Stranding? Sorry for sounding dumb I just want to know.

Imagine the movie ""The Postman,"" with a mailman trying to deliver stuff in a post-apocalyptic (but still high tech setting)...and there are Mad Max bandits and supernatural Lovecraftian creatures trying to kill you.

""It is set in a post-apocalyptic and neo-Western version of the United States...story of a nomadic drifter (Costner) who stumbles across the uniform of an old United States Postal Service mail carrier, and unwittingly inspires hope through an empty promise of a ""Restored United States of America.""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Postman_(film)"
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,The Death Stranding is some sort of extinction event where people’s souls can’t quite cross over to the other side afaik
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Just a guess but the strands are the ties between you playing in sp mode but also seeing elements of what other folk are doing in their game. So if you go build a road, a strand of that might appear for another player in the same location in their game. If they contribute to the building of the road, it will appear in their game too. Your game world will change over time based on the behavior or strands of other players parallel to you."
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,It’s a cool game. It’s not going to be for everyone and was never going to live up to Metal Gear Solid (same guy made both games). This game wasn’t made for the masses and is a fun quirky game for those who enjoy that type of game.
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"The games core gameplay loop is building a loadout for your given delivery, cross varrying terrain to deliver package. All the while dealing with Enemy Militia, Supernatural Monsters, and some large scale boss fights. All the items you use, are actually left on the map. Meaning that other players can find and use that gear.

Drop a ladder to help get up a cliff? That ladder will be there for future players.

The main appeal is the act of building the perfect loadout for the job. 

Have to run through a series of mountains? Be sure to use a gyro stabilizer exosuit, bring light gear, bring ropes, ladders ect...

Lots of flatland or roads? There will be Militia on the roads. So you could build super light and go for full stealth, build tanky with battle gear and weapons, or bring vehicles to rush past them.

Meanwhile, things could be vastly different then you expect. You could go through a mountainous area but there is a Millitia base that was not known, or you get ambushed by the Ghost monsters, or equipment could fail.

So yeah, the game is really just"
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"It's both a game and an apocalyptic event in said game that jump starts the plot. The game is made by Hideo Kojima, a videogame auteur, after his departure from Konami and, by extension, his most know work, the Metal Gear franchise. 

As with any auteur-work, you might find this game incredible or thrash, so YMMV.

EDIT: even to event."

ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"The people who are most upset about Death Stranding are often huge Kojima fans. So maybe he was expecting MGS:Again but got Kojima: Unleashed and decided that he didn't like it - and let's be realistic here, it's 2019 - you can understand a game pretty well just by reading and watching about it.

Meanwhile, as someone who isn't a Kojima fan (though I did play and enjoy the MGS games), Death Stranding is about what I expected. I have no problem with it because I sort of anticipated it would be like this. If I had different expectations and they were high, I might be very upset."
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"By how many posts I've seen on the front page about a game that hasn't come out yet, I'm starting to wonder if this is some paid shit by Konami to shit on Kojima because it makes no sense to see so many posts shitting on a game only a handful of people have played."
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"Just curious, why do you care that someone is expressing their opinion? Your whole argument boils down to “reviews aren’t valid to use to form an opinion about something” which is ridic. 

Let the person shit on what they want to shit on."
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I was on the fence leaning toward not getting it even as a massive Kojima fan until I saw SkillUp's review and idk, the way he put it kind of changed my perspective in a big way and my expectations overall and I'm honestly excited as hell now to play it"
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"It’s funny because every single complaint from almost every YouTuber has come true for this game. People made fun of the game for being similar to a “walking simulator”, and that’s EXACTLY what this game turned out to be."
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I think Metal Gear Survive already put the nail into the “fuck you Konami” coffin. 

 Also, and I’ll probably get downvoted for this, but I understand the start of that conflict. I don’t agree with what happened, and how Konami acted like fucking dickheads at the end of it, but I understand why they started it. Let’s face facts here, Kojima was sucking up funds like no tomorrow and wasn’t producing jack shit to show for it. If I was a businessman I’d be pissed too, and I think we’d all quickly hit a point of “all right you’ve had enough time and money, make a product.” 
 Still though what came after that was a whole other level of assholery."

ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,It should only make you balance like that if you go over your weight limit or try running off a cliff
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"it seems to be a game far more about the experience than anything, like Journey. Its super big on the asynchronous multiplayer, in that you'll find shit left behind by other players which can help out enormously, and you'll feel a sense of connection with this complete stranger as you periodically find other stuff they may have left in the world hours later. And the community as a whole needs to work together to build some of the bigger and more expensive projects like paved highways and large bridges because its unrealistic for one player to have nearly enough resources alone. This all has to happen without any actual communication, but it just sort of happens naturally if someone starts a project in a useful spot"
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Right? The interest slowly became frustration
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,reviews are in bud

ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I love Jim Carry in his serious roles like ESOTSM (I didn't wanna spell it all out) but his comedy style is just too much for me. I like my humor not as forward and strong. The Cable Guy was a perfect film for him because it let's his humor style add to the weirdness of his character.
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,It's a Hideo Kojima game. That's pretty much it.
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"Hideo Kojima the creator of the metal gear series, infamously off the wall, possibly insane creative director/writer who was often at odds with and eventually fired by the execs at konami for not reigning it in a bit, has just started his own games company. This is his companies first game, a game where kojima had absolute creative control and no leash or execs breathing down his neck. This is the first time we're witnessing what ""peak kojima"" looks like, and I for one am waiting with baited breath."
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"1. Kojima.
2. Supposedly new experience that's quite different from similar games.
3. Kojima."
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,What? When? Idk where people get the idea that not being able to patch meant games were more polished. It didn't and because of it a ton of games launched with game breaking bugs.
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I know I'm going to be downvoted for saying this but so is Death Stranding.

ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,What? It's not a walking simulator in the least. The goal is to protect your package as you deliver it to cities. There are ghosts and whatnot to be careful around or fight.
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Walking Simulator is a term used to describe games like Dear Ester and Everyone Has Gone To The Rapture and Gone Home because there was little game mechanic or substance beyond the actual basic movement of forward/backwards/left/right.

This game is more like a true Hiking Simulator, but it has many mechanics and aspects beyond movement, including an inventory management system, vehicles, combat, and a story with many well-produced cutscenes. All of which the traditionally-labeled ""walking simulator"" genre games didn't have.

I guess what I'm saying is:

Walking Simulator = nothing to do but move through the game space. There's no combat, no inventory management, no vehicles, and no cutscenes.

Hiking Simulator ™ = Hiking and traversal are the backbone of the rest of the gameplay mechanics which include inventory management, combat, vehicles, and it's all tied together with many cutscenes."

I don't remember my exact numbers, but after ~1000-3000 generations the neural net was capable of learning how to walk pretty effectively! 

The cool part was re-running it with a different random seed, and seeing a completely different walking method. Sometimes it would scoot across the ground, other runs it would do little hops, sometimes it would even walk normally haha!"

Yeah, I don't think this guy's first interest is honest and objective reviewing. Probably thought Last of Us was a walking simulator as well.

I generally like Kojimas stuff, but he's also pretty fully of himself if left unchecked. Like, just look at how insanely stupid and ridiculous the whole MGS story arc is. It's a convoluted mess. Fun game, garbage story boarding. 

And everyone was hyping the living fuck out of Death Stranding. Meanwhile in reality, it's such a divided reception."

And don’t get me wrong I’m glad we got Phantom Pain from it too, it’s an amazing game, but also consider that even after all the time that was put into Phantom Pain we still got that very controversial, and in my opinion lackluster, ending.

I personally never really enjoyed his games despite playing most of the MGSs (janky controls, terrible acronyms, worse dialogue, pseudo philosophical nonsense, imo) and won’t pick this up until it’s got a deep discount or when it’s free on PS+"

ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Any final exam worth the bare or vast majority of a grade better be both relatively easy in some subjects and relatively difficult in others, so that the grade and work put in is fair. That way it isn't easy to tank the course with a D or C- (or C to C+ depending on your standards), nor would it be easy to make it a bird course and score a quick A+. 

But tbh, an exam worth a few hours' of actual testing, requiring the prior work of the material building up to it (i.e. mid-terms, quizzes, labs, regular project/problem assignments, literature review papers, etc.) should never be worth so much. Whatever studying you do is for those build-up tasks, and it takes daily work compounded over the weeks making up a subject and months making up a whole course, and to put so little weight on the collective course work just to risk it all on a final... Real jobs aren't like that. Academic papers (published research) are like that, but *those* require **months** of work, if not years.

ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"There is much more to it. The surface level explanation / elevator pitch of the game leaves out alot that players might enjoy. Not trying to say the game is for everyone though... From what I gather the begining of the game is intentionally boring to highlight the sense of loneliness and human need for connections and validation. You are encouraged to avoid killing enemies because life and death in this universe has kind of merged. When someone is killed it causes catastrophic terrain deforming craters that make the game world harder to travel through. When the player is ""killed"" the game still continues and you need to get back to the world of the living in order to continue your journey. There are also things like boss battles, connected online social features, and building mechanics as you work to rebuild America's infrastructure to unite everyone again. It's very much a commentary on social media, and humans need for connection and praise from their peers."

ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Yes, you collect your body waste and combine it with your blood to make weapons that are effective against the BT's or Beached Things. But that's more of an extra thing on top of the travel system. The main mechanic is indeed cargo management and walking, the intention seems to be to actually put you in the place of a guy who makes deliveries. Although, toward the middle of the game you can make roads and bridges, and through the online you can encounter the roads bridges and ropes other people have established, and that allows you to use cars and motorcycles."
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Yes. There are enemy outposts and stealth sections. Be warned though that combat is de-emphasized and mostly non-lethal by design choice. It's definitely not a game for everyone.
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Yes. There are combat and stealth mechanics against human and supernatural enemies, both in the physical world and Hades."
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Yes you fight the BTs you built bridges, zip lines, power charging stations, yadda yadda. Once you build this stuff other people can use it to help deliver their goods too. It’s a big collaborating together, alone thing"
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Yep. There are guns and other non-lethal weapons to use. You also have melee. Traversing the environment is still the main thing though.

That being said, keep in mind we've only seen stuff from the first 3 chapters of the game. There are 10+ chapters IIRC. I also suspect there are further mechanics we have yet to see regarding the strand system."

IGN, who gave it a 6.5/10, and another from a nine credible source which game it a 3. You send me a link to 9 “credible” sources (in relation to your 90% of reviewers) which say its “basically a walking sim”, and I’ll send you $100.

ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"If deliveries main goal is to survive the wilds against bandits, ghosts, and whatnot. Yes"
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"I haven't looked into the whole ordeal, but from the bits I know Kojima's main fuck up was wanting such big names brought in to do voice work. Robert Atkins Downes probably took an unnecessary amount of money to deliver his performance as Kaz. Keifer Sutherland doing Snake seemed kind of like a pig headed choice even. His western fans and audience had an established fan favorite name attached to Snake as a voice. David Hayter was the only person most people wanted and he probably costs a fraction of the price. I'd imagine just those two names inflated the budget by some millions that could of went towards delivering a third playable area. 

That is about all I felt the game fell short on as well. It needed a few more hours of cutscenes, the second part of the game didn't need to force you to replay missions to pad the game out, Ground Zeroes should of been on the disc from the get go, some of the side missions (like with Paz... I still listen to the acoustic Love Deterrence when I have the blues) should of been mandatory, and one more playable area other than Afghanistan and Africa would of made the game feel complete to me. 

According to a quick Wiki/Google check TPP moved three million opening week. The game sold Ground Zeroes separate as well, and it had microtransactions online. It had to of made its money back and then some. I'm not saying Kojima was without fault, but I think he delivered on that project at the end of the day. Konami publicly giving him the finger on the way out probably cost them more money than it was worth in bad publicity."
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"it's not a ""simulator"" of any kind. That's a specific genre. This is an action adventure game.  It simply favors traversal mechanics over combat ones."

ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"It’s not even really trying. It’s “trying” in a metaphorical sense that’s really only good for making easy to understand analogies as far as I understand. 

Melanie Mitchell was recently on Mindscape discussing the history of machine learning with Sean Carrol and I thought they did a pretty good job of breaking the differences down.

ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I've definitely seen this on Reddit.  I'm not sure it was a game, I think it was just someone showing off the progress the thing walking had made and how many surprises and obstacles it could avoid.

But also I think there was one where a stick figure dude runs through an environment jumping and dodging and running and then a dragon eats him?  Maybe I need more drugs in my life, I'm not sure."
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Probably not the one you meant, since it's not really a game, but [Framsticks](http://www.framsticks.com/) is pretty cool if you're interested in setting up your own evolution experiments."
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Yep! I don't remember the technical name for it, but there's a method of evolutionary algorithms that uses several ""individuals"" and does ""sexual reproduction"" where you basically create a child from two parents and randomly pick mother/father values for each node in the net."

ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,just like in those DS speed runs where they take a specific amount of fall damage to proc their items damage (more damage on low health)
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Like redlining in Mario Kart 64
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Power jog
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Yeah, each Mages Guild chapter specialized in a different school of magic. That chapter focused on alteration, so the (assumed) solution was to cast a feather spell, allowing you to swim to the surface. It may have been possible to do it if you just had a crazy high strength though, I'm not positive."
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"The easiest way was to drop the ring them pick it up in the world, like in Skyrim when you drop a bucket on an NPCs head, carry it over to the ladder up, pick it up and climb the ladder out of the well, drop it again to carry it to the mages guild door, pick it up to go through... Etc etc until you get to the guy you gotta give it to."
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"They handle it differently than you're probably expecting. You're basically an amazon delivery person. Before you leave to deliver what you're supposed to, you have to arrange the items in your bag so they're balanced correctly, and since the world isn't completely fat or because people naturally get tired, you have to readjust yourself so you don't fall and break something you're carrying.

This game is meant to be on a much more focused scale compared to something like skyrim. They want people to be more focused on the environment, pay more attention to your character, and really just live the live in the game. Not teleport from one town to another so they can go kill a troll a bit faster. It's more about the experience.

But to each their own. Some people like story driven games they can delve into and be surrounded by, other people like games they can hop into and kill a bunch of things for an hour."
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"Do you remember all the people thrashing Breath of the Wild's score because you literally couldn't climb when it was raining? Nothing but bullshit and aggravation. Especially early in the game, you pretty much had to stand around and wait for the rain to go away in order to get to where you needed to go.

Still one of the best rated games of all time."
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Because it involves a new element of risk management rather than the game making the decision for you.
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"It's meant to be a punishment for carrying more than your stats allow. On top of that, it even gives you the same option for a solution, drop stuff until it's better."
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"The games core mechanics are about carrying packages. The gameplay loop is trying to maximize carrying packages quickly and safely, choosing to either go the reckless paths for speed and chances of stumbling or the safer and slower routes. It’s not everyone’s cup of tea, but there’s a game about being a piece of bread so what do I know."
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Pioneers used to ride those babies for miles apparently. Next time instead of hopping over, hop on."

ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,So you fight the spooky ghosts by peeing on them?
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Seems to be a slow pace exploration type game where the main goal for the player is to learn about what has happened (since the game does not explain much to the player) all while accomplishing your characters goal of making deliveries and connecting the cities together.
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"To be fair, making poop bombs is the only interesting thing i’ve seen about this game"
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Idk why people in this post are shitting on the game, it looks and sounds pretty good to me. Delivering packages through a post apocalyptic world while avoiding/defending against eldritch beings sounds badass"

ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"Easiest way I've found to do it without magic/strength is to 'grab' it, carry it physically across the area, walk it back to the door, then take it into your inventory (only then do you become encumbered by it) and use the exit."

ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,It’s not fun if the Army makes you do it.
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I used to do it because you burn a shit ton of calories.
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,Lol yep. The reward is seeing cool shit that not many people get to see plus being out in the middle of nowhere away from all those goddamned people.
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"Many reviewers are. The reward systems for deliveries, likes, and thank you's from online players are apparently not-so-subtle nods to the same feel-good mechanics we see in everyday social media."
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,If that excites you then you should look into postal. But it's a bit.. controversial. The game was banned in many countries.
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"And you can use a cat as a silencer.

ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,You package your pee and poo as grenades to use against the weird otherworldly enemies in this game.
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"No, yeah, you really do collect your waste and you have to manually go to the bathroom to do so I think. That being said, it's just what I've heard in reviews and articles, I have not played the game."
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Turns out he was being fecetious...
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Wasn't journey like 15$? Yeah 25% of the price could make this worth it.
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"A lot of walking throughout the whole game, you get those mechanics to make things easier, but when you have to traverse mountains you have to walk."
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,I think it's more like grenades
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,Even if I end up hating it I’m still happy to have bought it. I really think it’s important for people like Kojima to be able to make these types of games that are different and risky. I’m happy to support it in hopes more people can make their wired dream games for us to enjoy. That said I think it looks really fun and interesting
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"Yeah reddit is weird with the stuff the hivemind tends to fixate on. I'll never understand it. 

Never mind the fact that I guarantee none of the idiots spouting off here in the comments have even played the damn game yet. It's not out until the 8th, how did every Joe-nobody on reddit seem to get an early copy?"
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Huh?
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,So you're saying that this game is a better version of Paperboy? Well I'm sold.

ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,But why male models?
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"I think it's the professor and the fact that it's an online degree. My other professor is great but this one is obviously phoning it in. She will not be getting a good evaluation from me.

And I totally agree! That's why I chose online school damn it."
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Sounds like my kind of game!

ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"Lol yeah. Read the books when I was makin this acct and I loved them, so why not."
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,So it should please your concept of fun?
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"From what I got of this game, I dunno if your goal is really to mess with baddies much at all. More about legit being someone in a more post apocalyptic world, trying to connect people. You're not meant to be a badass fighting people left and right, if you were they'd treat your equipment load more like other games and have you be slowed or just ignore it altogether. But here you're just some random dude walking over rocks with crap strapped to your back.

It isn't meant to be ""fun,"" same as you probably wouldn't enjoy bein in a cardboard box on the streets like some homeless people. It's meant to resonate with a person and show you their struggles, even how they have to be careful walking over uneven ground with 50lbs throwing them around from behind.

Again tho, this is all my opinion on the ""intention"" behind the game, and I don't know much past reading some reviews."
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,You don't have to be carrying shit around all the time. If you want to load up with your weapons and wreck some people for a while there's nothing stopping you.
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,You can? There's a lot of video games out there.
ds45e3,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,That's a very reasonable response. Disagreements don't always have to be settled.

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,"So Quiet poses for you if you do the same to her but Reedus punches you in the face?

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,What kind of grown man shuts his hands in legs  when he detects someone looking at his crotch? He's like an anime schoolgirl.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,No don’t do it I’m a virgin
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,This is the only game I’ve seen where the more they show off the less I understand about it
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,So basically me everytime I'm in the guy's bathroom simulator?
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,When my wife gets this game I know for sure she will get punched in the face more than once

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,Will do even without the incentive of being punched.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"I wonder if they will program a reaction for staring at Mads Mikkelson, because you can bet I will be checking him out lol. 90% of the reason I am excited for this game."

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Thank god they gave Kojima infinite money to make this blessed game
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,It's things like this that make Hideo Kojima the goat of video game developers.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"This game looks fucking stupid.


Can’t wait to day one it"
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15, Willing to bet that was Norman’s idea

There was a girl on the other side wearing yoga pants. Despite being dark and literally nothing being visible, she clapped her legs closed in this exact manner. 

Long story short, Kojima thinks men react to crotch stare like a timid girl in yoga pants"
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,"This looks like the most comprehensive, detailed game that i have zero interest in playing.

Nothing i've seen so far say 'this game is fun'."

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,How did you find this out bro
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,"Death Stranding is when Kojima has full creative control with no sane person or executive telling him ""you know, somewhere in this product there actually has to be a fun game to play""."

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,So is this game out yet? How do we know all this?
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,This game is gonna turn out to be a huge flop and kojima’s “artistic ability” will be exposed as he has no clue what he’s doing anymore.

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-18,Yet he makes a game where there's an uncomfortable as fuck 5 min scene with a girl splashing in the rain in a thong? Japan's gonna Japan I guess.

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,So did kojima just put in enough little things to distract from the fact that there is no gameplay?
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,Good stuff. We need more of that.

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,"I feel that everything you do in this game theres a scripted scene. ""In Death Stranding, if you look at the wall too much, you will bash your fucking head on it""."

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,Typical Kojima.

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Still going to say either this game will be genius or the worst fucking game ever made ...biggest gamble I've ever seen in gaming
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Soo.. showing Easter egg before the game even out is a thing now?

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,He's clearly insecure about his tiny package
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,So the opposite of neir automata's kick to the face.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Tf is this game?
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"yeah, great! thanx for spoilering, you moron."

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,There will be a trophy for this...
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,It came out?
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Big pp
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Neir:Automata has an achievement for looking up 2B's skirt.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Nice
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,How did you find this footage? Where is it from?
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,That arm extension doesnt feel like
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Its out?
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,So cool to see normen reedus in a video game
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,does anybody still know what this game is about?
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"Daryl from walking dead, is all I see."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,He should have just given the camera a quick punch/slap while it was looking. This dips into comedy.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Anyone else think he looks like Daryl from The Walking Dead?
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Norman Reedus might be the most meta weirdo cypher in history.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Kojima why
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Well - I know the first thing I'm doing now.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,I never see this anywhere but nobody gonna talk how much resemblance the main character with a The Walking Dead character? (Norman Reedus)
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"Hideo loves putting little sexual innuendos in his games Metal Gears was no different, I'm guessing there will be a good amount of Easter eggs."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,This is part of somebody's erotic fantasy.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,This reminds me or Resident Evil 4 when you look up at Ashley's panties.  lmfao
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,This game is out?
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"This game is one big meme. Monster energy. Kojimas whole lore is just memes, like how Big Boss invented Doritos (and corn chips as a whole) and Mtn Dew."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Lol I’m so lost with this game
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Classic Kojima
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"I know this is just a joke post but on a serious note for a second, imagine how long this took to get captured and coded into the game. Let alone with texturing and all the rest of the game creator stuff. I feel like this game is just gonna be filled with random things like this but he game itself is gonna make little to no sense and be boring to play. I love metal gear. But I think it’s all starting to go to Hideo’s head tbh"
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,That's a very Kojima detail
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Worth it!
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Such as big boss ting
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Reminds me of Resident Evil 4 when you tried to have a peek under the skirt.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"Ok, what in the FUCK is this game?"
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,This game looks amazing and I want it now

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,This might be the best news I've heard all day.

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,It's so weird seeing norman reedus animated after seeing in in twd
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Ahahhah great
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Nice to see they knew what Norman's fans would do and put that in.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Yeah and when did he do this with Silent?
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Isn’t the release date of this game in November? Can someone explain please?
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Where is all this footage coming from?  Is there a demo or something?
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"Buy this game, amiright?"
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,My how the table has turned
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,What game is this from
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"What is the context of all the fourth wall breaks in the video they showed

Is it like a literal camera floating around Sam and he's under surveillance or something?"
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Darrel?
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Reminds me of Nier Automata where 2B shoves the camera away if you stare at her ass.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,This game is going to be a disappointment
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"Wait, this is out now?"
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,I love all this cute stuff when norman

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,I envy a person who thinks this is what getting punched in the face is like.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Ahh the old MGS1 switcharoo.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"I still can't understand that people don't know what kinda of game this is. It's Kojima's take on Breath of the Wild, there's a story to the game but the *game* is exploring the world and experimenting with how you can interact with it."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Willing to bet that’s a trophy when the game comes out
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Is that Daryl?
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Is Norman Reedus okay?
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Thanks cause I would never ever see that one.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,why does he grab ur face so nicely before punching u
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Haha
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,That flaw-ful jump between animations
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"Ah I need to check this by myself now 
Need to preorder"
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Tf is this gwme
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,I have a feeling this will result in a laugh
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"As long as I don't have to sit through 60 mins of video before being able to play the game. I'm looking at you MGS4. Fuck I hate that game. Game play was fine, but those damn long videos."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Surprised Quite didn’t just put a bullet in everyone’s head then lol
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Justice!
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Right in the fourth wall..
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Is this just Easter Egg: The Game?
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,This games is looking as the weirdest game I've seen in a long time.... not counting does Japanese hentai weird games :V
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Rada rada
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,It's kind of like Nier Automata if you know what it is.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Aw the shy little leg squeeze poor buddy
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,I like how his hands grew a little before the punch
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15, Omg the programmer wins lol
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Hold up is it out!?
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,I will definitely try on this once I got the game.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,I didnt even realise it was out yet XD! Da fuq

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,That's awesome
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,any chance for this game to release on PC or not?
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,i see this being used for a lot of memes
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-16,Summit? Is that you
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-17,I'm so glad that games now have more self-aware ai's because even perverts won't get away unnoticed.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-19,good.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,One game I won't be buying or playing.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"Fuck this game, looks boring as fuck"
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,But when it’s done in lollipop chainsaw it’s fitishist and creepy.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,Man I'm so glad we know this but not any actual details about the game.....
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,So is this a video game with linear gameplay/story or is it a dynamic story with video game elements like Detroit become human
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,He most have been so proud of this. I wish he would have left it for the pervy games to discover.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,I like how it’s so scripted that you can see it change to the animation
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,I hear there’s a game somewhere in all this?
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"In Metal gear solid on psx, when u look at Meryl too long then she starts blushing. It's kind of the same setup but with the opposite result. Typical Hideo. Sad to say it's not even that original. I hope the game isn't all old ideas"
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Do people still like Kojima?
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,That chin grab is just sexy imo
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Oh hi Daryl from TWD
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Quiet didn't punch you when you watched her boobs jiggle.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Just me or do these animations look bad for that big of a game?
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"Well, I dont play these games but when I saw this I immediately thought that these games do everything they can to make a heroine sexy as fuck, so you stare, drool and fantasize over her, but dont you dare do that to a guy. Pretty lame-ass thinking by the developers."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,In b4 a bunch of fake outrage addicted losers say this is homophobic or some stupid shit.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,How did u discover that?
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,How someone discovered this...

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,I’m worried for whoever found this out

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,How did you find this out? 🤔🤔
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Love how games are incorporating how not to be a creep in its' gaming experience.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Things gamers care about in 2019... horse testicles and norman reedus's junk
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,So women are just supposed to put up with guys gawking at them but guys are allowed to commit assault when gawked?
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,Guess I won't be buying that game then...
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,How do you know this
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,I guess we are all going to upvote this blatant marketing attempt
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"Punch in the face, I can see that.  But when he tries to cover it up first like a school child..  Not in character for a hardcore dude."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"Hideo Kojima thought Quiet was a good idea, and then implements this. That's pretty damn hypocritical."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,Console exclusive. Lame.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,Ok can we remember how RDR2 had all this stupid bullshit like horse testicles that changed size? It wasn't good in that game and it wont be good in this one.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,Wouldn't be the [first time](https://youtu.be/LBPbJ9VW8Zw) something like this happens when you try to get curious
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,I wonder of people think this is anti gay
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Homophobic

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,What made you want to test this ;)
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,anyone else worried that these meme mechanics is all there is to the game? Like how much gameplay have we seen outside of walking near slendermen ghost people and amazon delivery runs?
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Wonder how you figured this out.. weird ass
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,that guy is in the walking dead
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"Supposed to say ""no homo"" first"
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,What if a female is playing it ? 🤨
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"Violence against women and gay men, yay. Japan is so refined."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,"Makes me think that the whole thing about showing gameplay that doesn't convince at all to players is just a strategie to make people talk about the game, it doesn't matter if it's about bad things, just need people to spread the info about a very weird game called death stranding, I think that the core of the game and main gameplay would be reserved for reviews, obviously a suposition, I dont think that the guy behind the gameplay of metal gear 5 could only give us a walking simulator, besides, he needs to show konami the terrible mistake they've done by firing him and take his sweet revenge."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,So.. We gonna have to talk about how you found out about this?
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Why were you zooming on a cartoon video game character’s crotch long enough to figure this out?
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,Nothing like a little gay bashing for casual entertainment.

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,There is a 1hr long gameplay session from TGS2019 on YouTube. They show off a TON of stuff. Really solidifies what the game is about.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,It's a UPS delivery and walking simulator.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"Top two replies to this comment are referencing Portal 2 and Nier Automata. Those are the video gamest video games of all the video games. Even before they were released, we had tons of footage and knew exactly what the game was gonna be about.

So far everything we've seen out of Death Stranding is... very very little. Especially in terms of gameplay and story. I'm gonna get it, but I'm totally prepared to be disappointed. Everything so far looks like Kojima is getting high off is own farts."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,That's what I'm saying. Everyone is all excited but we have no idea what the game is even like.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"No one will believe me but like a year or two ago, Sony jn San Mateo was doing game tests and it was actually a classified death stranding game test and review. They wanted opinions on the intro ( introduces main character and game mechanics), and some campaign missions where you are delivering packages. There would be areas with alot of rocks and if you ran into it barely and clipped it you would fall so easily it was really annoying. Those black things that change your surrounding and chase you were honestly terrifying there was no clear instructions how to deal with them other than running and dying lmao. I dont remember every detail but all i know after the game test was that im not pre ordering this game until final gameplay footage is out..Believe me or downvote me but its not like i can give u my personal info, sony will track me down probably."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,You can also climb ladders and deliver Amazon packages
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Apparently the character will also move if you try to look at his front side when he's peeing.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,It looks like an artsy game with lots of random stuff. Better not get into expecting gameplay like your usual games.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,"Bro, LADDERS.

Revolutionary, ladder gameplay.

Calling it."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,Right? I still have no idea what the gameplay will be. Just walking across the country?
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,"Bro, there was a 1 hour long gameplay demo released 2 days ago. The gameplay is MGSV meets Journey."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,I mean you could just watch the 50 minutes of gameplay they released
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,"Much like Mario Party, the mechanics will be numerous and fun yet success seems random and winning oddly difficult."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,Apparently but if it is then it’ll be the most boring game on the planet. We’re yet to get a decent indicator of plot or any real gameplay.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,Well you can preorder it and get a bunch of gold armor and clothes.... that counts right? /s
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,Just don’t play it..... please

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"From what I understand...

After some paranormal disaster has devastated humanity and separated people across the US, a former soldier-turned-courier is asked by the dying President to try and reconnect the survivors of the apocalypse by delivering aid to different cities and outposts, also helping re-establish the internet.

Standing in his way are ""Beached Things"" or B.T.s, a parasite that exists in between the worlds of the living and the dead that can cause devastating explosions when they come across a loving human - ""Voidouts"" - and isolationist terrorists called Homo Demens who are engineering voidouts as terrorist attacks.

He must also rescue his former lover, the President's daughter who was rendered unaging by the disaster and also try and figure out just what *was* the disaster called the Death Stranding and how it messed up the cycle of life and death.

Or, TL;DR - Norman Reedus and his Funky Foetus hike the Appalachian Trail and go ghostbusting for charity."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,"> I still don't know what the fuck this game is about.

Neither does Kojima."

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,Can we talk about the ladders and luggage?
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"Honestly.  It's brilliant marketing.  Because I'm buying this.  Its hiedko kojima whatever...I have no idea how to spell his name from memory for certain but I'm mildly aware of his works.  And,  this has enough punch. 

I'll likely wait a month,  avoid gameplay,  but see if it still goes over well then dive in blind"
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,"That's intentional. Kojima has talked about how this is a type of game genre that doesn't exist. Similar to how he labelled Metal Gear Solid as ""tactical espionage action"" rather than just the generic label of stealth game. He says that playing the game will be an experience. We had the gameplay footage over the weekend but he made it clear via twitter that he would have preferred not to do this. 

I think he is hoping that his name is enough to trust players into taking a chance on buying the game. To be honest, it's enough for me. I haven't watched the gameplay footage because of how much he has emphasised that playing will be an experience. 

I'll check out review summaries before deciding if I'll purchase the game though, but I expect that the game will be well received."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"for a character that hardly speaks you grow quite attached to her. I still get sad thinking about it even though I know none of it is real.

You can get her back but it's kinda like FF7 she was meant to die there and just lugging around her corpse is meh."

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"I'm cool with games being made to appeal to hetero dudes. MGS series always lots to gaze at for me, but in the past the women were always at least bad ass and interesting. The lady bosses in MGS4 were pushing it, but they were so over the top and they were themed with heavy-handed nostaglia so they wete kinda cool.

Quiet is fucking weird. She's just a sex doll. Nothing cool about her. Boring. I don't know how the gaming community can get up in arms over boobie streamers and then be totally cool with weird softcore porn like Quiet.

I think comparing Quiet to past female characters is a great argument for why Hideo Kojima either lost his edge or gets way too much credit for the success of the older MGS games. I don't know how how any one person can go from writing EVA in MGS3 to writinga sex doll like Quiet in MGSV. There had to have been other contributors to MGS1-3 that helped make those games and characters so good that aren't around anymore. When Death Stranding gets released we'll know"

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,If it helps she doesn't die? She just abandons you and Diamond Dogs to ensure the English strain never gets unleashed. It's reasonable to assume she killed herself but much like everything else with that game there's no closure. She's just gone.

If I called the police for assault and the individual was questioned as to WHY he punched me and admitted I was staring at his crotch, that is considered a hate crime if I am gay. It would be judged that way and at the very least it's STILL an assault charge. This shouldn't be in a video game, it's such an odd thing for him to do in the game for zooming in on his groin. This to me is homophobic. You don't have to agree, just stating my point of view. And all you homophobic fucks that downvote me, you can't touch my Karma fuckers."

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,I should finish playing this game.

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,You could stare at Meryls boobs I think then something happens like.she gets mad I think. Someone correct me if I'm wrong. Plus I think you could watch her go to the bathroom in her cell.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,PSOne refers to a specific model of the first Playstation that came out a few years later. In general Playstation is abbreviated PSX or PS1

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,What do you guys have in the pipeline now? Feel like I haven't heard of anything after the new expansion
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"Basically, the character Sam played by Norman Reedus acts as a kind of delivery man for a company called Bridges. By making deliveries he helps create ""Strands"" that reconnect the US. So it's an open world game where you deliver packages to restore the world from the aftermath of a supernatural event called ""The Death Stranding"". You also fight and/or avoid these otherworldly beings called BT's (Beached Things) that have appeared following the Death Stranding."

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,Yes but there is also the spooky shit that will try to kill you and raiders that will try and kill you. It looks like this will have stealth and combat also.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"So you're a Post-Man? Kevin Costner already did that pun. I'm leaning towards that the game is gonna be pretty mediocre. Kojima might be surrounded by boot-lickers and yes-men, because this seems kinda out there without any meaningful content. Hey, before you down-vote; see those phrases *""leaning towards""* and *""might be""*. This not a attack, just an observation."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"the game you just described would be hyped by nobody if it didn't have ""kojima"" in its cover."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,"I'm confused on what issue you have understanding it? Between the briefing trailer and the 50 minute gameplay, I feel like it's been very well explained."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,"Doesn't seem very confusing to me.  Did you guys actually pay any attention during those 49 minutes?  In fact, I didn't even watch half of it, and I still knew enough.  Getting it day one for sure, looks interesting as hell."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Why do you need reviewers to tell you if it’s good or not? Just watch some people play it on twitch when it’s out and decide for yourself.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Everyone knows what Diablo 4 will be.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,You’re joking right? Shit is so vague about both plot and gameplay mechanics.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"Yes, the secrets of public urination"
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Right?  Have we learned nothing from Undertale?
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,So R kelly is just an enthusiastic investigator?
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Yes. This sounds amazing
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"Ok, but none of that really clarifies what the gameplay is like. I watched gameplay and I still don't really understand what the gameplay is somehow lol"
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,sometimes it's more fun to find out the story by playing instead of being spoonfed

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,I watched the Briefing trailer and the hour-long TGS gameplay stream.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"If that's the one I think it is, (where Venom is speaking with Big Boss and mentions no amount of dioxin will get him moving again) I interpreted that as Quiet coming down as some type of angel (or vision) to deliver him to the afterlife. But to each their own."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,That game looks really cool
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,The rain scene but with Norman

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"Yes and also if you're wondering there will also be a lot of action (Boss fight, gunplay, melee combat, fighting skeletons in the past) and also some cool stuff like (time traveling, hover board, motorbike, cars etc) not to mention the amazing typical Kojima cut scenes that you get from time to time, will always give you chills."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,You make it sound like this hasn't been the primary topic of conversation for a year.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,I can see why people would be offended but what if women wanted to look?

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,That getting checked out repeatedly in prison can be a lead up to sexual assault?

A rhythm game boss I spent hours trying to beat. So much frustration I gave up. As an adult I read there was an invisible/silent ""note"" put in at the end. What a huge fuck you. 


I love the man who made that."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"His eccentricity is more due to him not liking being in the spotlight. I think most of his co-workers have quite a positive reception of working with him, and he constantly down values himself while credits those working under his direction."

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"Thats Hideo Kojima for you.

In MGS4 you could make the bosses pose for you in all kinds of ways lol."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"I remember before MG5 came out the media was criticizing Kojima for Quiets outfit being there for just industrialized boner production. Kojima answered that there was a totally sound reason for her outfit to be that skimpy and that people will feel dumb for saying that. There wasn't any reason.

Apparently Quiet uses Photosynthesis, completely ignoring the fact that while Photosynthesis can be possible with nongreen pigments, (for example, some plants use red ones) however that would be way worse efficiency wise and coudn't support a human."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"In the same vein, if she doesn't like you and she catches you staring at her assets, she does something different, like scowling and turning away, I can't quite remember what it is though.

And I mean, the kind of thing in the OP has been in kojima games since the earlier metal gear when people on coms will comment if you're looking at a sexy poster etc."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,"Well, they never really finished making it. Amazing game, but the second half kind of sucks."

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,"Also when you follow Meryl to the bathroom, if you run straight to the last stall where she is without stopping, shes in her underwear for the entire following cutscene."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,"I don’t know about the bathroom thing, but in the PSone version when you first go into the air ducts to rescue the DARPA Chief, you can see into Meryl’s cell and see Meryl working out. If you leave the way you came in and go back, Meryl will be doing a different exercise. If you do it a fourth time she’ll repeat the exercises but in her panties. Why this is a thing, I’ll never know."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,If you kept looking at her she’d blush and make comments. It was also fun to look in first person when she was possessed by Psycho Mantis.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,I think if you do she blushes?
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,Don't forget controlling Rose breast in Codec calls in MGS4.

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,But that's the thing. Only Kojima would probably make some as wacky as this for a AAA worth indie game
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,[deleted]
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,I think people are getting so caught up on the currently barely-comprehensible plot piecemeals and conflating that with the gameplay that has been shown and explained a bit.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Other than walking across the country I dont understand what gameplay there really is. Story might make sense but this is a game and so far the gameplay is looking overly dull and boring.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"Yes we did, it just isnt very clear to us what it's about what we are doing and what's going on. The bulk of the gameplay is looking like walking simulator to us 10 minutes of that gameplay was them crossing a river."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Not to tell us if it's good but rather to get an understanding of what on earth is going on. I also dont really have time to dedicate to watching people play a game on twitch.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"My dude you either haven’t been paying any attention or haven’t watched all the trailers, character spotlights that explain everything simply or the 50 min gameplay that goes into even more detail. 

It’s all there, but there’s a couple layers that make it complex. Just cause it’s not hand-holdy doesn’t mean its vague as most pivotal characters have a video that pieces their story and the world together tidily. The first 2-3 trailers of 2018 were aimless but everything from 2019 has been concise"
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Theres no gameplay though. Remember it's a game not a movie.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,The story really does sound awesome but if you watch the gameplay it's pretty tedious after even 10 minutes. You're kind of just walking around clunkily sometimes using your ladder and sometimes shaking the baby. Fighting consists of basically just jamming the punch button over and over again
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,I’m not sure what people are having trouble with. Seems like 80% is traversal and 20% is stealth/combat. It’s a slower paced MGS5 with less guns and more electric rope thingys and extendo ladders

She covers herself when you adjust the camera outside of combat, but if you keep adjusting and trying she'll give up and let you look. And then you get the achievement"
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Good work son. We won’t tell the Big Boss about this one.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"Not necessarily. Like, if you're supposed to be working, sure. But if you're in the break room or waiting for a meeting to start or any number of other situations where you don't need to be working that moment, being on Reddit isn't necessarily gonna get you in trouble. This video, however, would probably be a bad call in most workplaces."

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,It's different depending on your bond with Quiet though.  If it's not at max bond then Ocelot will just throw a bucket of water on you but if you do have the bond she will stop him from throwing the bucket and you shower with her in her cell.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,That's Snake's shower scene.  Quiet has a shower scene too.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,Also when you return back to Mother Base with quiet when it is raining you get a flirtatious scene where they play in the rain.

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,"It's just a silly easter egg, which is a common Kojima thing. In MGS3 if you radio The Boss and your crew without a shirt on they'll all comment on it and tell you to put it back on. If you get the tuxedo special camo after finishing the game and starting back up they'll comment on that too. Basically, Kojima and his team put in insane effort to make hidden silly content like this for the amusement of players. It's why you can set down porn mags and the guards get distracted by them for example.

Don't read too much into it. After all, this is the same franchise where players routinely try to get the camera as close to Snake's ass as possible in every game."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,"> Why this is a thing, I’ll never know.

There's all sorts of chances to do mischief in Metal Gear games, even against the villains in this series. Really helps gives it personality beyond being a serious, melodramatic war drama thriller. Though most of it has to be found by player choice, and helping players have a sense of exploration within the game structure."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,Oh ya that's right
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,Oh I never did that.

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-14,That's exactly my fear. Mgs5 had some really awful parts. I'm not into the having to pee and stuff like that but kojima usually knows what he's doing.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"Im a die hard Kojima fan so i know i will enjoy this game even if the gameplay turns out to be boring af.

Just exploring the world and looking for all the weird little details and easter eggs he has filled the game world with will be amazing.

People will be finding weird shit for years after its release."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,">like MGS5 was when it was at its worst, which was when you were just sprinting across a barren map for like 5 minutes lol

Well so far that's what the entire game is starting to look like, with the occasional brief combat encounter

I am skeptical"
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"We had news years ago every week about how incredible, unique and spectacular Death Stranding gameplay is compared to other games. And after 1 hour of gameplay, specifically prepared to look cool, we only saw a freaking Uber Eats simulator. I really can't see anything to be excited about.

A name on a cover tells me nothing and gives me 0 enjoyment."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"Sounds like it's not really your type of game then. It's pretty clearly a ""walking simulator"" kinda game."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"This is interesting to me so I apologize if this sounds rude. You don’t have time to watch someone play a game you’re interested in for 15 minutes to get an idea of the game, but you’ll listen to someone who’s paid to tell you to buy games, and then you’ll buy it and have time to play it?"
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,This is a meme for sure.
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"I feel like no one saw the part in the demo where Norman Reedus puts on half a freakin mech suit and starts chasing down trucks on foot and jumping over cliffs. 

This is the guy that made Metal Gear Solid, I have full faith that there is more to the gameplay than he is letting on."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"The terrain design looks amazing. Most open worlds are just boring plains. Not many people appreciate how great the terrain variety was in Breath of the Wild, and this seems to satisfy the same itch in many ways."

Call Sigint while in a box and you'll have a conversation about how safe you feel inside and how Sigint should join you.

Call him with bioluminescent mushrooms as your active item and Snake will ask if eating them will recharge your batteries. Sigint will react in shock at the idiocy of the question. Afterward, eat them. They do in fact charge the batteries of your items when eaten. Call Sigint back and Snake will tell him that, yes, your batteries do recharge when you eat bioluminscent mushrooms. He'll think Snake is crazy. He'll think everyone is crazy as the other members of the team chip in about how it makes perfect sense."

Hyperdevotion Noire: Goddess Black Heart is a Strategy RPG

U: Action Unleashed and MegaTagmension Blanc + Neptune VS Zombies are musuo (Dynasty Warriors) style action games.

4 Goddesses Online is like a mixture of action and MMO-ish gameplay.

Super Neptunia RPG is a throwback RPG like the old Final Fantasy games."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"I never cared for them due to the lack of polish, but a few years back I was unemployed and massively depressed. Hyperdimension Neptunia mk 2 was one of the only games I owned on my PS3, and so I spent a lot of time plowing through it. After about 20-30 hours the game opens up a ton and I was  hooked, also plenty of insane challenges to grind for. You can easily put 100 hours on your first playthrough."

d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"Takes a lot less time to read a review than it does to watch a streamer and make an opinion especially when a lot of streamers get distracted every 2 seconds by notifications or are over reacting to everything or are extremely positive because they are hyped about the game.


There is more chance of a reviewer being impartial to it and open because it's their job and they may not be hyped about the game but have to review it fairly and openly."
d48olw,2019-09-14,2019-09-15,"Not OP, but: 15 minutes watching someone play a game gives me practically 0 info. Might as well just decide based on the trailer alone.

How are the controls? Maybe the game is exciting for a little while, but gets boring quickly. Maybe it becomes horribly unbalanced, Maybe the plot goes off the rails and ceases to make any sense(It is Kojima after all :p).

I'd rather get a rundown from a reviewer that historically has had similar preferences to me. Someone that actually played the game. The whole thing."

Unless you mean the art director. In which case I agree, how dare someone smother creativity. 

Seriously though. Nothing wrong with 2B or anything ""waifu"" related. Someone has to make em and if Yoko Taro can mix that level of sexy with that level of story I think he earns that right to continue."

Fortunately, it didn't take much effort to do so. The atmosphere, the chill you get when you realize a BT is breathing down your neck and that shriek goes off, the absolutely captivating landscapes, the cargo organizer is a dream to work with. All the little nuances are what gives this game life. You can tell ALOT of love and care was put into this. Even the online mechanic is absolutely genius. Being able to come together as a community is the theme of the game and in that, it fits all too well. Being able to cruise down the freeway because you and 30 other people helped build the road is extremely satisfying. I've been sitting here a bit trying to think of a game i could compare this too but i don't think there is one. Give this one a chance. It BLEW me away."

duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,The cargo weights just 20kg. The other 100kg is weight of the balls you need to pull that off.

duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,This sounds like a game that would be worth picking up while it’s popular because the community player base might not be around in a few months

duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"I have a question. I'm too busy and poor to play Death Stranding now. Say I get it in a year, will the game basically all be bridged and paved and way less effort for me?"

duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,How do bridges work in this game? Do you get some random subset of bridges constructed by people? Do you get them all? Do bridges last for a certain amount of time. I imagine after a few months the whole world will be fully paved.
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,I've been on the fence about this game but it looks like it's actually pretty fun with a really good story. And the fact that the world evolves is pretty dope.

This is why it looks as though he's [floating](https://youtu.be/GeyDf4ooPdo?t=172).  


Edit: Some people seem to be confused, but I think I can help. Imagine, if you will, your clenched fist is the motorcycle. Now point your thumb away from the point of contact between the bike and the ladder. Your clenched fingers would then indicate the direction of spin (of the entire bike and Reedus). Hope this clears things up.

everything I was reading about it made me uneasy, watching professional reviewers was an odd sidequest into the twilight zone seemingly stunted by Sony's demands, watching on twitch was basically unhelpful, but this game is something else and very captivating

it does require patience and I think the pacing is great

hope that helps"

duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"The physics in the game is *generally* great. But like all current gen simulated physics, there's always going to be a way to break it, cheese it, and find silly interactions."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"I feel like this might actually be semi-realistic. He hooks the wheels on the ladder, that's entirely possible (especially considering there are two wheels instead of one.) Send the bike a little forward (so the turning part of the wheel isn't on the ladder instead hooking the metal just behind that) and drop the rider and I could see this almost happening irl.

Now, since the wheels themselves are on the ladder, shouldn't they turn? Technically yes. But if this bike has enough power, it's possible they could hold in place despite the weight on them. There would have to be constant adjustments to keep the wheels just so, but assuming the rider is inhumanly perfect or the wheels are controlled by a computer, it's possible. But wouldn't the rider fall off the bike? Yes probably, he'd have to be *incredibly* strong to stay on with all that luggage. But hey, let's assume he's incredibly strong! There you go, he stays on.

The only really impossible stuff here is that 1 the game considers the ladder a solid immobile object, instead of an unsecured ladder and 2 the little hop up at the end would not be happening irl.

But other than that, it looks theoretically possible to me."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"No matter how hard you try, your game will never have _realistic physics_"
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"a. The verge is a joke
b. Even the best of engines with the best physics will have stuff like this. The physics in the game are actually pretty great."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,He’s very right though. Great review btw
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"You transport shit. You can add a hilarious amount on, although it turns your controls into drunkan asshole simulator at this level."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,That’s the game. I wish I was joking.
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-11,"It's great, if you are patient. It is a sandbox game, but different. If you like side quests, this game is up your alley. If you like weird stories, you should already be playing it.

Basically, if you have a decent attention span and don't need consistent action, you should give it a shot. If not, pass. If maybe, I would suggest waiting until it goes down in price.

Personally I love the game, really love the music. They released an album on most streaming sites called ""Death Stranding: Timefall"". Check it out for sure. BUT it won't be for everyone."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"yes.

do notice that the game's \~7.0 rating has almost nobody giving it a 7 out of 10, its either close to 10 or close to 0. I wouldn't even say the game itself is as simple as a ""love it or hate it"", it does require patience.

so if that $60 gamble is a big commitment for you, this might be a good use of Redbox game rentals."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-11,"From a first Kojima game player, It is awesome. At first I was like ""I am going to regret and hate this game"". And now I'm seriously thinking on taking my free days I've got on my work to play this. Got it Friday and I'm 35 hours in already. Points I like:

Best graphics I've seen on console.  
Great character development.  
Delivery system, when you think about it, sounds boring, but it so well made that I love it.  
Lore is good and intriguing at the same time.  
Soundtrack.  
BB.  

If you can, get it from a friend to try it. I know some people won't be into it, and that's okay. But if you think you like what I said above, get it. I'm sure this will be a heavy GOTY contender :)"
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"I'd say if you're down to go on a journey, this is right up your alley. Don't expect amazing gameplay or a crazy story. It's all about the journey, the unravelling of the world and story of Sam Porter Bridges."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"I'm having a blast, but it's not comparable to any game. It's hard to even explain why its fun without trying the game yourself. The network features are borderline brilliant, especially since they fit so well with the games story and theme. There's no feeling like making it through an exhausting journey and having  a kind stranger help you indirectly with a key structure or tool left behind."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-11,"Yes it is great. Pretty avant garde as far as video games go, but it sets a new standard for realistic platforming in game design and how to incorporate combat without relying on constant killing. Music and graphics are both great. I'm still early into the story and it's definitely a slow burn, but obviously very original."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-11,"From what I’ve heard, the game is very good but also very niche. Much more about exploration and interacting with the environment than anything else"
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,Not only do you need to drink 10000 but you also need to insert disc 2.
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"12+ hours in, I see nothing wrong with this statement.


I'm still finding it oddly satisfying."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,The same vehicle mechanics are at watchdogs too. And people hated that game for those mechanics.
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,Yeah as a CS student myself I'd actually consider this level of physics simulation crazy af.
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"No crossbows. I don't know how much the weapons develop in the end game, but you don't want to kill anyone. Dead bodies in this game's world create giant craters from explosions (they call it a ""voidout"").

But you can shoot bolas at people, stun grenades, so on."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"This is a larger load than normal. Plus, why am I seemingly the only guy who straps gear to my arms and legs and runs around like an 11th centuary samurai?"
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,Yeah youre a delivery man. That's what you do in this game is play UPS and it's fun as fuck.
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"I feel like the combat is the weakest part of the game it is very one note and basic. Besides some dialogue that can be cringy at times. They have like 1 animation for Sam when you're drinking or showering in the private room. It's really weird how the world is so detailed, but there are things that got kinda skipped over that shouldn't have. I really enjoy the game, but I feel like doing the actual deliveries and building is the best part of the game by far."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"I'm loving it so far. Everyone is calling it a walking simulator, but its more of a hiking simulator, the difference being that there's danger that comes with the walking and there are a lot of mechanics that go into it. Each delivery job feels kind of like a mini adventure. I mean ok they're not all exciting, some can feel like downright tedious fetch quests. The overall presentation is fantastic though, the music is great, the multiplayer aspect is really fun and unique and nails the feeling of helping each other out like a community."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"It's hard to recommend. It's equal parts tedious, frustrating, breath-taking, and thought provoking. You really need to watch some gameplay before deciding if you want to buy it."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"[Skillup's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuLRlRLBwQ8) convinced me to buy the game.

He goes a bit too fanboy(ish) at times but overall keeps it pretty neutral and is pretty frank in that 90% of the gameplay is walking around delivering stuff and that it might not be for you.

His analogy of ""...if you enjoy walking around just exploring and not really doing much in games like Skyrim and RDR2 you'll enjoy it""....not an exact quote, pretty much sealed the deal for me.

20 hours in and it's one of the most original ""games"" I've ever played and is an absolute GOTY contender imho. No regerts."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"ladders are easy to make, they use resources, but you also have to carry them as cargo, so they aren't the most useful item to stack up on.

But to answer your question, yes, you very well could."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"Depends on what you think fun is, to some people this game is probably really fun but others may find this game boring."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"It's hard to say it's fun but I also can't say I find it *not* fun. I think about it when I'm not playing, and then I play and it starts to feel like a chore after a while. But then I stop, and after just minutes, I want to play more."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,Shut up.   It looks amazing.
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"just try not getting too close. while standing still and not holding your breath you can see where they are, also the thing on your shoulder i forget its name lets you know where the closest bt is and how close it is. slow open and close means its not close, opening and closing fast means its close, and when it turns orange it means its basically almost touching you."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"The sensor shows you where the next one is. You can fight them with shit, piss and shower bombs."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,It's not out on PC yet.
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,Google says early summer of 2020
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,No physics at all!!
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-14,"its good if the premise of the game sounds attractive to you. you have to plan your route out ahead of time, and account for all the possible obstacles that you may have to overcome. its actually really relaxing if you can actually immerse yourself in the experience"
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,No game is setup that bridges and stuff or show up once whatever knew place you are going is connected to the network. So the first is always a dry run for every delivery
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,Then don't play it. It's literally that simple.
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"The world had an apocalypse type thing that turned most into dolly ghosts stuck between the world living and dead. Remaining humans are all separated by miles occupied with spooky ghosts. You're norman reedus and you deliver shit so that mankind can survive and come back together. 

That's how I understand it, there's more to it like the ""dark souls message"" type of multiplayer, but you get player built stuff rather than helpful tips like ""try tongue, but hole""."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"You know those tedious annoying fetch quests that devs sometimes put into a game to pad it out?   Well Kojima took that, and made an entire game out of it.   You are a delivery boy doing fetch quests.  

If you buy this, you are fucking nuts."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,Only trolls who haven’t played the game say this.

duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,It’s one of the best games I’ve played in 38 years of gaming.
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-11,"Its a lot more fun than you think, all the naysayers and *hurrdurr it's amazon delivery simulator* are the people who haven't actually played it and said *well, actually, it's pretty fun...*"
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"The game is actually pretty great but most of you won't step outside your confined bubble and give it a chance, everyone always says they love games where they can get lost in the world and atmosphere but when a game like that comes out everyone calls it a dogshit walking simulator, after beating it and playing for about 50 hours, I can tell you it's much more than just a walking simulator. If you were expecting pure action then clearly the game is not for you but that does not make it dog shit."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-11,Downvote me please this game is trash
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-13,"Couple downvotes, does that mean people tell me it DOES look fun? Lol"
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,On PS4.
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,Delivery simulation from what I've seen.
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,It's a PS4 exclusive until next year
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"Yes and fifa is just a running simulator.  
All you do is kick the ball sometimes and have like goal cutscenes every 15 minutes;"
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,Andromeda was hilarious compared to this.
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"Lmao this is one of the most polished AAA games in a while, one glitch and suddenly the game is ME:A levels of bad, shut the fuck up and delete your comment."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"Building freeway is painful. I spent pretty much all last night and tonight searching for Ceramics and Metals to pave a few sections. I couldn't have done it without the truck from the MULE camp, but even with that there are weight limitations and battery limitations getting to and from locations. Almost isn't fun. But then I finish a section, and it's beautiful to ride across. And then there's the 20k likes I got from it over night."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"I wish I had people in my game building freeways. I had to build every single piece so far. took a huge amount of time.

but bridges, umbrellas, generators and most of all ""ziplines"" are everywhere. feels kinda good everytime someone else's work makes your life easier."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,Freeways are awesome as well. Guaranteed smooth surface over all terrain and it allows free use of battery consuming equipment if you make sure to use it over top of the line in the middle. Trikes and trucks come to mind more than speed skeletons and power skeletons in this case.
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,I've spent about 5 hours on paving roads and it's more for my own benefit than yours.
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"I built a road and got thousands of likes cause everyone just started using it. Roads are worth the Likes you get.

Take out a mule camp, steal a truck and all their resources, ez roads."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"all ive been doing for the like the last 8hrs is building that fucking expressway.  i think theres been like 3 or 4 other sections built besides my  work, and ive got it spanning from the starting port to almost the weather station now.  plus theres an offshoot going at the craftsman."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,over time the structures decay so people need to keep rebuilding
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"That gets you loads of likes in online play.
Plus they're interesting, you can use them to climb too uneven ground because while your using it your character has complete stability, you'll only fall down if you want to."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"And people like you, or maybe even you, saved my bacon last night."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"Sort of.

You can build structures like roads, bridges, climbing ropes etc that decay over time. Once you've placed a structure or section, it can appear in the games of other players connected to the same waystations as you. If you use someone's structure you can give them likes, an ingame currency similar to exp, and you'll also increase your association with that player when you give them likes, so it's more likely that structues they build or contribute to will appear in your world.

Players never actually see each other, but can work together to make the game easier and more successful for everyone - I think there's an important lesson there that Kojama is trying to teach. 

Disclaimer: I haven't played the game. I've just inferred most of this from reading the comments in this thread."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,Ziplines are even faster if you've got the bandwidth.
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"The latter. Also you can leave behind ""disposable"" items like ladders and climbing anchors behind.

If you see a trail of ladders across a bunch of rocks in a rapids river, someone put that there. If you see a sign that you didn't put down, someone put that there. If you see a bridge that crosses a gap that you would otherwise have to go around, someone put that there. If you find a safehouse in the middle of nowhere that you use, someone built that safe-house and affected your life simply by allowing others to use it, even if they speak a entirely different language than you."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,That's pretty cool. I could see that being the basis of a melee weapon in a futuristic setting. (It could even be used as the reason why Marvel Thor is able to wield Mjolnir if he's able to trigger gyros in the hammer to allow him to lift it)
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"I mean, even with that being accounted for, this is not physically possible."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,I swear I was gonna get rick rolled

duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-11,"I'm sure there'd be online and offline runs, with offline runs being better looked at as legitimate."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"You can disable the online features

Which people will likely do for speedruns since it's more consistent"
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,Maybe for an amateur like you. True pros will be able to do 10 hours of cut-scenes and 19 minutes of gameplay!
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,Ikr i thought about this after i commented. I just want to see people running silly with big backpacks.
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"I mean, come on. Be a little more high effort. The game has a lot of cutscenes yeah but it's very cinematic that's the point.

They're all skippable, as is all the little dialogue in game. A speedrunner can easilly shave that all down to nothing.

30 minutes is a gross underestimation of the amount of time spent playing the game.

I'm sure this is meant to be sarcastic, but it's just so far from close it misses the mark."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"Speed runners skip cutscenes, and it takes like 3 hours just to do all the missions in a zone casually what even is this comment."

duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-11,That's the whole god damn cycle experience lol it's so jittery idk how it made it in like that
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,I can't believe we thought of the same comment lol

duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"It looks like the game is light on the actual gameplay but heavy with story and cutscenes. It looks like the majority of the gameplay is walking and delivering packages. It looks like large boring chunks, filled in with story.

Please, tell me how it really is. I want to buy this, but the gifs and videos make it look boring. I've loved all the MG games; should I buy this?"
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,How far into the game do you get the motorcycle? I'm about 4 hours in
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,That's why I wait for my favourite youtuber to make a review. It takes him at least 2 weeks since the official release.

duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"Yeah I'm a software developer and I was actually impressed by this physics engine. It might look wonky but the detail in the hitbox models and how this game simulates your wheels turning against another object is very impressive.

To consider that all objects in the game hold the data that allows these interactions and modifies/updates them in what seems like O(logn) time or better demonstrates very high efficiency in the game's data structures."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,wait wut
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-11,What would you recommend as the most similar game to it? I’ve been thinking it sounds like Red Dead without guns. Is that accurate?
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"Pretty much why I like every Kojima game. So weird and out there, but so much fun."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"Sounds like a game I’ll like, thanks!"
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"I like weird stories, but the dialogue and storytelling in this game is so bad"
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,I feel like every time Kojima makes a game its the best graphics on whatever system.
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-11,Lol I love when someone who hasn’t played the game gives a review based on other reviews.
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-11,"Imo if you really enjoyed exploring the woods as a child and enjoy hikes, you'll love this game. If you only play action games it may be tedious and you'll hate it."

duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"How far have you gotten in the story? The combat really opens up after chapter 4. I spent like 10k hours on mgo2 and it gets really intuitive with the different weapons. Plus with hand to hand and stealth options added in later it feels so much like mgo2 but better, I'm in love lol"

Here's hoping a video game bringing us world peace"
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"I started building mine alone too, dumped loads of resources in, then put game in rest mode overnight, came back today and other people had contributed a ton of pieces, even competed 2 sections. So I think it's a bit of a patience game too."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"You have to participate in building stuff to get access to more stuff from other players. That also includes liking player build things.

At first I had barely any roads either, but at some point it tipped and now in the second area I have an almost fully build highway while I only placed two road pieces of it myself.

tl;dr - don't be cheap with giving out likes to other people."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"Did you start contributing to the roads before or after connecting to the chiral network? I used to put materials into the roads on the way to the new centers, and then by the time I connected, other players had contributed to it."

duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"That video shows how the gyroscope allows him to pick it up *on the very end*, when it would usually be hard to hold horizontally like that. It doesn't affect the weight of the object, it's still just as difficult to lift *vertically*. 

If you hold something very far from the center of mass (like he does in the video), it will put a lot of strain on your wrist because it needs to counteract the torque that the object has, which is trying to swing itself downwards. With an effective gyroscope, that torque will instead slowly swing the object 90° to the direction you'd normally expect, which is the effect known as ""gyroscopic precession"". With precession, it's essentially the *axis* of the spin that will slowly rotate. 

It's useful for some things like stabilizing a boat so that it doesn't rock back and forth, but it wouldn't be very useful for helping to lift heavy objects unless they were weighted very badly. Perhaps you'd be able to lift a couch by yourself by simply grabbing it on one end, but you'd also slowly be spinning in a circles if you kept holding on."

duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"Without spoiling too much, part of entertainment comes from what obstacles you run into on the way to your destinations. 

Yes, the game IS about delivering packages, but in my so far 15-20 playtime, the meaning behind WHY you are doing it is justified. At first, the game can feel slow or be a slog because you extremely lack the versatile tools the game offers. And when I mean versatile, I mean fucking versatile.  Ladders, Ropes, Ziplines, Augmented Legs, vehicles of various types, assisted carts, etc. And this is all I currently see and Im only on chapter 3 (there are 14 story chapters, some short, some long). You feel a constanct sense of progression that trivializes your last journey by allowing you to overcome said obstacle easier. 

Everything you do, manage and encounter is inherently fun if you get beyond the ""walking simulator"" complaint. Its an absolutely massive journey so far, that if anything, play for the extremely unique story and setting. 


There is nothing else quite like it."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"I like to think it's like monster hunter, but instead of fighting monsters, you're fighting nature. It is still PVE, but not in a traditional bang bang boom boom sense.
And when the social aspect of construction is really like having 3 Japanese players carry you through the impossible encounters.

Hope that makes sense"
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"90% of the gameplay is you traveling long distances from one metal box to the next metal box, getting congratulated by a talking head that isn't actually there, and being told where to go next. Cutscenes are weird too, because none of the cutscenes actually take place in the game. Every instance of a cutscene happening is completely disjointed from the gameplay and the open world it takes place in. Like there are a few big cities, but every big city*(and every single location in the game in fact)* is nothing but a terminal and sometimes an elevator. If you get told you have to learn something important at South Knot City, you travel there and stand on the elevator for a second and it triggers a cutscene that takes place somewhere in that underground city you never actually see. It feels like you never actually meet these characters. 

If you loved the story telling style in the MGS series, Death Stranding is actually VERY VERY similar in it's own story telling. Characters are flashy and cool and all have over the top names that are in-your-face-symbolic. Characters give verbose monologues. The cutscenes feel very cinematic and movie-like. Gradually learning about the history of characters and their motivations drives most of the plot...... But, unlike the MGS series, it's no where near as great. It's kinda' shit TBH, for most of the same reason I listed in the first paragraph. The game is supposed to be about connecting people and locations, but you never meet the people at those locations. And every location is just a glorified big 'ole metal bus stop without a soul in sight. The gameplay is fine, but for a game about connecting the world together and bringing people together the game is bafflingly devoid of life."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"About then. Once you get to the distribution center, there's a bike busted there. You gotta get parts at the wind Mill, then you can make a generator to charge it"

It’s about how much time you’re willing to invest and if u care more about the story than super engaging gameplay, which this game obviously doesn’t have 100% of the time bc it’s generally a walking sim. Soundtrack is also fantastic, helps with the gameplay aspect."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"Im really in the same boat.  It looks like the cenematics are so wierd and cool, but gameplay looks like its just delivery and inventory stuff...like if metal gear solid 5 didnt have any combat...but maybe ive just seen inbetween stuff and the story is great, or maybe its one of those things thats not super thrilling to watch but is a blast to play.  Idk man."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"I just watched the first half hour of Norman Reedus trekking Scandinavian terrain and I've already decided I'll get it when it comes to PC.  

I can see how it can be a hit-or-miss though. This game is more an interactive (very long) movie than an actual game, even more than most of Kojima games. This is the most Kojima game ever in the history of Kojima games. It's what you apparently get when you give Kojima a free reign to make a game however Kojima likes."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"No game has done what this game does. While the writing is not perfect (still great), the gameplay is goddam refreshing. So unique and exciting."

duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,It’s a delivery game
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,">What would you recommend as the most similar game to it?

Most similar? It’s got an open world feel like RDR2 or FFXV, but with less towns and people. It’s got horror with really tense moments. Stealth comes into play on a number of occasions, but there can be plenty of combat as well.

There is a lot of side content, and I mean a ton. If you are a completionist it can take awhile, though I’ve read that people who just stuck to the main story poured about 30-35 hours into the game before it finished

Biggest draw for me (other than the story) is the sense of community. People build structures that are very helpful and other players can use them. For the really large ones everyone can chip in to build and maintain it. It’s a single player game in the sense that you will never see another player, but you will see what they’ve built, and you’ll see how much the things you’ve built have helped others"
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-11,"So there are guns in the game, but you are encouraged to not use lethal means.

For the sandbox part, it could be considered like red dead, but a lot less people in the open. Most characters are in bunkers or the cities (which are large safehouses).

Looks wise, more like fallout in a way, a bit like the last real metal gear game. But most ""missions"" are delivery missions."

But saying it's a walking simulator is clearly gibberish."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,Plus you have people who tend to put chargers along the highway
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"Yes and no. I'll try to detail it for you. Beware spoilers.

Essentially you have to reconnect these stations to the internet. Once they are connected you can see what others have built, used what they built, follow their literal footsteps. See where they turned around and walked left or spun in a circle. When a ladder is put up it says who put it up. People can 'like' whoever did it. You can also place holographic signs warning of danger. ""Hey enemies are about to spawn here after a cut scene, follow this path where its safe."" That's communicated with 2 signs one being the enemy symbol facing where they are and a direction arrow pointing which way is safest. 

You can also help deliver their stuff. Say I pickup a lost package. The destination it's for I dont feel like walking to. So I drop it off at a safe location. Players have the option to pick it up and carry it further. Eventually someone is gonna turn it in. Everyone who carried it gets some reward for helping."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,A sense of gratitude. But I don't really know otherwise lol.

duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"There is a section of the game that has a long section of freeway spanning across the map, granting smooth passage over terrain that would be rocky or impassable, but it has to be built by players first (in sections, using huge large amounts of resources for each section). Vehicles in the game all use battery power. Trikes and trucks are vehicles, while power skeletons and speed skeletons are exoseletons you wear that basically also function like vehicles. When you're on the freeway, your vehicles don't consume battery. Thus, once a lot of freeway sections ate built, you can take a vehicle and travel a long way without worrying about the terrain or your battery. It feels really nice."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"Getting around the map is hard. To start you have to walk everywhere. If you carry lots of stuff it's actually difficult and slow to get around. As you and the community progress you build infrastructure, and get access to vehicles.

The roads that can be built can power the games electric vehicles when you drive on them. So you won't start using the battery till you get off the road.

You also have other electronic equipment that's powered by just being on the roads. That's why they are so useful."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"Steal their materials to build more freeways to bully more MULEs.

Also, BT's aren't as much as an issue on elevated sections of road. They tend to stay near the ground, so you have more time to keep on getting out of there before they hear you and attack."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"Well, you still technically play every area the way the first player did, until you connect a base in the area to the network you don't see anything built by other players in that area."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"Sort of. When you first enter a new area of the map, you dont see anything player-made until you activate the way station thing. But even still, I've noticed that when I do this in my game that structures dont just instantly pop in that weren't there before. They just kind of gradually start to appear. 

Like for instance, I'm sure that in someones game the whole highway is built. But in my game there are parts that are still missing. I'm still not entirely sure how the online aspect in this game works and how it chooses who's structures you see, but I do believe that even if you were to jump into this game years from now that you would have an experience pretty similar, if not the same, as to what other players are having now. Hope this helps!"
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"Why don't you use ladders instead? Also rivers don't have anything on you unless it's ""red"" deep. You can safely just stand on ""yellow"" river if you just hold your gear and you will regain stamina."

The gameplay is an odd mix of fetch quests done right (didnt think that was possible) and progression of map transversal that the whole community helps out with. If i find myself thinking ""Man that area was rough without a generator to fill up my bike"" i go and place one and get notified anytime it helps someone else.

I love space trader games but I've always wanted more unconventional settings besides ""space"" and so far the only real noteworthy ones that come to me are Hardwar (Hovercars doing delivery on Saturn's moon Titan) and Hardtruck Apocalypse (Madmax-esque trucking courier game).

I don't doubt Death Stranding is divisive but I like it when the travel in the game is the adversary rather than some guys you have to shoot."

duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-11,I’ve watched and read several reviews.  None have said it’s fun.  Most sound like an art dealer describing some abstract painting.
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"Oh why don't you fuck off. The game obviously looks terrible.I don't know about the gameplay, but the lighting is absolute shit"
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"Watch the dude try to walk down or up a mountain, shit looks like a cartoon."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,Then why are you trolling in this subreddit?  Are you just bored?
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,That sounds Intense
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-13,This game is fucking trash.  fact
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"This game might actually be worse, lol"
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,w/e you kojima fanboi
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"Woah. That's kinda deep.

Why do I feel like Kojima is making some sort of human condition(? Don't know what to call it) simulation from this virtual lifeless world. Is there an overworld map in the game? Maybe we'll see something like the reddit r/place event. Last Kojima game I played was MGS5, and the base invasions somehow hinted at humans finally working together to disarm each other for the greater good.

Just putting it out there."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"Holy shit, this sounds interesting. This kind of communication btween players reminds me of The Journey"
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,From what I've read so far.... If a community of Minecraft builders and good samaritans put their efforts in this game... they would make GORGEOUS creations and deeds.
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,This sounds awesome. I will have to try it.
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"in eli5, if you ""beat"" the level then you see what ppl construct ? like beat the level to unlock the community zone ?"
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,👍
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"[No real spoilers I swear]

The story is supposed to be some sort of reflection of peoples obsession with social media, and the fact that people will go so far to put shit online just for the likes. 

There's a lot of stuff in the interviews about the fact that social media is proven to rewire the brain to feel better when you receive more and more likes(part of the reason everyone in game is obsessed with Oxytocin, a chemical released when making skin contact with other people close to you, and bow people are finding trace amounts are produced through social media when people are validated online)

I'm only a few chapters into the game, so maybe it'll be spelled out more as I play along, but that's just what seems to be.obvious as I play through it so far(I just reached a segment where you can start rebuilding roads for reference sake)"
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"The amount of time you have to administer likes, along with how many likes you receive from each ""like"" press done by others, is determined by your rank in certain ""stats"" (that nautical star on your mission results screen). I think Bridge Link has a heavy influence on it, because I gained like 30 ranks in that at once from building roads, and suddenly my like window is 8 seconds."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"That's very much the message, yes. He's said as much about it I believe."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"The game is parcel deliveries in post-apocalypse world. You can use ladders to climb stuff, for example, but you have to carry a ladder along with you, and most of the game is literally inventory management. Like, that ladder has to go somewhere in your pack, and you have to balance it as you walk. You can fall over and drop your shit if you misstep on a hill. 

Part of the game is being able to improve the terrain and build stuff between the places you have to go, and this is done in a weird social/asynchronous manner. One person can start a project, but they're too big to feasibly complete yourself, but others can contribute to it too with resources or whatever. The thing you built in your game world can be finished by other players and used in theirs, then the game gives 'likes' to your character for helping to build the thing they used. Stuff other players build can show up in your game to make your travels easier too, but only after you ""connect"" an area to the time-internet.

But yeah. Parcel deliveries, the game. Also there are timeghosts, but you just throw shit grenades at them. The rest is simply Kojima being a fuckin nutter with nobody to tell him ""no""."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,So say I get the game a year from now. Would it just be vastly easier because all the infrastructure was already built?
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"Oh, interesting, okay I like that."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,That does help. Thanks for explaining.
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,Your structures only appear in some other players worlds. It's not global. I think your structure has a greater chance to appear if it has more likes.
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,ok but he literally summons lightning from his hands
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,There is actual magics as well. See: Doctor strange.
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"At least in the movies, Thor says he comes from a place where they are ""one and the same"". That doesn't mean it's just science so advanced it looks like magic. It's both at the same time."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"That was said in the very first thor movie. Which was super early in the MCU. They went on to retcon the shit outta that statement. Dr. Strange is a wizard, the stones are fragments of creation. Magic is super real."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,It’s not often I legitimately laugh out loud while reading things but you took me by surprise
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"Definitely more respected. If it becomes anything like Dark Souls speedrunning, cheesing is gonna be strongly frowned upon. Offline is the only way to go for competitive speedruns."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"I’m about 10 hours in and I’m hooked. They forgot to mention the great soundtrack as well. My favourite part is finding structures that other people have placed, and also building my own in the hope that someone else will find it useful."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"Wrong, I would drink hideo's bath water"
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,It’s definitely in my top 5 games I’ve ever played in 38 years of gaming.
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"Not unless everyone keeps the structures in good condition. There is something called timefall. It’s like rain, except the “rain drops” cause anything they touch to age considerably. Because of this, structures deteriorate over time (in fact, I started getting notified that some of the first structures I made on the first day are starting to deteriorate)

You can repair them by adding materials. The upkeep is much less than the cost to build a new one, and just like with building a structure, other players can contribute to the costs"

duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,Definitely a game for you then. Pick that shit up.
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"I noticed that too, they didn't have the populated online world to play with. Very counterproductive to give it to reviewers a week before, but I understand this is common practice.

I really enjoy it."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"I've watched about 12 hours of a streamer playing it who really likes it.

That said after watching 12 hours of it, I have zero desire to play it..."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"....you're blind.   This is on par with any triple A this year.   When it comes out on pc it only stands to look even better as well.


I swear there's a forum somewhere that decided ""lets trash talk this gorgeous unique game publically for no real reason""

Are you a konami deep neural AI come for kojima?  Lmao"
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,How am I trolling?

duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-14,"you're unnecessarily mad at a game you don't own, kid."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"All of this makes me anxious that by the time the PC release is here, everything that's new now will be played out already."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"You're spot on, because hats actually the theme of the game. Main story, NPC interactions as well as the MP aspect, and even down to 4th wall breaks are all about this."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,Kojima has always tried to implement 4th wall development all the way back when you could get important codec numbers on the videogame case as well as that whole controller switch to defeat psycho mantis.
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,Pretty much. Apparently the stuff build doesnt last forever. The rain is called Timefall and ages what it touches. Comments say it degrades and ruins the stuff after a while.
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,Redbox. 3 nights for 7 bucks.
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-13,"Not really. The first thing you have to do in the area is connect it to the internet. Then you see a lot more of what people built and signs they posted. I see some before I connect, but it's a bunch more after I'm connected."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"No, for a few different reasons:

1. The first time you adventure in any area of the map, you won't see things other people have built until you complete the main delivery for that area. So other people's structures are useful when traversing places you've already been (and there is a lot of that), but you'll always be doing the last mile of delivery alone.

2. It's not fully multiplayer - the game just randomly picks a few people to cross over their structures and signs into your world. So it doesn't get cluttered and it doesn't build up over time.

3. Even the biggest structures only take a couple of hours of work to complete, at most (as far as I've seen, anyway). So there's nothing that could be built in the game a year down the road that you couldn't already run into right now.

4. Structures deteriorate over time. It seems to be a very slow process, but in a year, I would expect everything that currently exists in the game to be gone (unless it's actively repaired)."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"I'm pretty sure it also only loads contributions of players around your level. Meaning, you're not going to see stuff built by some guy who has a lot of fancy equipment and excess materials when you're in a lower level zone. So that way the contribution is more equal"
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,He rubs his hands really fast against his pubes to generate static electricity. The animators just can't draw that fast.

duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"Dr. Strange is fully magic, but if you can explain something it ceases to be magical.

Why do you think Harry Potter didn't let you hear a god damn thing the teachers in the magic school were saying? If they explain it, it's science not magic.

*Note: Dr. Strange is strongly hinted to be using forces balanced through the multiverse though. So it's like 6D physics!"
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,What do you mean by cheesing in this context?
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,That's honestly amazing. Thank you
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"TBF, streamers, depending on how big they are, could literally be being paid to play it, so it's rare that they'll shit on something and go all ""hype"" while playing it. 

Hell some streamers have personas built around fake hype."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"The game absolutely has a lot of graphical weaknesses. Particularly, the game has no damn LOD at all and no asotropic filtering. Means that in some moments the game looks incredible, best looking game ever, than the next it looks like complete trash."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"I literally just saw it for the first time in this post and it just looks terrible. I thought it was a joke post at first. Maybe I've been playing too much rdr2, but it really looks terrible. I don't care how unique the game is, it still looks terrible from this post. Like I said before that doesn't change the gameplay. I'll play it when I can."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,Protecting the kojima fanboy shield for a game that you supposedly aren't even interested in... I am at least on here because I was excited about this game but then realized it was a walking simulator.

duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,It doesn't dump everything people have done into your world. I'm not sure the exact algorithm but it seems like your instance is only importing a few objects from a handful of people at a time.
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"Yeah I'm not a fan of the whole ""delayed PC release"" thing.  I love exploration games, but with MH:W's Iceborne release I've already totally lost interest and I've gone back to not being able to kill shit in that game.  So I'm likely not gonna play it.  And now I'm concerned that my desire to play this game will evaporate by the time it's released.  

&#x200B;

It really sucks missing out on the initial hype of a game that's driven in some part by community interaction.  Seeing other people's creations is supposed to be a huge part of it, so missing out on that first wave of excitement really hurts that for me."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"There are hats in the game? Even better! 

On a serious note, what could Kojima have hidden within the codes of this game? The concept is a unique use of the connectivity available to us. He's quite the fan of literary works like Lord of the flies (Pig's head in the Eli introductory scene) and 1984 (overarching theme about how language can be wielded as a weapon) and others."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,True. But I'm more interested in his game being commentaries on the human species.

If you can't explain it, you cannot teach it or learn it from others. There's no reason why magic can't be explained."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"I think you're confusing science and technology - science is simply a method for trying to understand the world, so there's no reason you can't apply science to magic."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,Energy from other universes.... so full metal alchemist?
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"Making the experience easier than it should be. Say for example doing a SL1 run on DS3. Some people will fake it and level up. But the true achievement is in the completion of the game at the lowest stats possible. To put it into context, the game goes up to a suggested 120 in the base content. Staying at level 1 for this is an insane handicap against yourself. 

To summarize, you speedrun by doing what needs to be done to complete the story in as short a time-frame as possible. Set whatever restrictions on yourself that you want. But speedrunning communities operate on a sense of decency. So if you say you complete a SL1 run, prove it. Same for general speedruns. 

Nobody will shit on someone for being honest in this context. These challenges add multiple layers of difficulty to already difficult games. They are obviously not meant for everybody.

Edit: Short addition--People do those runs offline to solo. If you play online, you run the risk of being invaded. If invaded, it ruins the speedrun. Embers open up multiplayer online. But you need them for the health boost."

duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,I'm still really early in the game. I just unlocked the bridge. You can build a bridge but it needs materials. You can help other players in building theirs too gifting supplies.
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,I'm half way there!
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"This is my biggest gripe with the science and magic debate. It is as you said, science is just observations of the natural world. In a world with magic, it would be considered a science. Pretty much, if an experiment is reproducible, it is can be considered a science.

Full magic would be like a Wild Sorcerer in DnD where every time you use magic a different effect would occur. So this way there won't be reproducible effects. In the end, who knows. I really like the idea of as long as we don't hear a proper explanation, it stays as ""magic"" but the moment it is explained it is science/technology.

E: I should say explained to the audience in a fantasy setting movie with magic."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,Gotcha. Was just a little confused because in most speed running communities it seems more like if it saves time you do it regardless of what it detracts from the game. But that doesn't really seem to be what you're referring to

duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"Yeah, Dark Souls speedrunning and challenge runs are a different ball game than say, Super Mario Bros. It's not about doing everything to make your run easier. In a way, it's about doing everything you can to handicap yourself while still besting it as fast as possible. It's a kind of masochism we're drawn to. I still haven't finished my SL1 run. There are a couple bosses that pose a major threat. 

I'm not sure of specifics on speedruns, but I do know they are offline. Online could use the cooperation of other players to speed up both areas, and boss battles. Not very sportsman of the competition to cheese when 98% won't."
duz7jp,2019-11-11,2019-11-12,"Speedruns generally require a consistent, equal playing field to be considered legitimate. Randomness internal to the game itself is fine, but ""random"" changes potentially encountered due to the actions of other people would not be allowed. 

In this case they're referring to optional online functions that would affect the consistency of runs due to actions taken by online players that can't be controlled or accounted for."

63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,Mads is one creepy dude.
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,It's funny that we take real people and animate them into something less realistic to make the game more realistic 
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,I wish other game companies cared about the little details as much as kojima does
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"To all those saying ""OMG see! This is how you animate a game!""

This was a single shot for a trailer guys, wait to see some actual game footage before you get too erect."
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,Source??
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,This is hilarious because Mass effect andromeda used the same technology to capture human faces in the game. 
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"I love Mads Mikkelsen, but does he have any facial expressions other than ""super serious mode"" and ""psychotic serious mode""? "
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,That is a surprising amount of work to make a face that looks less realistic then a real face.  I wonder if at some point video games will become so realistic that they just use live action cut scenes.
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,What exactly is this game about? 
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"""Mads, what are you up to?""

""Oh you know, just doing some mocap in my bedroom."""
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,Is this the guy from doctor strange?
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,Let's not forget. Hideo Kojima originally wanted to be a movie director. I think Death Stranding is going to be pretty awesome with such an all star cast!
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,TIL he's much creeper in real life than video game form
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"That's MoCap, not animation."
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"I love Mads, he does a great Hannibal and he's fascinating... I hope Kojima also delivers"
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,Wait....Is that Hannibal?!
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,That's how you make a face not be tired.
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,Just hit me that Mads Mickelsen would be a awesome Geralt in a movie adoption 
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,There is a difference between animation and motion capture. 
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,ITT: Mass Effect circlejerk.
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"ITT: The two biggest circlejerks collide: Mass Effect Animations, and the Kojima circlejerk.

The thing is though, Death Stranding is most likely by all accounts going to be a much smaller game where they focused on more fine detailed content, while in Mass Effect they focused more on an insane amount of content, which makes it unrealistic to expect motion capture or incredible animations for every scene in MEA. And at that point it really just depends on what strikes your fancy.

I will say though that Mass Effect had particularly shitty animations in general, but holy shit is this a huge circlejerk. Combined with the Kojima circlejerk, this is immeasurable amounts of people jerking eachother. 

Note: I like Kojima as much as the next guy, but the guy always goes over budget, and MGS V disappointed a lot in the end."
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,I cry. Release sometime before 2019. 
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,That was unexpectedly scary.
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"First Doctor Strange, then Rogue One, now Death Stranding...

HELP! Mads Mikkelsen is taking over my media!"
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"And this is still more gameplay than we have seen of this ""game."" Why doesn't he come out and say that it is a movie already?"
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"To be fair, this isn't really facial animation ""In Death Stranding"", is it? It seems pretty far out to assume the trailer is representative of the quality of the product as a whole."
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,Back in my day they just put the actual actor on the game.
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"At this point, why not just actually film them?"
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"That is some cool stuff right there, yay for technology!"
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"sigh.

"
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"I'm in the CG industry, and while I enjoy these kinds of things and am constantly impressed with the level of innovation and progress I can't help but think back to something my animation instructor told us in school: ""Never use CG for anything you can film. It's more expensive and less convincing.""

This is a great example of that point. They've got real Mads Mikkelsen playing a CG Mads Mikkelsen that they're spending a lot of money and energy trying to make look like real Mads Mikkelsen.

Cool though."

63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,Mads needs to be careful: Rutger Hauer has that look copyrighted. It's like his Blue Steel.
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"I'm absolutely astounded by the animation of his eyes.

It's so life-like.

If you think about it, you'd probably just animate them moving at a constant speed upwards until they reach their point and then stop.

But human eyes are different, they flick between focus points whilst moving. Especially when you're trying to move your eyes slowly but not too slowly.

Incredible."

63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"That slight 'jitter' in the way the pupils move is one of the most overlooked subtleties in facial animation that makes it so much more realistic. Unless you're following a specific moving object, your eyes almost never move smoothly - they 'flick' from target to target. +1 to these guys. So many +1s."

63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"That's not facial animation, that's called motion capture for a reason. If you mocap 100% of the game its gonna look amazing, but if you're trying to hand animate everything its gonna look like some characters in Mass Effect. Most look fine though. Obviously way more expensive to mocap every little sidequest and thing NPC say so "

63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,TFW you died scratching someone's balls.
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,amazing animation! waiting for release!
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,The attention to detail is amazing. You know THIS is real.

63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,The juxtaposition between his roles and how silly he seems in real life always throws me off.
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"I mean, it looks great - but does it hold a candle to Bioware? I mean where are the googly eyes and the spinning heads I've grown accustomed to from Mass Effect"
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,Story theories anybody?
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,Is this new to people?
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,It's going to be the gaming equivalent of a successful movie director directing his own film making his own calls and having no producers or CO'S to reign him in.  so it will either be a subjective masterpiece OR Death Stranding the Phantom menace
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,I think I'm more obsessed with this man than Hideo is 
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,Is that Mads?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,I love Mads to death
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,Neat
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,This just seems like a camera with extra steps
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,Is that Mads Mikkelson?
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,Probably the same technique they used for mass effect andromeda?!
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"Yeah, but these videos always show how good the game graphics will be, and then the game comes out and they look like shit. Always."

63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,If only mass effect Andromeda couldve gotten it like this
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,Yea I'll just wait for non pre rendered gameplay to be the judge of this. Game Devs always try to build to hype when talking about their high tech facial animation but many fail and just end up in uncanny valley

63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"Wow based off the animations alone this game looks like it might be one of the greatest games of all time!

I mean, everybody knows they are _the_ one and only factor in a games success so clearly this will be one for the books."
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,I love this actor! What's his name?
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,Ah I see now. Mass Effect Andromeda just hired bad actors. This is a good actor.

63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,Bioware C team should pay attention and invest in some mocap
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,I don't know why Mads Mikkelsen is the perfect villain to me. I guess he has experience being the bad guy from his other roles as the bad guy.
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,I can put clips together too
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"I never used to be a fan of Kojima, but then I played MGS:TPP and I finally realised what all the hype has been about all these years. I love how much work is put into achieving these kind of graphics. Movies are doing it, games are catching up."

63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,Reminds me of the movie Congress

63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,I guess I just have to live with the fact that anything Kojima-related is always going to be massively overhyped on Reddit.
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,Why would you post these facial animations when you could post the ones star citizen just posted ...
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,I cannot fucking wait for this. 
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,Kojima should just direct a movie. I'm tired of how much effort is put into things that don't even equate to gameplay.
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"This game is gonna use Guerilla's Decima engine. Oh my, this game is gonna look gorgeous."
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,Retarded.  They went through all that trouble to animate the same thing they took a video of.  Ummmm...just use the video
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,What's that guy's name? I know I've seen him before
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,Thanks for showing me like half a second of the actual animation I guess  
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"Are you watching, BioWare?"
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,The eyes! his eyes look and feel real. usually the eyes on these games look without a soul.
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"I've been harping the risk of uncanny game art for years now, but the game consuming community is just now taking it as a serious risk now that it's happened in mass effect. I'm kind of think it's hilarious and clearly I overreacted."
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,Take notes Mass Effect
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"I did not know a second video was released,  looks crazy cool. "

63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,I was just thinking what was going on with this game!

63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,I hate it when they want to put green dots on my eyeballs.
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,can we get some details on the game please?
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,i'm not really crazy about seeing actors' faces in video games now.
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,I have a crush on Mads.
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,I can't fucking WAIT for this game. 
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,This is not gameplay animation... who gives a fuck?
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"Pretty awesome how far animation has come, real excited."

If one of the spin off movies ever took place during the time Qui Gon was alive I believe this guy should play him. He's like the only guy that has the awesomeness of Liam Neeson."
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,I'm so excited and we don't even know anything. Think we'll get gameplay at E3 or later at PlayStation Experience? 
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,Crazy tech. Not wishing time away but i'm super excited for the future of film and video game standards.
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,I preferred Mass Effect Andromeda /s
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,Whats all over his face?  Is that just shitty gif noise or did they spray some kinda motion tracking paint all over him?
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,You could have Hideo Kojima explain Death Stranding to you in a private room and you still wouldn't know what is going on. 
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,I hope this becomes the standard for facial animations in video games. It's a shame Bioware couldn't use this for Andromeda...
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,I'm not seeing much facial animation... 
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,Love Mads Mikkenbonker!

63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,Actor?
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,Someone should tell the mass effect team about this 
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,Yikes
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,Is that Mads Mikkelsen?
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,All they have literally made is the trailer... let's not try to over -hype something that does exist yet
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,Sort of gave me tingles!

63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"Even though i love this Death Stranding thing, and i've been following since it first showed up, i dont think EVERY in game cutscene will have the same treatment as the trailers. There are some truly kino shots in there. "

63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,i really hope the cutscenes don't turn out into a close-up fest like the later Ryu ga Gotoku/Yakuza series. it's like seeing talking facial pores scene after scene.

63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,Nahhhhh. Mass Defect: AndromeDURR still has better facial animations. Mads Mikkelsen's face isn't tired enough.

63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,Bummer the latest Mass Effect didnt use this or something like it

63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,Just slightly better than Mass Effect: Andromeda.

63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"It's not like people expected ME:A to have the best animations in video game history. There's plenty of great games with stiff animations and crude characters that don't get ridiculed about it.

How many people whine about the far more primitive animations in the new Legend of Zelda game?

ME:A is a game that's all about the characters and the scenes and dialogue plays a massive part in it. It obviously has high production value and tons of detail. When you put awful looking characters with bad animations in it, it stands out like a sore thumb and it's not surprising people make fun of it.

It's an example of a case where you shouldn't even try fine facial animations if they are the kind of quality that distracts from the experience and kills immersion.

Still character with subtitles can look more convincing and fitting for the story, than a character that looks like it's having a stroke while spewing out voice acting that makes you go ""wtf?"", especially when it's the one thing the player is focusing on while you zoom camera at it."

63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"For every CGI cutscene you need an animated face, if you would use a live action film it would arguably be more costly, limit your possibilities, and most probably the characters in game would look different. So by animating the character from a real live model you get more realistic movements & animations of characters in game and expressions. Which you then can use for ingame models as well as in cutscenes"
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"Yes it does. Actually, here's a good video explaining how this works:
https://vimeo.com/176540666"
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"Pre-rendered cutscenes vs actual gameplay. There's a difference.

All of the Mass effect dialogue and cut scenes happens on the in-games engine. Also, considering that there's no set main character facial features, they can't spend days on every single frame getting every single area just right. (Otherwise a face you created might end up clipping through itself).

I'm not really excusing bioware for some spotty animations, but you can't compare it to this.

63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"Someone medically trained can correct me if I'm wrong, but that's pursuit eye movements with vertical corrective saccades.  
  
I studied CG and facial animation at university a long time ago, just when micro-expressions in animation were becoming a thing. They're impressive to me, and are why I think facial motion capture like this at high capture rates are so important these days. Microexpressions are generally less than a 5th of a second, they're usually involuntary, and express hidden emotions. I think that's what separates the really good actors because you need to be in the frame of mind of the character to stand a chance of presenting believable microemotions. They give you the little hints when ""you just know"" someone is lying, or hiding something. Mads is actually really good at this.  
  
His macroexpressions (longer than a 5th of a second, the general grins etc that we're used to) aren't that obvious, but little flexes in his eyes, twitches on the corners of his mouth, these things need to be captured. This was the thing that threw me off about the CG characters in Rogue One, for obvious reasons I don't think they really captured the microexpressions naturally for the actors they were portraying which gave a bit of a wooden feel to them.  
  
Here's a really interesting piece about how this was captured and used in the curious case of benjamin button http://www.cgsociety.org/index.php/CGSFeatures/CGSFeatureSpecial/curious_case_of_benjamin_button"
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"For anyone curious, these movements are called saccades and can be either consciously controlled (when scanning a room), or unconsciously initiated (when looking at a face and your eyes naturally dart around their features). Microsaccades also occur all the time without your brain perceiving it, and can be fracked with an eye tracker to show how erratic they really are constantly! "
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"Not for Mass Effect Andromeda, apparently..."
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"Well if you have watched a lot of Mads' stuff, he has this weird smile which is like a millimeter away from being his resting face. You can see it in the trailer. "

63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"Which is why I'd never describe Mads as Stone faced. Stone faced, to me, describes absolute expressionless. Which is the last way I'd describe Mads. He's the absolute best actor I've ever seen in terms of microexpressions. Watching Hannibal is insane how much emotion and expression he can put into a shot while seemingly not doing much expression wise. "

I've seen the ""WOW 40 million and this!?!?"" comments everywhere. They think they are putting the game down when it's pretty impressive how big MEA is with that budget. 

Also, the money used towards developing is normally around 60%, so MEA only has ~25million."
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"Budget isn't why the animation was bad in Andromeda though. If that were the case they could have reused the old algorithm and still had Mass Effect 3-ish animations. The problem was that the Bioware higher ups didn't give the animators full control over the animation process. Instead, they outsourced to another company that did some kind of shoddy 3D scans or something. This is precisely why the Aliens in ME:A look much better than humans, they had to be animated be the animators. Anyhow, animation isn't the only problem with Andromeda. The game has a plethora of glitches and, frankly, just wasn't finished. "
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,surely they could reuse a lot of their previous games/

It would be unfair to compare it to say a live action film but it's completely legitimate to compare two triple A video games to one another.

63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"I still struggle with FF VII's graphics, but it's just such a *gorgeous* game that I can get by anyway."
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,Warcraft 3 was the same. Going for a cartoony atmosphere with as much detail as the gen comfortably allows is a great way to have a game age well.
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"The pre-rendered backgrounds in ff7 was amazing looking and still holds up very well imo. This with the fact that they didn't try to make characters super detailed works really well. It gave a special aesthetic look that isn't too horrible and mostly just makes things look fun (like Heidegger when he's laughing or when Barret goes on a rampage waving his arms everywhere and cussing).

I think the game would have looked quite bad (or at least aged badly) if they'd tried to make characters too detailed, which is sort of a pet peeve of mine in FF8, I think they tried to make characters   a bit too detailed in that game, still a really good game though."

63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"Same, I didn't feel satisfied with MGSV but that wasn't Kojima's fault it was Konami's fault so I do agree with you that he should take his time since Sony is giving him full control of the game. "
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"I was trying to figure out why they had him bother looking *down* at all, since the rig was just capturing the front of his face no matter where it's pointed.

Then I realized that there will be other subtle things captured, like the set of his jaw as his head moves and the eye tracking.  At that point I scrunched up my lips and nodded sagely at the screen."
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,You're correct. Our eyes don't smoothly move to locate anything. The eye is constantly focusing and refocusing on things in the field as you pan or move your head. That's what causes the jerk as the eye lags then catches up.
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"After reading that article about Benjamin Button's CG head, I'm even more bothered by Rogue One's severe uncanny valley effect.

I think you're right that the failure to properly capture microexpressions is a big part of why Rogue One's [CG Tarkin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsuvXHGCVXE#t=0m20s) was uncanny.  They completely failed to reproduce *discrete* movements - changes in CG Tarkin's facial expression are far too smooth.  The fake actor's facial movements are continuous, but real facial expressions can change quickly enough that it looks like an instant (discrete) movement."

63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"Absolutely, Hannibal is in my top five shows of all time. Even in Doctor Strange he did a marvelous job at making a seemingly cold and hateful character human in a very subtle way most actors can't. You see the exact same thing in his brother Lars. "
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,Agree completely. He is better than any actor I can think of at conveying emotion through just tiny movements of his face. It feels like you know what the character is thinking.
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"If you're reading this and like TV shows...do yourself a favor and watch Hannibal now. In HD, at least 720p, none of this 480p SD crap some people still do. This show is shot *so well* and is so aesthetically pleasing to the eyes that it deserves to not be seen cheaply.

It's only 3 seasons long because of NBC ratings problems, but everyone involved with the show has indicated that they are willing to return to it in the coming years because it's that damn good...and I'm fully expecting that to happen one day. Watch it, you won't be disappointed, I guarantee it. "

63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,I dunno. EA was apparently willing to extend the debt time but Bioware opted to release as is.
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,The Witcher 3 had a significantly larger budget. 
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"Two reasons I can think of off the top of my head:  
Bioware is not the same as they were when they made 1,2,& 3 there are different people running the show now and they are put there by EA and odds are they don't give as much of a fuck as the people who used to run it.   
The other reason, I don't think it had as big of an impact as the first one, is that they switched the engine from unreal to frostbite. I only add that cause its the only other major difference from 1,2, & 3 outside of game play and story.  "
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,I replayed Mass Effect 2 and 3 and the animation is definitely laughable at times. Andromeda definitely has its hiccups but for the most time it's solid. And that's not to mention that many of the aliens have very realistic animation.
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"It's a new engine, Frostbite. So it is a lot more difficult."
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"Depends how Unreal and Frostbite like stuff. If they have to do too much work, it might be worth just redoing it from scratch anyway. "
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"Comparing hand made animations to mocap is like comparing PS3 grahpics to PS4 graphics.

And there were a lot of awkward moments when I'd start thinking something looked really good before remembering that it's supposed to be *people*.

63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"I don't think that's going to be the case. I feel like we're hitting marginal gains at this point. I was a kid when Mario 64 and Goldeneye came out. Ten years prior to that it was the og metroid, zelda, etc. That's a massive jump in graphics. 

Ten years after that, games start looking more like they do today, just fuzzier, shittier lighting, smaller overall detail and scale. So we're in 2006 at this point for those of you just tuning in. Gears of war is new along with halo 3 and modern warfare 1 to come a year later in 2007. Now we're at ten years before present. Games can sometimes look photo realistic now, but unremastered modern warfare still looks feels a lot like any current cod with the settings turned down to not quite potato. The same couldn't be said about super Mario to Mario 64. 

I think in the near future we will get to a point where gameplay looks like a pre rendered cut scene. Vr graphics I think will basically get to the point of matching non vr level quality. 

That's my dumb unsolicited opinion anyway. "

I can imagine the facial details getting more real as well as the animation, and the frame rates solid 90fps, but aesthetically I think we're getting close to the limit of what we can express.

Theres already starting to be a diminishing return - we will see a lot of changes over the next 10 years, but they will be far less drastic.

Why would you assume that when both ME:2 and ME:3 used a combination of motion capture for the key frames and then hand/procedural animation?

Andromeda is just really, really crappy on this front. I think to anyone who knows anything about computer animation it's quite clear that they never even bothered to clean up the animations that the studio they outsourced the work to delivered. 

My guess is that some idiot executive decided they could save money by shipping the animation work to another team using a new technology that was supposed to ""save time and money"" and the result was just garbage and then they left it as garbage instead of fixing it (well, they are fixing it **now** that everyone has mocked them for it).

Anyway, the point being - Clearly EA and Bioware have both the money and experience in doing this type of work correctly. They just chose not to this time for ""reasons"" (which we'll probably never know).

63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"Ok, as someone who played Batman on Amstrad (and Head Over Heels), Commander fucking Keen and grew up on Doom (and actually got scared playing bits of it because realism)  and Quake, remember getting hyped about MMX, bought a Voodoo, remember the thrill of first playing half life, the wait for HL2, the birth of CS, getting a new PC and getting to play MW2 on it with decent framerates, and now the proud owner of a Vive...

Graphics at any one point in time have seemed like the zenith. I mean, we all knew Quake and Unreal looked a bit shitty and not really realistic, but they were beautiful for what they were. I remember just standing looking at the waterfall at the start of Unreal stunned at how pretty it was and how amazing the new engine was.

I don't think photorealism is the only goal here. I can mod Skyrim to the point a lot of it is pretty photorealistic, but as soon as I actually do anything it's clear it's not really real. Similarly I can add fucking tons of texture packs and mods to Silent Hunter 3 and it looks stunning, and 99% of the play being in the sea means you don't need to deal with a lot of shit to make it look pretty realistic (since the sub itself already looks pretty damn good, but I look at my crew for a second and I know it's not real (and so would anyone just watching my play).

This is how it is with old games as well. I could look at stuff and be immersed almost fully. Why did I get scared in Doom? Because I was a kid and when it was dark with flickering lights - that was realistic and immersive, especially when you can hear grunts around you, then you see something run at you and the immersion dies and you're having fun shooting stuff. The waterfall in Unreal is the same, while appreciating the new stuff that was there (lens flare effects and shit) and it was clear would drive games going forward.

So what's actually going to happen? We will continue improving graphics, and yeah, we will probably get past uncanny valley at some point. We will also eventually do VR right and make it popular (still not sure it will manage to take off this generation, although I hope it does) because it will become the only really viable next tech choice (if it doesn't happen now, I think you'll see refinement of technology in the background and the SDKs available to make it easier for devs (this difficulty is not helping the market).

What's left after that? AI behaviour, better sound, better controls (I like the teleport locomotion method, but it's still not perfect right?), procedural levels, procedurally generated stories, full body tracking (honestly I don't want to have to wear sensors either), full immersion.

There's always going to be something to make you go wow just round the corner, don't become too cynical or you'll miss it."

63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"I agree with you particularly regarding VR processing requirements. Personally, I see correlations between the graphical improvements of today, and improvement with CPUs from 15 years ago.

As CPUS started getting closer to maximum clock speeds, chip manufactures just started adding more cores to increase workload. VR is kinda the same thing. It might not require more detailed assets etc, but it requires most games to be rendered twice, essentially. As higher texture resolutions start to return less on investment, maybe we will see a ""parallelization"" of graphic workload, to increase immersion.  "
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"This. 100% this. Plus, don't forget about tactile feedback in vr and mixed reality.  The future is now. "
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"Lighting and physics, both.

The latter being the big leap that will take longer.  Simulating realistic physics is so resource intensive that we just about fake everything about it.  Realistic physical interactions, from flowing water to just having a car have a specific weight and creating actual tread impressions.  We're still a ways off on that."
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"Lighting is very good nowadays, especially with PBR-based pipelines. Look at the newest Hitman game for an example of good lighting nowadays.

What is however still very much in its infancy is animation. You see a screenshot of a game with nice lighting and textures and think, wow, this looks photorealistic. Then the characters move, and the illusion is shattered.

So, there is a lot of room for improvement. It can go all the way up to hugely complex stuff like this scenario: an AI controlled guard is alerted and starts running. You placed an obstacle in the corridor. How will the guard react? If it is a scripted animation, the obstacle will usually be ignored, or the guard will be treated like a solid object with infinite force. Stuff like Euphoria adds some dynamic behavior, but it is still limited. The ""proper"" solution requires an AI controlling the guard (so, no scripted movements), which is very difficult to pull off."

63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"I agree, and destructible environments can be improved a ton. It's more common than it used to be, but very far from perfect.

Maybe some day all in-game objects will be made out of particles with individual bond strengths and weaknesses, and close to real-life physics governing how and when they break.

It will be decades from now just for the computing power to do this in real-time, let alone the time it will take for the programming. I think that's a pretty logical place for games to someday wind up, though, even if it actually takes 40 - 150 years. Maybe quantum computing will pan out and lead to this sooner."
63bvxc,2017-04-04,2017-04-04,"I think the new VR craze will bring some needed attention to the world of video game animations. As a Vive owner, its become pretty apparent that traditional animation and video game physics are currently not ready for there to be a real player in the game experiencing and touching things in a first person perspective.

Enemies go through their typical state machine animations which players will have an advantage over in VR since they can do whatever movement they can in real life. Game physics aren't ready to handle a force in the real world interacting with virtual objects and thus the objects tend to spasm wildly or ruin the players gameplay and immesion in some way.

VR has its own issues to work out with its problems of locomotion, adapting to different body sizes of players, etc. But basically, VR might be really expensive right now and not really flying off the shelves, but it's definitely shining a light down into the gaming world showing that there is still much to be done to make video games better."

13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Kojima in his typical style said everything is broken and everything has changed. That's death stranding.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"Kojima ""we made this mechanics so players can help each other online""

redditor ""the purpose of this game is to play offline"""
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"Playing offline is really fun, it really drives the sense of adventure home, you have to prepare a lot more carefully for your journey in the absence of other players structures and actually have a reason to raid the enemy camps for building materials, playing online especially this late feels like once you connect a place to the network any place you think is challenging will have ladders, ropes, roads, ziplines already placed by other players"

13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,I’ve always though if I decided to play this game again I would do a challenge run. No roads or vehicles allowed would be a good one!
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,The real message of death stranding is dont be so serious
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"The real message of death stranding is the feeling you get while hiking in the game is almost the same feeling of pure relaxation you get while hiking in real life..... basically if you haven't or don't, you need to start hiking"
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,I thought the point of it was so people were more aware of their posture when walking
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"A Mayan King Pacal Votan had also prohesized that man will hold dear to them the artifical and abandon nature. Krishna at the end of Mahabharata had also said that he can see 4 different follies ahead in Kali Yuga. I folly in each direction, one of which was man abandoning nature."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,This game had no right to be as fun as it was.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"I think you missed the message, bud."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"“Welcome to the real world.”

13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"Kojima ""I want to make a game that makes tinhat peppers look kinda cool"""
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,The real message of Death Stranding is that Norman Reedus likes drinking Monster Energy.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,I thought the message was make more babies
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"Y'know, I remember staying up all night playing this game just full zen mode the day it released.

Let me tell you, as one of the first people to actually reach the part of the game where you make roads, getting the materials back and forth to construct them (and having nearly no other people contribute because I was doing it too quickly) made later just gliding across the entire map on them feel so incredibly rewarding.

Plus, getting just a couple of likes every time someone used the road I made added up *really* quickly.

Then I proceeded to do the same thing with a Zipline network through the mountains. Building your own fast travel network through otherwise incredibly difficult terrain just **hits**."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"I think that's one step before the culmination of the main message of Death Stranding >!with the reveal that you were reconnecting the nation just so that Amelie can enact the Last Stranding and destroy everything!<, which in one form is that basically as globalization and social connectivity is exploding, don't forget the people that are closest to you >!as shown that Sam stopping her from doing so by showing her that his real journey was all the friends he made along the way!<, and that while those connections as difficult as they can be to maintain and how much they can take from you, they are ultimately irreplaceable. 

Doesn't mean you can't or shouldn't have those mass social networks per se, just keep those closest to you still"
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"Played it 100% offline the first time around, had a great time. I might go the online route for a 2nd playthrough, but I firmly believe everyone should have the lonesome courier experience at least once."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,That title makes absolutely 0 sense
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Should I play this game?
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,I thought it was respect your mailman
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"I thought the message was ""A Hideo Kojima production by Hideo Kojima."""
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"Man, I can’t wait to see what he’s cooking with Xbox. Death Stranding 2 will probably be great but I want to see something new from Kojima."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,The real message was that video games can be boring as well
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"Our ancestors connected with nature by getting eaten by bears and sabertooth tigers.

Here's an idea.

Fuck nature."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,The real message of DS was the friends we made all along.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,The real message is that Kojima is so self-important that he thinks hours of boring pretentious cutscenes improve video games and that his are worth suffering.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Sad builder noises - when I was playing I purposefully built stretches of road for everyone to use.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"Yeah, but how do you get the sweet dopamine hit of someone else liking or using your structure?"
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Yeah.... I'll stick to my ziplines for the snowy mountains tho'...surely MY nature would understand
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"hard mode, trully"
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Deaths Stranding is two different games when offline and online.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,I thought the real message was that everyone is a little beach.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-15,"I played Death Stranding a few months ago and I just think there's something that's such a shame with Kojima's design philosophy, particularly with his unforgivably bad stories.  There's a great game there, it's just when the story starts coming back that fun game goes away and you're just bored beyond comprehension watching this laughably awful story play out.  The same problem existed in all the MGS games.  I wish he'd make a game that had no story at all.  He has good ideas, it's just that literally none of them involve story.  His story presentation is the worst in gaming history and the stories he tells don't justify the tedium of passively absorbing the story when you just want to play the game."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-15,Keep on keeping on
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-27,this could explain death stranding 2's supposed theme with the draw bridges and the message 'should we have connected?'
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Idk why you're getting downvotes in the comments. For my first playthrough I played offline on the hardest difficulty and I am so glad that I did. Real sense of progression when I was the one figuring out how to interact with the environmental obstacles. Building a complete road or zipline network felt like massive accomplishments.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,My achievement was MGS4 no alerts and no killing play through. (If you are not going to be seen you might as well not anyone either)
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"Although, is nature really worth the trouble of losing technological and societal conveniences?"
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,But the 'nature' in that game looks for the most part to be barren and depressing. Or does that change?
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Play it without a computer and actually walk outside
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Just go out and connect with actual nature
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"Can someone... Help me to understand your perspective on why playing this game is fun?

I'm playing... But after 4 hours into it I'm not really enjoying the walking"
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Hell. O bridges make the game so much better. I don’t want those scary things grabbing me
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"The real message of Death Stranding is: you don't have much time, so don't waste it and play only good games from now on. It's a powerful message and it rings true."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"Reconnecting to nature by playing a video game about it, then posting about it on the internet. I can practically smell the fresh cut grass...🙄"
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Or go outside into nature.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"dude turn off the computer and go get some sun, pick some flowers."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,This game bored the hell out of me.  I tried to like it but just didn’t click.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"I thought the message was you are a sadist if you can put up with monotonous and over simplified game mechanics just to enjoy the narrative

Spotting how the engine takes shortcuts in rendering is fun for a few minutes too"
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-15,"the real message of DS was not, ""keep fetuses in jars to survive ghosts""?"
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-15,Why are we still here?
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"I thought the message was ""Being a postman sucks and is really fucking boring""."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,I really like playing through death stranding but in all honesty I would never go back and replay it. It’s just a walking simulator with a wacky story. Without the roads and bridges it’s a barren wasteland.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,No matter what it's a still courier simulator.

13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,I've finished the game without rebuilding anything that game didn't ask me to do and it was pain in the ass in some locations and i'd gladly try to build all the roads if only it didn't ask for 10000000 of resources to do so
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-15,my brother in christ do not
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-15,"It has the most absurdly idiotic story that has ever been told in ANY medium.  Extreme plot holes, tropes galore, horrid dialogue. Profoundly stupid names of characters.

**THE ONLY REASON IT IS NOT UNIVERSALLY RECOGNIZED AS A DOGSHIT GAME IS BECAUSE IT IS JAPANESE** 

Stupid fucking weeaboos make everything worse"
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,OP os about to have the worst time lol
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"You know you can go outside and walk, right?
Then you really would be connecting with nature"
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,I thought the message was sometimes pretty games aren't good games
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,And Amelie is the worst character in any Hideo Kojima game ever made
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,I thougt the real message was that going outside and taking a hike is more fun than this game lmao.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,You want to play it wrong because you're feeling a bit hippy today?
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,So the purpose of the the first strand-type game is to give that honor to some other game
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"the purpose of this game is to play offline"""
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,a game about literally anything and people would still buy it.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"I don't think i built a single road in the whole game.

And i didn't manage to reconnect untill the end because of a bug.

Tbh i never saw the point of roads, they take too much resources to build alone."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"Honestly mate, it's mostly going to feel the same as the base, online game.

I never really ever felt ""connected"" to other people, because I never saw them. I only ever saw the trash they left around, occasionally.

It's like being in a public Minecraft server, but everyone else is offline.

And the game totally bullshits it during boss-fights when ""other players"" come to help you by giving you items. Those aren't other players! Those are AI with some players' name slapped on it!

It's just kind of a weak attempt at making a pseudo multiplayer but it honestly would have been better if they just added co-op."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"I mean playing this offline when you are trying to be a completionist seems absolutely maddening so I hope that’s not part of the deal.

I did every single mission when I last played and I can’t imagine having had the resources to do that without structures from other players. I mean sometimes I had to destroy their stuff in the way but it was mostly helpful."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"I like to think the message is to build relationships because they are the only things that outlast the inevitability of entropy. Cuz at the end of the game, all your work in rebuilding infrastructure falls apart as you race back across America. It's like a K-hole of loving hope."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Ummm no
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Roads? Where we are going we don’t need roads
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,One of the greatest games of all time
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Lol ok
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"I actually loved playing DS offline, it was more tedious, but I did enjoy the challenge."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,To be fair it's testament to game design that even years later we can make clueless comments on what the game wanted to do.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"There was a message?

Because while fun as hell the games story was some vague ideas wrapped in pseudo-philosophical languages that ultimately says nothing and demonstrates a lack of understanding of the subject matter by the writer.

You know, a Hideo Kojima game."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,How can you know what the message is when Kojima himself doesnt understand the story he wrote?
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,It’s actually about cooperation. The more people work together the easier life gets.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"I want to go back and finish the platinum for this, but I wonder how much more time i have to sink into it. I also wonder how much I have to rebuild/build from all this time away from the game. After beating  the story, it felt really grindy before i moved on from it."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"True. Also, it's established in the beginning that you can be convinced to labor, persuade others and serve a will through concepts like nation, family, grief, beauty etc. Don't know who or what you're even listening to by the end, or why you were ever doing it... AI? You helped them connect all over and reach further. Gameification."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-15,This is what I feel like a lot of people missed on release day. I randomly happened to be in a position where I could dump 70+ hrs into this game over 2 weeks on release day and dug in. Only missing thing is I felt like I was trail blazing for other players. I’d go back and build stuff in all the difficult places because of that. Beautiful game though. Would highly recommend playing it the way you are.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-15,"talk about nature, this game almost has no animal on the map, which is weird"
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-15,The message is to drink monster energy drinks.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-15,"I played it entirely in offline mode and loved it.

Watched a family member play it online and seemed like an entirely different game when there was so much infrastructure built for them to use"
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-15,then you find out that nature isn't really human's friend :p
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-15,"LOL

no.  The message of DS is ""Kojima is a delusional hack who uses his status as a ""senpai"" in the Japanese gaming industry to abuse his co-workers and make non-sensical games that are ONLY not completely panned because he is Japanese.""

  Weeaboos love awful stories and bad gameplay."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-15,"I don't know much about this game, but a if new gamer bought and played for the first time with an online connection, is the map pretty much built up or something?"
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-15,"I played the non directors cut version during the 1 week the servers were down. Finished it solo never went online once. It was a lonely experience in a weird way and I am glad I did it. But, I then found out the servers do work they were just broken, so I got the DC and now I am doing it with roads going for a full completion!"
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-16,"I didn't realise this, I invested so many hours in building roads and cables alone."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-16,I'm pretty sure the message of *DS* is the necessity of building community.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-25,this game was fucking terrible got all the way to chapter 4 and did a ton of side stuff. overrated hot piece of garbage beautiful graphics and voice acting though
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,[deleted]
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"The first time I played DS, was during the pandemic. My god, it was meant for that time. I just restarted it and am still blown away by how beautiful it is."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"The real message of Death Stranding that I got was that nothing quenches your thirst and gives you the energy you need to face the day quite like a Monster™ brand Energy Drink.

Whether you're delivering packages, running for your life from BTs, or just carrying around a magic fetus, Monster™ Energy Drinks - unleash the beast!"
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,I thought the message of Death Stranding was that Hideo Kojima could make a game about literally anything and people would still buy it.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,or when in doubt throw poop grenade
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14, I was playing I purposefully built stretches of road for everyone to use.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"The dozen or so hours I managed to play the game, I found the walking around and finding your way to the waypoint the best thing in the game. Having other players stuff there lessened the experience for me. Playing it offline seems like a good way to play it."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Nothing wrong with finding new reasons and ways to replay a game.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-15,"Yeah, it was very rewarding to build roads and other structures that other players can use as well, plus finding other useful structures that players built in your world was cool as well.

The game would not nearly be as good if it was all offline."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,True but also player structures won't appear until you've locked that structure for yourself to make too. So it sorta puts a stop to early game cheese
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"What online world were you in? Mine everything was haphazardly placed. Ziplines lead to nowhere or where just always slightly out of range to force me to build a second one right next to it. Bridges for tiny gaps. Ladders that made you fall after reaching the top.

And I basically had to build all the damn roads by myself so I was always raiding."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,And also pee to make mushrooms
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Music is also really good.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"Yes. Everyone who told you ""It's just a walking sim"" was a liar who never touched the game"
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"the bosses are fucking insanity, in more ways than one."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Ladder physics?
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,It's been a lot of fun so far. I'm only up to the Weather Station and about to set out to the Farm at the moment. Crossing the mountains and getting LLL ranking is going to be a challenge.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-15,You won't complete the game until 2025
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,I love it when I'm out hiking and get assaulted by invisible ghost people
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,The big thing the game is missing is the “spend 45 minutes removing the ticks from you” part of the hiking.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-17,"While I didn't like it as a game, I loved it as an experience."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"This sounds cool, what were the other 3?"
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Its always crazy to me to hear all the love for this game when i found it so boring and horribly redundant.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Lol what this game is a masterpiece and has so many perfectly executed mechanics to make it's seemingly tedious gameplay just absolutely engrossing

13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"I agree it was great, I felt happyness in some of my most liked structures and did my best to help people out with useful placements. 

I've just played it that way on PS4 and PS5 and wanted to replay it with as big of a challenge as I could think of. No roads whatsoever and no helpful structures from anyone else seems the best way to do that."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"I did the same with the zip line network! Man, I could get anywhere in that mountain town in like a minute."

13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Like Kojima himself.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,And it's absolutely phenomenal
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-15,"His name appears NINE times in the intro credits.

Fucking delusional narcissist"
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"I mean hopefully xbox got a good director to reign him in.

My number 1 takeaway from death stranding is kojima is the batshit crazy artistic vision that needs someone to filter it into a playable product.

Theres alot of interesting things going on but too many different threads and none of them connect well to being the comcast direct ups man, and the games controls often feel like they are actively punishing you for trying to play."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,">Fuck nature.

You mean... like, literally?"
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"Man, some of the best feelings were coming back into the game and finding a bridge that you didn't have materials for... or added road stretches that picked up where yours left off.

Thank you -- it probably didn't impact _my_ game but I'm certain it had a direct impact on others."

13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Nope.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"I don't know whereabouts in the game you're up to, but if the walking is not for you and may make you quit my advice would be to stick to the story and get more tools under your belt to make walking a less frequent requirement. You can always go back to do the none story deliveries later when you have better tools. 

You can also look up what equipment each installation gives you and decide based on that what you'd like to focus on in the short term."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"Get to the second map as quickly as possible by just doing main story stuff, then the real game begins and you can go blast bandits or hunt ghosts. There will also be buildable highways so you can drive a bike or truck, if you don't want to walk."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"I would recommend rushing to chapter 3 so you get a vehicle and the gameplay loop gets better. If after that you still don't enjoy it, it's probably just not for you. It's definitely not for everyone."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"It takes a little while to ramp up and get good. Once you get to chapter 3 the game really opens up. You'll get access to vehicles, weapons, etc."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Ziplines?
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,You say that like it's an insult.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Holy shit what a misguided take on death stranding
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Holy projection.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,The real message was the friends you made along the way....
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-15,"kinda fit the storyline, don't u think ?"
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-15,"The maps are broken up into invisible area zones, with each one surrounding an outpost. You have to get the outposts to join Bridges, but before you do that the zone around them is offline. This means every time you're heading into a new area there's no player structures. You have to make your way alone with whatever tools you have. 

When you bring the outpost online it'll then load up the structures players have put in. You won't ever get everything you want from other players, so they'll always be things you'll want to remove and things you'll want to add yourself. It's fairly balanced, even now."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,I didn't even know this game had bosses lol.  I've only ever seen the walking bits.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"If you throw a blood grenade, then shoot physical bullets through the blood clouds or into the blood stains on the BT it does more damage than blood bullets"
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Bloodborne taught us well.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Hopefully ds2 allows you to Jizz on your enemies
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,You mean there's another way??
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,How else are you supposed to beat them? The guns suck!
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,That's how beat all the bosses lol
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"I also played it under quarantine, and proceeded to listen to the soundtrack every day after. It just hits you right in the feels, both the tone of the game and the soundtrack. It was the perfect reflection of the feeling of living in the shadow of a pandemic."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-15,"Yup. April-June of 2020 was me turning off my zoom meetings, spinning the chair around to the TV and finding this game so relaxing,  the irony was not lost on me"
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-15,"I like how timefall gets filtered into monster energy.

they could've just used a normal filter and turn it into a NORMAL drink (or no filter at all, since timefall turns into ordinary water once it touches something) but the implication is that they used advanced technology to filter all rain into MONSTER ENERGY"
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"Yeah, that product placement wasn't a good decision from a game design standpoint IMHO. Luckily it got replaced with a Bridges Energy drink in the director's cut."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,You could argue that a good game maker could make a fun game based on any subject.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-15,"I never really understood the mechanics, there. I just built roads and saw sometimes I didn't need to - anyone have a reference or easy to digest link on how that worked? I dont trust anything written by Kojima to be simple"
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Which is interesting because I found the exact opposite. I loved building things knowing other players would come along and use them. I went around building roads just because I knew other players would be happy for the help. Going around and getting 5 Star deliveries on the roads knowing other players had come along and built them was an amazing experience for me. The moment I fell in love with the game was right after the first BT encounter when another player's rope saved me.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-15,"There isn't THAT many player created structures though, you still have to work out the best route."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-15,"That’s why it was great playing it during release. You would have to built most stuff yourself, but could appreciate every new thing that popped out too"
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"I agree, but that's not what your title communicated."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,This is one of those weird instances where Reddit starts downvoting tf out of a comment that has literally no reason to be downvoted

13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"I played the cracked version offline, it's a pain in the ass, it's slow and boring imho, however if you're into slow games, you might enjoy it"
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"You can make it across the largest snow peak on foot. I did it by accident and still have memories, of it like it was a real thing. Such a pilgrimage.

I'm going to do a no vehicle play through too, pedestrian traversal was great. Will you use zip lines?"
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"I got LLL on all premium orders. Unfortunately, it is impossible to get LLL on many orders without vehicles. Timed-large orders mostly."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"It’s not gonna be a challenge, it’s gonna be straight up impossible, specially with the timed orders."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-15,Honestly I feel if you B-Line the main story you could beat Death Stranding in 50-60 hours without using vehicles or roads.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,And when I throw my piss at passerby....pure bliss
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"To be fair invisble ghost people are a hundred times better than running into a single bear.

I was actually worried about that to be honest the game started with deer and other animals after all. Imagine being loaded up on foot and then out of no where getting run down by a half starved grizzly."

13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"The best one that I remember is A Cow literally licking her own calf to death, this signifies too much attachement to things or to your children, the most common one that everyone talks about is Brothels and Bars becoming the place of worship, instead of Church or Temple, the last one was if I am  not mistaken, profit at any cost, this means corrupt businesses ane exploitative work cultures all over."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-15,"No.

You only say this because it’s Japanese.   It’s the opposite of a masterpiece,  whatever that is.  The fans of this piece of misbegotten shit are the most disingenuous weeaboo pseudo intellectual idiots who are why so much shit sucks today.

You like awful shit.  You like it BECAUSE it’s bad.  You are a being of badness."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,They played us like a damn fiddle!
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"No one should reign Kojima in, nor could they even try. He’s always been that way and why his games and ideas are so innovative. Kojima is the director, not sure why you think someone else would be doing that."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"Kim Swift is the head of “Xbox Games Studios Publishing senior director of cloud gaming”. She will be the director of the Kojima game. 

If you don’t know who she is, just know that she directed Portal and also lead the development of the two Left 4 Dead games."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,His many fans say you're wrong
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"Ideally figuratively.

With rampant industrialization, ecological devastation and climate change.

Literally fucking it is how HIV happened."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,So everyone's games don't start with roads finished at all from someone adding all the required materials in their game? I did see finished bridges and zip lines when I went through.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"Besides basic necessities like air. Communication, entertainment, societal belonging. These are things that are absent among the characters of days gone, with most people living in secluded underground bunkers. An increased connection with nature in a situation like that really doesn’t seem like anything grand."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Oh... Would be pretty cool if the map became more and more green and lush the less players used/ built infrastructure or something. Shame.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Never finished the game scared me too much lol
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"It's more like a logistics simulator through rugged terrain, you start traveling on foot with some ropes and ladders but progressively end up with a lot of futuristic gadgets, vehicles, weapons and infrastructure that keep the gameplay in constant evolution until the end. Reaching your destination is a puzzle and is the highlight of the gameplay, there is also shooting action and horror sequences but it's not the focus all the time. You can also give and receive help from other players through shared structures, signs, material and tools donations, and other interactions."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,its much more than just walking
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,It has an excellent- and extremely weird- story and I can’t wait for the sequel personally.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,This game is phenomenal. My top 3
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"It is the worst part of the game, the game didnt needed Higgs"

13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"I thought it was hilarious. There's even a poster for that ""Ride with Norman Reedus"" show in the safehouse.

For better or worse, Kojima likes doing fourth wall breaks for cheesy comedic relief and I look forward to them every time."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"I'm not surprised considering Untitled Goose Game, Goat Simulator, and House Flipper were all well-received."

13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,That’s what I read from the title. I took it at face value. It seems you may be bringing interpretation instead of the stated intent to the table.

The first half of MGS5 was heavily reigned by Konami.  The second half they let Kojima do his nonsensical dogshit racist game stuff.  Needless to say the first half of MGS5 was excellent.  The latter was dongshit"
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-15,"> No one should reign Kojima in, nor could they even try.

Laughs in Konami, telling him to fuck off after he requested once again for way more money than the budget he first claimed to need."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"Not to mention, humanity would've died out in DS if it hadn't been for technology.

We wouldn't survive the timefall and BTs by hiding in caves and shitting in rivers, we wouldn't have food without automated farms making wheat in the timefall rain ultra quickly, we needed plastic raincoats that never biodegrade, and couriers with floating hoverboard cargo carriers and electric trucks, and being able to order medical supplies from other cities and have it arrive within an hour or two."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"Nah, that’d be kinda anti-the entire point of the game. It’s about connecting people together after it was all destroyed."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"That's a great description, I've never been able to really explain what I like about Death Stranding in a way that informs other people whether or not they might like it."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"Fuck man, nothing is worse than being loaded up with cargo, falling, then having the cargo float away in a stream or down a steep incline."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"As Maximilian Uriarte once put it:

“It’s called Death Stranding. You play as this guy everyone treats like shit, humping around in the rain with a ton of stuff on your back, drinking nothing but monster energy, all while taking care of a baby that isn’t yours. It’s the best game about the Marine Corps infantry I’ve ever played.”"
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Oh wow. You really actually made me want to try it now. I guess I only saw the jokes and was like…that’s all you do?
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,I hated the action parts. Otherwise its a very relaxing game of a post apocalypse postman.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,I'm about to start playing it. Does the online interactions require a PS Plus subscription?

13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,There's also jogging and running!
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Not that much more lol. Not till the end at least.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Some of the most memorable characters as well. Discovering Heartman in his lab was a magical experience for me.

Wheels did create a bypass of some of the the most fun game mechanics."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"Yes the Sanatani scriptures give a lot of  detail for a whole lot of things, the Mahabharata itself shows how own blood fights against own blood, corrupted by Maya, which is the Matrix of all things material.

 When Draupadi was being forcefully humiliated by Duryodhan and his brothers, nobody dared to challenge the man in power, all became onlookers, even the King of the Kingdom, this is like Harvey Weistein taking advantage of girls looking to make it in Hollywood, for decades and despite everyone knowing about it, kept mum, because Harvey weilded the ultimate power and nobody wanted to lose their jobs, not even Di Caprio or Brad Pitt, who  most people worship and whatnot. 

It's why I like Kojima's games, he has read a lot of scriptures and the fact that he decided to make a game like DS says a lot. He likes to draw from those ancient works."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-15,Yes all four directions lol.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-16,Wat?  I love Norman Reedus. The cast in the game was spectacular.  Everything else was extraordinarily stupid. But it’s Japanese right!?!?
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Ah okay. I've never actually played it but it's always intrigued me. It's been sat in my backlog for ages but life/ other titles have took precedence. OP's post just made so much sense from an outsider's view 😂
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"My favourite thing was building a zipline railway across the mountains that basically connected half the map and hideouts in the mountains.

13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"It’s slower and less balance making it more challenging.  Later in the game you get exoskeletons that improve your speed or carrying ability.  It’s been a while, so it’s possible I could be wrong on the exoskeletons abilities.  There’s also a hovering cargo float unlocked later in the game and you can load up so you can carry more or less.  

Kojima really did a great job on allowing players to strategize the approach and cargo.  While the story didn’t fully connect with me the game while frustrating at times was a good change of pace from the usual games I play."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"It’s slower but you have to understand that walking **is** the gameplay. 

It’s the task you have to navigate to complete your goals the same way that pulling a trigger in a shooter is. 

This isn’t a game where you just push the forward key and pretty much wait till you arrive. 

You‘re constantly assessing terrain, making decisions between various routes that have certain risks, using tools like ropes and ladders to navigate obstacles etc. 

All while you move through this tough terrain you have to manage your speed and the balance of your cargo near constantly. 

Very rarely are you just moving forward doing absolutely nothing."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,You walk slower but not like in fallout. It's more that you have poor balance and need to adjust if you start leaning too much.
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"You do move more slowly, but I don’t remember it being a huge difference. The big thing is that you’re more likely to tip, so you need to choose your path more carefully,"
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"It's awesome actually. You get exoskeletons pretty quick that help you out, also vehicles."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,Killing people and dumping their corpses in the tar pits so that they don't cause a thermonuclear explosion. But yeah there is a lot of walking
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"And building a sweet zip line system in the mountains, thinking somebody else will get to benefit from them, but never knowing if they do or don’t"
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-15,"My favourite Kojima game, or the one I've spent the most time with at least is MGS4... I feel like that kind of dipped it's toes into the 'insanity', with the BB unit and their 'weaponized PTSD'. Everything about the BB unit and all that surrounded them was weird. Like after defeating them, you'd hear about their tragic backstories.. then you could immediately whip out a camera and they'd strike sexy poses. It was truly bizarre.. but Death Stranding appears to be on a whole other level."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-15,"You'd never see all of one person's structures, usually just one or two."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-15,"They are probably all destroyed. I stopped playing a while ago and they don't last more than a week or two even at level 3 unless someone else repairs them, which few people did."

13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"The thing which makes death stranding worth playing is that it's actually movement based to the extent a large map becomes worth playing.

It's all micro movement decisions, ""should I walk down that incline slowly, or that slightly smoother section which looks a few meters longer? I'd need to put a ladder if I take that high route, but  it'd get me a bit lighter and save time next time I travel here""

None of it really matters, it's all just engaging you with the physical act of moving, in a similar way that games like BOTW, Spider-Man, Outer Wilds, really make the physical act of low level navigation engaging."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"They do indeed. When I played I found half a zip line system in the mountains when I got it hooked up, so I made the other half of the network. It was great fun, but honestly I think the best part was mapping out where I needed to go to make the nodes, abs then problem solving to get the resources I needed to it"

13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"I did that until near 100% then I started screwing around with ziplines and kicked myself at the time wasted.

Ive had a truck or two slide and get stuck perched on a rock causing a ton of backtracking.

Still never bothered with catapults though."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"Up into the snowy mountains, traction and power + trying to find the path you can drive on can get really annoying for some location arrangements and delivery circuits. It's great if you or someone else has built the highway, and you're going to locations that have an always-easy pathway up.

Ziplines are better for doing the rounds efficiently for small deliveries to tons of locations off the beaten path, but trucks are good for doing the huge cargo deliveries and deliveries along the way if taking the highway.,"
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-15,"Nah, the truck is way slower than doing it on foot. Especially if you are trying for all deliveries. Many deliveries need to be handled super fast and the truck just can't do that.

The truck is very good mid game and it's very good for carrying a buttload of deliveries on easy deliveries. Once you start getting past the medium level deliveries the truck loses it's value. You still do use it for most of the basic traveling though."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-15,"you couldn't find a downside to using the truck?

well shit, when I played, all I ran into while driving vechiles was a bunch of rocks that i couldnt drive over.

the terrain was not in the favor of wheels."
13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"I’m gonna have to go back to playing this game. Started a new playthrough on the PS5 version but backed off for whatever reason.

13h7b3n,2023-05-14,2023-05-14,"Well damn I used the truck or the carrier bike for first time deliveries myself. 

Had no idea about the ladder trick. I took the truck through the mountains and driving blind through the blizzard noticed I wasnt moving. Only for the truck to perched on a rocky pedestal near a drop off unable to jump or move. Trucks are great until your stuck with a heavy load out in the middle of nowhere.

Wish the game had a new game+ to take advantage of all the tricks I learned post game."

dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,This is amazing
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,This is like MTG card art
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,"i'm still going back and forth on whether or not i should buy death stranding, can anyone give me some insight on the gameplay and experiences?"

dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,I just finished the game. It was literally the greatest ending I've ever seen in a game.
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,"Im still confused. Whst exactly is the death stranding.

Edit I meant story wise, the event. What specifically is the DEATH STRANDING EVENT. The thing that comes up repeatedly in the story."
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,I really like the religious symbolism. Haven't played the game yet but I'm getting a rapture type of vibe from it. Great job!
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,Lowkey thought the dude was flipping off the giant monstrosity
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-12,Did you make that?!
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,Still have no idea what this game is about
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,What type of painting is this called
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,This painting really makes you feel like death stranding.
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,Sam's clearly just flipping off the BT.
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,I definitely thought that spoiler tag was NSFW. I spent a little longer than I'd like to admit looking for a giant penis or something.
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,This composition with the feeling of being in this art is truly astounding. You can feel the scale and the feeling of death standing behind you.

dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,Now do one better and become the guy that makes other people feel like they've peaked when you retweet *their* fanart.
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,Now I really don't know what the plot of this game is.
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,Is he flipping him off?
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,"Peak? You haven't even begun to peak. And when you do, they'll all know. Because you're gonna peak so hard that everyone on Reddit is gonna feel it."

In [X] years, I hope someone points back to this to see how weirdly accurate I was.

dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,"I’ve recently decided to pursue a career centered around my art, I’ve been focused on pen and ink as a medium for a few years now. I’ve been in graphic design since the first time I touched a computer and love digital art as my medium for expression in art, but... it was what i wasn’t naturally talented at that intrigued me the most for some reason.. I enjoyed refining this craft I initially sucked at. The decision to pursue it as a career is a somewhat scary one but I’m excited about it.

I hope you also keep pushing your limits as an artist and see what your capable of, best of luck to you! 

Getting recognized by Kojima is absolutely insane and would be hard for me to process honestly because he’s like a god to me! Congrats man that’s so crazy."

dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,"Hey, so ignoring the major reviewers, what do you guys think of Death Stranding? Im on the fence..haven't bought yet based on what I've heard"
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,Is it really a peak if you keep on ascending? I'd argue this was your mile marker 😉
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,At one point I swear I’ve peaked.”
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,"This might be the best promotion for the game I’ve seen yet, I haven’t seen much but this makes me want to find out what the big deal is more than anything else."
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,Why is Sam giving the yarn giant the finger?
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,"I’m no artist, but a measly passerby enjoying the art; by the shading I believe I see the rocks are falling, but just looking at the picture I can’t help but to see the earth being ruptured and all the energy is levitating the rocks into the air. 

Which should I see?"
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,I peaked too. 😉
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,Not even a Kojima fan and I'm amazed. Thanks for the new phone wallpaper

dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,The question is.... since seeing this will I be able to hold out for the PC release? This piece is strong and speaks to me and makes me wish I had my PS4 still.
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,I just finished the 1st Wind Farm mission and am about to start heading back to Capital Knot (roughly 4 hours in). I'm enjoying the game so far!
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,I went to Kojima's twitter (both of them) and did not see him retweet this picture.
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,Might want to tag spoiler on this... but great art!
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,It’s like an enraged god is about to rip the earth asunder around his feet and leave nothing but death and smoke in his passing.

dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,I mean... It doesn't have to be Kojima. I like your art. You peaked.
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,Fuck that part was crazy
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,Is it because the silhouette of the dude on the bottom is holding a Monster can up by his shoulder?

>!The large figure is a BT controlled by Higgs and Amelie. In essence, they are using it to consume people as a catalyst to immediatly cause a voidout (usually takes 48hours after a body dies). This is possible because Amelie is an Extinction Entity, a being created by the universe in attempt to balance itself out (life is considered overflow). Her purpose is to kill all of life similiar to the Big Five (the first 5 mass exctinction events, represented presumably by the 5 floating figures you can see at the end of the cutscene after the voidout). Higgs is kinda crazy so he loves the idea to fasten this process and kidnapped Amelie (who is basically the detached soul of Bridget) to make the extinction happen faster. !<"
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,So basically like the game
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,"So from very early game knowledge this seems to be a massive BT. We see it eat Igor, which the game tells you within the first hour that a BT eating someone is what triggers void outs"
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,It's just a copied game scene.
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,"i peaked as an artist when i won a colouring contest when i was like 5 years old, not to brag, but big kids participated too so it was a pretty big deal"

It is a 5/12 with defender
Can attack as if it did not have defender if at least 6 other colorless permanents are on the playing field."
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,"It’s definitely not a game for everyone. I’ve been playing it over the weekend and love every minute of it, it’s probably one of my favourite games in recent memory, but I honestly wouldn’t recommend it to any of my friends.

The gameplay itself is very simple, you hike through mountains, cross rivers, and scale cliff sides, delivering cargo to different outpost throughout fractured America. There’s a few combat sprinkled around but 70% of what you do during gameplay is probably walking from places to places.

The experience however is unlike anything I’ve ever seen. Even though it sounds boring, I’ve never felt a tiny bit bored while playing it. Forging your own paths through the beautiful landscape, interacting with objects and structures that other players placed is really unique and make the empty world feels strangely alive. I don’t know how to describe it, honestly."
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,"Like the other comment said, gameplay isn’t off the wall nonstop action. It’s more about scenery and just “relaxing” to enjoy the moment. I’m a huge Kojima fan and even tho the gameplay didn’t really interest me, I love his stories. I put in a crazy amount of time and beat the game, and the story is one of the best I’ve seen. He’s so good at introducing elements and switching things around, you’re always questioning it. And I’m not gonna lie, I still got questions after beating the game. I plan on replaying it after my exams are done just because I loved the story that much and want to clarify stuff. 

So if you love a good story, it’s a must buy. If you want to be going through crazy action all the time and don’t care for a story, you’d probably want to skip it."
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,"It's a mix of Metal Gear, Minecraft and Survival Horror... 

There are a lot of tactical elements in the combat, sneaking, building and cargo management (yes, it matters).
The world is built by the players. Everything you build, mailboxes, power stations, roads, etc. Will all be available to use to other players. Same with their stuff... They can also request supplies from you for building and even ask you to deliver packages for them. Same for you to them.
The survival horror comes from the non-human enemies, there are both human and non-human enemies in the game.

Honestly, I thought I would enjoy the game when I bought it... I never thought I would enjoy it as much as I am.
I am extremely addicted to it, the game is a ton of fun and feels really good to play since there's nothing else like it available at the moment."
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,"For me, I'm all about the feel good games. One of my go-to games is Forza horizon. Not because anything provokes me to complete anything, but because it feels reeallly damn good to drive around, and drive different cars I've built etc. I've seen people get lost in death stranding the same way I drive for hours on Forza. It's a feel good game. Like soul food for your hands.

Edit: the storyline is extremely long and compelling as well"
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,"I don't really play/enjoy single player games which is probably why I'm confused about everyone's hesitation on this. There is so much content and the gameplay loop is far more intensive then most open world games I see people raving about (AC: O, Witcher 3). Everything has a lot of layers too it like the cargo management, using your tools and upgrades to make networks to get around quickly (like ziplines later one), all of the characters in all the shelters have a lot of personality, and the ""convoluted"" plot, is basic sci-fi stuff that is explained in depth as you play. If someone is confused by the plot they have a lot bigger problems in their life than understanding a video game."
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,"Even after playing it and then seeing people try to explain it, it doesn't really capture how it feels to play. I was trying to tell a coworker about it and the way it sounds is boring and weird. I kept laughing trying to explain it because it sounds like I'm making it up. I am really enjoying it. Maybe you could rent from redbox to try it out."
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,"I'm enjoying it. It's not for people who want instant gratification, but the peaceful gameplay with the soundtrack, mapping out your own unique routes, just enough tension with BTs/Mules, the unique ass story, along with a great online system makes it definitely one of my favorite games this year. It always feels good to play something fresh. I can see why it got the most perfect scores of the year but also got a 3 and some 6s and 7s"
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,"Loving the game so far. It makes something as simple as traversing a river or a hill make you at least give it a second though and see if you can find a safer way that won’t fuck up your packages. The story has been very engaging especially if you’re into theme dense but straight up shameless Japanese writing.

But the way the themes interact with the multiplayer of the game, that’s where the real magic happens. A big moment was when I saw the first player bridge, something that takes quite a bit of resources and most likely took a few players pitching in to finish, yet it made a world of different while running side quests and delivering other players lost cargo in the same area.

Then there’s areas like the wind farm where players will have various ways of going back and making sure that other players can safely traverse, from a system of ropes to avoid every encounter in the area, to what I did which was leaving a trail of notes to help players cut through the enemy zones.

All that goes out the window when you see your first highway though.  The sheer amount of collaborative effort it takes to build and maintain the high way systems in the game is the exact thing Kojima built this ‘strand’ game towards."

dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,"The barriers between purgatory afterlife and real world are weakened/linked. Some souls are stranded between these realms, some can freely travel to and fro. 

Ultimately the death stranding ties into the overarching idea of extinctions. Think of the death stranding event as the means to an extinction in this world. For example a religious theory like the rapture would have horsemen, angels, devils, all playing whatever roles leading to the apocalypse. 

There's also a good cutscene where amelie explains the key differences between strand, stranded, and stranding. 

To be even more specific, the death stranding event first occurred when BTs breached the real world causing annihilation (voidouts) when in contact with the bodies of the dead."
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,"Okay, so this is what I've gathered in the first few ""episodes."" Spoilers for the people trying to go in blind, like I am. >!At some point in our near future (think like 2070-2100, no numerical dates have been presented) something happens that starts to prevent people's spirits from passing over to the afterlife. If bodies aren't burned within 48 hours, their spirits come back to our world. They generally stay in the area of their death and for some reason attempt to attack/consume living people. If those spirits consume a living person, then a ""void-out"" happens, which is basically a supernatural nuke. Huge explosion, leaves a giant ass crater in the ground. THE Death Stranding was the multiple void-outs across the world that basically ripped human kind apart. As you can imagine if you have no idea this is going to happen, with the number of people dying worldwide, lots of spirits in a short period of time, so lots of void-outs. The game takes place not too long after the Death Stranding, to the point where there are like 50-70 year olds that lived pre-Stranding in the game, but also long enough that there are adults in their 20-30's who never knew the world before.!<"

dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,"It's about reconnecting America after the event called 'Death Stranding'. You reconnect America by delivering packages from East to West. You travel through different terrains. It's epic. However, if you like fast paced action games, this one isn't for you. You will need to walk a lot, there is action but not much."
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,Do it. I’m biased as a longtime Kojima fan but hear this. If Metal Gear and the Kojima name didn’t exist this would still be one of the best games I’ve ever played. It surprises you.
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,"Whatever world or space humans go after they die seems to have exploded into the land of the living. Anybody who dies seems unable to safely cross between worlds and is stuck in the living world but as invisible ghosts with large umbilical chords that wanna devour the living and transform the dead into one of them, either one of these actions basically causes a nuclear explosion because these things were never meant to mix together.

Also for some reason the world of the dead has caused all rainfall to rapidly age anything it touches. You play as Sam Porter Bridges, a deliveryman tasked with travelling to the new subterranean American cities and linking them all to the new version of the internet. As you travel from city to city and back you deliver packages for people, and have to deal with the environment, the ghosts, bandits who want to knock you out and steal your packages, and a group of terrorists that want to seemingly destroy any new human infrastructure by killing people and leaving their bodies in ghost areas to cause large explosions."

dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,"I posted this above, but I will copy and paste it here.

It's a mix of Metal Gear, Minecraft and Survival Horror... 

There are a lot of tactical elements in the combat, sneaking, building and cargo management (yes, it matters).
The world is built by the players. Everything you build, mailboxes, power stations, roads, etc. Will all be available to use to other players. Same with their stuff... They can also request supplies from you for building and even ask you to deliver packages for them. Same for you to them.
The survival horror comes from the non-human enemies, there are both human and non-human enemies in the game.

Honestly, I thought I would enjoy the game when I bought it... I never thought I would enjoy it as much as I am.
I am extremely addicted to it, the game is a ton of fun and feels really good to play since there's nothing else like it available at the moment."

Lots of popular games people that I follow who thought this game was gonna be boring and dumb actually are liking it quite a bit so I think I might just pull the trigger and get it."
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,"> Even though it sounds boring, I’ve never felt a tiny bit bored while playing it.

Pretty much this. It's easy to look at a gameplay video and call it a walking simulator and it's hard to describe it in a way that sounds exciting, but it really is engaging as hell. I've never felt bored while traversing the terrain. Even the easy parts, when a field opens up in front of you and you just sprint through it like a madman, feel satisfying, cathartic.

There's also a pretty decent benchmark for me about whether a game has successfully ""engaged"" you or not: Usage of consumables. Most games where you have a rope or a ladder and using it means you have to go make a new one, I'd probably never use shit and finish the game with infinite wasted resources. Here, if I have a choice between tossing a ladder or a rope or walking for 20 more seconds, I drop that shit like it's hot. I'm constantly besieged by a feeling that ""we got to get this shit outta here asap"". I don't have the luxury to take a stroll around the hill.

Same thing about doing shit you normally wouldn't want to do. In a regular game where you carry shit that degrades, I'd never willfully jump in a river that I know can damage or carry my stuff away and decrease my grade/reward. Especially if there was a darksoulsy no-death system that meant your mistakes stayed with you. In this game, my cargo got pinged, and you best believe I yolo'd into a river I had no hope of crossing, desperately stumbled and flailed my way to the other shore and let that pile of resins I had picked up along the way float off into the horizon just to get the main mission done.

Shit is engaging alright."

I noticed Forza Horizon 4 available for PC also, and I was a HUGE fan of the original Forza series on the Xbox and 360. I never bought an Xbone so I have missed out on new entries. This game, while kind of frustrating at times, is one of the best racing games I've ever played. I do wish it was a little more structured like the older ones, but I've found as I've gotten higher levels there have been more specified or restricted content. I didn't realize at first that the game was letting me choose whatever cars I wanted for any type of race and kept wondering why my overly upgraded cars were getting smashed in races against similar classes... you can make almost anything into an S1 class vehicle but against native S1's it's practically a joke lol. But the game just lets you do whatever you want for the most part. After realizing this it became a lot more fun to pick more competitive classes appropriate for the track environments. Also I love swapping to my souped up Polaris Rzr or Toyota arctic and tearing across fields and mountains in straight lines to destinations. it never fails to surprise ghosts on the road when you come flying through the stone barriers that line the properties, crossing the highway into another yard completely ignoring roads."

But in this pic, he’s actually holding the baby, with a cross on his other shoulder. It’s as if it’s him, his family (baby) and his faith (detection tool / cross) vs the devil/monster.

Tbh I’m actually atheist and not religious at all. But def gave me religious vibes looking at the pic and I didn’t see any connection between the detection tool and a cross/symbol of faith until this pic.

Someone else brought it up at the guy at the Power Plant or whatever even was talking about footsteps and stuff.

Absolutely this is not a game for everyone, but it feels rewarding just going around and yanking out all the resources from the various stations and building more of that roadway, or seeing a spot along the road that's perfect for putting up a power generator for bikes.

dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,the story is super interesting. confusing as hell but really interesting
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,"I'd say if you like any anime stories you'll probably like it, if you like Evangelion especially it'll feel right at home for you, or barring either of those if you're into transhumanism in sci-fi and stories about transcendent evolution like the Hyperion novels, you'll probably find Death Stranding really enjoyable. The story is basically about the same things as both Evangelion and Hyperion, mankind evolving to fit a changed world in really crazy ways. The world itself and the concepts surrounding death and the afterlife that Kojima works into it are really interesting, and I absolutely adored all the characters even when it can be a little hard to get past things like a ten minute long explanation of why a guy is named Die-Hardman or the admittedly legitimately compelling story of Heartman's name. You have to have a certain degree of ""OK KOJIMA"" on hand though, it doesn't bother me nearly as much as some people even though I'm usually very short with hamfisted anime melodrama, but there are some parts in Death Stranding that I was just like ""Ok Kojima I get it that's supposed to look like a crucifix I GET IT OK STOP SLOWLY ZOOMING IN ON IT."" It's frequently way too blunt, but it can be hard to tell if Kojima is *trying* to be subtle anyway or if he's in on the joke, cuz his stories are almost always self-aware and goofy. But it's absolutely a worthwhile, intriguing sci-fi story told in a really unique, compelling way."
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,"I've beaten it. 

The story is largely about trying to rebuild society by establishing a super internet. Its hard to say much without spoiling everything so I'll just keep it brief. There is sinister stuff going on as well, conspiracies, nihilistic terrorists and character revelations up to the very end of the game. I will say that two character moment genuinely touched me in a way I've not felt from games before...

That being said, there's also a lot of stupid shit. In particular, the nature of the Death Stranding itself felt a bit wishy washy to me. The big bad also felt like it didn't have much reasoning behind it despite dedicating a lot of time to explaining itself. 

If your a character over plot person, I think you might like it. It also has some really cool visuals if that's your thing. For the record, I did find the game play loop satisfying but not necessarily fun."
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,"I haven't played it, but I get the feeling it's kind of an acquired taste when the main character delivers shit and his name is Porter and there's, I've heard, a guy named fucking America Dividedman? I'm not saying this makes it a bad game at all, I'll still probably buy when it comes out on PC out of curiosity, just... I don't even know what I'm in for, story-wise

I wish we got Silent Hills :("
dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,">!It all explains itself, down to why certain characters are named certain ways. It's definitely a completely new concept, nothing like people were predicting who thought that Death Stranding = Silent Hills. The story overall is OK, but I feel like they could have done a lot more with it. It's not bad, but it's not MGS tier either. Open world games kind of limit the impact of a story, IMO. Same thing happened with MGS 5; even though some of that could be contributed to the Konami/Kojima fallout, it's hard to disagree that a linear path through a game benefits a game's cohesive storytelling ability.!<

>!Death Stranding falls apart a little at the end, but it does seem to wrap most things up and definitely has some atypical Kojima twists. When looking at it through the lens of a completely new IP, it is GREAT, and I hope we see more stuff like this, in the world of repetitious IP's like Resident Evil **7** and Call of Duty **12** (or whatever number they are on now). It's no dissimilar from Hollywood, where completely original and new ideas and very few and far between. And how this game is littered with small little Kojima ""details"" give it so much charm and enjoyment to play. I think years from now it will be regarded as an absolute classic of our time.!<"

I remember my wife really sitting down to watch me play MGS5 for the first time. It was the mission that involved rescuing child soldiers in Africa and having not played any MGS game, at first she thought it was a deadly serious Tom Clancy-type game.

dviuwv,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,"Japanese people/gamedevs often are. They don't really get what ""on the nose"" implies or entails, like they seem to think that Badman McDarklordbad or Herobro Goodmanson are perfectly normal European style names  because they describe what the person is (duh) and also they're *english* and that means it's *cool!* 

Any Western person would instantly know that no one would really call themselves that, not even as an alias or nickname almost, but Japanese people don't really seem to get the ""read between the lines"" philosophy with these things, subtle names in pop culture are apparently kinda lost on them as a whole. It's almost like explaining irony to a three year old kid, they have no collective cultural peg to hang it on.

5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Going off of trailer...

- A lot of destruction, almost instantly reminded me of a lot of photos post WW2 that showed the destruction to homes and buildings
- I initially thought this was in direct conflict with Del Toro's suit, but I don't know enough about suit or eyeglass design to make any claims.
- Planes also remind of of WW2, which is again, confusing (for reasons later on)
- Notice that Toro HAS the futuristic cuff that Norman had, fellow escapee? He also has scars on his forehead that almost look he was put together (at least his skin)
- Fuck if I know about the baby
- Tank is really interesting; it's covered in weird flesh, but it also has human skeletal bones on it. Honestly can't place the tank either. It might be WW2, it might be more current.
- Tank is followed by a squad of skeleton troops in gear; here we start seeing what could be one of the potential conflicts in this game: Death and Life (the troops, the destruction, vs the baby). Note that they have old-school guns. The reoccurring old gear is interesting for a point later on...
- Baby wakes up after a tube is connected, no idea what it's feeding in but it goes under his suit so maybe it's similar to Norman's scar? A surrogate pregnancy? Note that the baby opens the RIGHT eye. The doll mirrors this later on.
- Doll gets grabbed by one of those strands, freaking Toro out and making him anticipate a surprise. 
- First real bit of color, red, is associated with this doll being pulled by a tendril, and the glow in the distance from the leader.
- We get a close-up of troops, interesting gear, but the leader's gear is COMPLETELY modern. The gun, the STYLE OF HELMET, EVERYTHING about him screams to him being from...

**a different time era**

Continuing on...

- Leader is covered in black goo. But looking at his eyes, it honestly feels more like it's coming OUT of him than it is on TOP. 
- He waits (remember he's pulling the doll) before emoting for the troops to move. Thing is, none of them saw him, meaning they communicated some other way...
- MORE strands and color. These WERE connected to the troops but now they fall/fade back into the leader, who has a moment of... feeling full? Feeling something, before looking down to see...
- the doll that was being pulled. The RIGHT EYE is flickering, before finally opening up like the baby.
- Hann-, I mean the squad leader, then looks towards the tunnel opening (or the camera) and I ended up with a strong impression that he knew about the baby.


We don't know what the characters in this universe can do, but we see strong evidence for two things: the function of the ""strands"" and the possibility of time travel. 


The time travel one is the weaker of the two, primarily because it's based on my THINKING that a lot of the stuff is from different eras. The soldiers have different helmets, but that doesn't mean it's modern (maybe a different army or division). That the leader has the most gear from the same era, to me, suggests there's either way more old guns lying around than new ones (meaning except for leaders/commanders gets old guns), OR it suggests that this commander, who is being played by a well-known actor and is friendly with Kojima, is one of those floating individuals from the first trailer, who has the ability to replicate things from different time eras, or travel to them. Remember the formulas dealing with relativity and how time is affected by black holes and gravity? IDK but seriously, time travel might be the thing going on with this. 


The other one is the purpose of the strands. Simply put, I think it's a way to ""gain access"" or ""hack"" into other things. Kojima said that he wanted to players to use ropes to tie the things they care about to them (Del Toro with the baby?) but we clearly see our favorite cannibal doing the same with his troops. We also see these strands on the airplanes, on the tank (connecting to the troops behind it), around the doll's leg, and under the water/oil. The fact that the doll is no longer inanimate after being tied to the commander (its eye opening) suggests some type of control. Think mind control or ""programming"", perhaps like a programmer (or like Zero) who can use the programmed appendage to collect, transfer, and edit code and commands. "
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"I get the feeling that we will never know what this game is.

People will 100% it then turn around and ask ""What the Fuck did I just play?""

It can't be defined. "
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"I wouldn't be surprised if this takes place in some kind of purgatory. The name ""Death Stranding"" even suggests it.

5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Okay, so this is most likely just going to be thrown into the void and not noticed, but I have a bit of a theory.


This has to do with some dimensional fuckery, something that has come into OUR dimension. We see these cables that are connecting people and animals. We first see the crabs, all the cables seem to be connected to their reproductive region/navel area So, wieners and umbilical area. We even see [this crab, which is filled with crab eggs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2Hy96sOnq8) We see the soldiers who are connected to Mads (by around his navel region). And we see an unconnected Del Toro and baby. Even the tank seems to have a cable trailing after it. Even the planes seem to have cables trailing after them. The soldiers following the tank also seem to be more dead than alive, same with the soldiers following Mads, they're skeletons (and seem like they're from WW2?), while Mads is clearly from more modern times.


The rainbow in the sky is pointing the wrong way, upwards. And the compass we see on Mads' character is spinning wildly (though that may be due to the wires coming off him). This does lead me to believe that it's some sort of dimensional fuckery (as well as Kojima's word about it being something to do with dimensional fuckery).


I think the baby is kept safe from this ""connection"", and he's trying to keep it from being ""infected"" by whatever this is. ~~I can't read what the pin he's wearing is saying though.~~ His pin is the United states, with a spiderweb pattern spreading out from near DC, above it says ""Bridges"", and underneath ""united states of America"" Might be connected to some sort of teleportation/dimensional research? And I wonder how he seems to be immune, may have something to do with his apparent lobotomy, we see a scar going around his forehead, but disappears into his hairline.? I also cannot read the small print on the thing he connects to the baby pod. Also the imagery with the baby doll that has had it's stomach/navel area stapled shut.


All in all, I think this is an extra-dimensional invasion of our dimension, something that infects and controls 'things' via these cables. Konami might have gotten the idea for their (awful) MGSV expansion with the dimensional shift and weird zombies from Kojima, but failed to understand his idea and just butchered it. So now Kojima is making a mixture of that idea, and Silent Hill."

5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"ok, i'm going to give this a shot as well, and point a few things out.

* you can see the rainbow in the puddles in the very beginning, arcing the wrong way.

* there's a dead crab upside down, but the scenery is from a WWII-ridden city.

* there are cables attached to everything. they run over the crabs, through the puddles, etc.

* more crabs. must've been a.... crab battle (ha). they all have tiny wires/cables running around/over/to? ([yes, to](http://i.imgur.com/mrPsd7f.png)) them

* del toro in the beginning walks by the baby which is already tethered as you see later -it's a lure. a trap. babies are significant in this realm.

* the rainbows are upside down, arcing the wrong way (even though, rainbows as see from in the air are a perfect circle)

* the [planes](http://i.imgur.com/tkB3UHZ.png) are, i believe, p40 warhawks (WWII fighter/bomber) [with bombs](http://www.worldwarphotos.info/wp-content/gallery/usa/aircrafts/p-40-warhawk/P-40_as_fighter-bomber_loaded_with_6_250_lb_bombs_Africa.jpg), [LEFT wing nub](http://www.fritzthefox.com/ww2guide/ww2guide_images/p40_photo.jpg), and the tails are fairly similar.

* there's a strange forehead scar on del toro -some suggested it was a lobotomy, but that doesn't make sense? [my guess is](http://mctropolis.com/austin_headscar_300.jpg) [brain surgery for tumor removal](http://images.freeimages.com/images/premium/previews/3212/32128030-medical-stitches-and-incison-after-brain-surgery.jpg). and he has a pin with a spider web spanning outward from DC over CONUS that says ""BRIDGES  - UNITED CITIES OF AMERICA"".

* futuristic blue glowy handcuffs?

* the tank is an [M32 Jackson](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HeiPsmc17dY/maxresdefault.jpg) so we're seeing a lot of WW2 inspiration. it's covered with human bones, and weird organic snakey material bursting out from inside. it's also leaking some black stuff, which you see behind del toro in the bridge as it crosses. there is also -most notably, a cable coming off the back of the tank, so the cables are playing a big theme here.

* the water starts rising. del toro smells it before it gets there, and then looks down at it. could it be a global warming indicator? either way, del toro doesn't care for it. the camera pans up and you can see a sort of umbilical cord hanging from inside his suit, and then he plugs it into the pod he's holding, which has a fetus in it.

* [~~holy shit, upon closer inspection, del toro is wearing the gloves because he's a skeleton underneath. his arms have no flesh, as you can see up his sleeve a tiny bit and see both his forearm bones, unless i'm mistaken.~~ i take this back, it just looks like the cuff isn't fully closed over his wrist.](http://i.imgur.com/z8gWDyh.png)

* the baby in the pod is a boy

* the toy baby is being pulled by a cable through the water. my guess is it's used as a lure.

* the real baby in the pod opens it's right eye

* all the soldiers crossing the bridge have cables affixed to them. they are all skeletons in WWII garb.

* suddenly dead dolphins everywhere by the entrance of the tunnel.

* red pulsing light coming from the toy baby being dragged

* red pulsing comes from a person further down the tunnel, out emerges a fire team of WWII skeletons, followed by a modernized soldier with NVG's/m4/etc. cables protruding from under his carrier (good trigger finger discipline, too). as he lifts the NVG's, they sort of burn off and disappear, revealing mads mikkelsen covered in oil/mud/etc

* mads motions for the skeleton soldiers to move forward, and without even seeing the motions, they move, probably because they're connected to him. the cables disconnect from the skeletons and sort of burn down like wicks until they disappear behind the plate carrier on mads. in the burning light, you see a bunch more cables under the water line.

* mads' compass is going fucking crazy.

* the toy baby lure floats up to mads, and the right eye is opening and closing until it opens all the way, revealing a blue eye. the toy baby has a scar on it's stomach the same way norman reedus had on his in the first trailer.

* mads looks up, now clean of the mud and black stuff on his face, and stares at the camera. cut to black, end of trailer."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,This game looks like it's gonna be a Mads amount of fun.
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"The baby in the container winks, kinda like the dolls eye, wonder if looks like the baby has some kind of supernatural power. Afterwards the guy looks up after seeing the doll like he knows the baby is there? Clearly what he's looking for. "
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,I feel like there is no need to properly explanation. It's great visuals of one man fantasies. For me it is enough to be interested. 
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"My prediction: 

This scene takes place about 30 years prior to the game we play. Norman Reedus is the child in that capsule, the man holding him is trying to save his life from those creatures. It's possible that he also is one of the creatures, but is not happy with how his species has treated the planet. He also could be human. The creatures are of a species that inhabits human bodies, and they have hunted humans to near extinction. 

The man will successfully place Norman Reedus in the ocean, where he will float around for ~30 years before awakening to an even further devastated environment in which even the parasitic species is having difficulty surviving. 

Norman Reedus is mankind's last hope, he must defeat the parasites and bring humanity back from the brink. So I guess there has to be a girl who survives as well for that to make sense. Or a new birthing method. There were some Christian vibes going on in the first trailer, so I think there was a bit of a hint at this being an Adam and Eve story. There will be some kind of lesson about learning from humanity's previous mistakes and not taking the environment for granted.

So the parasites will actually be like a metaphor for humanity in its current state."

5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Has anybody here read the book Robopocalypse? By Dan Wilson. It covers and explains basically this entire game premise. 

Tendrils are an alien connection method that can interface with whatever it likes, biological or mechanical. The dead soldiers are inundated with tendrils that puppet the bodies according to commands, zombie-like but controlled by the central source. The leader of the squad maintains connection until there's a mission to send the bodies on, then they're autonomous. 

All we need are mad robots and pluggertraps to make this a literal interpretation of the robot uprising from the book and its sequel. "
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"I think I understand the premise having played his previous games and watching this video. This game will touch on gene splicing cloning new creatures and some type of environmental catastrophe that is also tied to the former in some way but with a supernatural element that's always in his games.  The fat guy has a scar across is forehead so he's probably part of the regime and went rouge with the bottle baby, and these guys are looking for him. The skull soldiers are reincarnated like in wolf3d spear of destiny with the zombie solders, fodder for the game, and so on, not sure who you'll play in the game, I hope its not a game where you play a fat guy who has to keep the bottle baby from being broken the entire time.

This is about climate change and how continuing with the same methods of energy (oil instead of electricity) will lead to the death of species, **AND FUTURE GENERATIONS**. The umbilical cord represents taking away from the future so that we may live and make the most profit now, with a sense that the more money we have, the longer we can live due to technological advances. *Death Stranding.*

The reason I say a continuation of how things are, is because the soldiers are from WW2. It's still the same old warfare as back then, just with more tech. The flooding represents the rising of the sea level etc.

If you refer back to the first trailer, I'm very certain that the five figures in the sky represent the big oil and gas corporations that will continue to lobby for their own gain while the rest of the planet gets fucked. *Mads is one of them, which is why he is covered in oil and leading the soldiers. Oil is the real cause behind war*.

5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"My theory: Mads brought back WWII soldiers from the sea. He has the ability to create psychic tendrils to make things do his bidding. In the first trailer, we see tons of animals have beached themselves and have tendrils(interestingly similar to umbilical cords) leading into the ocean. In the second trailer, we see the same tendrils leading to the WWII era skeletal soldiers. In the first trailer, we see five beings above the sea. Mads is one of them. Guillermo has a lobotomy scar. Reedus has a vertical and a horizontal scar with no belly button. Both of these characters have something to do with a baby. Reedus has lost a baby(could symbolize the loss of innocence) and Guillermo has a baby in an incubation pod. Reedus has escaped a high tech high security situation. Guillermo is avoiding one. Mads has a compass on his outfit that goes crazy, increasing the likely-hood that he's psychic. The eyes are commonly symbolically considered to be a strong source of one's power, thus the black liquid coming from them. In the end of the second trailer, the doll's eye is blue as are the eyes of most babies. Its eye opens similarly to that of the baby in the incubation pod. My theory is that Mads is able to use the doll to see through the baby's eyes. Guillermo wears a patch the the united states covered in a web. Guillermo worked for the new government and learned something, stole the baby and snuck it out.

Five beings appear and begin taking over the world, enslaving mankind and starting by killing off the creatures of the ocean. They bring dead bodies back to life and use them as an easy army, taking over the planet. Guillermo learns something, possibly that people are no longer able to reproduce by normal means, and sneaks baby out. Something happens to Gullermo and the baby lands in the hands of Reedus who loses it and is shown in the trailer filled with regret for losing the last hope of humanity in the face of overwhelming destruction."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Alright, here's the prediction:

The settings are similar to Half-life, with the dimensional species invading Earth.  In this case, it's some kind of biological ooze that can take various forms but seems to be most effective when it hijacks living organisms like humans (Mads).  The ooze has necromancy/puppeteering qualities, opting to reanimate anything it can find.  Sometimes its ancient weapons of war, sometimes its modern.  The ooze is trying to control all biological life, some reject it naturally and simply die, like certain animals.  The baby in the sealed machine is cut off, some kind of pure device to counteract the strengths of dimensional ooze.  The old man had brain surgery, perhaps a hasty operation to cut out the ooze before it took full control of the host.

I think this is going to be like the Last of Us meets PT, gameplay wise."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Everyone is freaking out over Mads, here I am just glad Del Toro is still working on a game with Kojima! "
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"I'm so confused right now. The cognitive part of my brain is saying ""this is a shitshow, abandon ship"", but why do I know I'll end up loving it?"

5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"I must admit, I'm underwhelmed. It gave me the same feel of a lot of Kojima's most recent stuff: incredibly forced drama. It just feels like a lot of striking, randomly jumbled images that can't coherently be interpreted.

And that does nothing for me and makes me worry about the coherence of the full game."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,So great to finally see the Nightman in a major video game release.
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"My theory is that Mads, (most likely the main antagonist, like, c'mon) is some sort of timetraveller/necromancer and is raising an undead army or something. That would explain why he is dressed in modern operater-like gear while seemingly commanding what appears to be American paratroopers from WWII. The patch on their arms doesn't appear to be either 82nd nor 101st, but the spades the one soldier's helmet at 2:55 indicates that he is from the 506th infantry regiment of the 101st airborne. Knowing Kogima's attention to detail, he would not let these inconsistencies slip, so there must be more reasoning behind this likely pertaining to the story. 


The cords coming from Mads leads me to believe that that is how he is controlling these undead soldiers. The cords are similar to the tank that drove over the bridge, which, as far as I can tell, does not seem to be an allied tank from the WWII era judging by its angular chassis and its tread design, leading me to believe that, like Mads himself, might be from a different time period, especially since it drags a cord along that seems to be attached to the soldiers just like Mads. The setting appears to be Europe during WWII as indicated by the cobblestone architecture, sewer system, the building structures in the background, the WWII planes flying overhead and in formation, the WWII American paratroopers (albeit undead) walking around, and the general desolation of the scene suggesting prolonged engagements with heavy shelling and bombing. There are many places in Europe that still maintain architecture reminiscent of the WWII era, so a modern/future/post WWII setting is not out of the question. Maybe all of those undead soldiers were resurrected and used for warfare? 


As for the dude with the baby in a jar (Guillermo Del Toro), He seems to be wearing modern attire and has an interesting badge on his lapel that looks like an outline of the US. Perhaps he's another time traveler or something like Mads in this alternate universe. It's probably fair to assume that the baby is of great value and the object of Mads' search, which might be indicated by the fact that the baby doll was pulsing with an orange glow as it flowed down the sewer-the same orange glow that surrounds Mads and his gear, leading me to believe that he was scanning for ""the baby"" and picked up on the doll's signature which is why he showed up in the sewers to check it out. I'm sure there are many other thematic references and symbolism behind the babies/baby dolls and don't want to go too far out on a limb with speculation, but as far as the bio matter/body parts/tentacles, it seems that there's a lot of death everywhere, especially from animals as you can see the piles of dead dolphins and sharks at 1:59, which could suggest a source for all of that, although it doesn't really explain the tentacles bursting out of the tank and flowing under Mads in the sewer. It could also just be that Kojima is Japanese and likes tentacles and decided to use them to blow our minds. My guess is as good as anyone's. It's Kojima-he unapologetically creates weird shit and we all love him for that. "

5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"I'm not sure why most of these comments are acting confused. 

Plot of the game seems to be preservation of an untainted human child (DNA?) in a post apocalyptic world that has been destroyed by some sort of mind control bio-plague.

The game is going to set a new standard for production value in our world that is tainted with Ubisoft and EA. *I just wrote that as an observation but somehow I feel this is also related to the message of the trailer.*"
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Well, that's how you do it. That's how you get me to buy a ps4."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Observations:

* Mads Mikkelsen seems to be equipped with high tech, modern military gear but his skeletons look like their gear comes from WWII. It's hard to tell because of the darkness, but I think they're holding M1-Garands (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1_Garand).

* 3:21 - The skeleton on the upper right puts his hand on the other skeleton's shoulder. I found this unusually human and slightly adorable, like he's reassuring his skeleton friend. I guess love really can bloom on the battlefield. Seriously though, this is a common military thing, since you can't exactly look over your shoulder while in formation. But it seems like the skeletons are being controlled, since they don't have to actually see Mads' order to follow it. Why would they need to gesture to each other?

* Guillermo Del Toro's character, who I'm just going to call ""Bridges"" based on his little nametag looking thing, has the same handcuffs that Norman Reedus had in the other trailer.

* It's really, REALLY hard to make out, but Bridges' badge also reads ""United Cities of America"" underneath.

* Just before the water rushes in, Bridges smells something. He doesn't seem to be happy with what he smells. Shortly after, before he looks down the tunnel, you can see piles of dead dolphins(?) that weren't there before. It seems like some kind of tide came in and brought a whole bunch of reaking fish corpses with it. I find it interesting that this apparently prompts him to...uh...turn on the baby device (YOU tell me what's going on if you think I'm wrong). Maybe he just wanted to make sure the baby was ok.

* The baby doll seems to be mimicking the baby, since the both open their right eyes. This may have something to do with the black cord we see grab it's leg.

Thoughts:

 I think I actually DO have a vague idea what's going on here. There seems to have been some kind of apocalyptic event, and it's probably related to those cords. It seems like you can connect those cords to anything and be able to control it, or at least communicate or connect with it in some way. Because of the age of the skeletons' gear, this trailer seems to imply that Mads Mikkelsen's character is some kind of science fiction equivalent of a necromancer, digging up long dead soldiers and hooking them up with the black cords. I don't think it's a stretch to assume the army above the bridge belongs to him, or at least that he's one of the high ranking officers of it. That also probably explains the tentacle tanks; the tanks seem pretty rusty and old, and have the black cords zig zagging all over them. They also have human bones stored on them...replacements for the troops maybe?

TLDR: The black cords connect things. For some reason, sea life seems like a popular choice. You can control people hooked up to them, even if they've been dead for decades."

5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"I think a big hint is in the name of the game: death stranding. It is a wordplay between 'strands' (cords) and stranding (beaching, getting caught on something).  

'Strands' are the umbilical cords hanging out of everyone and they keep the dead alive. Hence 'Stranding' Death.  

Also, very very goodlooking and interesting. "

5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Lots of metaphor and allegory for mankind's pursuit of greed which leads to war and plunder of the Earth. (Dead sealife, ruins, tanks, undead soldiers, oil or grey goo, overall the shitty state the world seems to be in)

The bio tank is very interesting, as is the use of these black cables or strands? nanotech? biotech? we shall see.

Either way the narrative looks fairly familiar, hero and heroine with the baby as some sort of important role to play since they keep featuring it, either a plot device or strongly related to the protagonist.

Not sure yet if this apocalyptic future is man made or if there is alien influence, the floating beings could be aliens, it's too hard to tell at this point.

the next trailer will make no sense

then the next

then I'll watch an explanation video

and it will kinda make sense

but still make no sense"
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Just feels like an edgy art project at the moment, sure it's interesting but it's interesting for all the wrong reasons. It's a CG trailer with no real substance or context, can't really get on the hype train."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,This hype train doesn't even have wheels or a track and you all have already bought your ticket and boarded.  I will hold off my excitement until I see gameplay footage!  For all you know this could be a chess game with really intense cutscenes!
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,I wonder if there are no women due to both the trailers showing men caring for children. 
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,So many questions. Why is there a theme of babies?Why was Hannibal there? Is this a movie or game? 
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,I wonder if there will be any gameplay. 
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,What.
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Credit to Dtodd84 on IGN comment page:

1. Del Toro has a pin on his jacket that says ""BRIDGES"" on it with a type of Web stretching across the U.S.
2. Del Toro also has handcuffs on just like Reedus did in the first trailer.
3. Del Toro has a scar stretching across his forehead.
4. The baby he is holding only opens his right eye just like the baby doll that Mads sees.
5. The baby doll at the end has a type of incision where his belly button would be and in the first trailer Reedus does not have one at all.
Some guesses...
1. People are no longer ""born"" in the normal sense in this time Era, hence the lacking of the belly button.
2. Life and death as well as past and future are overlapping. The baby represents a future or past self they are trying to care for. Clues being the old and new soldier uniforms and the baby ""attached"" to the ""carrier"" which leads me to think they are the same person. Another clue being the first trailer where Reedus lost his baby (or himself) and now is ""stranded"" in some sort of lack of existence.
3. The dolls are old toys that children cut the belly button out of to match their new appearance and now just linger around as a creepy remnant.
4. The pin with the bridges may represent the black liquid that has spread or bridged everyone and everything. Maybe a man made thing that was thought to unite people through making time non linear, but had disastrous results and bridged all forms of existence. So when that liquid is seen in the trailers it represents some sort of time jump or dimensional travel has or is taking place as it bridges the 2 together. This is also seen as streaks behind the old fighters planes in the sky.
5. Last but not least, I somewhat wonder if the Del Toro character is in fact the same as the Norman Reedus character from the previous trailer. He just wasn't caught yet. The soldiers may have taken his lifeline (baby) and strandes him in another form on that beach. Which is why he still has handcuffs on, realizing he lost the baby and sees 5 figures in the sky just like the 5 soldiers we see in the tunnel that are closing in on him. They stripped him of everything that made him, him and left him for dead.
__________

I myself noticed the center of the web on the lapel pin appears to be over D.C.  Is that the origin of whatever is going on?  Mads' compass is going haywire which goes with Dtodd's theory of past and future overlapping.  Also, the cords Mads' character uses to control the soldiers appear to retract back into where his belly button would be.  Can only natural born humans become like Mads' character?"
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"I initially thought the baby was being protected or smuggled but now i'm wondering why the guy attached his umbilical cord to the tank before going into tentacle alley. Maybe it's protecting him somehow. He had the cuffs on just like the last video, and more signs of surgery, though on his head not his stomach like before. 

Also could be coincidence but the reflection of the strange fire effect on the skellingtons made a double-helix symbol on the water which kojima seems pretty fond of. "
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,I don't know what's happening but I can tell you I find it extremely compelling.
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Del Tero with scar on head and pin of USA on chest smuggles baby that he has synthetic womb for while he evades James Bond villain that commands army of WW2 soldiers with his modern gear and magic. 

Yes please. "
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"I feel like my $60 will be less me buying a game, more funding Hideo to continue to be as weird as possible.... which I have no problem with."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Is this an exclusive to something or will everyone get to play it?
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Oh yes, he bringing back the MGS5 camera cutscenes work. "
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"My guess is that whatever he is, he's using those tentacles as umbilical cords that seem to be keeping him sustained. (Notice how when they retract they look just like umbilical cords AND come from his stomach not the sides or back). He also seems to be weakened once they are released. The baby doll seems to be a tracking device, notice how it starts flashing red when touched? Think of these creatures as dependent on Humans for energy or life (think matrix) like a battery. The umbilical cord by nature is designed to provide nourishment and life. Humans are trying to protect these babies hence the storage unit, and I believe the device he attaches is either A. Designed to assist in temporary life support to the baby, these creatures seem to be able to ""sense"" the baby nearby. Actually, watching the video again, this kinda confirms it, when he attaches the cord to the tank again, its almost like the baby is finally able to breathe. Or B. An artificial ""womb"" for a human that isn't born, but grown (I believe this is going to be Norman Reedus's character. Test tube babies. Hideo LOVES to talk about controversial topics, this is a HUGE one.The capsule might ""cloak"" the child from being sensed. The tank was also VERY interesting to me, while some ""organs"" fell off, it seems like some of the parts are integrated into the tank itself. The soldiers are skeletons, yet the leader of the group has flesh, I think this story is about the dead rising to consume the livings ""life"" not only energy, but body as well. This is a VERY fascinating concept, it's literally disrupting life in reverse. Life -> Death turned to Death -> Life. But again, its also so simplistic, The saying ""You are born, only to die"". I think all these enemies will come attached to cords, hell even the planes have cords dangling. That's life, Death could be around every corner. I think Reedus's character is going to be special, remember the scar? Wasn't this around his umbilical cord should be? Maybe he's an engineered human that is no longer ""born"" upsetting the natural order and is ""invisible"" to these creatures and free from the ability to be ""attached"" to them. A new way of Life, Pissing off Death cheating the system so to speak.Just thoughts :)

One more add on thought. Remember the movie Lucy? Talking about the chemical or molecule? CPH4 it is a real molecule, produced by pregnant women and having important effects upon a developing baby. I think this chemical MAY come up in this game. CPH4 in the film Lucy, in large quantities is something that produces profound effects to someone who consumes it. Powers including telepathy (which could indicate why these beings are able to sense other people and or babies nearby) and even telekinesis. I think this plays into the whole idea perfectly, explaining these beings to ""develop"" from dead, to alive. Also providing special abilities. CPH4 is obviously *delivered* by the umbilical cord. Maybe the reason for going after babies is to obtain this molecule in reverse so to speak to ""feed"" the beings. "
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,do we know if this the spiritual replacement for P.T./Silent Hills as far as gameplay and all? or is this something new and different?

5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,All I got out of this was Mikkelsen is the bad guy and Guillermo Del Toro is some guy walking around with a baby in a high tech  mason jar....thats probably Reedus. 
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"I think Hideo is just taking the piss on us all.

If you listen close enough (might need to turn up the volume) you can also hear "" *shut UP mom!!!*

It's whispered but you can hear it.

My guess  some kids mom would only let him go if she chaperoned the whole thing and he got upset about it because she's being ""MOM"".

Oh. The video? I have no fucking clue looks weird as fuck.

Edit: Just watched again and i heard her right at the end again. "" That movie looks cool!!""

So it is a confirmed mom in the audience."

5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"I've never been one to blow a load over a title, some animated characters in a trailer, and cast and direction listing. Thankfully. Otherwise playing all the missions with all the intro text in MGS V would have ruined my nuts.

So could someone explain to me what there is to get excited about here? What exactly do we know about how playing this game will be enjoyable?

I know Kojima thinks he is a movie director, but it seems that again and again he develops a game instead. And I need interesting game mechanics for a game to pull me in."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Why are people so desperate to find some deep and hidden meaning to all of this? It doesn't need one. There's nothing wrong with it just being wild and surreal. Fucking over-analysis. 
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Not sure if anyone will even see this but I'm pretty sure I've figured this out. The man in the suit can create or promote organic life or something of the sort. My reasoning is because the baby has an umbilical cord and it wouldn't need one unless it was transferring nutrients. I also think that Mikkelsen can bring inanimate objects to life since it shows him controlling skeletons and apparently bringing the baby doll to life. Definitely not a coincidence that it showed both a real and toy baby both springing to life once anchored to a host. 
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,When is Kojima going to start making movies?! I'd kill to see a weird sci fi film written by Kojima

5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"The Death Stranding trailer reminds me of the boss fight in Sorrow's River during Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBhyHCzeP7E

Edit: Just with a more in depth plot."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Holy shit when he looks up at the end, I felt actual terror. Dudes got some acting skill, gave me chills with a few facial expressions "
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,I've watched 2 game trailers tonight. In neither of them did I see what the game was about. 
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,WTF did I just watch??
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Mads Mikkelsen looks so menacing
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,I don't get it.
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,I don't know what to feel....tell me what to feel....or don't.....I don't know.....ahhhbh!
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Death Stranding is looking very promising. I thought the E3 trailer was okay, but this trailer has got me extremely interested in the story. Hideo Kojima is great when it comes to stories and I trust him enough to make a great story for Death Stranding."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Am I the only one that thought Mads Mikkelsen was Till Lindemann of Rammstein at first? Even in the thumbnail they look similar!
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,I dont even know what's happening but it looks awesome.
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"W!T!F!
But Mads as Omega Red? I'm in..."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,I really don't care for any of this. I just want to see some gameplay. 
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Holy crap this looks interesting. I still haven't played MGS5, and I've played every MG game since the original, just got busy with real life now with wife,kids,job... side effect of getting older I guess. But wow, I think I am actually going to get a PS4 now just for this game. Anyone know if this is coming to PC? I can't find any info on it if it is.

EDIT: Turns out it *IS* coming to PC, but a time-delayed release after an exclusive time-period on the PS4."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,The baby doll had the same scar on its stomach that Norman reedus had in the first trailer. What does it mean!
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Skeleton with guns are so badass
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Were those [PAC (Personal Automatic Cryo-stasis System)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/5fgl3s/the_real_meaning_behind_pacman/dak9aou/?context=3) suits?
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"I know nothing about this game. I don't even know for sure if its a FPS. 

But damn I want to play this. "

5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"So... Metal Gear Solid Half Life 3 Deus Ex with umbilical cords...

I'm down with that...

I want to find out why he's able to command a bunch of army skeletons..."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"First man has a long scar across his forehead so I'm assuming he escaped from torture or they took his brain or some sort of modification. Also, on his suit he has an United States pin, so maybe he's a researcher or scientist of the US. Also, why does is the tip of the baby protector thingy shaped like a condom!?!? Baby protector thingy... condom.... hmm..
"
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"I get it!


^^I ^^don't ^^get ^^it."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"It's weird. Kojima-weird.

I love it."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,I have many questions.
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"So, modern soldier Mads Mikkilsen is controlling the skeletonized corpses of long dead ww2 soldiers? Guillermo Del Toro has a test tube baby in a lunch box? Norman Reedus and baby doll with morse code twitch eye have the same scar?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s013grY4zRo"
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,del Toro most definitely has a connection to Reedus. Maybe the baby that disappeared in Reedus' arms was a memory that he had while at some facility that the two escaped from? Who the hell knows anything other than knowing they're excited for this game.
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Where's Norman Reedus with his little fetus?
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"What's this feeling? Is this...that old feeling of being hyped as fuck for a story where I haven't a single fucking clue what to expect from it? 

&nbsp;

Yes. Yes it is. "
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Somehow I feel like i know even less than i did after watching the first trailer 0.0
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Looks like some humans vs androids thing
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"look better than EVERYTHING on pc, lol

#BeggarMasterRace"
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Most game stories aren't very interesting to me but holy shit this looks so awesome that I would play it just for the story.
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Mawkish
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,I am in love already!

5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"[Well, I'm intrigued ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgtJ3lBNsQ4)"
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Upside down rainbow makes me agree that this is some odd, purgatory-esque setting... A sort of mirror image of our world where the dead/ ghastly go."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,They cleared up that weird shit with more weird shit
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,so he went from vocal cord parasites to umbilical cord parasites?
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Del Toro's badge says Bridges which is either the organization fighting the antagonist(s)? Or they are the Antagonist also notice how the badge says United CITIES of America. The heart of the spider's web that covers America is more than likely Washington D.C. so we know the game takes place in our world or some form of it in possibly the United States.   
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,The baby shell has the same scar on it's belly as Norman in the 1st trailer.
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"I'm more confused now, than i was after the first trailer. "
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Everyones over here losing their minds, and im just sitting here, going, i don't get it...."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"if you liek this guy i suggest, Valhalla Rising "
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Got a Stranger Things vibe from the music. Also Mads Mikkelsen !!!!
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,That music <3!
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that the whole baby connected to an adult man thing is some sort of immortality device.

Like you're growing your own clone, feeding it from your body. 

Bad guy seems to be supplying the skull soldiers in the same way, so maybe a corruption of that technology? "
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"This is everything I expected and nothing I understood. This is Kojima left to his own devices without anyone holding him back. I still have no idea what *this* is, but I'm certainly interested.

Whatever it is going to involve lots of goo and lots of babies."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"I mean, I'm on board for whatever it is, but what the actual hell was that?"
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,I can't wait to not play this.
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"So it's like...a dead toy baby floating down the sewer, dodging evil soldiers like flappy birds type of game. I get it. "
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,GDT I LOVE YOU 
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,I suddenly understand jack shit.

5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Was I the only one who was in total awe at the graphics in this game?
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,The Death of MGS... i hope Kojima will also reveal their anti-silent hill game.
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"So I have no idea what sort of game it will be or what the game is about, but we can be fairly certain the intro cutscene will be fucking *intense*."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,I am knee deep into MSG:V right now.  Are you kidding me?  This looks crazy.
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,I was vaguely interested in this after the first trailer but now I think this might very well go down as the greatest video game of all time.
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Okay wait. 

This was all cool and weird and I want all of it now, but this is the 4th thing in which Mads Mikkelson plays a character where something is up with his eyes. Casino Royale, Valhalla Rising, Dr. Strange, and now this. That's some weird-ass typecasting right there. "
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Wonder whats up with the compass spinning like that @3:26

5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Is this PS4 only? 
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"It's official - there's no one left in serious media development who doesn't hire Mads Mikkelsen.

Viking takeover, woo!"
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"[Good trailer, completely explains everything.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aegP8j5al0)"
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Stoked!
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Hm I wonder what the scars across Del Toros head are supposed to be from...some kind of brain surgery? Maybe hes in a coma in limbo
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"I don't know what's going on, and I love it. "
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"MGS stories never made any sense to me, I'm sure this will not either. It's the mechanics of MGS I'm in love with, so fine tuned and everything is so well balanced. Everything about the series is out of the box type shit with such amazing gameplay. I'm sure this game will be the same. I'll just ignore this trailer and everything else till the release of the game which I'm sure I'll enjoy. "
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Oh my gosh it's Mass Mikkelsen. I need this more in my life. 
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"What is this game. What even is this game
"
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,These trailers are amazing. Not even a hint of what type of game play this game will have and I'm more hype than I've been for a game in a while. 
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,All I got out of this is that babies are ammunition and I am okay with this. 
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,I dont get it
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,I'm even more confused
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"I have to admit, I am excited to see where this is going, and I am a HUGE Kojima fan, being a life long Metal Gear fan and all, but what the fuck *IS* this...?"
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Looks very metal gear-like - especially the way he commanded the 'skulls' . Reminded me of Skullface and his unit 
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,This trailer was like the sequence in Trainspotting where he tries to get clean 
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,[deleted]
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"I own an Xbox. I'm seriously considering buying a PS4 just for this game. Did the same thing last time for The Last of Us. Damn you, console exclusives. Can't we all just get along?"
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"My theory is a lot of what we've seen so far, was going to be used in the Silent Hill game they were planning. There are some very minor connections, the babies, the organic environments, the creepy black water.

Obviously it's not anything to do with Silent Hill, but I imagine Kohima didn't want to waste any of the work he'd already made and just recycled/adapted a lot of it to make this new story. 

What do you guys think?"
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Jesus fucking Christ that was scary
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"i've got to wait and see what this is before i get too excited.  i like del toro and mikkelsen, but so far it's awfully abstract and reminds me of the Skulls sections of MGS, which i found ridiculous and annoying."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"This could only be a Kojima game.  And I don't mean the fact that it already looks and feels so much like a Kojima game.  I mean who else could release these overly crytic trailers that convey no concrete info on wtf is going on with the story or what the actual gameplay like?  

It's because I (and I imagine many others) have the utmost respect for and place unwavering trust in Kojima's method that makes pure madness like this not only acceptable, but exhilarating."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,What the hell did I just watch?
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Game gets weirder every trailer I see of it. No way I'm not getting it though. Possible game of the decade with those credits.
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"This is not a good thing to watch while high. 

Holy shit. "
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,I don't get it.
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Snake, this a OSP mission. You are not to be found. "
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"""Stranding"" could both be an allusion to being stuck somewhere, in this case, some end of the world type purgatory, or in a literal sense, strands, as in using those umbilical cord thingees to control dead people. 

This being a Kojima game, I'd bet on the latter. "
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"It's going to be VR. You switch perspectives through objects like that baby doll. It's going to be multiplayer. One side is Mads Mikkelsen changing perspective through soldiers, tanks, planes etc. Other side is Norman Reedus/Who ever that fat guy is, using objects to avoid capture. Cat Vs. Mouse game."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"I would do terrible, wonderful things to Mads Mikkelsen. Can't wait for this, time to get a PS4!"
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"I feel like i should be exited, but... I hate being dissapointed."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,I've never been so excited for a game I know so little about. 
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,I have no idea what's happening but I like it. Why?
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"It looks like all wars of the past and current / future are all combined into one world and those with money are now forced to save the next generation with their money instead of destroying them.  Probably an alien that transcends time and is able to re-animate and take over anything biological or technical or mechanical.

The bad guy is probably a re-animated dude from a corporation sponsor who is trying to fight back the alien with force.

It's Hideo though so we are probably all right in a way."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"When I heard those air raid sirens, I thought Resistance (the game series on PS3) was coming back lol"
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"So thematically, it seems to be WWII era but not and with a possibly time-traveling necromancer hunting down a 2006 businessman who protects fetuses for a living.


I forgot where I was going with 'thematically'. "
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,So hideo made metal gear and silent hill right? Or is that two different people.
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,It's like all my nightmares about winking babies and World War II combined.
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,I hope it's only weird as fuck because of a game mechanic that makes up for it
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Something also to do with prisoners. Each character they showed had some futuristic handcuffs.  Also the first trailer the strands on the title are on the letters eatstnding which is a anagram for DNA testing. 
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Is it just my PC, or is the frame rate really unstable? Seems really jittery when watching the youtube video. Looks amazing though!"
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,I ruined some moments of mgs v because I followed it so much prior to release that I'll never watch another kojima trailer again and play it when it comes out and have my mind blown.
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Sorry been out of the loop about this but does anyone know if this is coming to PC? 
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Kojima cannot be stopped.
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Kojima - ""Screw Silent Hills! I'm going to make my own game with Norman Reedus, and it's going to have blackjack, and hookers! In fact, forget the blackjack and hookers!"""
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,I'm betting on some sort of post-apolyptic AI takeover.
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,I think people are just getting more hype about the names involved than anything else. Was very meh to me.
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Soundtrack is dope 
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,This is one of those times when I really regret switching to Xbox...
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"uh, is this PS4 exclusive?"
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Looks great. I'm confused as fuck, but that's par for the course with Kojima. "
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Trying to find answers but theres no answers!!!!
Okay. The answer is that is is no answer then."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"What's up with Max's compass, it keeps spinning after he commands his soldiers, and then stops suddenly"
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Maybe its some sort of valhalla war, everyone has the weapons they used before dying in earth"
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Is is mere coincidence or is Guillermo Del Toro in this trailer?
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Dang I could tell it was mikkelson just from his chin
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,I am so confused right now but Kojima's name is attached to this so I'm obligated to love it no matter what. 
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Not a word uttered, yet I want more. Kojima certainly has a knack for grabbing your attention."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Man I'm high as fuck and watching this was a mistake.
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Yes hideo I know I need a ps4 pro now 
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Gameplay or riot
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,This seems more like a funky art project than a game. 
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"So this is what happens when you loose your award winning franchise to a company only after money.
At this point I'm convinced Kojima is on psychedelics drugs 25/7. I like it."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Do this in VR
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Wtf is going on, army's controlled by zombie worm things. Fetuses in portable tanks and baby dolls becoming alive and aggressive!? "
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,I'm so glad Kojima is basically free to do whatever he wants. Death Stranding will be like an acid trip in video game form. I love how his games always have this surreal atmosphere to them (especially MGS 2 and V). 
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"The 

Fuck?"
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,what the fuck
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,i have no fucking clue what is going on in this trailer.
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,I don't think Hideo Kojima is even making games anymore. 
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,I don't know what I just watched but I'm pretty sure it was cool.
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Dead people getting reanimated by AI oil thing and the baby is the only one with a cure. 

Also illuminati reptilians. "
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,So cool
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,??
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Kojima: ""I'm working on a new game. You remember how Metal Gear had some bizzare aspects to it?""

Developer: ""Yea. You're going to make a more serious game without them?""

Kojima: ""No. It's going to *all* be like that."""
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Jesus I have so many new theories now. 
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Holy shit it's Hannibal
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Why is no one talking about Guillermo Del Toro here? Haha cool guest spot. 
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"I'm even more confused after watching this, yet I want to play it even more now, too"
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Don't get me wrong - I like what I see...

But does it really need to have hugely expensive actors involved? I'd prefer development money being spent elsewhere."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Sorry for my ignorance, and this is probably going to sound really rude, but why is it that people can see something like this and absolutely love it? I've never played a Kojima game, so maybe that's it and I just don't understand his style, but to me this looks completely repulsive.

Again, not trying to be a jerk, just trying to understand what exactly it is that hypes people up so much about this."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,I couldn't tell you what this game is about even if I was part of the development team
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,4/10 not cryptic enough
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Ohhhh, it all makes sense now. Thanks for clearing things up !"

5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Awesome, I love it already."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,I hope it's more of a game than a movie
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,All I can say is tentacles.

I look forward to seeing more. "
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"A lot of people are trying to build up a solid, cohesive setting based on the military gear and the first teaser and what not, but I don't think it's gonna be that simple.  This reminds me of how dreams are structured, with mostly random images, settings, and characters forming a story that makes no real sense in the real world.  I don't think we're going to get much of what the game is truly about from these first two trailers, other than it's gonna be trippy as hell."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,???? This looks great even though I'm so confused.
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,What the fuck is going on?
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,It's going to be the most fukn bizarre game.

5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Ok. So, I'm thinking the babies are clones. The umbilicals are attached to who they're cloned from and you can see a scar on Del Toro's head suggesting what I believe to be a brain transplant. The umbilical cords can do more than just feed life into a new host body, but based on Mads' SKULLS Unit, I'd say they can also bring the dead back to life for a time under your command. Not really sure what the sea-life has to do with all this aside from the motif of live stranding of sea creatures on beaches and maybe with Norman's character being stranded somewhere, possibly an alternat world or future based on the Schwarzschild radius and Dirac equation. I'd also like to point out the ending card's bottom left corner with something called ""DECIMA"" being listed alongside PS4 and Kojo Pro, but I think it could mean a few things. DECIMA might refer to the Roman goddess, who, quoting from Wikipidia, ""measured the thread of life with her rod"" and ""was also revered as the goddess of childbirth."" It could also be the name of their new engine, maybe named after said goddess, or possibly the latanized name for the island ""Deshima"" off the coast of Japan. If I had to guess, Del Toro's character is some kind of scientist responsible for this nonsense we're seeing, Norman is working for him as a bodyguard or a soldier of some sort, and Mads is a soldier interested in harnessing this control over life power for himself."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"I have never been looking forward to a game so much, I'm buying this shit as soon as it hits the shelves. Btw, Is this PS4 exclusive?"

This game is going to fucking launch without us knowing any information about the weird shit going on, I wouldn't be surprised if a week after the game's release despite thousands of people completing it we still don't know what the fuck's going on."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"During WW2, the Nazi dig to deep and greedily and unleashed hell upon human kind. Now these things are taking over the world one human at a time; body snatcher style.

"
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"My genius GF (she made me call her that) came up with a theory: 

* There are no women left in the world (maybe Mikkelsen wants it that way for some reason)
* Reedus had a baby girl connected to him to keep it alive, but it died/disappeared somehow
* del Toro now has the last baby girl in the machine that keeps her alive
* The goal is to keep the baby alive (and probably get her somewhere) in order to repopulate the world with woman

Also notice that the baby doll has the same scar on its stomach that Reedus has in the first trailer. Maybe they've tried to grow babies inside of people (men) but it hasn't worked. Or maybe Mikkelsens people opens people up to check for babies. No idea...

5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"> I love it though.

I honestly don't know what to make of it.  The first trailer was confusing too, but I felt like that one lay on the mystery in a more intriguing way.  This time we saw a scene that looked more coherent and felt longer, but didn't leave me with as much of an impact.  Maybe it was a pacing thing, maybe it was that I felt the music and imagery blended so well in the first one.

Still very intrigued though."

5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,What i hate is they wont even show the most epic moment or ruin plot but theyll at least hint and show glimpses of the set design for the most epic moments. I felt that way in star wars. Not one set surprised me because they were all in the trailer. Even though the plot wasnt given away. Felt rehashed when seeing it. Unlile first time i saw jabba palace or neo out of the matrix. Those sets and aesthetics were awesome and shocking upon viewing. I think movies are good at not showing too much plot...but it doesnt matter when you show every location.

5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,A Hideo Kojima by Hideo Kojima
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"It does look ridiculous. Hideo Kojima is actually fulfilling a role similar to a showrunner in television. However its not a common title in the games industry because writers are almost non-existent. Game designers typically dictate the content of the game, leaving the creation of lore/flavor text/dialogue to the writers. 

He is apart of a rare breed from the early generation of videogames where teams were so small they had no choice but to have people that could do a wide range of development roles. 

Most of the guys that can land a design+writing gig almost always graduate into senior level positions like creative director, and are usually founders of their development studio. 

These are people like Tim Shaffer and Ken Levine. "
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,I think that baby doll's eyes was twitching in morse code as well.
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02, [Plane looks to be a P-47 Thunderbolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_P-47_Thunderbolt)
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Looked up the upside down rainbow thing. It might be a [circumzenithal arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumzenithal_arc).

Del Toro's scars either suggest some form of brain surgery/modification involvement, or an allusion to Frankenstein or the horror genre in general. (Very much Del Toro's craft.) He's also wearing some sort of futuristic handcuffs on his right wrist. Suggests he is a fugitive that managed to escape? 

Del Toro connects himself to the artificial womb. (I'm calling it that until the game smacks me down and tell me no.) Is the baby feeding on him or is it the reverse? I don't see that artificial womb with any sort of nutrients storage system, and babies don't grow via osmosis, so I'm inclined to go with the former. Is that connection anything like how Mads is connected to his skeleton soldiers? Doesn't seem the same. Mad's can burn away (all of his gear seem to be able to burn away). Del Toro's more like an imitation, perhaps?

The baby is male. Given the approximate head to body ratio and his general shape and size, probably close enough to 9 months and ready to be born.

The doll has its lower abdomen cut open and stitched. I'll leave the symbolism of that to people's imagination."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,If anyone plays magic the gathering. The oil makes me think for the phyrexians. For anyone who's curious about the lore the phyrexians basically seek to compleat all organic life by assimilating them with machinery using a weird oil. I got major phyrexian vibes off Mads his eyes reminded me of the art for phyrexian unlife.
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"I believe the baby doll was pulled into the tunnel rather than floating in there naturally, it looks like it was pulled with one of the ""tentacle"" things

also, del toro has same handcuffs as Reedus in first teaser"

5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,The baby and the doll both open only their left eye.
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"I'm thinking there's some reason to connect to others for some health benefit. Perhaps they can connect to specific organs as Del Toro had a scar on his forehead and Reedus had it on his stomach.  
It could be some kind of Matrix-like idea where humans are cultivated. Perhaps Reedus is an escaped pod baby, and that's why his scars are where his belly button/umbilical cord would have been.  
Or perhaps these characters are connected to others to replace organs that have been taken?  
Either way it's fun not to have been spoonfed everything about the game immediately. I really hope it stays mostly this mysterious before the release. Haven't had a truly surprising game since I went into Last of Us blind.  "
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Gave me the creeps to be honest.
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"The Silent Hill series is my favorite series of all time.. and boy is it rough being a Silent Hill fan. The first three games were absolute masterpieces, works of art that I got to experience when I was seriously in elementary school.. it all started off when I was in third grade staying at a friends house who had a ""cool"" mom that let us rent whatever video game we wanted regardless of the rating. The Silent Hill 2 box art stuck out the most to me so I picked it up. We didn't even get past the apartment section but the entire night I played I was so immersed and terrified, it was wonderful.

Two years later around fifth or six grade I finally got my hands on a copy of the game and played through it. I loved it so much I would research the symbolism on forums such as neoseeker and it was just so fucking enthralling not to mention the soundtrack was the first thing I put on my iPod when I finally got one. When Silent Hill Three came out I had a similar experience and absolutely loved it.. same thing with the soundtrack. As time past and the Silent Hill 4 trailer came out I was so god damn pumped because boy the commercial was creepy as fuck. Unfortunately while it was a good game is let me down.. which is foreshadowing to the events I had to go through with each recurring Silent Hill game that proceeded it. They got so bad that in fact I still haven't even played Downpour. When PT came out I was 22 and I felt like a god damn child again, so fucking giddy. Even though Team Silent had disbanded I had full faith in Kojima and with Del Toro at the reigns of monster design ugh, it was a total wet dream. Seriously I had to see a doctor to get meds for the raging hard on I had pushing through my jeans 24/7. And don't get me started on the disappointment I had when it was canceled.

When Death Stranding got announced I was hoping so bad that Kojima was pulling wool over our eyes and that it in fact was just a working title for Silent Hill and that the Konami debacle was just some kind of marketing ploy. However now.. now I don't feel so disappointed. I also got to experience Metal Gear Solid 2 at a young age and this game looks to be like the love child created during a disgusting fuck fest carried out between Silent Hill and Metal Gear. This game just oozes creepiness and has the militaristic aspects and weirdness Metal Gear and holy fuck am I excited. I hope Kojima gets to implement some of his creepy ideas that he had for Silent Hills into this game while also letting his creatively flow freely into what seems to be a totally beautiful mind fuck of a game. A game that looks to be the type that will be discussed and theorized upon for years to come."

Same track that was in Kojimas final MGSV trailer which came out after all the events went down with Silent Hills cancelation. The track that was probably going to be used in Silent Hills. Fuck that game would have been awesome. 
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Kojima loved ST so i'm assuming it influenced him at least that much.

5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Oh shit, the earth's magnetic poles are all fucked up and that's why all the whales n shit are dead. 

The earth's magnetic poles have ""switched"" in the past and will again in the future, if I recall correctly. It's also assumed that when they switch it won't be immediate, and there will be random north/south poles all over. Also, whales, migratory birds, and tons of other animals use the earth's magnetic fields for navigation, and if those fields fuck up then that would explain the beaching.  

EDIT: I think the question is why have the poles fucked up? Did those floating alien things in the first trailer crash land on Earth and their ship exploded? Are they even aliens? Was there some sort of manmade apocalypse event that led to this? The oil is still unexplained. Maybe drilling for oil awakened some ancient horrors that spilled out and caused this chaos.  


EDIT 2: Hell, maybe it's used to point to the baby because the baby is really close and he seems to know. Maybe he's a baby hunter. "

You won't see a rainbow with ends pointing away from the ground while standing on the Earth's surface.  You can see circular rainbows only from the air. 

It's a subtle clue that something is extraordinarily fucked up.  Either the sun, or you, are in an entirely wrong place, or physics have encountered an exception. 

Edit: Also, unrelated to physics, the fetus in the jar opens one eye, the same eye that the broken doll opens when it encounters Mikkelsen's character.  I think they're using the fetus as some kind of psychic reconnaissance. "

Being in an artificial womb makes it kinda not naturally born."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Wild guess here with regards to the baby, but the shot of the baby's face and Del Toro's facing the camera led me to think that they are the one in the same.
Perhaps the game could revolve around death and reincarnation with a character trying to usher in their next ""reincarnation"" (personified by an actual fetus that they carry) through the afterlife. 

That might explain the objects from different time periods (the futuristic handcuffs, the modern helmet worn by Mikkelson, and the WWII era military equipment) and the hellish atmosphere depicted in both trailers, which really struck me as otherworldly. 

Mikkelson's character might be some entity (the Devil perhaps?) that prevents this process of reincarnation and attempts to ""assimilate"" them into that strange network of cables.

?????

The only thing that is certain is that this game is intriguing af"
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"all good points. I'd argue though that the elements you highlight signify, to me, not *time* travel, but *planar* travel. Maybe it won't be called this, but I believe this game takes place in Limbo. I think Mads, Toro, and Norm all come from a world similar to ours, and they developed some sort of way to travel beyond the veil of death, by harnessing the soul of a fetus - suspended chemically between death / undeath.  In christian mythology, stillborn children, unbaptized, are all sent to Limbo. The middle place, between heaven and hell. It's an un-realm, where the infinity of light and darkness, heaven and hell, are canceled out. It's just nothing. A lot of people just picture a white void...but an endless, quiet realm full of dead sea creatures, synthwave, shambling corpses of WWII victims and C-list celebrities- That seems like a Limbo that a man like Kojima might envision.

So yes. I think the babies are used to get in- The way reedus did, first trailer. But Toro has his still...And he seems to be pursued for it. He hesitates as he grants life to the child, and Mads and his creatures seem to feel its awakening...It's possible that life in a place of undeath is a thing of great upset.

Tinfoil time! If not due to dead-baby-powered-dimension hopping, I think that the scars, umbilical cords and lack of belly buttons are due to the fact that Reedus and Mads are (or were, before dying) all *clones*. Not born, *made*. Perhaps they were genetically engineered soldiers, thus the buffness and the gruffness. Insofar as they aren't created by 'god', they got no souls, so they are kind of welcome in Limbo. The five floating angels from the first trailer are literally just angels, the dead shambling about are dead souls, the umbilical magic is ""life"" in that life is extra sacred in this realm between life and death...Idk. it certainly seems to fit with the name ""death stranding"". 

Toro, meanwhile, is some sort of brain-death victim. He had brain surgery and is in a coma, struggling through the underworld in a vain attempt to return to life. Maybe he thinks that baby can bring him back. 

the oily strands on all the tanks and planes and people are metaphors for dicks. "
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Tank is World War 2. Going by the sides and suspension, it's an M36 Jackson.

Edit: It's an M10"
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"I think your time travel assumption is correct. I'm not an expert but I am a nerd when it comes to military equipment and technology. The OG Skull Unit is dressed to the 9's in WW2 gear and equipment. The tank and airplanes are WW2 era and the rifles carried by the troops are heavily inspired by the M1 Garand. (I say 'inspired' since the rear sight and stock are not the same used by the Garand) Same goes for Mikkelsen. His weapon is heavily based on basic modern military rifles that resemble the M4, M16, HK416 and 417, C7A1, etc. The attachments and scope used on his rifle, the ballistic helmet, NVG's are all much more advanced than the soldiers under his control. The Death Squad actually appear to be soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division. Specifically the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment based on [this helmet](https://www.atthefront.com/us_images/head/506WW2_side.jpg) which can be seen on the soldiers in the tunnel.

5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"From what I can gather, it seems to be a horror game about evil dudes controlling zombified soldiers, horrifying biological tanks, and screaming planes with ""death strands"" and what looks like dark magic, following the plot of some weird lab baby (likely born with some ability or other crucial to combating death strand magic), and the old guy it's been placed in the hands of. I think it might also have something to do with time travel. I'm honestly a little confused, myself. It looks like it's supposed to be about some kind of weird necromancy where you just plug into something with a death strand and you control it, which is why you had a soldier walking behind the tank with a strand leading to it, like a leash, and that's also what was trailing behind each of the planes - several broken death strands.

5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"I think a lot of people are only excited because it's Kojima. There's no doubt both of the trailers so far make no fucking sense, but the excitement comes from wondering what's next.

I don't think it's artsy either, I think it's very silly. But I like it."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"I hear you. Although Kojima's always been like this for his trailers. For what it's worth, he doesn't really strike me as the ""art for art's sake"" type - which is really where the danger with being ""artsy"" is. I might be giving him too much credit, but there tends to be a reason why he does certain things, even if his logic can get convoluted and sometimes the effort falls flat. At the very least his games tries things that make them an interesting (if not unique) experience. The mainstream game industry has often been criticised for homogeneity in its ideas and execution - Kojima's work stands out due to his willingness to turn things upside down and not settle for the obvious. From time to time he gets it right, and the results are brilliant. But yes, he can get it disappointingly wrong too.

For me, it's just great to see him not be burdened by having to make a Metal Gear game, or be under pressure from Konami. It sounds like it wasn't a very healthy situation, and I imagine he had to compromise his vision more often than what was reasonable. I'm quite curious to see what he can do now that he's in a better working environment."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"I'm with you man, don't worry. I'd like even an inkling of what any part of the game even is before I'm interested. Both of these trailers are nonsense and the most people can do is speculate, it almost seems like it's a shock value thing. I hope it's a good game but who knows."

At 2:26 the real baby opens his right eye in a similar way the doll does at 4:12. 

Maybe Mikkelsens character has some kind of pact with the ""tube virus"" or whatever is destroying the world and has to hunt babies for some reason. In exchange he could have been given powers to control some of these tubes, pulling fallen soldiers from WWII
(definitely US soldiers, given the uniforms and the rifles that look like knock-off M1 Garands) out of their graves, and attaching them to the doll to spy on del Toro/the real baby."

5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"The floating people from the first trailer are supposedly significant characters in Death Stranding, maybe even the ""bosses"". I think it makes sense that Mikkelson's character is important, as the character is being portrayed by Mikkelson, who is also friend with Kojima. I can't imagine him getting a throwaway role. 


I think a huge conflict, thematically at least, is going to be between Life and Death, and what they represent (Fate and Free-will, ""No"" potential and ""Limitless"" potential). Maybe even between Light and Dark.


Or better (more accurate?) yet, between Light/photons and the Darkness of a black hole. Light can't escape from a black hole due to  its gravity, so there are some parallels to how life can't come out of death. However, this goes against the idea of reincarnation that you and others have brought up. It's definitely an interesting idea, I just didn't get anything that was happening with the baby haha. 


Describing Mikkelson as ""assimilating"" the others is very interesting; I was honestly thinking of a parasitic relationship in the sense that it seems like he (and others like him) are working through the network their strands form. Very intriguing, curious to see the role of those equations and of black holes in this game."

M36 is a long barrel while M10 is a shorter one, also the turret is more  pointy at the back and has an arrow tip similar to the one in the trailer."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Yeah, the rifles they were using was one of the biggest giveaways, but I don't consider myself an expert enough to confidently say one way or the other that it is time-travel. I suppose one thing to bring up that while their gear is older, that isn't to say that setting is in the past. It could be a case of reanimation, with WW2 troops running around.


Cool insight about the helmet, I've been spending the evening looking at a lot of Wikipedia pages for them and it's neat to see their evolution. "

Yea but their shoulder patches don't look like a Screaming Eagle Patch. It looked more like flaming dagger."
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"Time Travel is jumping the gun a bit.

One thing to note is that all of the WW2 era soldiers are skeletal whilst the modern people are exactly that, people. No decay to be seen other than Mads' who is sans-attached baby like the other more human characters have been.

One guy above had a theory of this being purgatory or the afterlife. It makes sense considering the name and the fairly obvious themes of life and death (ceasarian scars all over the place, babies, corpses, skulls, wombs etc.)

I like the idea of the 'babies' being your soul that you're attached to. Guillermo's woke up when he plugged it in and Norman Reedus' was connected to him by an umbilical cord or something. If the baby dies or gets lost, perhaps you're doomed to stay in purgatory forever, slowly decaying into a moving skeleton, a shadow of your former life. Maybe all those soldiers who died on the battlefield in WW2 are still roaming the afterlife."

They're treated as nothing more than obligatory obstacles and as excuses for the hero to show off what he's got. It's my biggest gripe with MCU, and probably the number one reason why I can't help but view their films as B class stuff, apart from a few exceptions. MCU films almost never see through with their villains, or they're afraid of creating a genuinely threatening and unsettling opponent because that would have an impact on the generally light tone that they constantly go for (with a few exceptions, again). Several Marvel villains have been established as intimidating and interesting at first, but then reduced to almost jokes later on, and they end up lacking all of their initial punch by the end of their respective films.

I don't need every single possible plot detail tied up if you look hard enough, some things left to pure fan speculation are fun too, but I also like the idea of being rewarded for being observant and thorough as opposed to a game that's indiscriminately random.

5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,"To me I feel like Hopkins was a genius killer, while Mikkelsens Hannibal reminds me of a Lucifer type character. He's pure evil and he plays with the lives of those around him by tempting them to do things and corrupting all those around him. "
5g0pjm,2016-12-02,2016-12-02,Their acting was very predatory. I think that's what made their roles as Hannibal so good.

To be really fair, Hopkins had like ~~45~~ 15 mins of screen time as Hannibal, max.

I noticed you can move while holding your breath but I can't see what I'm supposed to do with that. does hiding behind rocks help or something? do I have to hold my breath until I run out or something?

dvdl4w,2019-11-12,2019-11-12,[removed]
dvdl4w,2019-11-12,2019-11-12,"What I think some people underestimate about Death Stranding is that is isn’t just some walking simulator; Death Stranding is basically a science fiction horror game with serious story-telling to back it up.

Many horror games really are just kind of walking around while being scared by stuff, or running from things and in Death Stranding there is constant fear and danger while out in the wild of multiple factors, like >!BTs and MULEs, and later Homo Demens.!<

I think the only real difference here is that Kojima is less in your face with the Horror aspect of the game. It doesn’t have to tell you “this is supposed to be scary.” It is scary, stress inducing, and it throws along the delivery mechanic as this bizarre difficultly factor that you constantly have to weigh against the dangers you are faced with.

Underneath all of that is a story of hope despite isolation and fear caused by a bizarre and dangerous apocalypse.

Anyways, nice work as always Grafo. The dark flickering background reminded me of this point and I felt I had to share."

dvdl4w,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,"Pay attention to your scanner doo-dad.  If they're close, it will point toward the closest one, and when it turns orange and clicks fast, hold your breath and keep moving away from it.  Once it turns blue again, stop, look around, and plot a course through the BTs."
dvdl4w,2019-11-12,2019-11-12,"You need to keep moving because they don't go away. They can temporarily go invisible, but they're still near you. Do a scan when they do this. Crouch and hold your breath and you should get past them. You can fairly close to a docile one while doing that."

>!You can just run past them most of the time, If they are too annoying just let them drag you under and kill the big one and the section will become BT free until you step out of the area!<"
dvdl4w,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,"I haven’t been caught one time and I find the stealth to be a little too easy for my liking, even on hard. Basically, you just have to crouch, scan, and stay clear of the BTs until your scanner gives you the all clear. Hold your breath if they get too close and keep holding your breath until you’re far enough away. Don’t wait for the prompt, that means they’re already too close and aware of your existence. Make sure not to hold your breath too long or Sam will take a deep breath and alert every BT in the area. It can help if you hold L1 and look at which direction your scanner is pointed. It will always point toward the closest BT and flap at varying degrees of speed to let you know how close they are."
dvdl4w,2019-11-12,2019-11-12,[removed]
dvdl4w,2019-11-12,2019-11-12,"So, you only have to hold your breath when the scanner is spinning orange. Just hold your breath and walk directly away.

When its blue, crouch walk away, when another appears, just change your direction in a diagonal away from the scanners pointing, but still towards your goal. You'll end up doing a zigzag almost.

BTs end up a non-issue anyways tbh."

dvdl4w,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,"Death Stranding feels like the realistic portrayal of a Journey similar to Lord of the Rings. Like Lord of the Rings, there is plenty of epic moments and adventure to be found, but 90% of the game are the parts in Lord of the Rings you don’t see; Such as the long hours where nothing eventful happens until you reach a milestone that pushes the story forward. You feel a sense of accomplishment because of those long hours you put in to reach your destination, but it doesn’t exactly mean you enjoy playing the parts where your hero has to take a break for a few minutes because he’s tired. 

If you can appreciate the sights, the characters, and the story that gives purpose to the gameplay, you’ll absolutely love it. If none of the trailers had you wanting to learn more about the world and it’s setting, you’re better off just reading a wiki of the game."
dvdl4w,2019-11-12,2019-11-12,"If you're really curious there are plenty of reviews and stuff on YouTube now that the game is out. Here's [SkillUp's review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuLRlRLBwQ8) I thought it was pretty solid. 

As a suuuuper quick summary if you don't want to watch anything, something bad happened that killed most of the world's population and caused the survivors to live in isolated pockets. There's no roads or transportation left, so society is basically wholly disconnected and relies on people like the main character to deliver things between the pockets of survivors. An organization comes up with a plan to reconnect society and uses the main character's delivery making skills to do so. As you go out to reconnect society by making deliveries psychotic pockets of humanity and spooky ghosts that came around after the bad thing happened try to stop you."
dvdl4w,2019-11-12,2019-11-12,"Basically, an apocalypse happens that prevents the dead's souls from going to the afterlife, so they come back as scary ghost bois. If they contact a humans blood, it creates an explosion that leaves a huge crater. Also at the same time, a mysterious rain starts happening that makes things accelerate in time, including non-living things, causing builldings and machines to collapse.

If you can get past the idea of delivering stuff as the loop, there’s a lot to enjoy. The story though is bat shit crazy. Someone told me yesterday they loved the story because they’re big fans of symbolism. I’d like to see them explain what the fuck symbol Kojima is making by throwing your characters own feces in a grenade at ghosts."

dvdl4w,2019-11-12,2019-11-12,"I have about 25-30 hours logged into it so I'll try to explain. There's a lot to unpack.
 
You spend the majority of the game walking by yourself, that is a deal breaker for many people. The main challenge is the open world's landscape and the major gameplay loop is acquiring equipment that makes your travels easier, whether it be dealing with pesky ghosts or scaling mountains. It's a management game, not an action game.

The story is very unique, but also very strange. There is a lot of sci fi and much of the dialogue can be Star Trek levels of sci fi jargon. This can also be a deal breaker for some people.

Many people have different hooks, I think the management is cool and the story is cool even if it does get exhausting at times, but what really hooks me is the world building. Literally.

Structures you build and leave behind appear in other players worlds and their structures appear in yours. It's really cool to see the changes after a day of being offline, a highway could have progressed or a little ""town"" could have popped up somewhere. I even find myself taking time to just place structures where they might be needed and donating materials to others. It's really really cool.

TLDR; it's a management game with a crazy sci fi story and a shared world building mechanic. This is NOT a fast paced game and focuses more on immersion and world building rather than addictive gameplay hooks. I love it, but can definitely see why people would find it boring."

See this got me wondering, if those who get to playing this a few months from now (xmas present or just get around to it later) are going to just step out into the game and the world is already built for them :D

Most likely not, I would assume the devs have some system to work around this, but it would be interesting to find out how they're doing it specifically."
dvdl4w,2019-11-12,2019-11-12,So is the world eventually going to be like a huge sprawling metropolis built entirely by players or is it instance based and every time you play you get put into a different instance that resets after a certain time?

dvdl4w,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,"> You spend the majority of the game walking by yourself, that is a deal breaker for many people. 

You spend the majority of the story missions walking by yourself. But I don't think that's the majority of the game since you can choose to avoid the story missions and instead focus on building. There's opportunity to build roads and bridges for vehicles. Unlike most resource collection/building games where you just walk up to a tree and press a button, you can collect resources from raiding enemy outposts which is a lot more fun."

dvdl4w,2019-11-12,2019-11-13,"I'm sure the story is great, but i watch Movies and TV if all i want is a good story. The problem is that this game doesn't really advertise itself as a cinematic hollywood walking simulator. Coming from a dude known for stealthy shooter games this game just seems falsely advertised.

Don't get me bent, i actually like playing this one sandbox survival walking simulator myself. It's just that the gameplay is more intuitive. I'm constantly trecking across land for new clothing, evading wolves, looking for water, firestarting materials, making sure my clothes don't get too wet, etc. Trying to survive in a harsh Canadian wilderness. I get the appeal of that kicked back and more relaxed style of gameplay, it can be refreshing. But something about this game just lacks all the elements of The Long Dark to the point where i would constantly be asking myself what i'm doing. If it was more of a survival game with more intense survival elements maybe i'd be into it, but trecking across an environment that isn't trying to kill me constantly in some way is boring gameplay imo."

dvdl4w,2019-11-12,2019-11-12,I would agree but I did that with The Last of Us. I wish I experienced the first 15 minutes with a controller in my hand. So much story can fit in that short amount of time
dvdl4w,2019-11-12,2019-11-12,uhhh you accidentally capitalized the U in u/srgrafo . Its gotta be lower to page them! have a good day!
dvdl4w,2019-11-12,2019-11-12,"Do what I did.  Rent it first.  I rented it from Redbox and and played it until I beat it.  Personally, I thought the story was decent, but I absolutely hated the gameplay.  You might like it, you might not, but if you rent it first you could be saving yourself a good chunk of change if you don’t like it, and it’s really not too much extra if you do like it."
dvdl4w,2019-11-12,2019-11-12,"No problem. I've seen many people and even professional reviewers say the game is cumbersome, which is very very true. But that's kind of the point and overall challenge of the game, it's up to you as the player to NOT make the journey cumbersome.

If that sounds like your thing, I would for sure recommend!"

He's always been in the business of interactive movies, people just happen to like the extra parts that he tacked on top. And from what I've seen this is the most Kojima game ever.  

I agree that advertising it as an ""action"" game is pretty misleading though, but that's probably Sony marketing's fault."

dvdl4w,2019-11-12,2019-11-12,"As someone who is over 40 hours in and is hardly halfway done (assuming later chapters are shorter. Going by chapters I'm only 1/3 of the way done. No input on that please.) I think rushing it may have severely affected your enjoyment. I'm not trying to be confrontational, I'm just trying to say it's a game that shines in the quiet moments and taking time to reflect and take in the world is part of what makes it work. To anyone thinking about renting it, I would say beating it should not be the intention if you've only got it for a few days. The intention should be to try it out.

On the other hand, some people are just going to be predisposed to not be receptive to the game's pace. Taking it slow will not make those people enjoy it any more and you may be one of those folks. I think it's an absolute masterpiece so far and is a serious contender against MGSV for my favorite game of all time, but the game is divisive for a reason."

dvdl4w,2019-11-12,2019-11-12,"Meh, I don’t think I missed out on much.  I played the whole game, and I did do many of the side missions and made a point to try out the other features like leaving a few things and structures that I thought could really help people, and finishing other people’s structures with them.  

Story aside, the end of the game is is pretty much exactly the same as the beginning.  Take this thing and bring it over there.  The only big difference between the beginning and the end is you have weapons that actually work well, but the combat system isn’t really that great, so it doesn’t make the game much more fun.  At the beginning of the game my focus was on speed to escape attackers, and at the end my focus was just being absolutely armed to the teeth to where I could just demolish anything that confronted me.  


The fact is that you’ll either like the gameplay or you won’t, but if you finish the game, you’ll understand exactly what it is.  Kudos to you if you like it, but I just found the whole thing extremely tedious, which made me sad because I’ve played and loved every Metal Gear game.  Even so, I thought the acting was great and I really liked the story.  I kind of think this game would’ve made a cooler TV series or movie.  

So if you enjoy trekking through gorgeous landscapes for hours in what’s essentially a hiking/mountain climbing simulator this game is awesome.  But that’s also exactly what it is."
dvdl4w,2019-11-12,2019-11-12,"Honestly, there are a lot of games I did like but I just wanted to play the story, so I rented them, beat them in 3 days and then returned them.

The art is mediocre and shows a clear lack of effort. He has other stuff where you can see he has some level of artistic ability, but this meme shit of his is designed to be quick stick figures and it apes the style of better, more talented web comic artists and it has no appeal for me. He wasn't getting any traction with his other stuff so he switched to this homogenized, lowest common denominator bullshit and people just eat it up. 

None of it is remotely funny either. Half the time there isn't even any context outside of ""does anybody else like/hate this thing very commonly discussed on reddit?"" He obviously gloms on to whatever the topic of the week is and then purposefully limits the message in the comic so that it can be used as a template by even less talented people to recycle the same bullshit over and over. It might as well be clip art."

bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,*trgw erred
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,I wanna see a compilation of all the adaptations of this drawing.
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,How do we know the baby isn’t some kind of fuel?
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,Kinda looks like baby Gluttony
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,Why do they need to carry those babies
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,"Could someone explain what the baby is for exactly?

I've seen the trailer and I still don't get it"
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,kojima gonna settle this abortion debate once and for all with this game.
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,cursed image

bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,9 min trailer and I still have no damn clue what the game is about.
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,Calvin & Mads here everyone.
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,Fish bone
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,What is this game even about. I’ve seen the trailers. No idea.
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,this is hella good. well done!
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,When is this game coming out?
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,"Was just telling a friend about this the other day. ""I saw what Kojima can do now that he's free of corporate control. I'm not entirely sure *what the fuck it was* that I saw, but I saw it."""
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,**WTF** why is this not nsfw smh 🤦‍♂️
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,Look at the spaces between each bar that baby can’t reach each because of his legs(even the grown man too)
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,For someone who doesn’t play Death Stranding this is weird af
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,That’s fucking crazy 😜
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,Asylum for the feeling.
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,Wtf why did you draw the fetus out walking?
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,"How accurate an Image can be about the trailer.

~~needs more militar skeletons on fire~~"
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,so profoundly disturbing
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,"Just as lighthearted as the game will be, I’m sure of it!"
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,What did you use to create it?
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,is this kodone?
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,Aww
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,blessed imagery.
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,With no idea what this game is about i'm now terrifyingly intrigued
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,I saw the trailer and had no idea what was going on but for some reason I really like this
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,Could have gone my whole life without seeing this disturbing piece...
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,Blood bag
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,What did you just do to my childhood?
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,"Death Stranding at this point makes as much sense as Calvinball. 

I like it."
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,This game depresses me and I haven’t even played it yet
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,This name looks pretty neat. But what the fuck is it about?
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,"""Never preorder"""
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,Haha just saw this on your instagram!! Cool stuff!
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,YAAAA WEY
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,Yet somehow more coherent than the trailers.
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,This makes me uncomfortable
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,Does anyone else think this game looks way too weird to be enjoyable?
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,JESUS
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,"Wow, this is awesome. I remember reading the complete collections of Calvin and Hobbes when I was a kid and this looks like it could have almost come right out of on the stories. Amazing work."
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,I love that you thought of this mash up and made it happen. Very cool!
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,Love it and everything about it.
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,I can’t wait to see how utterly incomprehensible this game is
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,"Im excited to see what Death Stranding will be, but are we kind of going overboard with the fandom because its made by a legendary developer?"
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,I look forward to playing that game and finding out what the hell it's all about.
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,Small guy reminds me of Bonk
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,That is awesome!
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,The guy *mildly* reminds me of Vinny from Vinesauce
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,Norman reedus and the funky fetus
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,New hyped game? C&H fan art? See you at the top boys
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,"Or as I call the game, ""Norman Retus and the Fetus"""
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,"THIS! THIS IS THE GREAT SPAGHETTI INCIDENT!

I knew we would eventuality find out about it!"

bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,"I thought the game looked horribly stupid. Maybe it'll change my mind when i play it. But that trailer, just me me wonder if giving him the full reign was a bad idea."
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,"Now I get the plot.
The trailer is so vague"
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,"Nice! The style is very reminiscent of Calvin and Hobbes, I love it."
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,"But how do you know you are a fan already?

Doesn't matter looks amazing you are extemly talented do you have any more?"
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,"Haha, this is going to be one of those games where everyone dies horribly, isn't it?"
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,"Thanks I hate it. 

But at the same time it's pretty cool."
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,This is uncannily like Calvin and Hobbes... The only art style that could make something this dark seem so light
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,This game out yet? Crazy concept
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,"Still wish we were getting Silent Hills...

Awesome art man."
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,"This is amazing, /r/TIHI material too though"

I like it..."
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,Is this a Calvin and Hobbes reference?
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,"Only Kojima could make an 8 minute trailer for his upcoming game and somehow, confuse everyone even more."
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,"pretty cool, looking forward for the rest"
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,Calvin  👏and👏 hobbes 👏
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,Looks like Calvin and Hobbes but without Hobbes
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,I’m going to assume this game will overhyped for graphics and recognizable actors but will be shit 4 months after release
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,What the frick is this
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,Does anyone even know what the fuck this game is even about?
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,Fucking awesome bro well done. I cant wait for this game to be out

bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,art style looks like calvin and hobbes
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,"So, what is Death Stranding about? Anybody know? Cause it still remains a huge mystery to me lol maybe I missed something idk but visually the game looks great and the cast is awesome but wtf even is it 😭"
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,Calvin and Hobbes style
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,This reminds me of old Cartoon Network art
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,No one gonna comment on this originally being a picture of calvin and hobbes
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,God the baby from Death Stranding is cute
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,"Love it, like a creepy Calvin & Hobs.

bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,I love the bill waterson style
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,This must be Bill Waters secret Reddit account.

bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,Pretty much Death Stranding and Kojima’s mind behind it in a nutshell.
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,I never thought I'd see Calvin and Hobbes in anything new.
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,"Still confused. Thank you OP, very cool!"
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,Calvin and Hobbes?

bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,Upvote for calvin and hobbes
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,Seems weird that 'fan art' exists before the game is even released to create actual fans

bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,Still don't know ANYTHING about this game and it's confusing as hell.
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,So can someone tell me what the deal is with the baby in the tube?
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,This looks like Calvin and Hobbes
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-04,How can you be a fan of something you’ve never played?
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-04,It's a fetus and a Reedus
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-04,Absolutely brilliant
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-09,This feels like a dark Calvin & Hobbes comic

bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-02,"I find this absolutely adorable, thank you for doing this"

bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,OP literally colored over a Calvin and Hobbes comic. You can still even see some bits of orange on the guys face

bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,"I love Calvin and Hobbes. This is great.

Snowmen version next please.

Mankind is dying off. They need to deliver supplies/some kind stuff far off but don't really have the means to do it as there are monsters around that will kill you. But there is a sort of 'death realm', that you go to when you die and you can reincarnate by fighting your way back through that realm. This is why Norman Reedus carries a fetus with him, that is what he is regrown into. Basically clones, shadow realm monsters, apocolyptic future-scifi-horror."

Death Stranding is a completely new type of action game, where the goal of the player is to reconnect isolated cities and a fragmented society. It is created so that all elements, including the story and gameplay, are bound together by the theme of the ""Strand"" or connection. As Sam Porter Bridges, you will attempt to bridge the divides in society, and in doing create new bonds or ""Strands"" with other players around the globe. Through your experience playing the game, I hope you'll come to understand the true importance of forging connections with others.

That’s about all *I* could gather. Oh, and that really attractive French actress is in it."
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,"Looks to me like an open world stealth exploration game with lots of physics based puzzles. Upon getting caught by bad guys, you go enjoy WW1 scenery and the game turns into a FPS until you fight your way out.

&#x200B;

Plot seems to be about connecting small towns/pockets of humanity in a post-apocalyptic world. 

&#x200B;

Now, if I'm going to go completely off the handles into my own conjectures based off a less than 10 minute trailer:

>!Looks like someone screwed up with a new technology, possibly in a war, which ended up bridging the past of the world with the present. This resulted in stealthy tentacle monsters coming out to try and drag people back into the past. Also we have some pregnant women at the time of the start of this whose babies were affected by it and will never grow to adulthood, and instead stay in a neonatal form stuck in the past. Present day women are probably unable to concieve anymore and humanity is facing extinction because of this. The tentacle monsters likely destroyed all telecommunications infrastructure and wander the land preventing ease of travel, resulting in splintered and isolated communities across America (and the rest of the world). !<

>!You take the role of a bitter and disillusioned man, who may have been connected to that doomsday technology and lost his wife who died trying to reconnect humanity. Your role is to take over as the field agent of that large project to return communications and unify those isolated communities and come up with a cure. Add in a magic cult group that is after all your shiny technology and hates your mission, an antagonist from the main character's past who will probably chase you through the shooter sequences of various wars, and you get Death Stranding. !<

>!Main themes will likely be about humanity's violent past, starting wars with people whenever we find them, which sparks the idea that maybe humanity should be kept in little groups to prevent wars, contrasted against the fact that humans are social animals and that interaction is needed to move everyone forward. There will likely be a large focus on the main character's past involvement with what led to the current apocalyptic world, dealing with that baggage, and then moving on and making new friends and seeing how the main character affects people in a more positive way. !<"
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,I think you've got it summed up right there.
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,I have some ideas
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,L A D D E R
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,"My theory, if it is even worth 5 cents is:

It seems like Mads Mikkelsen is a commando of some kind from the games semi-recent past. Maybe like 2050ish. Some way of making soldiers invincible was developed, perhaps even entire cities, leading to an arms race. (nuclear weapons could become useless if you could just phase an entire city into a different plane of existence for a few seconds.) However it seems this technology was poorly understood, and this alternate plane is inhabited by hostile creatures, and using this technology to open doorways only allowed them into ruin our plane of existence. The fetuses must in some way be able to straddle the line between the two dimensions, or see these creatures or doorways or something. But as a result society has collapsed, with areas having to wall themselves off from the death strands, or something like that. Locking out the use of this technology might also have the side effect of isolating that community from other areas."

With what we have seen about death stranding, it could be he opposite, a lame gameplay of basically walking around, sneaking/avoiding/escaping either guys in similar suits or the ....things, but with a unique story with lots of potential for world building and an epic story.

bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,"I have a theory that it has to do with space time, look at the new trailer and tell me it doesnt sound like that, ""those attached to the past"" ""those who cant be in the future"" there are wwii soldiers and even a tank, there are this things that i bet are kinda like tindalo's hounds that seem to be 4D beings who are chasing the ones who play with space and time, i dont know about the baby, but im sure it has something to do with the body its connected to, kinda like an anchor to your original space time maybe"
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,"Lol because nobody knows what the fuck the game is supposed to be about. Kojima only gives little updates on status, not so much gameplay. Is it a survival game? An rpg? Some say it's an Amazon delivery boy sim."
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,It's not out until later this year and to try and describe what limited things we've seen in trailers would be less than helpful.
bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,Because literally nobody knows what the game is about.  They have released several trailers and instead of clarifying things each trailer has been more of a mindfuck than the last and given us more questions.

Huh. Idk about ""Samuel,"" but I believe ""Porter"" is French for ""to wear/to carry,"" and ""Bridges,"" well y'know... they connect things that might otherwise be isolated.

bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-04,"Yeah, I remember playing MGSV the first time and thinking ""Hey, this is pretty good!""

Then I recently replayed it, and it has not aged well. There is too much tedium with the fake open world aspect of the locations, everything is too far apart, and the side ops were awful. 

The story itself didn't age well, either. It's quite choppy and the pacing and character development is unnatural. The difference in emotional delivery between Snake, Ocelot, and Miller was like 3 people having a conversation with each other but in a different room at different times. 

I feel like it was a mixture of being too grand in scope and being cut short by Konami. 

Hopefully they can fix both of those glaring issues with Death Stranding. 

The tech in the game looks awesome, so far, as does gameplay and design, but I'll keep my fingers crossed for the complete game.

Kojima is good at building hype, that's for sure."

It’s another thing to want to grow lots of your eggs (have lots of children).

bw28qu,2019-06-02,2019-06-03,"What about the choice to become pregnant? As far as I know the best way to completely avoid pregnancy is to abstain from unprotected sex until one is ready to accept consequences of unprotected sex. Even then, we need to educate people about their actions and the consequences of their actions.

Edit:

Guess people don't like differing opinions but anyways, the main point I was trying to bring across was that if someone **voluntarily** engages in sex and brings about another existence of life, then the responsibility for preserving that life falls onto the parties that engaged in sex. If someone is acting purely of their own free will then they have a responsibility to take accountability for their actions."

inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,You have a future as Lea Seydoux double!
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,when i first saw this I legit thought it was the same image but flipped
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"Literally sat there and thought, what’s the point of this? Then I noticed the title.
I literally thought it was just the same picture but from the opposite direction."
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"Lip sync some lines, cause wow that is impeccable! Nice job."
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"Wait, which one is the cosplay? I'm serious, I can't tell"
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,E a t
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,[They're the same picture...](https://i.imgur.com/XFqHtXE.jpg)
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,So what do they taste like?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"Ewww, you even made the bug!!! 

....eat it."
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Which is the in-game one?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"This is the second cosplay I've seen from this user. Both times I literally could not tell that the other image wasn't rendered in-engine. The only reason I know this is the same user is because I had that thought, and said to myself, ""I've only seen one other cosplay like this"" and checked her post history. Phenomenal work on her part."
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,I think its awesome. Because the first thing I thoight was: is this Fragile but in a little diffrent resolution.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"i havent ever seen this game, so i cant rell which is the real one"
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Wait. You mean both of those aren't just screenshots from the game?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"Hmmmm, forbidden gummy."
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Found Lea Seydoux's Reddit account.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Which... Which one's the cosplay?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Very nice
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"Ok, you've either got really, really good cameras, or that is some of the best cgi I have seen in my entire life."
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Glad to see this game getting some love. I knew I couldn’t be the only one.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Took me a sec to realize that it was a cosplay
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Like how u got the cryptobiote lol.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"Lol i thought it was a meme, then i read the title and realized that the second photo is in real life! Great work!"
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,This is a cosplay? To be honest I just thought it was two sides of her face
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,Pam: Its the same picture
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,Which one is the in game character?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"This cosplay holds up really well. It's Fragile, but not that fragile."
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,You're pretty good
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"So you’re Fragile, huh? But are you *that* fragile?

Great work!"
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"Great job! At a glance, I thought this was a meme template.

Edit: Clarifying the cosplay is so good I thought both were screengrabs from the game."
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"Having never played the game before, I have no idea which is from the game."
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,You may be fragile but you don't look so fragile
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Ummm... which one is the OG??
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"Why is this so trippy? I swear, I can't tell the difference. That's some good cosplaying right there."
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Which one is you? Lol. Very good
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Who else couldn’t tell the difference and really had to zoom in?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Jesus!
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Uhhh which one is the video game?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Uhm which photo is the game?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"It doesn't feel 100% the same.  


But I can also blame weird graphical elements that remind me of Andromeda for some reason...  


...then it's perfect. Better than perfect? Maybe you can call it that way."
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Where's the cosplay?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Which one's the game?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,So which one is from the game?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,But did you eat it?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"Never having played the game, I honestly can't tell which is supposed to be from the game"
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"the only way i can tell the differencd is the shininess of their skin, the eyes, and the hair."
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Took me a second to figure out which was the game  lol
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"I honestly can't tell which is the game and which is the cosplay( I haven't read the comments). And I don't know if that's saying more about the graphics in the game, or the quality of the cosplay."
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"gj, thought the lower pic was a screenshot a first"
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,idk who is cosplaying who i think that kojima saw you someday and went MAKE A CHARCTER THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS (sorry for bad english)
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,K straight up I thought it was the same image at a different angle. Took me a bit too realise what I was looking at. Great work.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Wow you win at the game of Life
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,10/10
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,It wasn't until I read the title that I realized this wasn't just 2 ingame screenshots
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,She kinda looks like the woman in the last Bond movie.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,This is the same picture.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,first you are gorgeous. second where is the rest of the set
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Great job
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,That’s pretty damn accurate. You did a good job being thorough about this.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,IDK why but I thought this was a meme template
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,It took me a moment but I thought the top was you
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,This is awesome
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,RTX on.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"Nice try, Léa Seydoux. That's cheating because it's you."
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Confusion. Graphics too good. Cosplay too good.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Step 1: Be Lea Seydoux's doppelganger
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"""Are you gonna eat that?"""
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,"Didn't even notice it was a cosplay , nice work"
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,I thought these were both screenshots
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,That moment you really the puffy eyes are from the chiral allergies.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,Needs more umbilical cords.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,"Legitimately at first glance thought both of those were screenshots... Remarkably well done, nice job!"
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,"Hm, not that fragile."
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,It's very scary how you exactly resemble Fragile.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,Where do I buy the bug?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,"Ok so not ever playing death stranding, I always thought those things were tiny babies."
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,Holy shit! Spot on!
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,Wait what where is the real one I’m so confused
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,Never played Death Stranding so it took a triple-double-take to figure out which one was the cosplay. Wildly good.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,RTX: ON
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,It took me too long to realize the bottom picture is you
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,Are you just Lea Seydoux ? Isnt that cheating?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,How dare OP put two of the same photos next to each other and expect us to believe it's a cosplay? Unbelievable.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,Ur face looks good
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,Umm soooo... Which one is you?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,Why is she holding a bug?  I never played this game
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,"I haven't played the game so I had to zoom in on my phone to see which one was real, lol."
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,"How'd u get ur hairline to look like that, pretty legit is it a wig."
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,"I though that was just a mirrored picture, wow, good job!"
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,"You nailed the nose part, actually ALL of it! gj"
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,I can bearly tell the difference
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,This got meme potencial
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,Holy shit
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,"Holy shit, I didn't notice one was a cosplay until after I read the title and spent like 20 seconds trying to figure out which one it was."
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,One does not simply
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,amazing
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,I know I'm supposed to shoot the imposter but which one?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,did you do something to your nose to get the same exact look or do you just happen to have the same nose
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,Soooo....you did the motion capture for the game...true?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,"im only in for about 3 months in reddit and i know that this is bad because the first thing that came to my mind was to say ""now eat it""

&#x200B;

i hate myself"
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,wait I havent played the game which is the real one and which is the cosplay one
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,"Didn’t play it, can’t tell who’s real."
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,I swear I thought she took both pictures
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,Very impressive
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,So which one is the cosplay?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,"It's not cosplay if you are Lea Seydoux

&#x200B;

..welldone !"
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-10-06,I am so overwhelmed by this. Every strand of hair and detail in your face is that of the reference. I love you 🥺❤️
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"Are you Leah Sidoux?

Edit : not Léa Seydoux, her double..."
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"You look Fragile, but not that fragile."
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,is there a reference picture?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Finally a cosplayer who works with make-up instead of photoshop
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Wayyy too much photo editing
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,That's impressive
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"I saw the picture first, so I thought,

""*I dont get it, its just two pictures of the same person from different angles*""

 Then I read the title .......................

# DDDDDDAAAAAAMMMMNNNNN

I really like very accurate cosplay. Something about it is just so satisfying."
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"wait!!! that’s a real human? at first I thought it’s just the same picture with different perspective, and when I read the comments I realized it’s a cosplay!!!!

omfg well done, well done indeed!!!"
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,i cant tell the fucking difference wtf this is so cool
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,RTX off vs RTX on?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"Amazing, but how did you do the giant person holding you up?"
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Please tell me you've got her umbrella
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"I haven't played the game, does the character eat that little buggy fella? Cos it looks like you're about to eat that little buggy fella.

Also, should I play this game?"
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"I've been staring at this for over a minute, I can't tell which one is real."
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Give me my dick back!
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,no micro penis jokes?? really? isn't this reddit?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Chicken nugget
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,should have held a gummy bear
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,NAILED IT!
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,They're the same picture
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,WHICH ONE ARE YOU????
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,wait which one is you-
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,You don’t look real
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Dam! This looks so good
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,I'm 90% sure these are just two in game screen shots.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,It's a wig?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,This is incredible!
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,That's amazing. What did it taste like?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"Get that black magic shit outta here! /s  


(srsly tho, that's some fine make up skills!)"
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Damn. Which is you and which is the game?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"Beautiful work.  Could just barely tell the difference, and it still took me a minute of trying to figure out which one was the cosplay before I could do that."
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Which one is from the game????
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,What’s the bug made out of in the irl version?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,This is amazing
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Holy hell. Amazingly done!
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Great work on the nose shading!
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"Why must the lines between real and fake have to dramatically blur *that much*, to the point that I can't tell which one of these two images is real and which is fake?"
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,This is like one of those RTX Off then RTX On comparison memes. Really impressive cosplay
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"I can't tell the real one , you are too good"
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Are you Lea Seydoux?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"Excuse me, which one is the actual cosplay?"
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Corporate wants you to find the difference between the two pictures.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Which is which
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Wich one is you?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"I dont even know which is the game and which is you, so good job!"
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,C H O M P
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Looks amazing!
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Nom nom
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Holy shit you look like CGI that's amazing
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"Finally some death stranding cosplay, and it’s actually pretty good!"
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Which one is the cosplay? :D
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"Which one?

WHICH ONE?"
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Which one?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,spoiler: did she eat it?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"No sarcasm, which one is the cosplay"
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Must be Italian
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"Not having played the game, I legit can't tell which is which.

Very impressive."
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,I’m sitting here wondering which one is the cosplay since both look like a game render
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Damn 😳
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,With Nvidia RTX
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Took me a minute
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,She looks like Katheryn Winnick
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,That looks stunning! Awesome cosplay! <3
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"Holy shit. That's really good. I kept looking like ""wait where is she... Oh"". Can barely spot the difference."
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Which one is the human
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"I've never played the game so my first reaction was literally: ""why are there two pictures of this character looking at a shrimp?"". Only then I realised the second picture is actually a very well made cosplay. It's astonishingly good, nice job!

Also realised it's not a shrimp, idk what it is but it's still very well made. So props for that too."
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,I thought this was an actual video game for a hot minute
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Fragile? I literally thought for a second that the second picture was just the same as the first one but mirrored!
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,I genuinely thought you just posted two images from the game and I got so confused when I read the title
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,It's kind of cheating when you are her. /s
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,If you can get some “old skin” gloves to wear *under* the gloves that would be next level!
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Where can I get one of those lil worm things
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"Wow, I had to look at this a few times to see that one of them was Cosplay.  Nice job!"
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,That's pretty frickin' good
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"what did you do to the picture to make it seem like the game? that obviously isn't the original image, it looks smoothed or something"
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,This is good cosplay.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,She doesn't seem that fragile
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Which one are you?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Which one is the fake?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,This is 90% of the way to meme format.  Nice.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Which one is the cosplay?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,I saw this 2 posts above from r/cosplay
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Wait this was a cosplay? Thought it was the picture but flipped
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Uhm for real which one of them is you? Great job. Have a nice day
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"That's an amazing cosplay, really impressive!
I love Death Stranding, It's the only game that made me ugly cry."
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,The video game looks more life-like
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Great job. I wanted to ask if you only used make-up or did you also edit the pic to make it more cgi-like? Cause your pic looks like it'll fit right in within a game.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Wtf is she holding
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Wait you’re telling me the top one is you? They look identical!
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,I don't get it. What's so interesting about that Cheeto?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Both?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,What's happening here? I never played

inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Honestly thought it was just a different camera angle with a little bit of different lighting very nice!
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Eat it
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,The picture in the bottom looks like RTX 😂

Amazing work."
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Great cosplay
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Honestly I had to look and see which one was in game and which one was the cosplay. Amazing job!
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,I think I’m having a stroke trying to figure this out
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Wow
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"Having not played the game, I have no idea which one is you. Thats both amazing cosplay, and also amazing that the game looks like a person!"

inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"Hot damn thats a fine pic. Gloves gave it away for me. Top pic the gloves are like a texture, no bunching, and the seams are way smoother than they ought to be."
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Those are some good graphics.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Bruh I passed this thinking this was made in blender or something before reading

inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"So, I get the in-game rationale for eating those bugs, but what I never understood was why she has to eat them alive and how she absolutely savors every moment of it. You know that thing explodes in bug juice and guts with every bite and is writhing around in her mouth and down her throat as she swallows it. She's so nasty."
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Do you make the accent too? I thought it was beautiful.

inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Does this mean you bought the game and played it? I didn't know there were people who can afford DS in the world.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Who is who
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Amazing graphics
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,What Cosplay?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Which one is the game and which one is the cosplay? I’ve never played the game.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"You mean ""Norman Reedus and the Magic Feetus""? FTFY 👍 but also great fucking job. Hard to tell which is which!"
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,which one the cosplay?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,I legit thought the bottom photo was another in-game screenshot wtf this is crazy good
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"Wait, its a cosplay?"

Your cosplay is on point!"

inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,how is NSFW
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Honestly the only way I could tell the difference was the artificial lighting in the game(top) image. Really well done!
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Uhhhhh which one is the game?!?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,*nom*
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,This is fantastic 👌
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Lmao I thought they were both a picture of the cosplay at first.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"Okay now, which one is the game and which one is real?"
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,This is amazing
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"Is that the magic of contour makeup? Or do you just happen to have identical fanciful features? Daayyuumm!

inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,I thought for a fat second I was looking at a screenshot of the game! Excellent work 👏
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"I ALMOST COULDN'T TELL! I legit looked at both and wondered wait it's JUST screenshots from the game...

Then I saw the bug in her hand and was like WAIT A MINUTE---!"

inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Haven’t played this game — which one is you? I can’t tell the difference this is so damn good.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"Thought these were screenshots from the game and was about to downvote for low effort, that is incredible, damn nice job"
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"I didn't even realize it was a cosplay, weelll done spot on"
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,I need to finish this game. It’s just one of those games that seems like it would be so hard to get back into.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,I think I'm going to need more photos before I can decide if it's good cosplay...
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Blown away. I can't tell you apart.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"I haven't played the game, seriously, which one is the cosplay ?

I'd go with lower one because there's more folds in the cloths and the glove but that's my only clue"
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Where is the pic which is referencing the character?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,I love when cosplay captures more than the appearance of a character. Your reproduction of the lighting and especially the pathos really shines here. Great work!
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,you have a very nice nose
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Awesome cosplay. Fragile's story was so tragic! She didn't deserve what happened to her.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,[deleted]
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Do princess Beach next
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Which is which?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"Well done, couldn't tell the difference to be honest. I mean I can tell the top pic is from the game but still they look a lot alike that if they got swapped I would have had them still confused 😂."
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Got more pictures or a making off ? This is amazing !
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,I'm not gonna lie. I can't tell the difference.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Where is the cosplay? I see two pictures of Fragile smh
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,So uhhhh where’s the cosplay? All I see are renders...
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,lol
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,the top one is from the game. For those of you too stupid to pay attention to detail.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Did you sit in a tub up to your neck all day?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"Wow! Amazing! And you made Fragile even hotter, damn."
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,[removed]
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,I cant tell which is the cartoon but the top one looks off
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Which one is real?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,Fragile is the worst character though. Why would you cosplay as her?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,[removed]
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Absolutely god awful game tho.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,You made yourself CGI
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,You did a really good job replicating the uncanny valley look
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,"I don't think you look like Lea to be honest, but you do look exactly like Florence Pugh"
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,How did you manage to make yourself look CGI?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,What’s that thing she’s holding?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,*pull out baseball bat* we gonna see bout that

inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"yea having never played this game, I have no clue which is the cosplay"
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Check the hair. Hair is really hard to get right. Also the lightning looks a bit off on top.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,I think the hair gives it away. Games haven't yet mastered hair yet.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Corporate wants you to find the differences between these two pictures.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,You can tell by the pixilation in the hair on the bottom one that its the real life one.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,I got you. Bottom one is real.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Game=top real= bottom
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,I love these ones where it's 50/50
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,One of them isn’t?
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Same

i feel lied to"

inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"Really? The cosplayer's ear is deformed and the makeup is bad, especially around the hairline."
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"Thank you! The cgi part definitely wasn't planned, I believe the artificially darkened background did that"
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,I think it's the shitty quality of the photo actually
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,This cosplay is really strands ahead.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,She looks like a strand-type person.
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Thank you

Obviously, I love it, but I can't promise you will. Kojima games are pretty specific, so that depends on what you are looking for in a game."

The pores are still visible when you zoom in, but I believe people get the cgi feeling bc of the unnaturally dark background, which I unashamedly photoshoped."

inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"Thank you! I didn't strive to achieve the cgi look, tbh. I only tried to look similar. I apply quite a lot of makeup for cosplay in general and for this one in particular. The editing involved moving my hand, replacing a clay cryptobiote with a 3d one, color correcting in lightroom, darkening the background. Oh, and removing some ugly stray hairs I believe, haha."

inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,?? it's the same price as any other game
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"Of course, pre-ordered and played through. Its price is normal if you're playing via ps4."

>!As much as I loved the game, I was so upset about her ending. It was beautifully done, but it felt so unfair. I could not fully immerse into Lou's and Sam's happy ending because I kept thinking about how unfair it was towards her. We do get to hear she does deliveries again, but we never see that during the ending sequence.
Forgive my rant, haha!<

inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,Even the hair looks deceiving to me. It looks like she alters her pictures somehow to make them appear more rendered. There's just something about the images she releases that makes them look that way. Even in her face. I can't put my finger on it but I doubt it's just makeup and lighting. I recognized her work based on the fact that her photos look like they were taken in-engine.

This is a really great photo/“cosplay” too so it’s extra sad to see how reactive, demeaning, and judgmental you are. I’m not even criticizing you in the comment so please take a deep breath and try to move on because this is already taking too much effort to argue with you effectively and it’s not worth it.

inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,"No.  There's *extremely good* research in the area, but it hasn't found use in games yet because of the computational costs involved."
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-07,"To get realistic animations they already use motion capture (real actors with sensors). Then they clean the animations and they can apply recorded animations to any human 3D model they want. 
The problem is real human animations are often slow and have long follow throughs, also linking the end an animations to the beginning of the next can be tricky if you don't always make the animation go back to the same static spot. The inputs that gamers send can be real fast. I.e. left right left right very fast. So if you want to stick to super real animations, the controls will feel slow and delayed. So you have a balance decision to make between realistic and inputs that feel smooth to use as a game designer. And highly competitive games will always have kind of unreal inputs and animations to allow for very fast movements and reactions."
inmm8x,2020-09-06,2020-09-06,"No, they weren't. They were saying the lighting in the top one, which is from the game, is off, therefore you can tell that it's CGI. There was seriously no joke."

The process is slow and mysterious humanoid beings in the sky (angels? riders of apocalypse?) are causing all females of all mammalian species to die.

This process causes male ""mothers"" intense psychological stress as it is beyond the evolutionary systems of the male brain--particularly for men who undergo this process multiple times over.

The handcuffs feel like how Kojima felt working for Konami. His baby (Metal Gear) was taken away from him but the umbilical cord also seems like hes saying that he was pretty attached to the series as well. Or it could represent PT/Silent Hills as he created something new and it was taken away from him. I dunno, maybe the five dudes floating in the air are supposed to be Metal Gear 1-5 and how he is walking away from it. 

Or, and this is probably the reasonable explanation, its just typical batshit Kojima crazy. 

Either way, Im pretty hyped about this "

4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Maybe some kind of purgatory setting. I really liked the imagery of the five stationary beings in the sky. Hopefully it's not just a shitty linear third person survival game with a naked man character.
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"We need a theory/speculation thread.

Notes: -Oil substance appears after contact.
-Norman is wearing a handcuff
-Necklace seems to contain modern looking talismans. 
-Baby has mechanical Umbillical Chord.
-Norman's chord may have been surgically removed.
-Chords also visible on everything but the smaller fish. Mammal related?
-White Sperm Whale may allude to Moby Dick, a common theme in Kojima's work.
-Hand prints may indicate the dead take an interest in the living. 
-I think the talismans on his necklace contain remnants of people who died.
-I think the oil indicated organisms are being used as fuel, probably for the floating beings.
-I think the ocean is being used to store the species with the chords."

Edit: which makes since with the lose of the baby motiff the two have in common. Correct me if im wrong, but wasn't the basis for the silent hill games reconciliation of terriable actions done by the main characters? Maybe norman forced his wife to have an abortion and he is given the scars as penance?

4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I'll be honest with you. I didn't understand much of anything.

4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Third impact when?!?! 
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I'm guessing this will not reflect what we see in the final game. Aside from Norman's character model. Kojima said in an interview that they're still deciding what engine to use.

Edit - Why am I getting downvotes for this? Kojima Productions has only been in existence for a few months. They don't have a game engine. How on earth would they have a trailer that reflects an actual game at this stage? It's more likely that this trailer only relates to the new game on a thematic or symbolic level.

Edit 2 - Oops apparently Kojima stated this was in-engine. I'm still going to remain skeptical that this is what the final game will look like because 1. It's so early and 2. Kojima has fooled me several times."

4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Is this a game? I saw no indication as to even what kind of game that would be. I didn't watch E3 so perhaps I'm just out of the loop.
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I feel like I know less about what this game is now that I've seen the trailer instead of just the name and thumbnail.

4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Calling it right now. It's a Kojima tech-pocalypse from outerspace

Every mammal on Earth is (or in Norman's case, was) attached to a power cable. The beings we see floating, are harnessing the thermal energy generated by the life on this planet. Probably the energy generated by the planet itself as well.

Norman, somehow, breaks free of his tether to these presumably alien/mechanical beings. Not only does he sever his connection, he escapes his captors and on his way out also recovers some potentially valuable information which is stored on those 6 USB's around his neck. (Theory on the info, below)

Determined to blow the lid off the whole thing you take off in search of someone you can show it to.... but there is no one. Everything is dead. Everything is gone. All that remains is the facility you came from.

The game will end with you going back to the facility, willingly, to be plugged back in because there's nothing left in this world.
The aliens/machines will bleed this planet dry.


Oh and those USB's? Each one contains information from the aliens excursions to other planets.  
Specifically; Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and Earth.  
After the aliens are done on Earth they'll go to Venus, and Mercury. Assuming they're harvesting the thermal energy of planet as well and not just that of it's mammalian life, then the final stop on this journey would be the Sun.

The aliens/machines will destroy everything we know in order to sustain themselves, and there is nothing that can be done to stop them."

4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Welcome to the unchained mind of Kojima. Full of naked men and dead fish.
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Oh, Norman Reedus!
And look! He has a Norman Feetus!"
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Sony treated Kojima like the rockstar he is at this keynote. This game will hopefully be the fruit of a very powerful and mutually beneficial union.
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,meh
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Needs more crossbow.
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,So I'm almost certain that this video is only meant to generate hype for the fact that Kojima is actually doing something and Norman Reedus is in it. It's not like we can really pull much away from this trailer other than the fact that it might be a massive metaphor.
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,So no PT after all huh 
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Kojima: LOOK GUYS, NO SONY!! I CAN BE WEIRD AGAIN!!! I NEED SCISSORS, REMEMBER GUYS???"

couldn't be more excited"
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,i think reddit is a little too obsessed with Kojima.
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I'm a big fan of Kojima's work but why put an actor in it? I dislike this trend of modelling characters after real life people. It pulls me out of the game because I recognize the face from a ton of different roles irl. That being said I am still excited for this game despite not knowing what it is about.
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,we dealing with some lovecraft type shit here?
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Be prepared to wait 10 years and be completely underwhelmed.
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,it is coming to PC right ?
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"So much damn hype for something that literally gives us nothing and for something that isn't even coming any time soon. In terms of teasing and seduction this is a fucking burka.
              
Looking at this without a Kojima dildo up my arse I can say it leaves me a little curious but hesitant. Ignoring the fact this won't be seeing the shelves for so long that the very thing may change or even never be made; this trailer has me wondering what is happening and what the story will be but I'm too concerned with what kind of gameplay it will be to find myself more than just curious. There's really no point starting a hype train when not only are the tracks not laid but the damn train isn't more than some wheels and a floor. "
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Can Kojima just make a movie already....﻿
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Looks Lovecraftian to me.
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,utter nonsense 
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Where's the game? If Kojima wanted to make a movie, then do it. I want to see how the game will look like, the gameplay, etc.
"
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I wonder if there's going to be any metaphors or weird imagery in this game.
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I don't get it. What's the point of this trailer? I have no idea what this game is about?
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Is this the game where you play as a lifeguard seeking revenge for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill?
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Wild speculation : the cuffs are definitely future-tech and the umbilical cord looks like a fibre optic cable definitely not tissue/organic. 

He's trippin' balls and the baby turns to black goo and he see's some floatin shit that disappears. Both the baby and the floating people/things disappear. 

Maybe he's in space prison/jail/confinement and he's having hallucinations or a real bad nightmare? I have a feeling that the big robot mascot is the main character or his armor or something because the pic where we see the eyes...they look a lot like Norman's eyes.

If it's not a dream or w/e then we are in for a Mr. Kojima's Wild Ride. "
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I guess we know who died on the Walking Dead with all the new crap Norman Reedus has dived into.

Its intriguing I guess but tells me absolutely nothing about it what so ever. No story info, no game info, no real coherent event going on. As some one who really isnt familiar with his work I really have no reason to be excited after seeing whatever ""that"" was. Hell I dont even know what the game will look like, he did an interview with some guy after Conan and they said they hadnt even decided on a game engine yet.. this isnt even a game yet, its more like a very elaborate piece of concept art.

He was left there and has the ability to reproduce asexually like a sea horse but his offspring aren't immortal to prevent a race of immortal beings.

He still has a regular human brain, so he can't comprehend vast amounts of time. When his child is born he cuts it out of his stomach (sea horses have their children explode out of their stomachs) and has done so multiple times which is why his scar is enormous and still visible. Hes crying with the baby because in the blink of an eye his son/daughter will disappear since hes been there for hundreds of centuries and time all blends together.

And that the umbilical cord represents the connection we have to the earth and how when the oil spills seep into the oceans they seep into the babies/animals much like how a mother and baby transfer nutrients via umbilical cord.

4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I really just can't get into the random shit Kojima places in his games.

It feels more like he's trying to make modern art statements than create a game. For example a fire whale in the latest metal gear.

The moment I saw that stupid whale I just noped out because I couldn't get why the fuck it even exists."
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Honestly, I just don't get the attraction a lot of people have with Kojima's games... and that may sound like a criticism, but allow me to expand upon that.

They are the modern art of video games. I hate modern art. I think pragmatically, and I enjoy grounded video games. I like conventional beauty in my art, and conventional, grounded story-telling in my video games (without the repetition of old troupes). Like a beautiful oil-painting to a charcoal, as opposed to a pile of used tampons in a gallery.

And that is what I like about not liking Kojima's games. They push the boundary and the tradition. The challenge the base rationality and mechanics of games and go completely off-the-rails with the implied and symbolic. 

I may not like it myself, but I love what it means for video games. It shows that video games are, and should be treated, as a true form of art and expression. Something which is hugely subjective. It is a beautiful thing to not like something, because it shows that the space that that something can fit within has expanded to allow for that subjectivity."

"
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"So this is probably going to be a total nonsense but I will share it anyways: disclaimer I am not hard core Kojima fan but I follow Jim Sterling. So this is him - Kojima and after many fights and destroyed ideas/dreams (dead crabs) he is coming with new hope but he is on a tight leash (handcuffs) and as there is this new project of his that is so dear to him (baby) is odd, corrupted and weird (cable in baby). Even this project for which he had a lot of hopes is taken away and becoming only a shadow of what it is meant to be (hand prints). On top of it some sort of blame is put on him (black hands). He is aware this can't go on now and become serious about it without emotions (change in face expression) as they have take something that was part of him (strange cross like wound on his stomach) and possibly turning all that in his crusade (cross like shape of the wound). He look at these 5 anonymous figures in the sky. They are not angels, they are just people on high places (probably new establishment that took everything from him) and lots of ravaged Kojima's deeds (dead whales and other creatures). He is probably fighting them (he came on stage with line ""I am back!"").
Maybe that or something is in the air that makes me high AF. Thoughts?﻿"
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"From youtube: 
>This is a one BIG allegory to Kojima (Norman), being thrown out of Konami (5 sky figures), where he was previously imprisoned (handcuffs). He was sad to lose his baby...the MGS series (notice the baby has a cord attached). He's dirty hands represent hard work and despite him losing his beloved child some part of it is still with him and guides him (tiny hand prints appearing on the sand).

>It gives him courage to stand up, he has a scar, maybe he also had a ""cord"" but now he's free. I don't know about his necklace tho...6 stones...on the wiki there are 6 main games fully produced by him (not counting GZ and extra editions)﻿"

4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I think the ""stranding"" in Death Stranding is probably referring to these black cables in the trailer, like a physical 'strand' connecting the attached to idk, death of some sort? The baby is attached by a 'strand' then dissappears, leaving only an oily substance. If you look closely some of the sea animals are also attached by 'strands,' that follow into the ocean. Finally, the font in the title sequence at the end of the trailer makes heavy use of black 'strands' again, this time coming down from the letters and connecting them towards the ground/ocean. I think in this sense, ""stranding"" does not mean becoming stuck or isolated, but rather, becoming connected.

4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"My take on it is... those 5 beings in the sky are not of that world. They are there to consume every life on the planet. The ""spirit"" crawling in the beginning crawl towards Norman, but he has no belly button so he's a one of a kind which cannot be consumed by them. You then see the hands crawl to the baby. It is consumed instead and turns to black, the baby is gone and the ""spirit"" crawls back towards the beings in the sky. Norman is there to kill them allllllll.

Maybe ""Death"" is ""stranded"" there and needs energy in those beings to return. Or perhaps their home is a waste land, everything is close to dead and they must do this to restore their home.

It was a great trailer. I have no goddamn idea what it's about, but I'm really fucking interested.

If only they hadn't done these two things -- and again, I'm not saying that it just isn't me -- then I would be even more interested.

4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Darryl!
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Anyone else think this looked like Daryl Nixon from the walking dead? 
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Hell yeah
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Looks like s game about the bp oil spill 
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Why did Darrel dissolve that baby?
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I wonder if this has anything to do with the largest stranding that happened last year, kinda scary that i found this out from a game trailer."
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?!
https://youtu.be/Hi4z0S8jfbU"
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Maybe it's a game about being in limbo? No idea, guess we will have to wait and see with this one."
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Finally, can people stop bitching and moaning about PT now?"
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Kojima: ""It's '*not*' Silent Hills"" ;-)"
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,6 chains on his neck. 5 ships? Crosses? Plus him...
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,As
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,so we don't grt silent hills... but still get a weird supernatural game featuring Daryl Dixon? I'm not sure I enjoy this decision
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,So he spawns in the fishing hamlet and is promtly killed by a huge sharklooking monstrosity that wields an anchor as a weapon
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,That's a lot of fish.
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"whats this game all about? i already watched the trailer. xd
"
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"This looks really fascinating. Reminds me of the creepy-pasta ""My Brother died when I was a child. He kept talking."" of a gray bleak landscape with a gray ocean in the afterlife."
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Apparently your a Nam vet abortion doctor
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,This is gonna get weird. I love it!
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,wtf sony! why you always so creepy at e3!?
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,What does it mean????????
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"This is how the afterlife will start. 
-typo"
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"My friend literally ignored me tonight when I told him I thought the trailer was too ambiguous, even for Kojima. He is still pissed off."
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Is that Daryl Dixon?
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,To be released in 2020.
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Perhaps the C-section scar and the baby represent that something he created or something that is a part of him was stolen. He may be on a quest to find what he brought to life or something that is apart of him, in a world of death? "
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,It's good to see Billy Ray Cyrus back at it after the whole Miley thing.
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,That's Daryl 
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"So... Norman Reedus has a c-section on the beach, wakes up, cradles his baby, but doesn't notice it running away to hide in a pile of dead fish? Sounds good, I'm looking forward to playing it."
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I'm not nearly high enough for this right now.
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"teal'c kratos, and now daryl is a jaffa... what is going on?"
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I'm...very confused. 


Very NGE feeling."
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Black sand and ice...
Set in Iceland?"
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Am I the only one who when they first saw the thumbnail picture for this trailer thought they were making a new walking dead video game with the proper cast members in it? Idk,  I kind of did,  and was kind of hoping for it too.  This still looks ok considering we know nothing still. "
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Dope
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"So I'm guessing that this is essentially the spiritual brother to the now dead Silent Hills, yeah?"
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,S T R A N D I N G
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Hahaha we all need a little more memes in our lives. 
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I want to know the story behind this soooooo bad. I guess I have to save up for a PS4 :(
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Don't tell this is going to be a PS4 excusive
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Prepare for a 2018 release.. I'm so interested I need more information!!
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Reminds me of Lovecraft's shortstory ""Dagon"". The inky black ground with dead sea life all around matches it fairly well."
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Norman Reedus has enough time mocap a video game, that tells me that Daryl is dead... God dammit"
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Six tags, five figures. ""Missing"" figure could be Reedus or the baby. Baby makes more sense, as it disappears & it's imprints lead towards the five.

Death Stranding possibly hinting at Stranding/Beaching of marine life? It can happen en masse (esp with pilot whales) and is essentially mass suicide where the animals beach themselves with no way to get back in the water. Nobody really knows WHY this happens. 

Also, tags on necklace have equations on them in promo art. They slightly resemble USB drives, but that's conjecture. 

Those are my notes so far. I've posted it on my various social media platforms to try and organize my thoughts. Hopefully it can get other people thinking too. "
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,This looks like it's going to be some real mindfuckery.
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,is valve at e3?
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Is that the guy from walking dead?
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"""I'm working with Norman Reedus, god damn it!""- Hideo Kojima."
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Can someone explain this to me?
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,So happy they got Norman back!
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"*And I'll keep coming*

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Was it just me, or did those waves at the end look really bad?
Seemed to glitch a lot.

Other than that, really cool trailer. Very movie like."
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I can't wait til every video game has Daryl in it
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Well, no one can ever say that wasn't a thing we saw just now.  "
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"So all views on this video came from Reddit. Good job, front page of the interwebs!"
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I'd like to believe that Kojima enters every room led by a single ray of light.
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"So the handcuffs were glowing blue on the inside, and Norman had no belly button yet the fetus had an umbilical chord... I guess the answer is Kojima"
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"One thing that I'm not seeing a lot of people discussing are all of the hand prints on Norman's body as well as in the sand. Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't people use to or even still do put ink on the palms and soles of babies hands and feet and then put that on paper for certification reasons? Either that or for the family to look back on as the baby grows older? I'm not 100% sure about that and I definitely have no idea what significance that symbol carries in the trailer.

Super excited for this game though. I have no idea what it is about or even what kind of game it will play as, but that's sort of awesome. There are so many teaser trailers that even though no gameplay is revealed, you know what you are getting into. This trailer has none of that. It could be a horror game (most likely possibility and the one I'm most excited for), a shooter, a survival game, or even a point and click adventure game. Who knows? It just looks so cool and that's what I think Hideo Kojima does so well. He makes shit look so cool."
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,He's got no belly button! Definitely not a regular human
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,[removed]
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,That art style oh baby
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,So instead of buying the silent hills IP... He bought Norman Reedus!
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,How the fuck has no one posted Norman's crying face from Walking Dead?
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Not Snake

(Norman Reedus)"
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Since when the fuck did Daryl from the walking dead become a father?
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"What if the baby is reed us himself? The umbilical cord actually looked like some kind of data cord to me. That could possibly explain all of the usb sticks around his neck, and explain his anguish over the baby's plight as it lays there. Perhaps the baby turning to tar and leaving its prints behind on reed is is allegory for his past mistakes and the invisible scars left behind as he looks out upon the consequences of his actions. Dunno, just something I came up with reading others comments and watching the trailer a couple times."
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I don't even. Looks like Daryl is having a bad trip.
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"""Dad was such a drag..."""
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"As a long time Hideo Kojima fan, WTF did I just watch?"
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,This particular upload is missing the beginning of the trailer...
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"*Sins of the past...*     
*Lead towards the lands of damnation*

Basically what I think what this game is gonna be about. But its Kojima so its gonna be insane and I'm gonna love it! "
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,With all the shit about copyright infringement how can a random dude just download a video and re-upload it it his account without any problems
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,[deleted]
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Ok i'll admit , the trailer was hype , not action packed hype , but hyped in the mystery & other departments , i think it'll be great to find out how the game plays out when its launched rather than watching more footage about it , might spoil the first time experience."
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,That final shot looked like a Noah Bradley painting
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Is that Daryl?
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,There's no way they're going to be able to explain everything that just went down in this video in the game. That was an insane experience in itself.
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"So...it's...a...game, then?  

I mean, it's Hideo Kojima so it'll be trippy, ridiculous, have several disappointing sequels, more dialogue than the collected works of Plato and Shakespeare combined, and it will sell like hotcakes...but this is a *trailer for a video-game*, isn't it?  

This is making Suda 51's shit look downright normal and sane."
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I see, too ,same eyes"
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,What is this game? Do we know what it is about and what type of game it is. Trailer doesn't really give much away...
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Shut up and take my money already Kojima. 
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,That reedus is so hott right now
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Is that Daryl from the walking dead?
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Wut?
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,What is a Stranding?
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Can't imagine Daryl pregnant﻿
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Any info on what the games actually about? 

Survival horror? 

*IS IT NAKED REEDUS MINECRAFT MOD? *"
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Boondock Saints has certainly aged differently than expected
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I can't believe I had to scroll down this far. The OP's version is shit-tier quality.
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"so this is Silent Hills left overs, stitched back together?

yeah！！！"
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,That looks like a pretty fucked up game.. can't wait
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I have no idea what this game is or what it's about, but I saw the 5 people looking thing in the sky and - who dat.."
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"It annoys me to no end when they post ONLY cinematics. Please, just 4 seconds of gameplay. Right now it could be a platform scroller for all we know...."
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Time to wait for 8 years again.
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,So.... Does anybody know what this game is going to be about?
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,[Fucka Yeww Dolpheeennnnn!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGepBtBCuTY)

4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Well that's the weirdest game trailer I've seen in a while.. Dafuq bruh 
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,[Not sure if confused or interested.](http://i.imgur.com/iuXL5Hg.gif?1)
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,If this isn't going to be on PC then I'm definitely getting a PS4 if this game turns out ot be amazing. Also I want to play the new Gran Turismo.
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,What the fuck was that?
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,*Did you bring some fish?*
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"A bit late to the party, but this reminded me of some sort of [weird french frangrance tv advert](http://vmashup.com/7pTSfRmM)."
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"2 questions 
1. what is the release date
2. what consoles is this for"
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Was that supposed to be like the story Dagon?
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I guess we'll never get the next Z.O.E. we were promised.
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14," can someone explain what the games about? or dosnt anyone know ? im sure its going to be amazing because its kojima, but it looks pretty weird, why does norman reedus have a fetus coming out of him"
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Wake up Daryl. 
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,meh.
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,If this becomes a game like Ark then NOPE
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,gg ps4
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Death in sky, baby is should be life, but is death because black cord. Baby fate handcuff stranded to man, cause contrast because man alive but baby death. Sea animals become also death, but not death like baby because not handcuff to man. Man has death strand removed hence scar."
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Guess Low Roar will get a lot of new views from having their music used in this trailer. They are not that big are they?
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,'I can't believe I had to scroll down this far. The OP's version is shit-tier quality.'

4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Robots. Oily robots.
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Looks really interesting, but the title is kinda clunky. "
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"So...

When we will see a mgsV complete edition with Ground Zero + The Phantom Pain?"
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Did the invisible fetus baby just handstand walk away?
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"This trailer is some weird shit, weirded me out while watching it on E3. And why is Norman's stomach cut with the fetus right there? As if HE was the one pregnant with it and then someone cut it out of him? I need to know more about this game."
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,anxiously waiting to see the complete game.It will be great fun 
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Ahhh not sure what to think ... 
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Nice cgi
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I wonder what he's smoking. No matter what though.. Kojima-San is awesome ! Notice me senpai ! Notice mee !!
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Did anyone noticed flying objects that disappear in the end of trailer?
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,ridiculous. Kojima said in an interview before and after they havent even picked an engine yet. this game is 4 years off. Another agent or last guardian by sony.
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"[OMG, THIS GUY WAS RIGHT!](https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/4mu015/kojima_productions_mascot_unveiled_even_further/d3yczq4?context=3)"
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Yes, I will probably look in to getting a PS4 if this really is an exclusive. Well played Sony, and thank heavens Kojima escaped from Konami. 

Still a bit bummed about the state of MGSV, but I'm looking forward to whatever he comes up with as long as the next game from him is fully developed the way he invisions. "
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Holy useless trailer, batman! Watched it and have no idea what it is about."
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Autopsy scars.   He ded.
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"There's some kind of black umbilical cords and I guess that's gonna be a major plot point (related to what causes the death of the animals and the baby to disappear maybe?) and also, the protagonist does have a weird scar and no belly button, so that's that."
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"gahhh damn it, back when they put out that image of the astronaut skull dude, I thought the eyes looked like norman reedus but didn't comment or anything. I coulda been a psychic or something."
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Wouldn't Death *Standing have made more sense? Stranding is a strandge choice.
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Yo, someone combine the lines from the words. Come on Kojima, let there be a hidden message."
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Yeah but the question  we are all wondering, what's this game about?"
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Er, did Norman Reedus get a cross section done for an invisible baby?"
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Watching this on acid was a mistake
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,it saddens me to know that there won't be a death stranding pachinko machine. I love those.
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Yawn
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,darrel is taking meth again...
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Who is that? Daryl?
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,What's the game about? /r/trailerisunrelated ... 
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Walking dead guy ruins it for me. Metal Gears are cool and all but this is asking too much of m. Kojima finally gone off da deep in end.
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"First Flexicution now this, Oh man im getting hyped again"
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"I have no damn idea what's going on in this trailer.  Kojima is a mysterious man, and I can't wait to see what he has planned.

Norman Reedus is a plus."
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,DARYLL?
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Jesus I can't even imagine what Reedus was thinking when Kojima told him what to do.
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Little disappointed it's PS4 exclusive. Looks like I'm going to buy a used one.

It feels like you're in prehistoric times for the whole game running from fucked up shit with everything dying around you.  Birds falling from the sky,  fish etc etc.  Then at the end of the game we find out that it is a view of the future. Norman reedus plays Adam,  like adam and eve.  He needs to (remove his rib) to save humanity.  The baby footsteps are his destiny which leads his way.  Just a guess.  Maybe.

4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"All of this sounds good except the religion part. The 5 figures are just floating with their arms down, there's no correlation to crucifixion."
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,Another thing to point out is that the baby wasn't really a baby when they got washed ashore. You can see the handprints and the obvious handcuff indicating that it was either a man or woman before he/she went Benjamin button. If that baby is a female then maybe it would suggest another religious allegory (Adam and Eve).
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,I took his cross scars as in he had a c-section... Which I found interesting.  Not sure how the religious affiliation came to be from that extremely vague trailer.

 Some virus decimated humanity and the survivors used genetic engineering etc. to allow men to become pregnant too.


The animals are symbolic of all the people who died, the characters baby got taken away from him and the five figures are the five people responsible for that.

4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,It's a metaphorical journey of a man who lost his stillborn child and slowly coming to term with it.
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Reedus is man; or moreover, kojima's ideas of the 'intended man'. He always speaks from this place in his games; FOXHOUND and their intentions for the Philosophers' Legacy, 'the terrible children' and the duality between Solid Snake and Liquid Snake, the 'redundancy inherent' of telling the same story again with a much older snake in MGS4, etc. 

The handcuff is the breaking of ties from convention / expectation. the child is the future of man. once freed from his chains, man realizes the importance of legacy and lineage, how keeping a world intact for their children is vital to humanity, and he seems to be extremely remorseful and apologetic.

But its too late. The oil has been spilt. The wildlife, dead. The seas, poisoned. Trees, decimated. The oil is on his hands.

the toxic handprints in the sand are the true legacy of humanity. man has awoken from his chains to a future that may not have anything left to nurture him with.

at the end of the trailer, man stares off into the distance, upon those who may be responsible for fucking his shit up so badly.

&nbsp;

After all the amazing work Kojima has created, he's *now* claiming that **he's just getting started?!** This thing is gonna be fucking amazing, and anyone with half a heart and half a mind who plays it is gonna have their heads blown off."
4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Norman represents God/Earth, there baby is man kind. The hand prints filling with oil and all over his body represent humans leaving their mark on the earth and making it bleed it's oil like blood. The whales have umbilical cords connecting them to the oil saturated water like how the baby was connected to Norman. The children of the earth are dying because of man kind who has moved on. The hand cuff represents that the Earth has been freed from the grip of a futuristic humanity who is ascending away from the earth possibly to space but not after leaving it hurt and dying."

If we are thinking with symbolism, Adam is a the first man, and therefore he shouldnt have a bellybutton (?). A bellybytton indicates he came from somewhere and isn't the first man."

4nz69b,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Expanding on this, he's one of the four horsemen. Before the events of the game, he killed the other 3 because their vision for the world was not appropriate to him. And as punishment, his power was unleashed without control. The dead baby symbolizes the death of his race. Now, he has to deal with the consequences.

Kojima is a god level troll in gaming as well, dont forget that.

Kojima makes confusing-ass games and also lies out of his ass during interviews (remember him saying something about the MGS5 trailers being PS3 quality or some bullshit like that?).

For instance 98% of all animal matter on earth is: Humans and the animals we farm/eat. The remaining 2% is everything else. Birds, fish, wild animals etc. etc.

Not to mention there's a lot of bad, really bad climate change stuff on the horizon. This summer might be the first ""blue ocean event"", where the north pole simply won't be cold enough to hold any ice what-so-ever, meaning it'll be a black void that absorbs solar radiation instead of reflecting it, making earth even hotter (in the long run of course).

I'd like to see something like having to create your own next spawn.

1. Kojima’s “worst” games (MGS4,MGSV) are still regarded as some of the best games in their respective generations. Story? Yeah not his best, but still a hell of a lot more creative and entertaining than most games even try to be.

2. Every game he’s put out has had some of the best gameplay you can ask for. It’s fleshed out, simple but can be mastered to become something greater. Fun, engaging and above all else, innovative. 

3. This is Kojima at his creative peak. He has full creative control over this. Could he be overly ambitious? Sure, but at the end of the day he clearly has a message and drive to this game that I’ve yet to see from another dev. That is enough to excite me and back the game.

I think people need to just go into this with an open mind and low expectations. What i mean by that is don’t assume it’ll be like any other game out there, and take the time to learn what it wants you to learn."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,I love that somebody like Kojima exists in this industry. Somebody who just has batshit ideas and the games have fantastic attention to detail and somebody is still willing to give his crazy ass a blank check.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"It's extremely curious that Sam is called Bridges, that the organization is Bridge, and that the baby is a bridge to the other side. Something tells me that Sam is the baby (perhaps he's a clone), and that essentially the discovering of the ""bridge"" tech was the foundation of everything. So like, Mads' character discovers the secret, but something dark leaks out, transforms him, and causes near extinction, and Sam (a grown up clone), taps into this tech to try and save the world. I could be completely bonkers, but another reason I think this is because death doesn't seem to be the end for Sam, like there's some sort of revival mechanic built into the narrative (kind of like Bioshock)."

bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"My take from the trailer:

The US (and likely everywhere else on the globe) has had some kind of catastrophe involving the ghosty guys. It's also re-animated the dead.

This completely fragmented society where all humans now live in small, isolated communities where the ghosts and the nazi zombies aren't. 

Your job is to bring packages (possibly radio/communications equipment?) between those communities to re-establish communications. You'll do it while evading raiders and the ghosty guys and the nazi zombies.

My assumption is that there will be some kind of mass goal that all players will work towards over time, and that you can achieve more when you've...connected with other players."

bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"So it could be a Multiplayer game, making Strands with other players 

So now you can be very confused with a random person"
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,Hear that konami? Connections with others are important
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"Nope, still confused and memorized at the same time."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,So what you're saying is that I have to use the power of my strand
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,Now I understand why Daryl’s carrying around a fetus
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,Oh right I totally get it now..
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,I need to make me a Norman Foetus cosplay bubble thing.

bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,So pretty much like Kingdom Hearts 1 where you're going around connecting/closing worlds?
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,bless kojima
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"So, Fallout:New Vegas"
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,Looking forward to the Twin Peaks if video games.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,So... how does that explanation having a baby in a pod with the umbilical cord or some shit on it
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,[deleted]
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,Am I gonna need ps+ for this?
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,Still don't get it. Will wait for reviews before I buy this one for sure.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,I may need to get this game
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,So it’s a Persona game yeah?
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,I may not understand exactly what went on in the trailer but I love unique ideas and innovation. I honestly can't wait for this game.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"I swear, every time I hear or see something about this game, I feel like I understand it less..."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"I can't figure out what the hell it's about, but how fucking contrived is that name? It's a game about building bridges and his name just happens to be Sam Porter Bridges? As in porter, a person who carries things? Fucking hell."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"[Ah, so it's like that, huh.](https://imgur.com/a/5qEUv2I)"
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,This doesn’t sound that fun in my opinion.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,The trailer was really good. I know this takes place in  a dystopian future. But I am concerned the game is going to be extremely empty and lifeless. Either way the story looks intriguing.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,How does king crimson work?
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"Sounds like the core of the Balance arc in The Adventure Zone, with a theme or two mixed around. Bonds/bridges, etc.

Griffin needs to write a video game."

bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,So angry Konami kicked him off and cancelled Silent Hills

bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,Can't wait to form communications with people shouting the word fuck down the mic constantly
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,This statement is so kojima I love it
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,I've been excited for years but now I'm somewhat cautious because I'm starting to get stronger Online-Only vibes. Pls no.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"....he built a game that makes you sit there for hours, when in another unit next door someone is doing the same thing but because iof social anxiety and the levels in japan.....i just cant"
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,So it's a dating sim
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"Interviewer: And they have babies inside them because....

Kojima: >:("
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,If it's good then Kojima probably made a better Metal Gear Survive than Metal Gear Survive
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,Dragon Warrior VII?
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,Sounds like the typical esoteric explanation given for the latest woke Hollywood movie.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"Same theme he's been hammering home since MGS2:

""God, get out of the house and talk to someone, you fucking nerds."""

bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,i smell always online.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,Starting to sound like something from the final fantasy the spirit within movie
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,How high is Kojima?
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"
Ooih that sounds super cool"
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,That explains nothing
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"Thanks! That explained nothing!

For real though I'm excited"
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,As a misanthrope.. why? :/
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,I love kojima and I love his games but sometimes he just seems like that kid at a party who gets way too high and starts spewing bullshit
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,sooooo is there a single player campaign? haha
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"""Through your  experience playing the game, I hope you'll come.."""
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,I love how people are lapping this shit up and so keen for it despite NOTHING EVER BEING SHOWN OF THE GAME!
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"And of course you're going to be playing this game all alone, so no."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,Kojima: I built a game where you're the internet repairman.

Why can't they give him a name that's just a name? Shit, name him Norman Reedus. Nah it's gotta be symbolic bruhhhh.

For the record, Kojima is bae. This isn't a jab at him."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,It's a whole new kind of game... if you don't count the Heaven and Earth trilogy released on the SNES over two and a half decades ago.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,I understand
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,You only have to see one or two Studio Ghibli movies or movies directed by Kurasawa to get an intimation of how very different and indeed alien to western observers Japanese fictional conventions can be.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,My first character will be a colossus titan. Knock knock motherfuckers. 😐
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"This is awesome, and needed"
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,So it's gritty open world persona?
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,This explains nothing.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,Kojima has lost all connection with reality.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,Trailer link pls
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,Ya but why are men giving birth to crazy fetuses and shit
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,Is the main character dummy thicc?
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"In this day and age, is it wrong for me to snicker at the title ""Homo-demons""?"
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,I'm a little glad this had no connection to pt... That was terrifying
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,Can’t wait to play this game and question everything I know about life.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"I like Kojima, but I hate multiplayer. So can I make connections with NPCs instead?"
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"This will be one of those things like trying to explain the matrix, or inception, or memento and will either be loved or go over a lot of heads I think.

It looks like a gobbledy goop of every scifi genre out there. Not necessarily a bad thing, but could easily be hard to digest at first. I'm  intrigued, but I want to see more gameplay first."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,That’s kind of beautiful..
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"I remember hearing/reading something about it being a live world with topography that literally changes based on how other players act, like there'll be a crater left where someone else died. Has there been any more mention of that?"
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,You beautiful bastard.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,T_T Kojima you beautiful man.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"It’s like MGS and NMSky, I’m really looking forward to this game/story/movie/art."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,Ironically it's an EXCLUSIVE game
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,...forging connections with others whilst looking cool as shit.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,Well I don't think Kojima would do something like pure action expendables with that lot Hollywood actors. About the story I'm sure there will be a great understanding when we play the game in the meantime.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"Oh yah *pfft* I toooootally get it

**Starts to sweat profusely**

*I dont get it....*"
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"Still not get it, but im going buy it"
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,He probably doesn't know what it'll be himself.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,Kojima-San never dissapoints us!
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"He knows that makes no sense, right?!"
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,I'm still confused.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,What he's trying to say is: Death Stranding is Pokemon Go.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,Is this the game with that fetus that becomes an adult?
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"I thought 'Stranding' meant 'stranded' - and it kind of does, but it also refers to the 'strands' forged between the stranded."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,I love his concepts
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"*Death standing credits*

WHAT THE FUCK WERE THE TANK BABIES ABOUT!??

AHHH!"
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,No place to Hideo
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,I still don't understand
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,What a way of explaining everything and literally nothing to everyone that still can’t get past the test tube babies thing
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"So it's like Attack on Titan and Walking Dead put together except there's no Titans or walkers, people are just really antisocial and you're a delivery guy."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"Pretentious as always. Never change, Kojima-sama!"
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,The Postman
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,So its gonna be online? Like GTA online/fallout 76?
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,This is peak Kojima.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"Just a reminder to everyone: Kojima has something of a history of intentionally obfuscating key plot points in pre-release material, so it's probably safe to say that anything we see or hear (even from the man himself) is either missing critical context or straight-up lying to us."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,TLDR: Yes.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"Don't worry, even Kojima doesn't know what Kojima means."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,Journey: Hideo Kojima edition.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,so does this mean itll be online only or youll be forced to play with other players? i hope not
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,didnt he call the baddies PTs in the trailer? is this supposed to be a nod to the unfinished PT game? i mean its made by the same people and it has norman reedus.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,'im so hyped for this game but for the life of me I have no fucking idea why I am lol
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"I get so many vibes from this game. It's got the IRL actor model and some themes from Beyond: Two Souls, but it also makes me think Kojima made his version of a  Final Fantasy game because some of the stuff reminds me of Magitech from FFXV. This game is going to be fucking amazing. I hope we see some tech demos before too long, maybe at E3."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"So it's like railroad tycoon, but with people as the towns? Neat."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,So Yes
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"Death Stranding's plot will be the answer to Metal Gear Solid's questions. In many ways it seems like this setting reflects a world where an entity like the Patriots or ~~illuminati~~ are able to succeed in their plans of perpetual war and absolute control.

That's what I liked about Kojima in those days. He really brought to light some of the most mature and intellectual questions into what you can call ""popular culture"" since it's a video-game...whereas usually these philosophical ponderings are reserved for rather esoteric literature-analyses and historical studying.

In a way that's how his style has grown to be. Taking a game, which is usually just fun entertainment, and transforming it into something much more than that. Social commentary, political insight, enlightenment commentary, economics lessons, etc."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,NANI! Strando!
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"So you have a bunch of is a bunch of isolated communities. There are a bunch of levels set in various wars (WWI, WWII, and some kind of modernish War). War is what human division eventually leads to. You got these scary floating people who seem to be those who lost their lives in one form of violent conflict or another. Maybe they represent the lasting scars that violence leaves behind. There also seems to be some kind of thing about letting go of the past and coming together. For all the jokes about not knowing what the hell is happening, this might be one of the more thematically understandable and clearly relevant Kojima outings."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-11-13,"No matter how many pretty words you throw at this game, if you switch out all the weird stuff you lug around with pizza you have yourself an over glorified pizza delivery game that has you falling over every 10 minutes to pick up pizza boxes what is the point in this game, the amount of extremely unnecessary mechanics is unreal, wtf is the point in the bb’s are they even necessary remove that whole weird as hell story element and the game would play out exactly the same.   I get the strand gameplay mechanics but it neither adds to the game or takes away .  Overall you have a beautiful open word in which you spend hours WALKING and falling over trying to unite the post apocalyptic world through be a delivery boy no tips though."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"You have to play this game like it’s a movie, you have to connect to the characters. In fact I really have started to only play games where I feel this connection, but I don’t know why."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,I really do not want to create connections with other players around the globe. My interest in this game is over.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,Is this the dude from the walking dead?
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"It's funny because ""Porter"" means ""carrying"" in French, and there's a french actress playing in."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,Ill glad this clears everything up :)
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,Yes.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"Wow, ‘Your Name’ sure went dark haha. The strand thing"
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"""Anyway, here's Wonderwall""

\- Hideo Kojima"
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"That’s a really fancy way of saying “convoluted”. 

But I’m still gonna check out the game."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"unpopular opinion.

no way this game lives up to hype."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,Is he saying it's an online multiplayer game?
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"Beyng cryptical about information about a game is always bad. The trailer was selling DS as a ""kojima game"" and to me, that was bullshit.

As gamers we don't need to have every single detail of the game spoiled to know what we face, but at least we should know the concept, the idea behind it. We don't need to know that it's a MMOARARPG sanbox wathever, just the concept, without snobbing people as ""modern gamers that aren't happy until they know everything immediately"". And now i like the concept of the game and i am intrested."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,too bad i'll never play it since it's only on ps4...
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,Isn't it a bit ironic that the game itself is *isolated* from other gaming platforms due to its PS4 exclusivity *walling* them off
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,Im a big metal gear fan but honestly this all sounds a little too pretentious for my taste.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,Honestly as long as I get to run Norman Reedus through a tunnel naked dodging russian guards the game will be a success.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,I don’t get why people say they don’t know anything. They’re explaining it.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,Thats really cool.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,what a legend
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"builds connection with other players. 

*kid whispers in mic: 'i fucked ur mom'"
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"Lmao what? Dude, how is that a ""new action game""? You are just uniting factions? Doesn't almost every game have that?

oh the theme is ...connection? wtf are you talking about? I would maybe be on board if he had done any good work since Snake Eater."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,It's about fucking time we got some quality games
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,Hmmm I guess they are gonna try multiplayer stuff like they did with FOB bases in MGSV? I cannot say it was super enjoyable tbh when I played them. Hopefully this one is gonna turn out better but then again I do not have a PS4 and am not planning on getting one.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-31,"Even if this game flops, I'm glad to see someone doing something different."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,Wants to connect players by releasing exclusive for the PS4. O_o
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"The best part of the trailer is that after the collapse of the USA presumably caused by creepy oil ghosts, the literal ghosts of the USA's garbage wars come back to haunt them.  That combined with the centrist 'coming together' platitude makes me think  the political commentary in this will be fairly heavy handed.  Hopefully it will be wacky and over the top enough story wise that that doesn't bring it down"
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,It's gonna be shitty
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,Seems like Persona with extra steps.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"Man, I'd love a MGS 3 / MGS 2 story development arch. Getting a new MGS 5 would be disappointing ."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"Wow. Looks visually stunning, and tonally shattered. I'm not even gonna bother trying to guess the plot. The open world looks fun to explore. I just hope it isn't barren. I'm trying to imagine a casual player making heads or tails of any of what we've seen in the trailer."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,Looks like a dirty Benedict Cumberpatch.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,Kind of ironic that it's a playstation exclusive LMAO
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,Anyone else tired of games trying to be super deep?
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,It concerns me that we still don’t know what it is. Feels like no man’s sky all over
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,So he’s making Speaker For The Dead into a game?
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,It's pretty bad when you have to write down what the game is about because the trailer makes no sense. And it's even worse when what you wrote doesn't make sense either.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,I personally assume this will be a mixture of Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within and Journey.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,trailer where?
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"Let's connect everyone. Unless you're playing on xbox then ""F.U."" pretty much is what he is saying."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,Nice thought...Except it's a console exclusive so it has essentially built it's own walls.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"Forging connections with other people has only ever caused me problems. I have exactly one person who isn't a part of the family I was born into that I care about and I'm happier than I ever was having friends.

Hopefully the game isn't too preachy about that aspect but it seems like it probably will be."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"It's honestly getting to the point where I feel like it doesn't matter how good this game is, because Kojima's pretentious babbling is going to drive my interest into the ground well before it comes out."

It looks like a mediocre game with celebrities to raise the profile of it."

bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"Oh, so it's game that forces me to interact with other players... yea, no thanks - sounds annoying and pretentious. 

I hope I'm wrong, because I was all sold for this game, and the gameplay and concept looks amazing, but I have Zero interest in playing with other gamers. I come to open world games like BotW and Skyrim for isolation and escapism. Introducing the fact that I have to work with strangers doesn't interest me in the least bit. I have to do that all day. No fun."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,At this point Kojima could shit in a box and you people would sit there debating the hidden meanings. He's basically disappeared up his own arsehole and asked if you guys wouldn't mind following the stench to come with him.

bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,It's like me and [Twin Peaks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjDa-_Vq51I).
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"Here’s my interpretation of the trailer:

There was a Grey Goo attack (or something similar) a long time ago, this thing has a hive mind and can bring people back to do its bidding, people have become isolated in their attempts to reject assimilation, you are tasked with connecting these isolated people while avoiding oblivion. It’s sorta like End of Evangelion, but Instrumentality is out to get the stragglers. An allegory for isolation as defense against conformity, but the game attempts to connect those that are isolated, literally"
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"Its the sentiment behind the Souls series multiplayer, if I were to hazard a guess."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,That is why his games are so good because repeated playthroughs always feel like something new as you slowly grasp a little bit more of the lore and various situations that happen.

bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"So, basically the music in kojima edited trailers."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,Kojima is weirdly in tune with some great Western music. The trailer from that last big Phantom Pain trailer was at the time a brand new song from Garbage that happens to be better than anything they ever put out in their heyday IMO. It still gets stuck in my head regularly. It subverts my expectations of a guy you never see speaking English. The lyrics are so on point and end up getting theorized about in relation to the games despite the fact we should really be asking ourselves how a foreign person could be so good at English wordplay.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,There’s a character named Die Hardman. Sam Porter Bridges is the one of the more subtle names in the game lol.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,Welcome to Kojima.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,Carrie Porter Bridges would have been even better
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"For more on-the-nose-ness that anyone might like to know, “Porter” is close to “Porta” the Latin word for gateway! So it’s Sam Gates Bridges. I wonder if he has anything to do with connecting people through walls? (/s on that last part)"

bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,Or it's very mediocre and nobody will talk about it a few months after release like with so many hyped games before
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,I don't believe so. I think it will probably another mixed bag like MGSV.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"I've never owned a Playstation (and I'm old enough to have bought a PS1 for myself), but this might be the game that makes me get one. As a playstation noob, what should I know? Are there value versions? What's with the slim or pro ones? Do they make the game run better? Haaaalp"
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,Kojima has a massive fan base especially in Japan. Its gonna be a well written journey. people who look for shallow games will hate it as they have no intention in understanding the story.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"Even if it somehow ends up garbage, it'll still be a cool ride and they've made tons of money. Preorders are sold out.

bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"It's coming to PC on a later time so, don't know about that"
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"Here's what we know for certain:

* Norman Reedus drives a futuristic motorcycle sometimes.  
* Aluminum ladders feature in this game, as do climbing ropes.  
* Those backpacks are big.  
* Mads Mikkelsen wants babies to be able to go to the moon.  
* The president of jack shit is very ill.  
* Don't fall into the black goo.  
* Vietnam zombie commandos are fire proof.

I think this really clears things up!"
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"players have fetch/deliver missions, to connect places. Think of dark souls, if your main mission was to go from bonfire A to bonfire B, or C to D. There's probably some heavy character development / single player stuff along the way. Other players are also trying to complete it (in their own universe I guess) and maybe you can see them in your world (like the multiplayer aspect of dark souls too).

Oh and drop an unhealthy dose of LSD on top of it, and in a sci fi dystopia."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"What we know is that it's apparently a supernatural MMO videogame re-imagining of David Brin's novel the postman.

Yes, this is the same novel that was later adapted into that awful Kevin Costner movie."

bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"Bridges, Jerry."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,From what they talk about in the trailer it sounds like Norman reedus’ character is charged with connecting isolated cities with cable that presumably will allow instant communication. They believe this will reunite the untied states after what seems like a war that destroyed the country. Norman’s character seems to blame our way of communicating as the downfall such as internet and our ability to share things instantaneously with the world.  So seems like the theme of the game is about staying connected to those that matter in your life but avoiding the shitposts of those that don’t. But who really knows.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,Only thing all the replies have told me is that Kojima got high sniffing his own farts again and fanboys are going to lap up his fever dreams and proclaim it the best game ever.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"Yep, with Tom Petty pre-order DLC"
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,We play as a local postman rivaling other more superpowered big delivery company postmen. And if we die we spend a day in first-person-view Baby Hell.

bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,Fuck that's a great movie. That and Waterworld are my top two favorite Kevin Costner movies.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,Is MGS4 really considered one of his worst games??Because that's my favorite of the series by far.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"It's actually really good marketing.  Take a look at all the people who hyped up their plans to deliver the moon and failed to follow through (for instance, No Man's Sky).

Kojima manages to keep the hype up without promising anything."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"Wait, people consider MGSV to be one of his ""worse"" games?  I know people hate how the story falls apart by the end but it still has the best gameplay in the series."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,I thought MGS4 was a masterpiece...
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"> This is Kojima at his creative peak. ***He has full creative control over  this***. Could he be overly ambitious? Sure, but at the end of the day he  clearly has a message and drive to this game that I’ve yet to see from  another dev. That is enough to excite me and back the game. 

This right here its my biggest fear. You know why MGS games are great? Because he had to work with restrains, he had someone that grounded his ideas and made them work.

&#x200B;

Its kinda la David Lynch with his early work on Twin Peaks and the Netflix era."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,MGSV is the pinnacle of military stealth games. If the all the missions were as tight as GZ with respect to level design and story it would've been legendary

bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"You forgot “the story probably won’t make any sense without a ton of external reading/ an LSD drip”. 

Kojima has made some phenomenal games, but he loves telling insanely dense, intentionally opaque stories."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"I think people are worry about a George Lucas effect with too much creative freedom.

Although games and movies are two very different mediums, people also claim Konami is to blame for speeding production, so I think Kojima has the benefit of the doubt here, but it’s also true having no oversight can be very bad."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,Amen
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"MGS2 was by all accounts the last game where Kojima had almost complete creative control on the back of MGS1's success and people were disappointed by it because they didn't like what they got (ie playing as Raiden over Snake). In saying that after recently having the chance to finish of MGS2 again the game holds up - the story about mass information and data control is eerily relevant and written with a contemporary tone, not to say the games structure and writing are without flaws although its hard to see it coming together any other way. When he gets his vision it is something that is unique and in my opinion makes the argument for video games being considered art."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,">MGS4 and MGSV are wost games

I guess, they are like Star Wars prequels/sequels of MGS franchise. Some fans like them, some don't."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,MGS 4 is one of the worst Kojima games? You must be joking right?

bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"MSGV Konami fault not Kojima. This game won’t please younger generations but mature gamers will love it. Not a slight, this game will just take patience and time to understand and get things going vs jump right in and shoot things."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,You cannot tell me the man who wrote MGS2 and MGS3 isn’t good at stories. I really struggle with that sentiment. Or do you mean MGS4 and 5s stories specifically?
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,I wonder what Yoko Taro would look like with Kojima’s resources.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,He's like a video game auteur
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,Having played a few metal gear games that plot is way too simple for Kojima.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"> I think this is because death doesn't seem to be the end for Sam, like there's some sort of revival mechanic built into the narrative (kind of like Bioshock).

I think this theory is corroborated in the gameplay when we see him go to the ww1-esque battlefield. People theorize this place is called ""Hades"" and instead of ""dying"" in the overworld you are sent to Hades were there either be a stealth or survival segment that you have to do to get back to the real world."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"The theory I have seen thrown around based on what we have seen so far is that the ghosts seem to age stuff around them very fast, so the baby is a clone of yourself and somehow when the ghosts get you, your memories are implanted in the clone and it ages into an adult you, and possibly that sets off some sort of bomb (the giant craters seen in some images or teasers). But someone else mentioned having to get out of Hades which also could be it. But then wtf are the babies for"
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,This is Kojima off his meds. Have a little faith.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"It's literally the description of the game Infamous which coincidentally is another Playstation exclusive game.

You connect power as you progress to different cities who are, you guessed it, isolated and you have to fight tar covered enemies. The tar in Infamous however is a mind-controlling agent used by someone else who you have to kill, but doesn't quite free them after her death."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,Lol Kojima is miles ahead of Bugthesda
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"I always hate it when game devs tout their own game as ""a new kind of..."" Like, I didn't ask for a new genre. Just make a good game, and stop trying to reinvent the wheel."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"It's funny you say that because after watching the latest trailer I immediately thought about the Matrix. When it came out, it contained a lot of sci-fi concepts that were confusing at the time, but that we now take for granted. I expect Death Stranding may do the same."

bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"Okay... But it’s also reinforcing the theme is it not? By forcing players to traverse barren landscapes alone, it’s going to make players feel extremely isolated and yearning for connection. We also don’t know the full scope of the online yet."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"The Konami thing was a blessing in disguise. He hasn’t wanted to make a Metal Gear game since 1998, he just couldn’t bear to let anyone else make one. So him being fired is kinda like him being torn away from an abusive relationship, as he’d have made MGS games until he retired, and I’d much rather have something new like Death Stranding anyway.

If we were going with your metaphor, I’d say Silent Hills was the kid that Konami got custody of, and the second they got it they drowned it in a bathtub."

Kojima is a perfectionist at heart and I know he appreciated the critical acclaim MGS5 received but was hurt by how a lot of people said the game felt unfinished. Death Stranding is his first fulfilled (sorry P.T.) original vision since Zone of the Enders. He’s going all out"

It is by far the best turn around from any game I know of.

Fans complain that movie trailers show the whole plot. Kojima shows a trailer that shows 9 minutes of amazing footage and people want to complain it explains nothing. That’s part of his fun. He has consistently put out amazing games so he gets leeway on things like this"

bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"Kojima has a better track record and that's what's earned him the deep pockets to do projects like this. I love Yoko Taro and he is equally crazy in a very different (but also good) way, but while his stories have always been intriguing the gameplay in his games wasn't always up to par. I trust Yoko when paired with the right studio like with what he did with Platinum. I'd be fine leaving Kojima in a dark studio with a box of money just to see what he makes of it.

I'd love to see what they could cook up together, but I almost think you would have too much ~~artistic genius~~ insanity."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"On a side note, I'm trying to figure out a detail from the trailer:

At the very end, Mads is holding a book. The title is something like ""The ____ and the Young,"" and I'm trying to figure out that missing word but it's blurry as heck. It could be something made up for the game but the known words are so generic it's difficult to search. And tinfoil hat speculation, on the spine there are yellow and white rectangles that form something resembling the Vatican flag.

My first thought is ""this area is stronger because players built it out"" and ""this area is better because neighbor area is better"" so you're building bridges around the world. And then could even have world events that weaken areas and force players to move around. The whole thing is ""single player,"" but every so often your progress gets sent out and added to a total somewhere. That could be late game content after a narrative in my mind."

bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"One story aspect of the Dark Souls games is that time is “convoluted, with heroes centuries old phasing in and out.” Direct quote from a character in the game. 

When you play Dark Souls online you will constantly see ghosts that are actually real players in their own game. You cannot interact with these ghosts, they’re just there for you to see. On top of that you can also see the blood stains of other players who have died in their own games. Interacting with these stains shows their last moments and can alert you to hazards around you. People can place summon signs on the ground, which allows others to summon them to their own game to help them with a certain area or boss which would otherwise be very difficult by yourself. Summoning others into your world usually involves using a consumable item (humanity, effigy, ember). These are relatively rare. If you feel you need to summon someone but don’t have the materials to do so you can put your own summon sign down to be summoned to someone else’s game world. If you successfully help them defeat a boss, you get one consumable item which will let you summon into your own game world. It’s a kind of “help, then be helped” system. You can also be invaded by players, as well as invade others on your own accord. There are also many covenants, which add a whole new layer. 

How will Death Stranding utilize online? I dunno. It’s Kojima. He’s been doing this since the 80’s. I trust him to do something smart."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"I think it's a cultural thing.  MGS4 felt like I was watching an episode of DBZ with the drawn out drama and re/over explaining everything. 

The rest of MG has some of it, too, but they were balanced with good gameplay.  The very first time you play is just walking Snake a few feet before the next cutscene.

Actually, I think MGS4 might hold some sort of record for cutscenes."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"In the same way I will blindly watch any film of my favourite directors, or read any book by my favourite authors, I will play any game by my favourite game makers. Doesn't mean I'll unwaveringly love them all, but they have earned my attention based on what I have consumed previously."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"Finished the game, watched the BTS videos, read the lore book, then tracked down Hideo Kojima himself and had a three hour conversation about the meaning and motivation behind the game.

I'm now farther away from getting it than ever."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"Barely. The longest stretch between games was Peace Walker to Phantom Pain, which was 5.5 years to be fair, but they created the FOX engine in that time. The idea that Kojima takes forever on games is massively overblown."

bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,Journey! Amazing piece of art
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,It is there. It is just that it flows so easily between the cutscenes and the gameplay that it can be quite hard to spot when it does just by watching.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,Yeah it was completely botched thanks to Konami. The first half of that game is spectacular.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"Not even just that an act is missing, act 2 is a ton of recycled ""missions"" with a few ""new"" parts sprinkled in.

The fact that they're missions at all is hilarious, given it just took Peacewalker's formula, and translated it to consoles... but from PSP to PS4, which doesn't really make sense."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"Take it this way, if MGS V didn't happen... the only thing we'd be confused on, in MGS lore, is how BB supposedly dies in MG1 (For NES) and comes back later in MG2 lol.

Nothing in the game mattered, outside of V."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"Well, I mean, that's one of the earliest parts of the story :P

Unless you mean the series died at MGS3, which is fairly popular opinion in the MGS community."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,Totally agree. That Sahelanthropis sequence was so badass.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"I didn’t mind because of how fun the gameplay was, but that’s easily a fault on Konami’s end. A rushed element you’d NEVER see in a Kojima title otherwise."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,Pretty sure you didn't even have to replay any missions. You had the option of doing 2 story missions or like 6 side missions to pass time before getting the call for the final mission.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"I did finish it, but I HATE resource management. That whole aspect of Mother Base made me almost not finish the game. I just did the bare minimum and finished it. Didn't much care for the story...I think I only got REALLY excited after understanding what Quiet was all about. The whole Venom Snake is not actually Naked Snake shit was weak imo."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"To be clear, Peacewalker introduced a vast majority of those game design elements, and that was on *PSP*.

Mission based gameplay, item/weapon crafting, motherbase (although not in 3d, understandably, for psp), Fulton balloons."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"Yes let’s narrow down the one example i pointed out.

Go on twitter and look at any gaming outlets post about the trailer and see the skeptics. Hell on this sub most posts about death stranding you’d find people bashing the game despite having no information on it."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,Wow. The Kojima/COD fanboys are out in force today. Isn't it a school day?
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"that actually sounds really interesting... you feel the rest of the playerbase interacting with the game, without them really being in your gameplay... if death stranding does something similar im sure it will be great"
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,There's an amazing show you should watch called Game of Thrones

bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"Chronologically the story ended at MGS2 for me, and MGS3 wrapped up some stuff from the past. 

I don't want to say it died, but it just got a bit silly."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,Yeah and for that reason I can't blame Kojima or his team because we did not get the exact game Kojima wanted.
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"I can't say I've replayed it since the first time, but fairly sure eventually you have to complete really awful side challenges to get the game to advance forward, mostly in Act 2 I believe."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,Nope you’re wrong I just see memes
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"I’m not even sure what I said that upset people, I was just joking that they are reusing the title on their new game."

bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"Man, I want a new Souls game so bad.


I don't care if it had any lore, or dialogue at all whatsoever, even though I love those aspects of the Souls series...I just really need another Souls experience. I need that sense of exploration and danger again.

The way that map was designed and you found connections was so satisfying to me.  Maybe my favorite world design ever from a gameplay perspective.  And ya, the lake was a really cool thing to find.  That was probably when I started getting really sucked into that game."

bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"So, you're okay with supporting bad game development, as long it says Kojima on the box. Cool."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"I played demon’s and loved it as well.  Maybe I was just worn out with it after those two, but I couldn’t get that into the second dark souls and just never really got back to it.  In all fairness, I probably had hundreds of hours into dark souls."
bugjak,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"Sorry, I thought this discussion was about gameplay. Kojima's games tend to have excellent and deep gameplay, so this one not having that would certainly be an outlier, but if it randomly happens to be purely a movie-game, that is alright, because his stories have always been hugely entertaining to me."
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"Jesus Christ the cast is outrageous. 2 *film directors* acting in a Kojima game (Del Toro and Winding Refn), 2 massive stars (Reedus and Mikklesen), probably the most recognizable voice actor in the industry right now (Troy Baker).  Bananas. 

I'm cautiously optimistic. I've always loved Kojima's games, but now that he's doing something 100% new it feels exciting and kinda risky to be playing it this close to the chest."

buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"That was insane, I also think the line of dialogue at the end was chosen deliberately.

I know Spacey did CoD, but between this and Berenthal in the new Ghost Recon it seems like games are the new movies. Also Spacey wasn't the main playable character in the game so this is def a cool shift.

Shit, look at how popular Rockstar made voice actors via GTA and RD2.

The babies in capsules attached to the surviving humans looks like they provide life source to them while trying to pass through those areas. Mads Mikklesens team of commandos appear to be from the ""other side"" and I think have the jump on the BTs but also hunting down the humans who are trying to reach new land for survival.

And yes that is probably wrong and nonsensical too."

buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"Am I the only one who's not a fan of Kojima? Convoluted hard to follow stories does not make them good or you smart (if you understand them) Metal Gear 5 should never have been in an open world, and further more they should focus on gameplay instead of trying to make a weird story. Splinter Cell was always the best stealth game."

Being able to put ladders in places that isn't just 'hold A to clamber barricade' seems like a really cool thing, make players think before they fight or try to avoid enemies instead of having one defined path"

buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"For all this time I've had no end of questions regarding this game, this trailer finally provides... answers?  

And by that I mean 'answers' with a question mark on the end, what the hell is this? I'm in."
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,God I need this game in my life now! Honestly I don’t want to see anything else I like how mysterious these trailers have been. I have full trust in Kojima!
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,Every second watching makes me more confused.
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29, Im fairly sure I will finish the game and still somehow wonder what it was about
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,This brings such warmth to my pants.
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,Yes please
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,Can't wait for the on realese quality drop!
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"This is how I understand it if somebody could correct me:

Kojima made an amazing series out of MGS. Eventually, the studio wanted to turn it into a micro-transaction-fest similar to EA. Kojima was kicking up a fuss about it so they fired him and eventually released the newest MGS game which was downvoted into the dirt.
Now Kojima was free to go make his own studio and create the game of his dreams.

Is that about right?"
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,I'm trowing money at the screen and nothing happens =(
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,I'm buying a ps4 just to play this
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,I've been excited about this game since I heard about it last year. this trailer give me some much to look forward to! Still not sure that I understand what the game is yet though.
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,I seem to be in the minority but for me this looks bad. Nothing from this trailer excites me
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,That was an incredible trailer. So much talent.
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,[deleted]
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,I still have no clue as to what the game is about after watching a full trailer.
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,What the fuck
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"Nothing makes sense, yet I must have this game.."
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"The music is awesome.

It's nice to be excited about something original for once."
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,So what’s it about
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"Still confused, but I'm pretty psyched."
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,Post(apocalyptic)man Pat
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"I have a feeling I will play this whole game, and still have no idea what it's about.... and that's perfectly fine."
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,All aboard for the adventures of Norman Reedus and the Funky Fetus!
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"I feel like even after playing the game, we still wont know what the wtf it is about. lol"
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,Can we get an F in the chat for the Xbox players?
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,The soundtrack already has shivers up and down my spine
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,What did I just watch?
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"Woah, man. What the hell did we all just watch?"
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,i watched this live
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"Did... Did this trailer start with a shot right up a vagina? If so, that's fine. I just want to know..."
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,So glad Kojima is doing his own thing with his own studio. This looks wild and amazing.
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"I understood absolutely nothing bout the game, but I am also somehow hyped. Only a Kojima trailer can do that to you."
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,I really thought this might get pushed back for PS5
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,Dayum this game is so beautiful I might just get a PS4Pro for it
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,At 2:58 or so when he's sneaking and the people see him....does anyone else think that sound is a liiiiiiitle bit like the MGS noise when someone sees you?
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,what if I don't want to save a baby
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"If nothing else, this soundtrack is awesome!"

buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,wtf did I just watch
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"Pre-ordered, looks absolutely amazing."
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,Oh good! He’s got a backpack loaded up with things and knickknacks too. Anything that he might need it’s got inside for you.
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"It's dangerous to go alone! Take this baby. 

Graphics looks great, love seeing an animated  Guillermo del Toro."
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"This looks like the the titanfall 2 time travel feature, mixed with metal gear solid and final fantasy the spirits within. With social and political commentary sprinkled on."
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"How is it even with active gameplay reveal and a release date, I somehow know less about this game than I did before?"
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,I didn't realize this game was gonna have Mega Man style bosses.
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,Are there time travel aspects to this? I was getting time travel vibes last year but now I’m completely lost.
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,What the fuck is this game about
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,this game looks fantastic I can't wait to play this.

buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"The line “you can go anywhere, even the moon” might be a hint back at the very first trailer they did for this new studio."
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,I hope this game has levels with actual designs and not just endless anonymous wilderness and outposts like MGS5
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,What?
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"I’m born amazed and confused, I’m not sure which one surpasses the other. Regardless, Kojima has my money!"

buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,I have no idea what's going on and I know from experience to never assume we know anything for it can all be a ruse. All I know is I have the 8th and 11th booked off from work and my weekend free of anything
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,This is the weirdest trailer I think I've ever watched for a video game and I don't think I'll play it but I'm totally intrigued.
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"when the trailer showed kojima's credit for creating the game, writing, directing, etc. i wanted another credit page to pop up that just read ""eat a dick konami""."

buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,The best part of this trailer for me was reading “A Hideo Kojima Game”. Welcome back!
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,It’s been 10 years since I’ve listened to apocalyptica. Holy shit what a throwback.
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,Day one baby! What a ride this game’s gonna be.
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"I was wrong about this game it looks more action oriented than I thought,like the cast too and I really hope this game is good considering it's pretty much taking the place of Silent Hills."

buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"Just overall a very weird looking game. Like, just like with the last trailers there is nothing here that screams it will be either good or bad. The baby things seems like a bit of a style clash. 

Also kind of wondering why they gave us all the actors when only 3 of them are really well known at all."

buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"Hey I think I understand the ""plot"" a little bit.  

The game seem to be warning us about the risk of isolation in our current time and age. I've watch the trailer one time only, but some quotes seem to go that way.  

-You want to cover the whole world in cable, it didn't work in the past, why would it work now? (women voice)  

-It's hard to make friend when you can't shake hand. (Mad Mikkelsen)  

There's also a bunch of reference to connection. I got a feeling that one of the main plot element is going to be about those risks. It's a good call back to Metal gear 3 AI warning us about the current the internet giving us too much information to filter.  

The fetus seeing the ""real world"" could be a take on them not yet being corrupted by the world. OFC there's a lot of other thing in the plot about the past, but that's something else."
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"Looking at the small parts of gameplay presented in the trailer, it seems to me that it will feel very similar to what the phantom pain was like, at least gameplay-wise. The way the character moved, the way the combat was presented and the sneaking and crawling over the grass, it all reminded me of phantom pain. Not sure if this is good or bad. 

One of the things that bothered me the most about the phantom pain was The Big Empty map, for example, I hope that doesn't come back in this new game."

buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,Seems like a super interesting story.  What little see we saw of gameplay looks straight ass though.  It’s Kojima so I have complete faith that the gameplay won’t be bad in the end.
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,What the actual fuck did I just watch?
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"I've always been a fan of Kojima, but mostly the stealth-heavy story-dense MGS games rather than Kojima himself. I was left incredibly disappointed by MGS5 (gameplay was great but I never really cared as much about gameplay as I did story).

I've never really liked his work outside of maybe Snatcher and the Zone of the Enders games. But I fail to see the appeal of this game, at least they  showed some gameplay outside of walking, so that's good, I guess..."

When i was a kid you can only knew tiny bit from what an upcoming game would have been, you had to go and buy some games magazines to only knew the release, and in the meantime before the release of the game you and your friends tried and argue on how the game would be, no shitty gameplay and story trailer that spoils everything in the game, just a name and some hint on what a kind of game can be. So much respect and love for these people!"

buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"I think this game will have elements of time travel which is why the rain will age things. The war scenes with the phantasmal soldiers still entrenched in war. Like that old trailer with Del Toro. 

The soldiers towards the end are more modernized spec-op soldiers and Mads Mik has one of those ""others"" as a friend that lit his cigarette, so i'm wondering if some of our travel will also see go forward in time rather than just backwards.  

I don't think the ""others"" are aliens as much as they are dimensional travelers phasing in and out of our reality."
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"The only question marks I’ve ever had were about gameplay. And this trailer put those to bed.

Kojima never liked the trope of video games being about going around and killing things. That’s why he made stealth games. Where you were encouraged to not kill things. There was little doubt Death Stranding would follow suit. So that makes you wonder, what will the gameplay be like then?

And we got a taste. A little bit of modern and adult themed Luigi’s mansion. A little breath of the wild. A little Metal Gear. Interactive and dynamic open world. I was skeptical of the gameplay before, but I’m not now. Looks stellar. 

And the story is gonna be batshit insane and incredibly thought provoking. Kojima took the blandest premise humanly possible, a “a special agent fighting terrorists” and turned it into metal gear. Imagine what he’s gonna do with no creative restrictions.

This is going to be a masterpiece of gaming.  Could end up being the best game ever made. Guess I have to buy a PlayStation before November 9th now. Thanks a lot Kojima, I don’t have the money for that"

The only issue i always have with him is that he spends way too much time on one aspect of the game (visuals,emotion) and less on actual gameplay mechanics. I recently tried to play some of his newer titles Metal Gear and that weird Survive game and they just feel so clunky and over done. I had to skip so many cut scenes to get to experience the gameplay only to be let down with its mechanics and overly engineered ideals. Hope this one is a bit more MGS 2-ish in terms of simplicity and fun factor."

\-This... this was a mess. I didn't understand half of what happened. The other half was incoherent rambling with technobabble. The graphics were amazing, the game ran smoothly but what was ALL about? The things that happened don't make enough sense, the gameplay combines many things into others and it does work, but seems like I was trying to do something current consoles can't do yet. It's confusing and exciting at the same time, although I think I got more confused about what this whole experience was. Probably way more than before I played it.

buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"My guess is someone is trying to blur the boundaries between life and death. Trying to connect the world of the living and the world of the dead. The ""void outs"" are the dead leaking into the world of the living. Probably the ""terrorist"" guys are behind it. People continually talk about ""the other side"" which to me suggest some kind of afterlife. Also there's skeleton soldiers.

The ""bridge babies"" are on the boundary between life and death or something so they can be used as a link to the other side. That's why they use them to see the ""VTs"".

Maybe Death Stranding is a phrase for being stranded in the world of the dead. Which is to say normal death. You die but you're stranded and can't come back to the world of the living. Maybe someone is trying to change that and it's destroying the world."

When you die in the real world you keep playing in the alternate world where you have to escape to your ""real"" world again. In the real world there's also a hostile terrorist group which is an off-spring of the apparent apocalypse.

This game is bound to make headlines everywhere, and coming from Hideo Kojima, with tons of money and time to produce, it's likely to be a very good game to play. Thus, it will be a very successful game that will send the message to corporate folks in big name developing studios that hiring actors is the new way to sell games, not supporting dedicated creative minds. Because that's just never the message, right? 

If future games start to spend huge budgets in hiring actors rather than developing solid games, we will have a lot of crap to sort through when looking for new games. It's bad enough as it is, but it can definitely get worse."

buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"Part of the theme of the game is connection, so there will probably be a really heavy online component to this, just like MGSV."

buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"Man, these ""EA said SP games are dead"" memes are so cringy now. They didn't say that. They said that games are going to need some kind of online component. And guess what? Death Stranding has an online component.

Also isn't EA publishing that new SP Star Wars game later this year? So relax. You've won."

buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"the player will be trying to connect the various outskirts of surviving humans. The company seems to be called Bridges, and Kojima's little recap called the main character sam porter bridges. So Mads M's character could have created the concept of using the babies as bridges to other realms of humanity. Something about people who aren't letting go? It seems to be maybe some kind of purgatory, and the BTs maybe feed on the humans who havent let go? 

Idk, it looks insane. I don't have a PS4, but honestly I'd just watch someone play this through for the story alone"

buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"I think working with DelToro on this project probably shaped the story telling. I think it will be a much tighter, yet still bonkers story."
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"I love Kojima's talent, and dedication to keeping gaming evolving, but I do find a lot of his concepts pretty abstract, and a little pretentious."
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"Yeah, the first MGS is great, I lost interest in MGS2 about three hours in and never bothered with any of the others until revengance because there aren't enough of those style games in the world, its still weird as shit but its a lot of fun.

buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"No, it has been confirmed to stand for  ""Beached Things, "" probably a reference to how during a ""death stranding"" for whales, they are washed ashore (are ""Beached"") and die."
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"I think the character played by Mads Mikkelsen created a way for people to jump through time because he lost his kid and wanted to see him again and by doing so he let a extra dimensional being in called BT's which stands for either beyond times or between times basically if they catch you, you are sent to another time like shown in the trailer where Norman Reedus's character is sent to a world war 1 battlefield. not sure what the baby's do maybe they are a way to bring you back to your current time? but basically it seems the world was devastated after the BT's appeared and sent people all over time so most of the earth's population disappeared  and the current president wants Norman Reedus's character to try and help rebuild the US and create strands of connection to other nations etc, but first starting with the USA  

Edit:  oh yeah Mikkelsen's character is kinda the bad guy because Reedus's character is trying to somehow fix what he did so he is hunting Reedus throughout the story. aka it showing him constantly popping up with a skeleton crew of all the best spec ops people from the past to back him up. just my take on it not sure if its true"

buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"You've got 80mln users of PS4. If you somehow convince 10% of them to buy your new game, you sell 8mln copies. 8mln*(lets say $15 of clean profit on each copy) = $120mln. After that you release PS5 remaster, and after that you start to sell remasters, remakes and also include it in future PS related stream services. Generally, why would you want to lose way over $100mln and force your fanbase to wait if you don't have to?"
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"I really want this game to drastically outperform not only Metal Gear Survive, but also his previous MGS games. Konami needs to learn the hard way that their decision was wrong and cost them a ton of money, and no better way to do that than Kojima's first game in a new company outperforming every game he made while at Konami."
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"And let's be real, from what we've seen so far (which is like over half an hour of cinematics in total), even if Death Stranding fails as a *game*, it's undoubtedly ambitious in a way few video games are and is likely to influence a lot of future creativity and innovation in the medium. Even how it's taking a huge leap in involving BIG names from a much larger and more universally consumed form of media will probably have lasting impacts on the future of gaming, if/when the game sells well. A few years ago it was ooo la la if you got Troy Baker and Nolan North (iconic voice actors for us, but not people anybody would know if they didn't game), or you got a medicore mo-cap of Ellen Page in a pretty bad game(but hey, at least she is recognizable to the public). Now we have photorealistic Reedus and Mikklesen in a Kojima game... I think we will very soon see a lot more big players in the world of cinema starting to do big things in video games in part because of Death Stranding, assuming it does well.

Consider No Man's Sky. It's actually a pretty dope game now, but when it came out it was garbage and most people totally abandoned it. In a lot of ways NMS was a flop, but I think the gaming community as a whole still respects their ambition as a small team. Sure maybe it was't that great of a game at launch, but as a proof of concept for a really ambitious way of generating content, I think it succeeded in a lot of ways. I think if Death Stranding fails, it will be in a similar style of succeeding in other ways."

buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"My guess for the meaning of ""death stranding"" is the inverse: the dead are stranded in the world of the living, hence the spooky skeletons. Similar consequences, though."
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"I thought the same thing about Metal Gear Solid ,and  if you just look at the surface you only see the crazy shit; the clones, the giant robots, the magic and AI ect, but really it's a very simple story about a soldier realizing that the nation he fought for and the ideals he thought it represented were meaningless. By the end he understands that he was only a cog in a machine built for corporate profit , destined to be discarded , and the only thing that ever mattered was his personal connections to other people.

&#x200B;

Hideo Kojima has always been ahead of his time. Way back in the 90's he predicted that the rise of the internet wouldn't bring people together , but instead would flood people with so much information that it would make us insane and docile, because people would start to be unsure of the nature of reality, and that was long before anyone thought up shit like social media or procedurally generated deep-fake videos."

Wrong audience, dude.

It's like when people get all up in arms over GTA and stuff... it's media made by adults **for** adults. If you assume that because it's a video game it must be appropriate for children and buy your 8 year old these kinds of games that's your bad decision to own. If you literally aren't aware that there is a spectrum of games designed for audiences of different ages, just like literally any other creative medium, that's just being clueless and neglecting to actually monitor the media your kids are consuming. If you are talking about teenagers, 15-16ish, the game is probably appropriate, but if they are 15 and are actually persuaded to take up smoking because they saw a cool character do it in a video game, they were a lost cause to begin with; that 15 year old is an impressionable dumbass and I don't think that was the fault of a single video game.

People are getting dismembered and stuff in this game, but god forbid children see one of the characters smoking!"

It feels... regressive, perhaps? ... to just turn animated media into ersatz live-action and discard one of its most unique selling points.

All that said, I'm still going to buy this on day one, of course. I'll follow Kojima's imagination anywhere."

Thing is: if you want to tell story then you want characters to act natural. And based way to do that is usually mocap. Since software still can't generate believable faces that just match what they are saying and what they should feel while saying it. Actors can do that."
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"Sure, but I also think actors are taking roles in gaming because it's probably the easiest way to a billion dollar role, and that only happens if the game delivers. So I see this shift as a positive where games with known actors will get a bigger budget and the stories will be stronger since that is what the actor will likely be basing their choice on. So you'll have strong stories written ahead of development and then it's a matter of using that fat budget to get quality devs, who make that vision playable.  That's my hope for how this trend goes, but you're right in worrying it could go the other way."
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"I think it's different with an active rather than passive medium. Mediocre movies can coast by on at least having some entertaining performances on behalf of its actors. In a video game, if the gameplay is shit, it's shit, and no amount of amazing cinematography is going to make me sit through it for an extended amount of time. I have never, ever bought a game on the basis of its voice actors, despite many of them having some prestige talent, and I don't think that's going to change any time soon."
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"I think however that could be a positive for videogames, since, if we associate them with movies, then poeple will start expecting movie grade quality at least in its storytelling. I hate the ""star"" draw too, but it could backfire. What's the point of having Troy Baker and Norman if the story is not worthy of such stars?

And it is true that cartoon dubbing has improved thanks to stars, like Tom Hanks and Toy Story can't be separated."

buggin,2019-05-29,2019-06-07,wow this was a great video
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"Obviously you're right that having actors be themselves (visually) is mostly done so you can send those people out to do PR for your game, get mainstream attention, etc. But from a technical point of view, I'm sure it also makes sense as far as the motion capture technology. Meaning they can avoid dorky looking characters with ridiculous looking movement as much as possible."
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,Was so stoked to see Guillermo Del Toro and Nicolas Winding Refn.

buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,I trust anything Kojima puts out to be a masterpiece
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"That would be great, but I'm not sure he has much to do with the writing. IMDB doesn't list him outside of just being a cast member (not among the writers) and in an interview on the subject he didn't seem to be involved in it beyond what he described as being ""a puppet"" :

"" Speaking to [IGN](http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/11/09/death-stranding-del-toro-expects-kojima-to-show-him-gameplay-soon), Del Toro revealed that even he hasn't seen much of the elusive, much-anticipated game. ""In Death Stranding I'm just a puppet,"" he said. ""I don't know what \[Hideo Kojima\]'s gonna make me do. He's supposedly going to show me the gameplay at some point in the next couple of weeks.""

If Del Toro is calling himself a puppet and saying he hasn't yet seen gameplay, perhaps Death Stranding will be less of a collaboration between the Spanish filmmaker and Kojima than some thought. The pair previously worked together in shaping P.T., the playable teaser for the since-cancelled Silent Hills game, but it sounds like Kojima is definitely leading the way this time around.""

Source:  [https://www.gamesradar.com/death-stranding-gameplay-may-be-coming-in-the-next-few-weeks-if-youre-guillermo-del-toro/](https://www.gamesradar.com/death-stranding-gameplay-may-be-coming-in-the-next-few-weeks-if-youre-guillermo-del-toro/)

It's not to say that he may have given some sort of uncredited advice, but alas it doesn't look like he's a major collaborator on the writing.

Edit: I just had a thought... what if they are re-using some of the concepts from the cancelled Silent Hill collaboration but because of contractural stuff they can't legally make that connection between the two games publicly?"
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,He is definitely  pretentious  and direly needs an editor to cut out most of his bulk but I have such a sentimental attachment to the MGS series. As a kid I thought it was the most deep thing ever. Regardless of story and concepts though Kojima always makes his games fun as hell. Gameplay wise you don't really have to worry about his quality.
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"Its Kojimas monstrous ego that ends up coming close to ruining his work. The early teasers of DS looked absolutely obnoxious. But like MGS theres a heap of substance here and it looks interesting but not very exciting. Looks like a mountain climbing simulator with perfect views. Im sure itll be good, just hope the story is fleshed out."

buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"I think it will have big game-changer elements but that the actual second to second playing of the game will feel similar to MGS V as mentioned above. Video games are becoming a lot more mature, so it's hard to expect anybody, even Kojima, to release a game that is literally unlike anything we've ever played in terms of mechanics, a game that invents a new genre of game. I think that is really unlikely these days; if you look at the last few genres that have been defined, they aren't entirely new ways of playing a game, they are a specific subset of a game genre we are already familiar with: MOBAs are a kind of real time strategy game, which are a kind of strategy game, Battle Royale games are multiplayer competitive action games with a particular rule set (but in large part they play like 3rd person shooters, FPSs, some other parent genre we know well), etc.

What I hope for Death Stranding is not necessarily an entirely new form of gameplay we don't yet have words for, but new ways of integrating the gameplay into the narrative, new ways of feeling agency and encouraging you to fully inhabit the world, new ways to feel like your actions in the game have consequences you care about. On that front I think Death Stranding has a ton of promise."

The baby Mads is talking to at the end is Sam who is going to ""have the whole world to explore, and the moon."" The scene in the begining of the trailer is Cliff singing to the baby with blood on his face and before he sings he says ""I'll always be with you"" and his character seems to be hunting down Sam through time.(the WW1 stuff)

Sam says they ""connected everything with cables once"" like he wasn't a part of it, I'm assuming he is referring to the internet and telecommunications in general and all of that was shot by the time he came around."

buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"Death Stranding most likely is never coming to PC for several reasons.

* Sony funded the development of the game.

* Sony had Kojima use the first party exclusive Decima game engine to create Death Stranding. The same engine used in Until Dawn and Horizon Zero Dawn.

* Sony is publishing Death Stranding.

* Sony filed the game Death Stranding as a Sony Trademark. Another example of a game with a Sony Trademark is Bloodborne, which most people are aware is never leaving PS4 at this point. 

Not saying it can't happen, but if you really want to play it don't get your hopes up for a PC release. There are still people waiting for that Bayonetta 2 PC release that is ""definitely gonna happen any day now"". Even though Bayo 3 has already been announced as yet another Nintendo Switch Exclusive."
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"The engine they used in this game is Decima, which is the same engine Horizon Zero Dawn (Guerrilla Games) runs on. Which means it more likely won't come out on PC."
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"Yeah, that ain't happening. The game runs on an engine developed for the PS4 from the ground up and its development has been entirely funded by Sony. It's a full-on exclusive.

Also the trailer is captured from a PS4 Pro. It's not native 4K, but the engine they're using has top notch checkerboarding so it practically looks like 4K."

buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"The things is, Kojima's work has always been about a blending of the realities of the silver screen and video games. I highly doubt this will change anything in gaming that drastically. There is still plenty of room for telling stories without having Hollywood faces shoved into it (like the newest God of War or Witcher 3)."

buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"I honestly don't like it at all. First of all, it's kinda a marketing gimmick. What is next, Activision paying 100m to have RDJ in their next CoD? Hollywood is as hollow as it stands already, and gaming is already pretty bad, combing the shitty ""advertising"" (read hype/lying) with hollywood gaming is gonna be a disaster.

Second of all, I like video games because you can design *any* character to make it look anything. Why make it look like a famous person. But then this is creative so this is purely subjective."
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"The point of my argument is not to avoid actors, but rather to avoid big name actors, so as to not give publishers the chance to market the games for their cast, but rather just the usual things we care about in games. If games marketed like that become successful, that will lead to studios focusing on actors rather than story or gameplay, as the video essay linked in my comment argues."
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"I don't mean to sound like a jerk, but how would doing motion capture with a non famous actor affect the movement captured for the game? As far as I know, some game studios will even have the devs do that sometimes, so I don't see how just having non-big-name actors doing the work could hurt the development process in any way. 

Honest question, I really wanna explore the technical perspective of this"

The baby could represent life and therefore rebirth as the factions in game are trying to rebuild the country. Two ways of doing it are going back to the old way, what we remember, or building something new and letting go of the past.

buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"Even in early games like MGS1 and 2 there’s an unbelievable amount of quality and little surprising details, with more more just added into each subsequent game. The fact that every MGS game could be considered the best and the peak of the series speaks to the effort and quality. Although he is a bit too crazy about celebs and sometimes has questionable choices like kicking out David Hayter, I’m interested to see all that Death Stranding will offer."
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"From interviews I've heard about the aftermath of Phantom Pain, it has become clear to me that Kojima was a dick to David Hayter, and I can understand why Konami fired him for going over budget.

It could be that the reason he goes to that place in time is he's traversing through a former WW1 battlefield, thus once taken to the other side he's trapped in the metaphorical purgatory where all the shadows in the area originally perished."

This doesn't mean anything anymore. Both consoles are x86-based and utilize universal PC components. The PS4 doesn't have any form of proprietary architecture to utilize specific coding methods (like PS3's ""Cell"" technology). So from a technical standpoint it *COULD* be brought over to the XB1.

So it's really just down to Sony allowing it. But as you and others have stated there's likely a contractual agreement to make this a PS exclusive title in exchange for being able to use their game engine."

buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"It's more complicated than that. Yes, hardware wise the PS4 is pretty much a PC.

But then you have the software side. The PS4's OS is a BSD derivative and the APIs used to develop for the PS4 are very low level to allow for more minute optimization. To port the Decima engine to work on Windows, you'd have to rework all those API hooks to make them work on something like DirectX or Vulkan. Of course that could theoretically be done, but why would Sony spend so much resources to put the game on other platforms?

Also, the contractual agreement goes deeper. Sony is funding the game's development, publishing the game and owns the IP rights."
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"The hardware is based on whatever, doesn't mean the engine itself can work on just whatever.

Guerrilla likely didn't think about windows when making it."
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"It doesn't need to say in your face exclusive, it's pretty much a first party game at this point. It's using a Sony owned game engine, developed entirely with Sony money, development assistance from a Sony owned studio. Likely uses a ton of Sony services like their motion capture. 

The same thing happened with Spider-man, it's not going to come to PC at all so don't get your Hope's up. Sony don't fully fund a game with millions for it to just go on PC a year later, especially not something this big. This will likely end up being the new big PS franchise if it sells well, I imagine Sony will even put an offer on the table for Kojima and bring the studio under the arms of Sony."
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"> they didn't say exclusive yet

Yes they did, multiple times actually.

Also checkerboarding isn't the same thing as what we typically call upscaling. And my point was that if you want to play the game ""like in the trailer"", the PS4 Pro version will give you just that.

And if you're so set on native 4K for some reason, the PS5 will probably give you just that."
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-30,"Sony provides the resources, funded the project. Doesn't matter that Kojima Productions is an indepent studio. The franchise belongs to Sony and he has simply has been contracted to make it."

buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"Oh I don't think they do the two at the same time either way (motion capture and voice recording), so it probably doesn't matter too much. If they're able to put the actors voice in their virtual image at a different time, then they can put anybody else's voice in their virtual image, and obviously even a made up character/body."

buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"Apparently as far back as Metal Gear Solid 3, Kojima was looking to recast David Hayter, and even had Kurt Russell in mind. 

In an interview with David Hayter about the voice actor change, he believed that Kojima was jealous that Hayter was stealing his thunder, and was more the poster boy of the series than Kojima ever was. So there was a bit of animosity there, and Kojima apparently has had cold feelings for Hayter in the past. 

On top of this, apparently the game had gone over budget and Konami was pressing Kojima.

You can get a full story here https://levelskip.com/action-adventure/Why-David-Hayter-Was-REALLY-Replaced-in-Metal-Gear-Solid-V-The-Phantom-Pain

buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,I'm not saying it would be a two-second port job. I just wanted to dispel the false notion that such a task would be next to impossible. Current gen systems took a massive step forward by switching to x86 based processors. It meant that porting games between each other (and PCs) were *relatively* easier. If you compare that to porting games which were designed specifically for the PS3's Cell processor it's a freaking godsend.

buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"there's less of a demand these days for people to work on them for sure (being how there's only a couple exclusive games vs most being on pc anyways), but it seems like the switch got a lot of work because it had more exclusives worth playing"
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,we sorta suspected emulation would be quick this gen because both platforms are straight x86 for the first time. last gen was powerPC and the travesty known as cell.
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"This approach also means that they probably only need the face and voice of a famous actor, and they get cheap stunt of same physical makeup to do all the moving parts to save costs. I'm sure companies involved will find interesting ways to save money here :)"
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"How would you think a voice actor is upstaging you and think that hiring Kurt fucking Russell would somehow NOT overshadow you? I dunno man, that rumor just doesn't add up."
buggin,2019-05-29,2019-05-29,"I think that can probably go up there with the theory that Kojima got put on lockdown, abused and fired by the company because he made PT on the downlow convincing the company that he was making a horror easter egg level inside The Phantom Pain like the nightmare sequence in MGS4 and got it out onto Sony's store via a personal friendship he had with one of the higher-ups in Sony with the theory that if the public got hold of it and played it, they'd be so desperate for the rest of the game that Konami would have to let him make Silent Hills."

dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"I own a few of his books. Thank you for doing this he deserves more recognition. 

I have tried and tried I cannot draw like him."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Fuck, all those Metal Gear designs are iconic."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-02,Damn i just had some Zone of the Enders vibes
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Fir a second I thought that was goblin slayer in the background
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"kojima is just one guy. he has a horde of artists, engineers and designers working around him  (some whom are more talented and skilled then him in their own fields, but probably enjoy their anonymity/privacy more)"
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,He as an amazing art style. I'm debating on looking for a print of his work to frane and put in my room. The MGS2 blue solid snake art is amazing.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Yoji Shinkawa, Otto Dix, and Ralph Steadman have been my artistic muses throughout my life, forever grateful for their creativity and passion."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"This was an april fool's joke

[https://www.seiko-design.com/en/aprilfool/index.html](https://www.seiko-design.com/en/aprilfool/index.html)"
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Met this absolute legend today!
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,I absolutely love this guy’s work.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,That vídeo of shinkawa painting big boss live is incredible. This man's art is unique and splendid.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,We need more of these recognitions in gaming
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"The art of MGS really set the tone of the series, it was serious and a little gritty/dark which really made the characters and story feel more serious despite how tongue in cheek and goofy some events and enemies were"
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Damn. Why are Japanese dudes so good at this industry.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Can we take a moment to appreciate that Kojima Productions takes its time to release a game rather than set an end date and hope for the best. #AlwaysHasTheGamersInMind
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Misread the title as “death standing just around the corner” and thought oh god is someone about to die
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Yes, this. I always thought of Kojima and Shinkawa as a unit, one for the absurdly good storytelling and gameplay, and one for the absolute beast mechanical modelling, as seen as many  bosses such as the metal gears. Both are awesome in their field."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,This is the first good post I've seen on r/gaming in probably over a year
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,[deleted]
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"He's the real reason I was excited for Death Stranding.

Probably the only reason now..."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Dude is one of the best illustrators alive. I'm a big fan of Murata as well.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"God damn Shinkawa is so good. I loved as a kid flipping through the novel sized booklet in MGS and looking at his art work.  I was getting a drawing commmisioned recently and the character is wearing a trench coat,  they sent me the first draft and I said they need to go look at how Shinkawa draws trench coats.  So much energy and motion in a still image."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Kojima spouts his galaxy brain nonsense, this guy puts it into a tangible form"
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,His art is what drew my eye to MGS when it came out. His depictions of Snake and Grey Fox caught my young teenaged attention and I had to check the game out. Now here we are so many years later and MGS is arguably my favorite series of the generation.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Thankful for Shinkawa designing all the Metal Gears and Orbital Frames. One of my fav mecha designers.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Yoji is a beast and the unsung hero of MGS and I assume Death Stranding. Lovely post to commend a true artist.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Supporting artists is my kink
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Classy move, OP. Yes, let's give this fine artist the praise he deserves."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Agreed, OP. Shinkawa is the backbone to every major success Kojima has. Without his input, Kojima would be nowhere."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"One of my favourite artists, love his style. It's so fucking cool"
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Jeez what an underated artist. This is the guy behind everything! :)
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"I look at something like that and it blows me away. Not only is the artistic ability far beyond what I could ever do, but the mind it takes to even come up with something like that. Amazing."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"I’ll be honest, this game doesn’t look remotely interesting to me. Is there really a lot of hype for this? If so, why?"
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Hi's the men
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,I’ve kinda always wondered who was behind the very distinct art style of kojima games so this was both interesting and informative thanks op
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,I've never been a particular fan of Kojima's games (nothing against them at all!) but I love love love this guy's work. Fantastic style
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,It's like Snake with Raiden's Revengeance armor
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,and i'm over here not being able to draw a straight line to save my life....
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,he got higher billing on this games credits I've noticed.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,In art school when we had to do studies on our favorite artist I chose this man right here and to be honest I had decided before I even knew fully what the assignment was
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,I have always loved his art style and I intend on getting a tattoo in his style as well
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Very nice
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Woah
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Absolutely beautiful.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Bummer that Left Alive turned out bad.  I thought Yoji doing Front Mission stuff  would have been a perfect match.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Didn't he do a movie poster for Pacific Rim?
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"I think he worked on a mecha anime before Konami, regardless, always liked that splashy ink style on his character portraits."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Isn't there another famous artist working on this who's known for his monster designs?
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,The homie...
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Yeah, but who's the guy on the right?"
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,The God son!
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,his arts are masterpiece
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Been going through an extremely tough time lately and honestly....this game is a bright spot in a sea of dark
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Shinkawa is truly legendary. Adore his art style
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,His art is phenomenal!
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Master🙏🏻
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"I read the title as ""with death standing just around the corner"" and assumed this guy was dying of cancer or something"
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,i was making fan art of this guys stuff back in grade school
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"His art is legendary, can't wait for Death Stranding in all of its weird goodness."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,I really want a tattoo in his style but I don't really trust anyone to get it right.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"I really like his art style. When I heard he did the artwork for Zombies Chronicles back in 2017, I was amazed"
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"I’d like to point out one of the professional reviews said there were no time limits, weapons, enemies, or vehicles in the game while Yong Yea showed all of that in the game in his review. So this guy played almost no e of the game, wrote a review as if he did play it, was paid for it, and it’s still up."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,A good framed Yoji Shinkawa print is on my bucket list for wall art.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,What is death stranding
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,A Hideo Kojima artist hired by Hideo Kojima.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"As a huge fan of Yoshitaka Amano, I appreciate his automatic type style, as if a video game character was drawn by Jackson Pollock."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Could you imagine how epic his rendition of a dickbutt would be
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,No MGS fan worth his salt would ever not recognise a Shinkawa piece. The man is as integral to the success of MGS as Kojima and Death Stranding would’ve more certainly been lesser if Mr. Kojima had not chosen to take Mr. Shinkawa with him
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,(From the back of the room) YEAH! (clapclapclap) Woo! Go Yoji! (looks embarrassed and sits back down) hehe yea (small fist pump)
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,If I remember correctly he did the artwork for Black Ops 3’s DLC zombie chronicles.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Cant wait for the masterpiece they call Death Stranding!
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"In the games, due to the tech at the time, I always thought Solid Snake looked goofy, ugly even. Not the image I had since MGS1. But Yoji's artwork was a perfect caricature of a grissled, veteran espionage agent. Every line seemed to show the stress and muscle memory Snake has perfected over his years in the field. His art covered what the game graphics could not."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,The man. The legend.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Dude sure can draw.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Metal gear solid!
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,HOLY
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"I don't really care about artwork, but his pieces are the only ones I ever wanted hanging in my house."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"I'll never forget that fight against Psycho Mantis on the Playstation 1....

Kojima even had it programmed to mention other Konami games on the memory card. Genius.

I just wish Silent Hills wasn't canceled..."

dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Dude's work is incredible. MGS2 and 3 are some of my favorite games and he played a part in that.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Such an amazing and unique artist. All of his MGS illustrations are iconic and helped make the series what it is; I can’t imagine the series being what it is without him.

Also, the dude is 47 looking like he’s going on 30. That alone is incredible in and of itself."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"His art has always been an inspiration of my own.

Not that mine's any good."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,That character looks like Genji and Master Chief had a baby
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,A fucking legend
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,I work with a guy with the name kojima. I want to ask him if he is related but I don't speak Japanese well and he doesn't speak English.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"I love his art. He's the designer behind the beautiful ZOE Mecha designs. 

Jehuty <3"
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Who is he ? And what is the movie about ?. Never heard of either.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,As somebody who has never had any encounter with this dudes work: Death stranding makes no fucking sense
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Yoji Shinkawa gets ALL the love on the Metal Gear Subreddit. All of his art, even if it's not Metal Gear Related, gets so much love there"
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Not ganna lie you look like elon musk
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Do they never fucking age?
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,So; the Big Boss to Kojima's Boss?
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"imagine him doing this style of art for other games, like kingdom hearts or that untitled goose game?"
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,He'll always be in good stranding with me.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,[deleted]
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,bruh what you mean that dude genji
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Isn’t his name in the trailers?
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"With all due respect, I first saw Master Chief fucking a deer that was looking back at him screaming."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Hired by Hideo Kojima.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,I hope this guy made the walking simulator somewhat tolerable
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"I was gonna say, looks like Solid Snake artist"
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Was the table on a 400ft scaffold? Lol
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Unfortunately he's not getting a whole lot of exposure at all for Death Stranding. His art was everywhere for the MGS series, but all they're pushing for DS is the graphics."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"IGN gave this game 6.8, I really have to see this game for myself to decided"
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Any similar artists to Shinkawa? Really like the style
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,I thought this was a Stand fan art for a second
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,The fact that he's 47 and looks fresh out of college. Unless this isn't a recent photo
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,So this is the guy who scared me when I was little with the mgs2 cover art
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"All I see

[https://imgur.com/a/BlFKMIb](https://imgur.com/a/BlFKMIb)"
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Wasn't he responsible for tons of mechanical design in Kojika games? Pretty sure he brought us Metal Gear, Orbital Frames etc. The dude is honestly my hero and a huge inspiration."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Hey does anyone know where the background art is from? it look amazing
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,looks like he didn't even realize it lol
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,What if he took over the kingdom hearts franchise?
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"He is either 25 or 50, I can't tell"
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Goblin Slayer, is that you in the back...?"
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Can you buy his artwork somewhere like on a canvas or matte paper?
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Is it just me or does this look like Hirohiko Araki with young Keanu Reeves hair?
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"I just found out that I will be receiving such a great birthday present!
Having loved gaming since the release of N64, I have been anticipating this game since I learned of the silent hills debacle.

I'll be celebrating via rock climbing, drinking and music, as well as a snowshoe bonfire in my mountain home, and yet...
The week nights following will, I hope, be full of Kojima absurdity and Del Toro Gothic glory"
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Imma be pissed if this game flops. Dude getting fired would be in vain. Chances are people will buy it for the developer alone and quietly trade it in if it flops but I hope not.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"I am not getting this game.  I know everybody worships this guy, but it looks bad."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"That is just it. Konami allowed Kojima to gobble all the glory from all the mgs games and him to be presented as this ""all knowing god of videogames"". When infact he gas done some shady stuff like discrediting main writers/co-writers, blastering his name everywhere do that people only notice his name. The thinking it seems to be with these games is that Kojima has an idea, hypes it, makes it convoluted because that is ""deep"" and starts to incubate that egg and then just lays that egg which is the complete game, all on his own.  Alot of people tend to forget that without a really good team and alot of effort and skill from the developers there wouldnt be Kojima nor any good game. 

While it is important to have creative directors running a game, it is still the team that makes their crazy plans possible and not even all the ideas are possible to create."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Shame death stranding is a pile of hot dog shit. 

I loved RDR2's mechanic of picking everything up individually, it's groundbreaking. I also love backpacking simulators. 

I love death stranding. I also love a 72 hour game with endless fetch quests. GOD I LOVE DEATH STRANDING."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Then there's also Hideo Kojima's co-writer and evil twin Hitori Nojima
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Also, the 70 members of Guerilla who worked on the game ;)."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"When you put the title that way I thought you meant he was dying, until I realised it was the name of the game."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Oh, I can imagine manga or graphic novel in his style.

Day 1 buy from me!"
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Yeah, fuck the thousands of others involved in making this game"
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"This guy is a legend,idk why but I thought he would be older"
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,The man’s watch is a unit.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Kojima hogs all the glory people act like no one else’s have been there for years working on games for him they just think kojima does literally everything he is o freaking overrated
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Yoji is a fantastic talent. I’m yet to see anything as interesting as his art style in gaming
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,I don’t know what that drawing is but it looks really freaking cool
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Thank you ☺️ I
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-04,And the writer Tomokazu Fukushima
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-04,Any idea if Junji ito is working on Death Stranding?
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-04,Always love his art. It's so distinctive
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Holy fuck this post is so astroturfed lmao
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"For some reason, I thought this guy was Keanu Reeves for a minute."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Kojima gets most, or maybe even all of the credit for his work. But visually, Kojima games would not be the same without Yoji Shinkawa."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Kojima gets way too much attention, don't get me wrong, he is awesome, but he doesn't make the games on his own, when people talk about MGS and other Konami games people praise Kojima like a God, yes he does a lot of awesome stuff but there is a whole team behind all of those games and they should not be forgotten, in a lot of those games on the credits Kojima always gets his ""special spot"" separated from the rest of the team and I just think that that is not right."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"""Kojima getting all the spotlight""

Calling Shinkawa ""legendary"", Ads showing a ton of promotion for Reedus, Mikkelsen.

The spotlight is shining on everyone it usually shines on."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Does anybody know this guy’s instagram? 🙏🏻💯
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Am I the only one who thinks Metal gear didn't make sense at all? And that this is probably going to be stupid as shit?
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Kojima is an overrated narcissist
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Too bad the game sucks.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,I don't understand the hype for this game. It doesn't look entertaining at all. It just appears boring
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Raiden is still gay.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Walking simulator By hideo kojima.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,“Shinkawa is gay.” - Hideo Kojima
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Just think this man is most likely 50+ years old.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Game got a 6.8 from IGN.

Dude can make cinematic actions games, but his strange artsy metaphors are missed on a majority of people."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Shinkawa is an amazing artist.

It's kind of sickening how overrated and undeservingly revered Kojima is in the western world. There are dozens of developers more prolific and influential than him in Japan, France and the USA, but I guess when you shmooze with movie stars it means you're more important than others, right?"
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Wow really jumped on that post eh?well played.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,I heard death stranding sucks
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,So cool!  He was totally thinking his life needed to be validated by a bunch of internet losers.  He may die tomorrow.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,That art could be genji concept art
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Lel that game is getting awful reviews right now
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Fuuuuuck yeaaa walking simulator with mumbling main character yeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa fuuuckk yeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"DS looks like a total garbage fire of a game so far, would be zero hype if it wasnt kojima."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Glad he was brought along for the project.  It was too bad about Left Alive.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,I love how that Wired article was announced basically saying Death Stranding was a  dumpster fire piece of shit game and it gets buried with more hype. This site is such a fucking crock of shit... it’s bought and paid for 100%.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"One of the best. It's a shame his talent was wasted on the dumpster of a game, Left Alive."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Hideo Kojimas game is bound to fail based on people's expectations now. Everyone has put it on this golden pedestal for years and the only gameplay seen has made it look like a walking simulator that is trying to bite off more than it can chew. I respect the man and like his work, but people gotta chill with praising the game as much as they have. He is just a human, give him some space."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Shit game death stranding basically based on old Japanese delivery men from feudal age, that's stupid and boring"
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Wrong.

I'ts

Hideo Kojima presents an employee of Kojima Productions by Hideo Kojima, starring in A Hideo Kojima game \*Hideo Kojima's Death Stranding\*, **Yoji Shinkawa**.

Get it right next time!"
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Just around the corner?  The games been reviewed and its apparently not very good.:(

I'm gutted. And worried they're right , as it does look like it's been claimed...a little boring and janky. 

I haven't played it yet but....even if it's not great...I feel we should support it to say fuckonami!. Really fuck that company over by making his game number one... over a pachinko gambling machine!"
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Kojima is such a bunch of shit. Thousands of people contribute to make a game and Hideo Kojima pretends like he shaped the game from clay with his own singular vision. I can’t imagine the ego a person has to have to own the credit of the work of so many.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Because if you're going to fill your game with wordy pseudo-philosophical bullshit, it may as well look pretty"
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,i heard death stranding is really boring
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,yo i heard this game had mad product placement please confirm.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Such an incredible artist for such a stunning looking game. Shame the gameplay is supposedly dull as dishwater.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Not to be rude or anything but I have no idea who all these people are.

dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Death Stranding is nothing more than a walking simulator. Very boring stuff.

dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Not only was the art amazing, but the soundtrack was a work of fucking art."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,ZOE2 is criminally underrated.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Did not know he did Zone of the Enders, it was one of my favorites when I was younger."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"I don't think his art has been on the cover since MGS3. It's been pretty generic screenshots/character portraits from MGS4 onward. Pretty generic, tbh. Definitely missing the artistic flair."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,I'm honestly disappointed in the actual cover art they chose for Death Stranding. It's just close up of Norman Reedus And The Funky Fetus' face with the star looking robotic thing behind him. Nothing special imo.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,[deleted]
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Box art has gone down the drain since back in the day, imo. We used to have really cool box arts, that had neat concept art on it or something sorta abstract that pertains to the themes of the game, and now it's like ""Here is Main Character Man (or woman) looking at camera."""
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"The better MGS vox arts has always been his. MGS1 VR Missions, MGS2, MGS3 Subsistence, the collectors edition of MGS4. The reverse side of Ground Zeroes. Phantom Pain was lacking but the definitive edition has a nice box art."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Sadly covers like that went out of style after the the 90's / early 00's. Now like 90% of game covers are main character dude/dudes doing some sort of pose on the cover.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Maybe it's because this ISN'T a MGS game?
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,They have Norman Reedus though. No way they don't use his face for the cover.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"I think you would be surprised if you actually looked up which of the art he *directed* vs what he actually made himself. Your favorite stuff from MGS2 was probably not actually his art. 

He’s a great illustrator, don’t get me wrong, but his team is frankly where most of the talent and actual artwork lives."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"it's what drew me to the game in the first place, he's a legend."

dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,He's been a life long influence for my work. If I could afford it I'd own every single artbook of his.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,His art is its own atmosphere.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,A Hind-D?!?

dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,I could have been a contender!
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"I didn't grow up with his art. I don't know an especially large amount about him nor have I seen even close to most of his art. However, I can say that his art makes me want to draw whenever I see it. His art looks so effortless and beautiful. He's one of the best visual artists in gaming, in my opinion."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Ur welcome
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Do you mind sending me a link to some of his books? Im an aspiring artist and would like to see some as well. Or a link to all of them can be fine.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,What are some of his good books?
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,His work as well.

dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Think you meant anonymity.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Art Directors / Directors / Producers / Creative Directors have a skill in their own right, don’t get it twisted. 

Often times Creative Directors start as copy writers with no discernible artistic talent and rise through the ranks - because their job is often directing traffic not production."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Arguably some of his more lauded work is the product of cowriting with someone that reigns in his cookyness. He's got a bit of George Lucas in that aspect.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,What are you basing your assumption of “some of whom are more talented and skilled then him in their own fields” on?
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,That's both hilarious and badass.

dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Infrastructure and education. They got in early, and the top tier companies are still in Japan. So they have kids being funneled into education programs to fill spots in the industry."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Its basically just a part of their culture now.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"There are just as many amazing American and western artists but since you’re viewing Japanese artwork as foreign and exotic, you’ve become desensitized to western art, it’s significance and it’s prevalence. Don’t forget that most of Kojima’s games are based on American cinema. We’re inundated with examples of our own art 1000 times a day and it just doesn’t seem special anymore, much like seeing a Porsche in Germany isn’t particularly special to Germans."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,You just posted cringe bro

dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"The same reason the Irishman had hype. A well-known director getting a seemingly unlimited budget to do whatever he wants with well-known actors and produce something that is entirely under their control. Also, a decent track record, I don't think anything Kojima has done has been bad and regardless of affinity for the genre, he sort of spearheaded/invented stealth as a main video game mechanic. Plus the games are usually technical marvels although that's less on him and more on his team."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Cool guy but I think this game will flop in terms of sales.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Because it's Hideo, essentially able to do whatever he wants with an entirely new story. It doesn't look like my sort of game, but I bet its going to look and feel like nothing else out there."

dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,What exactly about MGS didn't make sense to you? Not ripping on you but curious.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Like the entire series didn't make sense? The series as a whole is pretty darn solid when it comes to it's lore and timeline(even if it's absurd). If you're talking about a single game, then sure, it won't make much sense since you're missing 4 decades of in-game lore."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Overrated? Every game the dude has made has been a 10/10, best of its generation-level masterpiece. I can't speak for the narcissism cuz I don't know the guy, but to say he's overrated is just objectively false."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Yes, because you own it. Yes, you've played it already."

One of the people who helped make Beyond The Bounds also voices a character in MGS 2. The Character shares the same name as his actor...

dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Special edition covers of MGS4 had his artwork.  Rising Revengeance also did too.  MGS5 GZ had the bonus edition cover.  

I think the only ones that didn't have a Shinkawa variant was PO, PW, and PP.  Guess P's don't like Shinkawa."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Well, I still think MGS 4 cover was decent because it's was a close up of Old Snake face which gives a depressing tone for the game."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,MGS4 LE had Shinkawa art.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Depends on the region. The US gets the short end of the stick most of the time, but most EU and Japan covers have Shinkawa's art."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"I mean, he wasnt really selected. He's been working with Kojima since the Snatcher days. Those two are basically together till the end.

What are you talking about? No one would hire him? Everyone would fucking jump to recruit the lead character designer for the WHOLE Metal Gear Solid series and then some. His style is some off shoot of a renowned form of Japanese painting, with inspiration from tons of artists. 

Square Enix literally napped him immediately for Left Alive after he left Konami to KojiPro, provs because he had an open slot of time. He even had a brief stunt with CoD during that gap.

If he wasnt so busy with KojiPro, he would be a famous artist being hired all over for designing characters and making pieces for them.

Infact his artstyle would make shareholder's mouths drool. You show em some fucking hype ass hell cool art shit from Shinkawa and they'll think, ""Holy shit, we're backing this cool shit?! WE'RE GONNA BE RICH""."

dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"When he said ""if he went out to apply for concept art today"", he likely meant a hypothetical situation in which today was his debut, and MGS didn't happen."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"I'll admit my knowledge on how he ended up with Kojima is fuzzy at best, but what I mean is if he started his career here and now were he not already established, he'd be turned down for being so stylistic. If you can't illustrate a believable scifi scene you're just not hirable unless it's in a niche part of the market. Not that if he were to apply as is.

Anyway, I would like to see more style in game art. Like Viewtiful Joe, Mischief Makers, that cel shading looking Ninja Gaiden game, PowerStone, ZoE, more Amano stuff, more Shinkawa, more of this guy who made Vagabond, DC games based off the Tim Cook style of Batman art, Bioshock deco styles, nouveau like Tolkien themes, etc etc etc.

MC Escher level designs. James Jean like boss designs. Geiger inspired dick monsters in Berserk video games. etc etc etc"
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Why the downvotes?  Even Shinkawa [mentions them in this interview.](https://www.konami.com/games/zoe2/english/interview_01.html)

Excerpt below:

> Another thing that ""stands out"" is the cockpit at the groin. Where did this come from?

> Shinkawa : This is another idea from my school day sketches.
This is one major characteristic of Orbital Frames.

dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"I am aware of this, that's why I respect his art so much."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Np. Thought you made a good point. Just took a brief trip through the brain blender.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"You are saying that like it’s an absolute truth.  I would say Kojima is great, so where does that leave us now?"
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Yeesh. Sensitive much? Nobody said American art was bad. They can both be good. You can like pizza and burgers. Someone can be amazing at making a burger and that doesn’t have to discount your love of pizza.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"They didn't let him finish because he took 6 years to not finish a video game. They specifically put out Ground Zeroes to bide time, because he was over two years behind deadlines. At a certain point, they had invested hundreds of millions of dollars and had to put their foot down.

Konami is a shitty publisher in almost every way, but it's 100% Kojima's fault for MGSV"
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Ahh, I misread your message initially as 'I don't really care about his artwork, but his pieces...' and was very confused. Makes sense now. Thanks!"
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Since when does anyone care what ign thinks? It has a meta critic score of 85 after 70+ reviews. That's damn good. Not to mention I wasn't including Death Stranding in my statement, seeing as it's not even out yet. But if you think someone having a different opinion than you makes them a blind fanboy, then you're an exceptionally obtuse person whose opinion holds about as much water as a sieve."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,What game are you referring to?
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Which MGS game that he made wasn't good?
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"I think it was for [this ninja star variant of the watch](http://www.hypeblaze.com/2018/04/01/the-grand-seiko-watch-designed-especially-for-ninjas/) which absolutely fits the character.

EDIT: Thanks to u/MuhamedBesic for pointing out that this was an April fool's joke, although the design is still legit and done by him."

dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Which is still unlikely to be (hypothetically) true.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"He wouldn't have this artstyle if he was just starting. The way he paints shows that he have a deep understanding of anatomy which makes me think that obviously he could draw/paint in a different style if he needs to.
Also, he is more of a character designer. Go look for a guy called Anthony Jones, his art looks all over the place and is as stylish as Shinkawa paints and he already worked for companies like Blizzard in Warcraft games as a character designer and many high profile movies."

Its final lesson is carved deep in my psyche: that this world, and all of its people, are diseased. Free will is a myth. Religion is a joke. We are all pawns, controlled by something greater: Memes, the DNA of the soul. They shape our will. They are the culture. They are everything we pass on. Expose someone to anger long enough, they will learn to hate. They become a carrier. Envy, greed, despair: all memes, all passed on. You can't fight nature, Jack. Wind blows, rain falls, and the strong prey upon the weak. Sam tells me you see your weapon as a ""tool"": something that saves lives, a means of justice. Now, there's a pretty meme! Exquisite!

dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Huh. Agree to disagree I guess. I played the entire singleplayer campaign without updating or downloading any additional content. Seemed like a pretty complete experience to me.
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"They're much different and not as narratively enticing, but they're pretty fun games. If that's his floor then that's not too shabby. For a PSP game, Peace Walker is pretty deep."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"Peacewalker was far and away the best game on psp, and mgs5 was a clinic in open world stealth mechanics, and I loved the depth of the base building and weapon and gadget reasearch. So much fun unlocking crazy shit like the wormhole Fulton and trying it out for the first time, Picod blasting twisted sister the whole time... Magical. 

The story in 5 was an incomprehensible mess and an undeniable letdown, I'll give you that. But the gameplay itself was so much fun I couldn't put it down. And at the end of the day, that's the most important thing about a game, *in my humble opinion:* gameplay.

To each their own of course, if you didn't like them then you didn't like them, simple as that."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"I agree never played 5.  It looked fun but without the backbone that made the franchise.  I also agree the man is most definitely a narcissist.  But recognize praise where it is due.  MG1 MG2 MGS MGS2 MGS3 MGS4  all wonderful games in their own.  He went in different direction with some of them but the character building, stories, and relationships throughout were primo.  To say only a few, is being disingenous

I aslo agree death stranding is not going to be of the same calibre."

dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,"I never said that he doesn't deserve praise. He's gotten lots, and quite a bit has been deserved. A lot of it has gone to his head, though, and the result has been long winded, narcissistic wet dreams in video game form, that just aren't fun."
dqs8mk,2019-11-02,2019-11-03,Oh wow. Didn't notice the date it was posted. Thanks for pointing that out.

18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"If I had to guess, the trailer was a test for a new machine learning driven speech and facial animation system. 

The sentence they were saying (""The hungry purple dinosaur ate the kind, zingy fox, the jabbering crab, and the mad whale and started vending and quacking."") contains all the phonemones in English, which is something you would want to test a new system like this with, and they showed the models reading the same sentence with different emotional affects.

Normally you'd have to voice and motion capture and then hand tweak/animate this kind of performance, but imagine if you could give an NPC dialogue lines from a script and some general emotional direction, and have something of this quality rendered out in seconds or maybe even in real time. 

Imagine having millions of possible NPC conversation lines instead of thousands, performance consistent with NPC physical state (injured, exhausted, sleepy, etc) or emotional state (angry, sad, happy, sarcastic, terrified, etc). 

Imagine localizations with spoken lines and correct facial animations in every language.

The reference to Microsoft's cloud computing makes total sense if they're referring to being able to use Azure Compute for training and running the animation system. 

Same reason OpenAI is using Azure systems for ChatGPT, same reason Flight Simulator does it for generating their Earth map. Just taken to the next step."

I have a theory it’s going to be DRASTICALLY different from the first. DS1 was the “rope/connection” game… DS2 will be the “stick/division” game."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,How exactly does the game look cool so far?
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I liked metal gear but really have lost interest in anything he is making since. Just my opinion
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-09,That's a Kojima ass trailer of ever I saw one. I'm all in.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-09,But will it have cringy product placement and awkward showers will fully clothed side characters
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-09,"I wish he would pack it in with this obnoxious shit and just tell us what the fucking game is going to be like.

If you want to make films go and make films."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-09,Well guess what. OD is Online deathstranding
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Oh they're using Metahuman? I'm excited to see it in action. This teaser didn't really have much substance, but it's a fucking Kojima and Jordan Peele game, those fellas don't really miss, I'm hyped."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I swear people see absolutely anything at all with a kojima name on it and automatically call it good with no actual reason or understanding.

It's been close to 20 years since he's had that sort of acclaim."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Will it be as pretentious and boring though
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Looks so cool? It was three people talking to the camera, it looked like a community college student film."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,What game? Idk about your standards but a bunch of floating heads spewing what sounds like ai generated nonsense at me isn't a game
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Goddamn Kojima is overrated. how does this look good? its just 3 heads, at least wait for gameplay lmao"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I don’t know if we can say “looks so cool” when we haven’t seen anything yet.  I’ll keep an eye on it as dev continues, but I can’t say Death Stranding left a good impression."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"The reflection in that woman’s eyes was crazy. That game looks scary as hell

Edit: why am I getting downvoted lmao"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,When Jordan Peele came out I was so pumped. I can't wait to see what they are dreaming up.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Okay but did anybody notice they walked out of a PT door? I hope this is what could have been.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,are you sure it's going to be a game?
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Too bad it’s a Xbox exclusive
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I’m also definitely HYPED for Death Stranding 2.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Kojima could shit on a plate and people would be calling it the greatest thing of all time
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Hope he makes a good game this time. Death standing was probably the most boring game I have played in many years. I could only play it for like maybe 5 hours.

The gameplay is just... So boring.

The story is kinda cool but the characters themselves aren't very interesting. More just strange and I don't wanna interact with them lol. I can remember a lot of MGS bad guys but don't really remember any of the death stranding characters."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Looks like pretentious bullshit to me but that's what Hideo Kojima fans seems to like so *shrug*
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,This screenshot is incredible
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I didn't even realize that it isn't footage of real people at first...also the ""For all players"" at the end makes me think that it is definitely not a console exclusive."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I understand you love Kojima but what exactly looks cool in this trailer? 🙃
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"No one rides dicks harder than Kojima fans. 

&#x200B;

This is the first ""Floating Head Game"""
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"While I think Kojima is way overrated, it is funny seeing his fans hype up every bullshit with a defense of ""you just don't get it"". And as long as his games sell it's a win win situation."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Unpopular Opinion:

Hideo Kojima is the most overrated game designer in the world. 

The man is basically the living embodiment of JP from Grandma's Boy. 

Each new game he makes ends up being further removed from reality than the one before it, and requires more and more exposition to comprehend what the hell is going on. 

Eventually, I can imagine Kojima making a ""game"" where its you just staring a CGI version of Kojima, while he exposition dumps on your for 20 hours straight."

18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Oh yeah, Death Stranding. The game that WON'T EVER COME OFF MY PS5. Wow, can't wait for another Kojima virus, I mean game."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,It's going to be a nonsensical incoherent mess that Kojima fans praise for the amazing storytelling. I bet it'll have fun gameplay though.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,what looks so cool about it? they lit showed nothing
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Well shit, I just sold my series s. Guess I will buy a series x."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"""Looks so cool"" 
They showed absolutely nothing 
Death stranding was the only game I didn't like from Kojima I fear he's lost his way creatively"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Not the Kojima trailer I was expecting, but what a wonderful surprise! Now I have this and the next Death Stranding to look forward to!"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I hated Death Stranding. Fight me!
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"“So happy Kojima is doing a non-Death Stranding game.”

Motherfuck the guy only did one Death Stranding game and didn’t even promise a sequel."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Horror game with a two-letter title from Hideo Kojima? Jordan Peele is on board? ""Other legends"" as well. Now, what the hell are they cookin' out here?"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I am still salty about the canceled Kojima Silent Hill game
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Is it really a non Death Stranding game?  Because they didn't show any gameplay, so for all we know it's just another walking simulator with a different name."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Ya. It looks alright. I don't know what the fuck it's meant to represent but uh. You go Kojima.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Yeah, you literally know nothing about this game yet."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"This ‘trailer’ is literally just the facial mocap, you can literally see the lights they use in the actors eyes."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"what about it looks cool? we only have a couple of faces mumbling shit and screaming. i like most kojima games, but his game announcements are shit."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"more incomprehensible, overrated, bollocks"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"So...the actors getting their faces scanned with some weird effect to the eyes...

10/10 best games best game."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Looks like nothing, lmao. What are you excited for specifically?"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I'm glad I don't buy into the Kojima fandom.   Death Stranding is a forgettable game that imo is not an art piece but rather just a boring game.

Here we go again."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Kojima is overrated
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Kojima:

18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I just hope it has actual gameplay unlike death stranding where it all felt like a filler to the story
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,rtx skibidi toilet trailer looks great!
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I was having a good time watching the show then I opened Reddit. Lol. I really need to get off this platform.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Ehh… I don’t know about it.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Yet another overhyped bs that will be talked about for several years just because it's Kojima.

&#x200B;

how many people are talking about death stranding again?"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Real actors, scanned to a T with extreme detail...says its kinda a game but not really. Just make a fucking movie then. Like where is the artistry in these games if you are going to scan everything and ONLY celebrities."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I hate horror games why everyone releases games like that. Where is the fun spectacle and the engaging uplifting stories. Also fuck jump scares!
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Why is Kojima a big deal? He hasn’t made anything special in..a very very very long time
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I'm just going to go ahead and say it. It's highly likely thus game will be like Death Stranding. Like kojima said, its a blend between movie and a video game"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"With Jordan Peele and others too.

This is going to be epic."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Metal Gear was awesome but people crowned Death Stranding before gameplay was shown and that game was a slog. 

Lets calm our tit"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,It looked terrible tbh.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I don’t really trust anything from Kojima after MGS… Death Stranding was boring af and this game looks to be the same. Just stick to what you’re good at man
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I get Hideo Kojima is really respected, but why did he get like 10 minutes of the game awards with a single trailer that showed nothing when entire groups of awards, the supposed purpose of the show, are glossed over in seconds. Like he hasn’t released a great game since 2015 (Death Stranding was fine at best). I just wished they actually focused on the awards more"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"This looks anti-cool. And I’m going to say something that might get me down voted to hell and back. 

I think when kojima was put into situations that the hardware limited him he made amazing games. But now that there really aren’t technical limits and he can do whatever he wants his stuff is kind of weird, not in a good way though."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Kojima is god!
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Can't wait  for another overhyped Kojima game
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"He even chuckled when he said ""it is a game"", suggesting that at this present moment it's barely anything."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Man these xbox fans will eat up a face shot and say, ""Looks cool, can't wait"" lmao"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Kojima being with Xbox just doesn’t sit right considering the history
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,This dude is such an overrated dev. I have zero hype that anything he creates will be fun to play.

18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I’m always down for a weird Kojima game but as soon as Jordan Peele walked out I was way interested!

I’m also curious who the other secret collaborators are, my wild guess is possibly Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross given that Kojima came out to NIN.
NIN is also just great entry music so it might mean nothing. But I would be even more interested to hear they’re doing the music."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,lol how did we go from “its great that Kojima is doing a non-MGS game!!”  to “its great that Kojima is doing a non-Death Stranding game!!!” after one game?
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Sometimes I think Kojima makes weird trailers as writing prompts for the internet - there is no game. Yet.  

How else do we get a Fedex man who fights otherworldly creatures with his pee and pod baby?"

18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Always excited for anything with his name attached. Let’s see how weird this one gets haha.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Thought this was r/Gamingcirclejerk for a minute.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Yeah at this point I will take a look when its out. Death Stranding while I don't think it was awful just didn't hit with me and I have no idea if this will hit with me either until it comes out.  I like his vision but I don't know if I like his ""uncensored"" way of making games or telling a story."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"""Looks so cool""?

I love Kojima, but this was a whole bunch of absolute **nothing**. And now that the game was been revealed to be some sort of game/movie/Cloud based shit, my interest in whatever the hell this is dropped to zero."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I am ready to never hear about this guy again. He is way over hyped. I have no clue why he keeps getting funding and attention
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Collaboration with Jordan Peele? Thats unfortunate. Not a fan of his movies at all. 

I enjoy The Quarry and Until Dawn but not super hyped for an interactive movie type game either tbh. I'd rather a game game."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"This was the worst trailer from last night. No gameplay. No visuals of what the game might even look like. Just people spouting a cryptic phrase between names of actors. 

I truly don't understand what people see in Kojima."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Kojima's track record outside of Konami has been extremely disappointing. Not sure what people still see in this guy...
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Can someone explain to me why everyone dick rides Kojima so hard cause I legitimately don't understand
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Kojima dick riding has been devastating to the game awards
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I don't understand where all of this Kojima hate has come from. I wonder how many people in this thread were even around when MGS2 and 3 set the gaming world on fire.

Personally, if I see Kojima, I'm sold. He's up there with Christopher Nolan in terms of making something that isn't dumbed down to the lowest common denominator. You might have to actually think. It's no wonder all of these esteemed actors and directors and creatives are lining up to work with him."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,“Looks cool” not a game. We saw 3 people on a screen scream about elephants. And the man who makes race movies about black people having a hard time is the co writer
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Yeah this is not a game. This is a man with an overinflated ego, who is still mad he never became a filmmaker but at the same time has the adoration of an entire industry he doesn't want to be a part of, going through a midlife crisis where he is allowed to make whatever project he wants to make. You're seeing the result of that, and you've been seeing it since Death Stranding. It's only going to get worse."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Is that the deceased german actor Udo Kier?

In case it wasn't clear. I'm just quoting some angry Sony fanboys right now."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Nah i think it's going to fall apart. Expecting Kojima to make a comprehensible game in 2024 is even less likely than a good Platinum Games MGRR sequel. Hell, i would expect konami to make a remake this same year that people like way more. 

The reason is that judging by this trailer alone i do not think kojima has learnt anything from the reception to death stranding."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Just wish he could use his skills to make a game that isn’t ruined with the weird ass writing. Dude can’t even do a military game without some stupid sci fi nonsense

If you watched this trailer and felt excited, you are an idiot."

18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I dunno. It’s faces. It’s a movie. It’s maybe a game? Not hyped for it but I’m sure it will be pretty neat.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Is that Udo Kier?
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Has anyone taken the eyes, zoomed in and enhanced the reflections yet?

You can clearly see that there's stuff going on in their eyes, like door opening and figures walking around."

18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Is it me or Kojima should make movies if he wants to make movies so much? I mean he can make games but I want to play games, not movies.

Let's hope this game has more game mechanics than Death Stranding"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I don't expect much tbh. Isn't this the Microsoft exclusive side project they are doing?
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Just more celebrities to prop up a boring game.. yawn… maybe try making a game that isn’t pretentious as hell… downvote me to hell but it’s the truth
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I guess. He’s become such a hack.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,A half naked man already leaked some of the early gameplay a year ago or so
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Got immediately turned off when they said a new form of media and kinda like a movie, I'm only interested in games I can play and control with a controller, not another MGS4. We'll see how it turns out but if it's not a game in a traditional sense then I'm not interested."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I can see nose hairs!!!
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Meh, I gave up on Kojima games after Death Stranding. The story was vague, the gameplay repetitive, and I ended up quitting halfway through because it was a slog. 


I don't understand why this guy is so revered."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,jordan and kojima don't speak same language apparently so i'm just here imagining how annoying it must be to develop a game together.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"What looks cool? Hearing everyone suck off Kojima for 10 mins and then they show CGI faces saying a sentence? 

&#x200B;

Kojima is too damn pretentious for his own good imo and this little "" preview "" showed nothing."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Death Stranding was also looking cool at first.

Then we got cargo simulator."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Did I miss something? What looks so cool? I only saw hovering faces.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,They literally didn't show anything. Lets hope for a good game
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Ok, honestly… I thought it was real"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I will not buy another Kojima game I think lol. Loved MGS up until Snake Eater and I don’t want to talk about DS. I just don’t think his storytelling is for me anymore.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Homie looks like locke from lost
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,You didn't like death stranding?
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,GOAT 🐐
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Why do I keep thinking that's an old Gerald Butler?
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Looks like it will flop
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,He is doing both
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Metahuman is good enough for anyone to pull this off in a few days. Everything that was impressive about this was done by epic games. 
Also side note, I've grown quite tired of narratives doing this thing where they reveal a piece of information after it is relevant for the first time, so you can go back and go ""aaaah, so that's what that meant in the beginning"". Revealing information that changes your understanding of a situation can be great, but not if the previous understanding was ""senseless mumbo jumbo"". In that case, reveal the necessary information to make sense of the narrative beforehand."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Still might be a strand type
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Is it OD as in both eyes?
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Is that Udo Kier? That would be awesome. He played Yuri in Red Alert 2.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,">Jordan Peele

No thank you."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"An Xbox exclusive Kojima game?! : 🫡
With Jordan Peele: 😞"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Finally. A horror Kojima Game. I've been waiting some something like this for years
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,who is this ugly white man
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Wait , what did I miss ?

He announce a new project ?"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Looks like a man shriveled up in the sun then covered up in varnish so that he can no longer move, but stare blankly forward with his mouth slightly open while he rots inside the thick layer of glistening varnish."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,To me this looks like Kojima’s take on something like Detroit become human. Only one of the characters is 100% human (the synthetic eyes on the others). Have absolutely no clue beyond that what we’re getting but as a long time Kojima fan I’m excited none the less
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Looks like the governor of NJ

https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AP\_18171046280926.jpg"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I honestly thought the gameplay would be seeing whatever happens through the reflection of their eyes. That's some Kojima juice right there.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,That's Yuri from Red Alert 2.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Kojima making a horror game is all I needed to hear. They didn’t have to show shit and they didn’t for me to excited. He changed horror games for 10 years when he put out PT
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,lol! I thought this trailer was for a play at a theatre. Looks cool! LOL!
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I don't understand who plays these games, or how he gets the funding to make them."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,A tech demo as a trailer? Snooze fest
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Death stranding was literally one of the most boring games I have ever played
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,What exactly looks so cool about this? The whole thing was just people’s faces and literally nothing else is known about the game aside from Kojima saying it’s going to be some kind of interactive movie.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Looks cool? Where did you look bro
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Is that John Locke? From Lost?
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"It's a cloud movie ""game"" lol

Keep your expectations in checkkkkk"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"honestly, even as someone who doesnt feel all too motivated to play any of his work due to differing tastes, im always incredibly interested in whatever this man's cooking. very curious to see where it goes, especially with jordan peele working on it"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,He said it would involve cloud gaming technology with the main focus on immersion. I am excited to see what he will try. Maybe a game that involves an ARG powered by a cloud base platform where your everyday devices influence gameplay changes and outcomes? Sounds like a very Kojima thing to do.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I really don’t understand what is so incredible about this to care so much it’s just another weird trailer from Kojima an incredibly overrated game Director
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,It’s literally just footage of actors doing face capture calibration. What did you think this was? How can you say something “looks cool” when you’ve seen literally nothing from it 😂
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I'm sure it won't but I hope it has the option for multiplayer.

Edit: typos"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I keep hoping to like a Kojima game so I can understand the hype.... to this day the number of games from Kojima that I think are good is ZERO.

Fingers crossed for this one."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"W-wait is that Udo Kier? Ya know, that mind control guy from RA2?"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I weep for their poor lost souls.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,What “looks so cool” to you? Graphics? That’s the only thing I saw.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Did we watch the same trailer? I didn't learn jack shit from this trailer how do I know if it's cool
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I wouldn't be surprised if people brigade the game for being ""woke"" since Hunter Schafer appears to be staring in it and she's a trans actress."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Gunna be hilarious is kojima thinks he’s inventing the interactive fiction genre
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,What part looked cool to you?
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,What does it look cool? Graphics? I guess but it tells me nothing about the game.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Oh man, they showed an image of a face!!!!! GoTY right hear ladies and gentlemen!!!!!"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Everyone blew up death stranding like this too and that game wasn’t even that great lol.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,This post is brought to you by our proud sponsor “monster” now with triple the caffeine!
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"It looks nothing, but it's interesting collab with great horror maker Jordan Peele"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Can't wait to get OD
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Gerard Butler?
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Looks cool? What looks cool?
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I’m more interested in Jordan Peele’s involvement than it being another Kojima game wherein nothing makes sense to anyone but Kojima. Same for the three announced cast members.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,So is he like pretty much done with death stranding 2 and working on a different thing?
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,The first overdose-type game fr
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,It was hilarious to see Udo Kier reading his lines from the cue cards in the background.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-09,God it's gonna be funny watching the Kojima stans gaslight themselves into thinking buying an Xbox was worth it to watch some weird Bandersnatch impression
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-09,"They show Udo Kier, that’s enough"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-09,But where was Death Stranding 2?
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-09,Looks realistic
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-09,This game is gonna be a master piece
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-09,"""Looks cool""

Literally just showed some faces. Nvidia does it all the time. 

&#x200B;

I am a huge kojima fan, but sometimes this shits a bit silly."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-09,That's Udo Kier and that alone brings me joy. Kojima? Yes plz.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-09,🖕🏿💩🤡
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-11,"Vapid people commenting ""nothing happened"" 🤡"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-12,Open Door
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2024-01-04,"Ngl I feel the same way, but that’s more because of how every time this guy’s been cryptic and I don’t understand ANYTHING of what’s going on, the game blows me away."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Classic gamer moment. Shows nothing, WOW SO COOL"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,That's how you know it's a Kojima game
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Literally ten minutes on stage fawning over Kojima showing nothing but award winners are shooed of the stage after 30 seconds

Priorities"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,It's literally an unfinished model of an actor with animations.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,All is see is an angry Udo Kier.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Tech demo with pretty graphics and no gameplay shows up:  


Gamers**: wow, so cool! PREORDER!**"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Worshiping Kojima aint just a meme
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"He showed Jack and shit, plus Jack skipped the town."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Kojima dick riding never ends
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Exactly. I think this will be cool, but will basically not even be considered what we know as a “videogame”. The concept *seems* interesting, but people blowing their top saying it’ll be a great *videogame* need to slow down. We don’t even know exactly what it is yet."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,These idiots are so brainwashed. What the hell looks so cool about what was shown?
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Why have gamers become like this... Reddit has become a cesspool of cucks
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Typical Kojima
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Because Kojima is a bit of a hack but gamers don't care.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-14,">literally shown jack SHIT

If I ever got to kojima's level I'd make a game with a protagonist called Jack and I'd mocap an entire scene of the guy squatting over your comment and shitting on it.

Ya know, for the lolz."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Ain't no one ride harder than Kojima fans.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Thank god top comment is sanity. Mfer is literally hyping himself up over a screenshot. Jesus christ.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"And that's what I like, I'm tired of seeing the whole fucking game from the trailers."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,[deleted]
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Still looks cool
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Lol I mean the render looks amazing. The tone was cool.  Yes it’s just a clip. Mother fuckers in a gaming sub getting upset gamers are excited for a Kojima game. Lol. Ok
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Well if you're beyond clueless to who he is or what he's doing, yeah sure any idiot will think this is jack shit."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"there were some leaked videos and pics like a year or so ago. Third person game, looks like silent hill. Looks very promising"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,It has great potential!
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Pretty much every kojima teaser lol.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"This was my immediate thought as well. 😂 

They showed some mfs saying a few things and a door opening."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"The concept he showed was very interesting, we have never seen anything like it advertising wise"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"It's a kojima game, his cult don't need to know anything about it, understand it or for it to even be good, they'll still say it's the best thing ever no matter what he churns out."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"yes, but I'm not even joking the premise is actually interesting if it delivers."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,😄 do you remember the trailer for mgs2 it was crazy. I got so hyped and started the game which was finished by my younger brother because I couldn't get around doing pull-ups on a railing.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,That's what people said when elden ring got announced.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,For real. I love Kojima games but the description of it’s a movie but also a game makes me nervous.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"this is quite literally the gamers paradox.  the less you know about a game, the more hype it is."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Yeah, our brains try to fill in the gaps of what it might be which inevitably leads to some disappointment when we see the game isn't what we expected."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"They showed you a human-bulldog hybrid, ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?!"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"""a non-Death Stranding game"". You mean any game???"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-09,From the [leak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6q_OsaftT04&ab_channel=BeyondTheHype) a year ago it seems like an interactive movie on mobile. Also mind the nipple jumpscare at the end.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-10,The 3d-scanned facial animations looked cool at first but definitely nothing impressive was shown.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Like giving?
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I swear his fans are like a cult
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,First skibidi type game
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Him saying he is going to revolutionize the stranding genre was amazing.  This man is a gift and you will cherish him.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,It's just death stranding but instead of boxes it's Gigantic disembodied heads that talk shit to you non-stop.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I think that’s part of the hype. The less you reveal, the more people speculate and imagine"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"For those unaware, there was leaked footage a year ago. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6q\_OsaftT04"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"An entertainment to surpass Metal Gear…

Wait, that feels familiar."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Anything Kojima related everyone loses their minds and think it's a gift from gods
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,The door was literally the PT door btw.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,For real the meat riding is crazy
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I work with metahuman , this is nothing more than a calibration session for voice and facial capture. There's no artistic spin here aside from the small reflection in her eye at the end."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I think Konami kept him centred. His new stuff is just weird at this point.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,heavy rain did that before it was cool
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I'm not expecting anything more than Kojima's usual insanity and a good horror experience. But that's certainly enough to get excited about. Someone who gets free liberty to make weird things and has the clout/connections to bring in a lot of very capable people is exciting. We only know of Peele, but he mentioned a whole team he couldn't reveal yet. We know he worked with del Toro and Junji Ito on Silent Hills, wouldn't be surprised to see them or similar people involved just because it's Kojima."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,but he made metal gear solid.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"lmao exactly. So thankful its not D Stranding, but this is certainly nothing worthy of my hype"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I mean, talking heads were popular as far back as the 80s."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,This guy is so full of himself artistically. Been a hack since day one but somehow has people convinced he's the second coming. It's mind boggling.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,being friends with guillermo del toro has gone to kojimas head
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"If it’s anything like Death Stranding, it’s gonna suck. Kojima needs to make a bond game and stick to what he’s good at. Experimental gaming ain’t it."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Well at least it can't be any worse than Walking Simulater
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I mean, the graphics are really good. It’s a collab with Jordan Peele. OD is a play on PT. Horror by Kojima.  “Not a game. Not a movie”. This is exciting stuff if you take it all in and realize this is going to be an amazing game by an amazing developer."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Toss a ball in their mouths to win a prize
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,But it's *Kojima*
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Pretty sure it's CG. The fact that you can't tell is pretty evolutionary.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Is he making a Skibidi Toilet game?
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Three talking heads speaking gibberish. Not sure why I expected anything else from Kojima.

I Need Scissors 61: The Game(??)"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Good lord, let people like things"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Is it immersive though? I couldn't tell from the presentation.

18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I think that was the point.  Horror game and we know he can do horror cuz of PT.  The whole bring was existing for me to see. I can’t wait for a proper trailer though.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Yeah, that clip was annoying af to me"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"We didn't need it, but Geoff did. That was the most excited he'd been all night. Kojima is his Viagra."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"No, and Geoff really needs to stop using event time to fanboy over Kojima. He's done this way too many times."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"You are a worm through time. 

The thunder song distorts you. 

Happiness comes. 

White pearls, but yellow and red in the eye. 

Through a mirror, inverted is made right. 

Leave your insides by the door. 

Push the fingers through the surface into the wet. 

You’ve always been the new you. 

You want this to be true. 

We stand around you while you dream. 

You can almost hear our words but you forget. 

This happens more and more now. 

You gave us the permission in your regulations. 

We wait in the stains. 

The word that describes this is redacted. 

Repeat the word. 

The name of the sound. 

It resonates in your house. 

After the song, time for applause. 

We build you till nothing remains. 

The egg cracks and the truth will emerge out of you. 

You are home. 

You remind us of home. 

You’ve taken your boss with your boss with you. 

All hair must be eaten. 

Under the conceptual reality behind this reality you must want these waves to drag you away. 

After the song, time for applause. 

This cliché is death out of time, breaking the first the second the third the fourth wall, the fifth wall, floor; no floor: you fall! 

How do you say “insane”? 

Hurts to be happy. 

An earworm is a tune you can’t stop humming in a dream: “baby baby baby yeah”. 

Just plastic. 

So, safe and nothing to worry about. 

Ha ha, funny. 

The last egg breaks now. 

The hole in your room is a hole in you. 

You came and we let you in through the hole in you. 

You have always been here, the only child. 

A copy of a copy of a copy. 

Orange peel. 

The picture is you holding the picture. 

When you hear this you will know you’re in new you. 

You want to listen. 

You want to dream. 

You want to smile. 

You want to hurt. 

You don’t want to be."

18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,It will be a smoking crater.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Intriguenly disturbed is the best kind of disturbed
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Just that scream in the trailer spooked me lol
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-09,"Wait, isn’t the phrase “the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog” missing S and V? Or do you included the rest of the sentence after the quotes?"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,The cloudbase gaming makes me not as excited though
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,For sure. He also mentioned the cloud technology and being like a video game movie where everyone gets a unique experience. I’m thinking that it’s going to be a wide open horror thriller with a cloud based generative AI that changes the game and even the voice acting to respond to what you do.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Yup! I cannot wait.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Yes!
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"They said it was an interactive movie in a sense, they basically said it's not fully a game. You can find [leaked footage from a year ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6q_OsaftT04) however."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I kind of got the vibe that it'll be like Heavy Rain but with some weird shit
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Similarly to Death Stranding, people won’t even know what the game was after completing it."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"When they asked Kojima what kind of game it was, he barely even clarified if it was even a game."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I’m honestly surprised Sony didn’t acquire kojimas studio during the development of death stranding, I feel like everyone thought that was gonna happen for a while there.

But hey, if working with different publishers helps him make a bunch of different experiences, it should be interesting to see and probably more beneficial for everyone"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Based on the leaked footage, it looks like it will be/support a mobile screen experience. That must be where the cloud tech is coming into play as well. Either that or it is one of those games that supports touch specific controls when streaming to a phone on xCloud the way a few games currently do."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Hellblade 2 is probably a horror game.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Aww is this game gonna be an Xbox exclusive?
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Detroit Become Human + Silent Hill.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"They arent real, these are definitely 3d models motion captured.

 You can see it pretty well in the old man, and when the girl screams- around yhe mouth"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Yes! That’s what I couldn’t believe either. These are renders and just seeing that was cool. But everything else surrounding it: he’s doing horror again, Peele is involved, and this will be some kind of move / game mashup.   Apparently people get upset when you get exiled for a new game in a gaming sub lol.  But I can’t wait to see more."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Haha nice. Splitting hairs really
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I was thinking the same thing and I you combine that with the description on the game's website that talks about testing the players fear threshold it may be hinting to a very personal horror experience
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08, Yup I love DS1.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,OP thought he could farm karma by ass-licking Kojima. Top comment saw right through it
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Lmao yeah, same question."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Yeah this was a nothing burger. Plus with ds2 this is probably years off. Mf is announcing shit when his other game doesn’t even have a release date.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Probably because the game doesn’t even have gameplay to show. This is a teaser not really a trailer.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I’m just waiting for everyone to decipher what was reflected in those characters eyes lol
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"It's probably still in the very early stages of development. It was just a 60 second clip to remind people that it's in the works.

They still have DS2 to take care of before this one."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Amen.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I mean this wasn’t a trailer it was just a teaser / a clip to supplement the announcement. And it’s working Heyder everyone’s talking about it now. But I definitely can’t wait for a proper trailer and to hear more.  I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"It’s not just a game, it’s not a movie, it’s  new type of media we have never experienced before"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Really? Wow cool. Any idea what it could be?
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"The only people who think that’s “controversial” are Kojima fanboys. 

After seeing his recent work I think I’m actually on Konamis side, knowing they probably saw the batshit crazy stuff he wanted to do coupled with him just lighting their money on fire."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I just mean the 2 he did back to back was enough for me. Was looking forward to a new game, new genre, something else.  And we got it."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Yeah that’s my sentiment exactly.  I don’t even care about the clip that much it’s just the announcement of it all.  The render does look nutty though.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Exactly how I felt.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,This sub doesn’t disappoint that’s for sure.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Tbf it is kojima. Even his worst games (like MGS4 is still great)
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,All kojima games are interactive movies though lol. Whatre you talking about hard pass.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Unreal Engine pretty sure is what they confirmed
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,They did that with Death Stranding we got some cool  cgi video trailers with zero gameplay and people lost their mind how good this looked and I sat here thinking huh? But theres no gameplay? Just a dead whale on a beach?
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I mean I would argue MGSV (while one of my least favorite Metal Gear games) is widely regarded as one of the best stealth shooters out there (at the very least mechanically) and that was only in 2015.

While I don’t think people should jump the gun and call the game good before it’s even out simply because Kojima is behind it, I 100% understand people being intrigued/excited for it because he’s making it. Say what you will but the guy is not afraid of putting out something different. MGS2 and Death Stranding are good examples of that. Even if you end up not liking the game, it’s cool to see developers try something new"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I thought death stranding was great.

super pretentious obviously but it had some cool concepts and I thought the entire thing was really funny. I could play the gameplay loop for hours as well. was kind of disappointed there wasn't more."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Probably. That’s his MO.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,You know all those rich people looking at a painting of a tiny black square on a white background that costs 2 billion dollars and they're calling it a masterpiece while the artist is laughing at them stoned out of his mind? You're seeing the gaming equivalent of that.

18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,">I can’t say Death Stranding left a good impression

Have you actually played it? Or have you only watched/read reviews?"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I agree. This teaser / clip is genuinely quite creepy. Excited to see what it's about. Ignore downvotes, people just disagreeing I guess."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Graphics looked amazing. Even that small clip was cool to see.  Not sure why the downvotes. People don’t like it when others are excited… for a game…. In a gaming sub lol .
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Who cares? Better than sony, at least you can play on PC"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,They **need** exclusives to save this generation
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Okay kacap.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,https://youtu.be/Yi-5xTlWiiM?si=k5xQiaHwgz9y9Fgg trailer
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Oh man you gotta see the trailer itself
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,The render.  The tone. The fact he’s making a horror game. And that Jordan Peele is involved. And that they said it’s not a game or A movie but something else.  There’s a handful of artist and game developers and directors I get excited about when they release something. He’s one of them.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I know, right!? “Looks so cool.” The fuck, what? CGI MOCAP heads? We didn’t see shit. Get ready for a 48 minute intro cutscene that insists upon itself more than the Godfather while attempting to shovel a mountain of exposition down your throat."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Obviously you are biased and you have some hate against Kojima for some reason. What has been bullshit that people have defended.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I totally agree, that is Definitely unpopular."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Did you just call that man an award?
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,what the fuck is a kojima?
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I’m a huge Kojima fan and didn’t like death standing. So there’s not a ton of bias - if it’s good it’s good if it sucks, we wait for his next game."

18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"When you give the world one of the best games, the best series, the best characters in all of gaming, you can do whatever you want.  He’s a consummate creative and his game releases are events in and of itself.  Who else can say the same?"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"My opinion on him has cooled some over the years, but there are a few things I will always count on when he makes a project.

He is an auteur who is incredibly passionate about the projects he makes, even if towards the end of Metal Gear Solid he himself didn’t want to make them anymore.  The projects he makes are absolutely wild narrative rides, have such an absurd attention to detail on what can be done in them, and are some of the most unique experiences in gaming even to this day.

Death Stranding didn’t quite hit my interest enough to pay for it at full price, and while I’m still working on things to be cleared from my plate first, it’s something that’s always been prodding me in the back of my mind that I should check out."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I'm with you. Yeah he did most of metal great solid,  then released a very odd game in death stranding. I don't get the hype either.  Hopefully this game is something,  but I'm not expecting anything until 2026 or beyond."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,never even heard of a kojima.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,death stranding was a movie?
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"As a playstation fan, I also think it looks cool. For just a few faces talking, it had a lot of atmosphere."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I knowww, I know.  So weird. I don’t get it.  Maybe they just get first crack at it and eventually it’ll get to PS?   So weird though."

18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Keep hating. All good. This is going over so many people’s heads it’s hilarious.   The announcement is what I’m stoked about. Fucking relax.

18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Kojima speaks and understand English. He just used a translator for public talks.

Us having no fucking idea what the hell was going on"

18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Yea I absolutely hated how because of last year they gave winners literally like 30 seconds and then told them to gtfo. If they kept going, music got louder. Legit rude as hell imo."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,if those were really models of the actors im shocked by graphics quality for the first time in over 10 years
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Wait thats a model?! I thought it was live action!
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,It’s solid snake. He gets older every version. Gonna be lit when he uses cqc with his walker

HOLY FUCK IF SO."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Groovy
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,And Jordan Peele didn't exactly give us any bit of a better idea by gushing about how awesome Kojima is and how the project is unlike anything anyone has seen before.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-14,Ye and Kojima fan boys would call it GOTy and profound
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I'm not a big fan of kojima games myself but let's not pretend they aren't great games with alot of thoughtfulness, care and creativity."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Ok Kojima I'm interested
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Most Kojima fans are just people who genuinely vibe with his weirdness and meme up their loyalty to him because it is funny.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT!
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Can you hide inside the heads?

18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I'm pretty sure he was completely off the rails even when he was making MGS. That said, I really dug death strandings game play loop"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"You're gonna get a lot of hate from the Kojima fan base, but I'm here with you."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I doubt Konami kept him centered. He always had free reign for his MGS games until MGS5 (when the issues with him and Konami started).

It was more to do with what his aspirations were and what he wanted to show. His early MGS games were focused because he wanted to tell a more compact game. As MGS got more popular and he got more renowned, he wanted to express his opinions and viewpoints more and more through his games while also trying to implement different gameplay to his games. The more he became a bigger director the more his games grew wilder"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"We have 100 AAA devs making very safe video games that are meant to appeal to everyone, that’s 99% of the video games that get made anymore.

18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Its kojima doing horror which is hype worthy in and of itself. Then you got the Peele collaboration and cool cryptic trailer. You gotta be ignorant to the sheer talent involved to not understand the hype even if you arnt behind it.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I mean he’s still doing Death Stranding… what are you talking about?
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Death Stranding is sitting at 93% rating. You’re wrong.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,“Not a game” better quickly post this to the gaming sub
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,">It’s a collab with Jordan Peele

18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"It's very obviously a render, the motion is really good but also gives it away. The skin also doesn't stretch exactly as it would in real life (but again, it's an amazing attempt)."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-09,"It's like Geoff is constantly seeking validation and to him Kojima is the ultimate auteur and that if he fanboys over him people will think he's legit and knows what he's on about.  
He reminds me of Nicholas Hoults character in The Menu"

18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Or a weirder Detroit Become Human with how the people are reading the strange purple dinosaur sentence on repeat. Possibly suggesting that they're being trained to mimic humanity?
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"After how things with Konami ended, I think Kojima is happy flying solo and making cool, weird, and experimental things and whoever wants to jump on board to publish is cool with him."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Rumour has it that Sony offered to purchase Kojima Productions, but Kojima wanted to remain independent.

Sony were throwing money at him apparently.

Konami saga probably had a part to play in him wanting to remain independent"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,And hellblade will probably better. Kojima is overrated.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,It's looking like it. Xbox branding all over it
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Console wise yeah but anyone with a pc will be able to play as well since Microsoft considers Xbox more a software platform than hardware at this point.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"It's utilizing Xbox cloud technology and rumours from past few years were that it was gonna be Microsoft exclusive, but it remains to be seen."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Xbox and PC. But yes, he made mention of this project last year that he was working with Xbox. Apparently this title requires Microsoft's cloud infrastructure which is why he has partnered with them.

And while I've rolled my eyes in the past, a lot about Microsoft pushing the whole cloud computing marketing that they have done. I have no doubt really that whatever element of the cloud Kojima is using will be appropriate and suitable for the title. The man is not one to over hype and over promise and then deliver on a compromised version of what he envisioned or stated, unlike say a certain bald british hype man who previously worked at a Microsoft owned studio."

18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Yeah it's a supplementary teaser, but if you compare it to even [Death Stranding's 2016 teaser reveal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2nuHEGhwiw), (which was 3 years before release) its underwhelming. Felt more like a video announcement to highlight the cast, not even the project itself."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I remember folks saying the same thing when the Phillips CDi came out.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"This never means anything when people say it lol. It's a video game, that's media. It's basically an interactive movie, it's already media."

18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Yah that sounded crazy. Some kind of interweaving movie/game interactive movie. Sounds super exciting. Classic Kojima.

It's pretentious gobbly-gluck with a mix of horror, action, and package delivery cobbled together by long-winded cut scenes staring Kojima's movie star buddies.

Oh, and emo Icelandic pop music. 0 replay value."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,The trailer didn't show game graphics. It showed footage of actors speaking in front of a camera. Maybe the downvotes are from people who want games to be games.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I think his storytelling is often bullshit, mixing pseduo philosophy and deep meaning with fart jokes or product placement. It seems he wants to make movies, but every studio tells him ""nope, we're not gonna finance your six hour brainfart that needs a sequel so you can retcon some sense into it.""
And still, I enjoy people buying and praising his games and would never forbid anyone from enjoying them. You do you. :)"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Metal gear isn’t one of the best series its good yes but not THAT good. Also What character? Snake?

18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Because Kojima has established himself. He’s proven himself to be very capable of making great games. A small team does not have the benefit of being known.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I loved it. One of my favourite games ever. *shrug*
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,They nerfed his proposal for a boss battle that required a week to beat.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,MGS was really my niche and there’s nothing left to fill the void. I loved everything about V. Oh well…
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Because I want MGS; nothing even close to it exists anymore.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I'm happy he announced something that is not death stranding.. didnt realize that was such a tough concept to grasp
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,thats unfortunate. game was a pretentious nothing burger.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I personally liked Death Stranding but reviews mean literally nothing, games are subjective and while the kinds of people who go out of their way to review games, or who are so engrained in gaming culture that they are paid to review games might like it, the game did also receive plenty of criticism from a lot ordinary more casual gaming fans who's opinions matter as much as anybody else but who aren't likely to care about posting reviews."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,It's a game. Kojima just loves to blend movies with games and innovate. Will it turn out good or horrible? Can only wait and see.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Really scary how the general public doesn’t seem to know what to look for to tell if something is cgi or not. It’s only gonna get worse.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Yep. I immediately clocked not only that it was a computer render, but that it was made in Metahuman. It's kind of blatantly obvious if you have been exposed to this stuff.

I mean, again, it does look good. But it was more or less a tech demo for a product we've seen, with the content being nothing more than some creepy poems and a scream, giving exactly zero idea what the ""game"" will even be about, should it even be a ""game""."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,You cant criticize! Consooome or shut up!
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I thought it was Louis van Gaal
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Probably gets him a shit load of cash too.

Microsoft and Sony would both love to be advertising their exclusive Kojima game"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Yup. Sony also helped him a lot times and I dont think Kojima would go exclusive unless it something Sony don't really care about. Decima engine helped them greatly for Death Stranding. Making an engine from scratch is freaking expensive and time consuming. Came out with a great product. I really think Kojima has great relationship with Sony but it's like that friend with whom you don't have to hang out all the time but when you do you catch up and have the time of your lives. Xbox right now is desperate for genuinely good and unique games after almost all their failures for the past three years. Kojima can deliver a unique game and Jordan Peele is a fantastic writer, actor, producer etc and whe it comes to thriller/horror he is a gifted man. Xbox can throw money and Kojima needs that for his behaviour of being experimental and independent. I really hope OD is good."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Kojima is just niche. I personally don't enjoy his Death Standing stuff but I love Metal Gear. You either love his games or hate them.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Thanks for the info ☹️
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Who's the British man you speak of?
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,PT. Silent Hills. And DS has horror aspects to it. But mainly those first two.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"People said the same thing when Heavy Rain was first announced too... Turns out, like most of these ""it's more than a game"" situations... It was in fact just a game."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,">I remember folks saying the same thing when the Phillips CDi came out.

You don't think ""Hideo Kojima Presents: Mr. Payback"" is going to be a big deal?"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"He just said it was a new genre, and the result was a truck simulator with some horror and fights against bandits, terrorists, ghosts, lovecraftian tar monsters, and skeleton soldiers revived from the world wars. Also being able to collaborate asynchronously with other players to build infrastructure, mark hazards or points of interest and share tools or materials. And the player's canteen turns rainwater into Monster Energy."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Death stranding was amazing!
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,">Didn’t Kojima spout the same thing when Death Stranding was announced? I know he has earned his status of being a groundbreaker in the gaming industry, but fool me once…

Fool you? What do you mean? He said that Death Stranding is going to be a new video game genre, and he was right. I don't think any game before it had a multiplayer system like the one in Death Stranding. At least, I don't think any game before it *successfully* achieved it, even if some games might have tried. I don't even know how to define it exactly, but it's the only game in the last 20+ years, which made me genuinely *care for* both NPCs and other players. For example, when I look at a seemingly completely different game of Mario Wonder, I see direct inspiration from Death Stranding in how the multiplayer works in it. I can't define it any better, sorry."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"FMV games were interweaving games and movies in the 90s and, for a more modern example, Remedy has been doing it for years and years."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"With Xbox he has access to the studio with the most experience with the Unreal engine, The Coalition (not including Epic Games), the studio already supports all Xbox studios that choose to work with Unreal."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"A *game* from Kojima? Are you sure about that? First of all, it's Kojima. And second, he literally had to clarify he's making a game...kind of. What other game dev do you know that says something like that and people eat it up? 'Don't worry it's a game...kind of'."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Horror? You sure you played it? Where was the horror?
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,It’s not video – it’s clearly 3D scans of the actors lol
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I thought it was at least in engine? Weren’t the heads just floating at the shoulders?
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Eh. I think its perfectly valid to say Death Stranding did a terrible job of dispensing the story in an understandable fashion beat-by-beat (as did MGSV), but the story made sense in the end, ie you could follow the whole thread. But it didn't really make any sense until you got to the very end and a bunch of exposition happened."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Neither does Kojima so it all tracks
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I beat it, and constructed full highways all over the country, setup ski lifts through the mountains, delivered a fucking pizza, and I still do not know what the hell was going on."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Let's be honest, is it really a Kojima game if you understand what's going on? I need to finish my playthrough, but I kind of grasp what's going on with the characters in the story. It's the Death Stranding itself that isn't really clicking outside of ""just because"". I'm sure it'll all be revealed in the final hour long cutscene that Kojima is known for."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Man, isn’t it so weird it sold so successfully?

Isn’t it weird DS2 is happening as well???

**Man, maybe the game itself wasn’t ever the problem????**"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Your ""opinion"" is dogshit lmao."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"It's some of these peoples only opportunity in their lifetime to accept an award like this, you gotta let them soak it in. The indie stuff not being a stage award was ridiculous."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I think it has to be just CG reflections on the eyes. No way that’s video game level graphics. That’s beyond what Hollywood can even do.

If those are real graphics, then holy fuck."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I think his point is that Kojima can reveal what is basically a picture of a toilet and fans will go ape shit over it.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I just find it funny that the zeppelin lizard is responding to the zeppelin oasis and it’s not related to zeppelins at all
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,His last two games were both godawful.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"That’s cool and all, I’m just saying people had their expectations way too high for that game when not much was known about it"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Would that be the sniper in mgs3? Because I would totally play that for a week.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"How do you even make a boss battle that takes an actual week? Can you save, can you pause? Is that longer than the rest of the game?"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,This wasn’t Konami but the other staff (though a good chunk of them did stayed at Konami)
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Would've been amazing. Damn.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I disagree, reviews don’t mean ‘literally nothing’ they are a pretty decent metric to tell whether or not the people that bought the game actually thought it was of quality. Taste is subjective but quality isn’t."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,The rating 93% is because it has a soul
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I have a feeling Kojima keeps doing these 'games' because no studio would trust him to make any movie.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I think its very safe to say it will be good.

Since at least mgs1 Kojima has never made an objectively bad game.all his titles push the hardware they are on, push player expectations, control well (Even if his button mapping isn't the most intuitive at times, particularly in the earlier days) have satisfying gameplay elements. (If your into them) are some of the best looking titles on the hardware That's available, are very bug-free experiences. And have a deep. Thought provoking narrative.

Now, if his work is not to your taste, that's a different discussion entirely subjectively sure, you may not like some or all of his work and there's nothing wrong with that. No one said you had to like everything.

But to outright say its ""bad"" or ""horrible"" putting it in the same pile as mass effect. Andromeda, aliens colonial Marines, Duke Nukem forever, anthem, or mighty No 9 is just downright silly."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Aka a teaser.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-12,"what does fanboying over a game director have to so with ""consoom"" or whatever the fuck you're talking about"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,And that's what's happening today. Kojima cashing in big time.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"> I really hope OD is good.

Same, I'm still hurt at what PT/Silent Hills could have been.

And hearing that Kojima and Peele are working on a horror title has me excited.

I have both ps5 and Xbox, and the Xbox doesn't get used.
...just nothing worth playing on it for me (open to suggestions)

But seeing the brief snippet of OD, it'll definitely be a day 1 purchase/or gamepass, whatever it comes to.

(Edit, Hellblade 2 is looking good)"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"You'll be able to play it on PC too, certainly."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I guess is he's referring to Peter Molyneux, he is known for overhyping his games."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I totally forgot about the PT demo. I don’t think he had anything to do with Silent Hill before that though…a shame that his PT/Silent Hills title was never fully released but I don’t think my man has a completed horror game out yet, ~1 hour demo notwithstanding. I can see the DS horror elements though."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I’m not sure if you’re being sarcastic cuz I’ve seen people say some legit daft stuff about DS like this before

18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"There's a video game called Journey that predates Death Stranding and does something similar. Actually, Dark Souls does something similar too.

I love Death Stranding, for the record."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,">What other game dev do you know that says something like that and people eat it up?

what part of ""people are just excited for a game from hideo kojima, it isn't that deep"" did you not understand? Like isn't it obvious why people are excited for it? Its because they like games from him duh"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Are you sure you can read? 

Like i said, i beat it.

Where was the horror? Did you play it?

C'mon dude."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I agree with you but there’s a lot that gets explained to the player indirectly. Some from the environment but mostly from the emails and interviews. Same with MGSV. A lot of supporting story elements were in the tapes. I preferred the tapes tho as opposed to DS’s emails and interviews
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Which I would argue makes it an awful story.  If I have to stumble through 40+ hours of gameplay going ""Huh...wtf...what did...I...huh?"" only to get 30 minutes of exposition at the end that is basically the plot of the game, it's poorly written."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Bruh how can you get all the way to delivering pizza without figuring things out? That's the bloody *endgame*.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Metal Gear isn't nearly as incomprehensible as the memes make it out to be. Yeah there are twists and turns and sci-fi/pseudoscience elements disguised as supernatural.

MSGV is really the first time the series just does stuff without explanation."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. I didn't know you were so sensitive.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,wrong
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"To be fair, that toilet will probably be relevant to the plot in an absurd way like being the seat that the murderer of the protaganist's whole family, who is secretly the true father of the protaganist and is manipulating the Cold War to help the protaganist save the world, took a shit in and in it contains the tablet of nuclear codes that he swallowed 24 hours prior. It thus becomes the most wanted toilet seat in history with 3 different factions fighting over it."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I hate that this is true, and I hate that I'd be one of them. But we also know that the toilet game would be the best weird as fuck toilet game there is."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,True lol. But he’s definitely earned his reputation.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Because we know it really isn't just a toilet. That's what you get when you build up a reputation over decades of working in the industry. You build a repertoire and people will be intrigued with what you'll offer next. I don't know why pseudo-intellectual redditors try to paint that as a bad thing.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Both are sitting at 9/10 audience reviews. You are clearly in the minority.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Meh, I would say a lot of people had high expectations and those were met/exceeded."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Quality is subjective though, whether or not you think something is good quality depends entirely on your taste and your opinion on what makes something good quality.

Like for example I think Dark Souls is absolutely perfect, one of the most high quality games I've ever played because subjectively it appeals to me.

However someone else might hate the awkward movement/combat or they might find the lack of any obvious direction or some of the convoluted puzzles to be poor quality game design and thus they won't like the game.

Their opinion would matter just as much as mine and just as much as the video game community/video game critics who that kind of game specifically appeals too.

This applies to everything, like I think Rotten Tomatoes is just as poor of a metric as game reviews but look at how often the audience score and critical score completely contradict each other."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I mean these games cost as much to make as big movies if not more in some cases. I think he just loves both mediums and tries his best to get the best of both worlds. It's certainly not for everyone and I am sure this game even more so but I respect him trying to innovate and follow his own vision.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,I'm on PlayStation ☹️
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Ah, I only know fable from him 🫤"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Ya! And I think “OD” is a play on PT. So if it’s even close to that demo I’m exited for it.   It wasn’t just this clip of faces that got me stoked, it’s that he’s returning to the PT days of horror games. And now with next gen tech.  I’m definitely interested to see more and what this really is."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-09,"No, that is stuff in the game."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I don't think he ever talked about a new type of media. It's definitely a new genre tho, where else would it fit?"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"You're right, I can't read. I was hoping no one would notice. Sort of like you're hoping no one notices this wasn't a horror game."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,And to be honest not many people are reading those email notes and etc if it’s more then two paragraphs.. but the way society is today they just like fast pace so let’s just go with one paragraph
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"No argument about the story. But I fell in love with DS for the gameplay. Trotting from pillar to post with a hundredweight of Cargo in your van? Top bombing, mate!"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,That's a you problem. Not everyone requires to be spoon-fed everything. SOME of us can use our brains and enjoy unraveling a story through other means.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,i only understood it because I read vague sci fi. it was a good demo of tech. It was not much of a game.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,What's the ocean sky about then Mr.IUnderstandDeathStranding
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-09,"Because that's just gameplay.  
The actual story and world etc made no fuckin sense lol."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"🥱 Nope, nothing really. Nice try though."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Just because your brain is too smooth to enjoy maximum Kojimbo doesn't mean it wasn't a good game.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,…..go on.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,[deleted]
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Metal ... Poop .... Solid?
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,That comment makes more sense than anything Kojima has written
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Lmaooo. Reading on the toilet seat right now 😆
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I think even if the game wasn’t fun at all and truly made no sense, it would still be one of the most well polished and carefully crafted video games ever."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Death Stranding was mid.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Dark Souls has poor balancing, whether or not you like the game overall does not matter, it is flaw. Quality is not determined by whether or not you like the something."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Considered a Series S?  Or is money not the issue?
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Lol, yeah you can't read.

I never said it was a horror game, buddy. 

Reading comprehension is important.

Read it again."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I don’t mind it but the novelty of Sam’s room later in the game becomes too mundane. At first I would enter the private room, shower, turn on a song on the music player and read through all the stuff cuz I wanted to know more about the game world since it was so odd compared to any other games I’ve played but I can easily see why other players wouldn’t really like that."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Lots of modern players hate reading ngl my friends won’t read anything longer than a paragraph
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"That's fair!  The gameplay definitely also wasn't for me, but I know people who swear by how interesting and fun it is."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"The ""Strand-type"" term also made the game immensely enjoyable for me. Finding shit someone else left behind or built, retreading footsteps or finding new areas untouched by others was a very cool experience."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Loved the game and the story. It was so engrossing that every step felt real by the end.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"You mean unraveling a story by having it all explained to you at the very end of the game?  Sure, definitely using your brain there bud.  Way to contribute exactly nothing."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I haven't beaten the game or anything, but that particular imagery reminds me of something like the Farshore from Elder Scrolls. There are different varying versions of this particular afterlife in the real world, too. All of which are pretty unsettling."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,youre not special or an intellectual bc u enjoyed a dogshit game
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"PM me Kojima, I'm ready to pack my bags and be a lead writer at Kojima Studios anytime."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Feel like you and your upvoters would love David Cage games.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"It's him, guys. Get him. Take the toilet seat alive."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Most likely yes!
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Lmao, regardless of what you thought of Death Stranding, mid is NOT the word to describe it. It was, and still is, one of the most polarizing games ever. You either absolutely hated it or absolutely loved it. ""Meh"" or mid just isn't an accurate enough of a word to describe that game."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Sure, but people have complained that they found Death Stranding boring or tedious which could be quantified as poor quality pacing if you don't like it.

I just fundimentally find this whole pretentious idea of using critics reviews as a way to invalidate peoples opinions to be really snobby and dismissive."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I'm really a 1 console person. It's already too much. Still got backlog before I even move to next gen. 

That said, I have been considering pc gaming or xbox when I do switch to next gen. 

Do you have both? I know game pass is better than ps plus but anything else a + for Xbox?"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,That's kinda sad lol
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Yeah, the gameplay is very 50/50, it’s rare for it to actually click for people given that it’s labeled as a walking simulator. Kojima took a big gamble making a game like it and well, it did pretty well regardless."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"I loved getting myself ready to head into an unlinked area of the map, there was such a sense of danger to it. Then the feeling of relief when I connect it to the network and see all the tools other players put around knowing the area is safer to traverse now."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,There is a bunch of emails in the game that explain what's happening exactly. You just have to read them.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Like previously mentioned, literally  read emails and listen to conversations. That tells you the story throughout the game! Neat concept, huh?"
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,Why are you in this thread then? If you're feeling bad about something and feel the need to shit on everyone's parade you need to look inward and figure your shit out.
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Ok but that’s the beauty of kojima getting funded in 2023.  He doesn’t make games designed for everyone.

It objectively kicks ass that someone ponied up the money for him to make a AAA game about a mail delivery guy with a baby in wearable briefcase.

I only sorta like DS, but it’s so much more exciting that it exists than far cry 9."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Oh, that's fair.  Actually, I'm the same, I had a pc, ps5 ans xbox.  I ended up giving my brother the ps5 since he couldn't find one, and we weren't short on games since my household is gamepass.  Also, my digital library is very large on Xbox since the 360 eta.

An underrated feature I love is I can play on xbox, then my wife wants TV, so I move to pc and continue the game and save.  It feels great.  So me and my daughter and I share the same gamepass account on Console and pc so we can play together.

I will say if you get Gamepass, that backlog is just impossible to get through.  Both consoles are great, though."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,It’s all by design 😂
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Oh yeah, the game was (and kind of still is) a sensation."
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,youre in my thread
18dbys7,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"Yeah that's kinda what I was worried about. Xbox is gonna have a huge backlog for me. I do like playstation exclusives more I think. It's cool that you can play on the same game pass together though. Ps plus just became worse, which is why I'm considering moving on

For now, I'll just ride out the PS and cross that bridge when I come to it 😊"
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,And ETS2 is freakin fantastic. So chill (except unhitching the trailers lol)
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Can someone actually fill me in on what Death Stranding was going to be about? Do you literally just walk around and deliver shit and that's it? To me I always thought it was a sci-fi/action/shooter or some shit.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,May we take a moment to look at the year of release for csgo and realise that games which are basically the same thing over and over but which are hugely competitive due to skills involve last the test of time?
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Euro Truck Simulator but with a Kojima story?

Take my fucking money."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,See also Elite: Dangerous
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"ETS2 is ridiculously fun in VR. You're sitting in the truck, driving through Europe (or the US in ATS). You gotta have a wheel/pedal combo for real immersion."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Civ V is best Civ
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,why blur
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I am just glad I see destiny there were some dark times while playing that game specially D2 but to see it on top of the charts makes me happy.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,[deleted]
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Honestly I'm pretty excited to try Death Stranding. I understand people not being excited for something that's not so action oriented, but I want to try it just because it's so different. I use to hate horror games, but once I started Silent Hill 3 I loved it from start to end, so I'm really keen to see something abnormal."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Destiny 2 gang Eyes up (guardian)
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,ETS2 and ATS are incredibly fun.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I was gonna say, I'm getting all excited about Utah being released this week for ATS.

In no other context could I ever be excited for Utah."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Nice blur...
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,It was in the top 5 when it came out. So yeah. I will play it  :) sometimes you want to get away and lost in another world and not to get shot on the face.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,This might seem like a stupid question. Where dyu get these stats from?
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Is dota 2 really that good?
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I mean, trucks are cool..."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Oh boy. People still play in Terraria.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,[deleted]
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I find ETS ironic considering here I am on a couch/chair pretending to be a trucker/not making money, when if I did it IRL I would be making bank while also being a trucker. 

Regardless, I'd still play it."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,We can still see the game names you tried to blur out for no reason.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Why did you blur out Destiny?

&#x200B;

Who hurt you?"
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Sometimes i get surprise on how much people think sports/action games are the only ones played by gamers.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Not to mention Sea of Thieves, which is basically the same thing but pirates and sailing (and other players killing you and taking stuff you've worked hours for)"
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I mean.. you arrive from school and literally all you want to do is nothing for an hour. Then if you see this game you will actually fin it appealing..
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Star Citizen checking in. Lots of people will deliver cargo for fun.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,it wasnt supposed to be delivery simulator from the get go though
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I honestly thought that you were referencing PUBG.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,CIV 5 is still in the top 25?
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"How old is this that Civ 5 is still in there, granted IMO 5 was still better than 6 but at this point I'm guessing most ppl have moved on to 6"
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,It's not death stranding...It's Stork Simulator 2077
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,What's with the random blur?
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Love thé game play it since 2014.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,ETS2 helped me brush up my driving skills. I understand how to use the clutch now.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Have you blurred D2 because Sony might try sue?
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Currently obsessed with American Truck Simulator (same company).  Really good games.. truckin' is hard!
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Damn 14 million hours of Civ V, that's like 4 games!"
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Everytime I IGNORE that stuff on steam, I wonder: ""who would buy this?"" Reminds me of ...was it on the Simpsons or Family Guy?? xD Virtual STUCK BEHIND A BUS or the GARDEN WORK SIM."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I could see Speed Run type things becoming a thing in Death Stranding. How much shit can you carry at once safely?!
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I see you too play terraria. A fellow man of culture, I presume..."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"That is indeed fair play. After all, trading sims are still pretty cool, especially the space-flight ones. And while it's probably not the best example of the genre (although I still enjoyed it a lot), the game DarkStar One gave me a lot of things to buy low and sell high as I travelled from system to system.

Though with that in mind, can you do that in Death Stranding? Is it possible to make a tidy pay-packet by buying resources cheap in one town and selling them somewhere where they fetch a higher price? 'cause that to me is kind of the bread-and-butter for games like DarkStar One and High Seas Trader. That kind of system can spice up going from town to town, though it does help if you roughly know what the nearby towns are buying and selling."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I totally misunderstood this image. I thought this was one person's playtimes
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Whats the blur for?

ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"The greatest mystery in the world. Who is playing this? Seriously, how can you enjoy such a game is beyond me. You have games with wast fantasy worlds, never before seen locations, fantastic creatures, games where you can be anyone you want, be superhero, demigod, animal, anything!..

But people chooze to ride trucks. I cant understand this."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,At least it's fun to mess around in truck sim
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I don't think anyone would have high standards for a Truck Simulator vs Death Stranding, the latter was made by someone who has a great rep for video games."

ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,What's with the blurry box in the middle of the photo?
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I'm slightly out of the loop because I don't own a console, is that really all you do in that game? Or is this a meme and there are other things to do. I remember the trailer having moments of suspense that look vaguely like stealth."

Yeah, I pre-ordered."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,I dont know about this chart. It only has like 7 or 8 games worth of hours for 1 person on Civ V
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,Civ 5? Nice.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,What graph is this? Haven't seen DOTA 2 at the top for a while. Thought LOL or Fortnite was 1.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,I'm also just kinda happy to see how strong civ v is still going
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"Just watched the trailer for death stranding, honestly the graphics look kinda disappointing for a new AAA title. Almost like PS3 quality. Too bad it's a Sony exclusive so we will never get better visuals. Psyched for rdr2 PC release tho, looks amazing. Beat the game on ps4 and ready to go again!"
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,My boy Terraria still in top 25 makes me happy
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"TBH, I think it sounds like a really fun game.  Especially if there is a good storyline."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,I dont see forknite there
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"That’s essentially PUBG for me too, loot and deliver it to enemies when i die lol"
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"How long ago was this taken? It's down to 51st place with 5,000 players now."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"Lol I literally uninstalled PUBG last week.  
I no longer shout at an inanimate object in my room anymore.  *Progress.*"
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"Euro Truck Simulator attracts the same significant number of people that play any type of traditional vehicle simulator though.

Death Stranding will not attract the ""simulator"" crowd because its not a simulation game, despite the nature of the ""deliver cargo"" style gameplay elements.

So this comparison is pointless.

That said, I do think folks are giving Deaths Stranding a hard time over that element of the game and should be more focused on the story because that is literally what the game is about. It's more like an interactive movie than a game in my view."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,[deleted]
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,I wasn't interested in Death Stranding until I found out it's about delivering packages.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"I was so hyped for Death Stranding, but then I found you carry a baby around. Big nope, so done with babies, real or virtual."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,It's a legit treat on vr. I keep grinning like an idiot looking the map or having to literally poke my head out of the cabin to back the trailer on the delivery depot. It's excellent if you wanna relax while listening to a podcast.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,Exploring different countries and managing a company of truckers is a lot more interesting than being a glorified delivery person in an empty mountainous place.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,Promods just released a multiplayer compatible version and everyone is trying to take the death road near Kirkenes in multiplayer.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"I'm a very excited for Death Stranding, so close now."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,Just imagine having a system that determines if you play euro truck sim to mess around or as an actual sim. And based on that gives you the ability to remotely steer actual physical trucks on the road and deliver stuff.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,So proud of destiny 2 at 4
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,Terraria is #22?
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"Dont forget spintires mudrunner and elite dangerous, i have 400 hours on both, im so excited for Death Stranding!"
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,The better question is who plays football manager 2019
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Euro Truck Sim has multiplayer though
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I wouldn't play Euro Truck Simulator 2 either.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Ok but no one claimed ets was ""genre defining"" and ""innovative"""
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Thank you! Somebody said it.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Yeah but ETS is a huge map that has real elements. Plus its so fun to drive a truck around.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,ETS is actually fun tho.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,is death stranding really that basic and simple?
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I actually think you could argue with people who play PUBG, or any battle royale for that matter. Unless you're dropping into a highly populated area of the map (Fortnite had something called the Towers? Twisted Towers? iuno), then you're basically going to be walking around for a while just looking for shit. 10 minutes into what is supposed to be an action/shooter you might finally find a fight and if you lose it, lol, das it. buh bye.  


But PUBG is number 2. Fortnite is also fucking popular. People like different shit. Just gotta accept that. At this point I might buy Death Stranding out of spite and I'll enjoy it because a lot of peopel are telling me I shouldn't. Weird approach, but don't tell me what to do!"

ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I don't know what it is about ETS2. You look at it and you think meh, how bland and boring. But if you sit down and play it, bam you're hooked. I can't explain why, but it's so good and fun, and really zen."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"It's an open world adventure game with goals that include deliveries, which is not new despite his suggestion.  Hideo just got really, really excited about the social media aspect of his game.  Gotta collect those likes!

Seriously though, I trust him.  He's good at making games and this is mostly likely going to be a good game."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"The type of people who play ETS2 are probably not the type of people who play Death Stranding.

Then again if you think ETS is just walking in a straight line you clearly don't understand the game. 

Sometimes you turn road, on a road that's too short, with traffic in the way.  Which is like an all new level of intensity."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Zero interest in the game from the start, but it’s hard to argue this point. Also, the forklift job in Shenmue was one of my favorite parts of the game sooo"
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Gamers: Why does every game have to be about shooting/killing shit? Why can't any AAA games do something different?

Also Gamers: You don't even shoot shit in Death Stranding? How boring, who would want to play that?"
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Normally I would joke about the fallout new Vegas’s courier being related to this post but honestly you really don’t do mail work on a daily basis just a platinum chip and that’s it lol
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,You literally do that in pubG too

ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,Destiny 2 is number 4? Htf!?!?! People really don’t care about Pay to play huh?
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Wow, I'm surprised to see Civilization V is still way up there. Anyone know why so many people decided to stick with Civ V and not upgrade/switch to Civ VI?"
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Minecraft isn't even top 4, wtf?"
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I think it's a little different

ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I'd argue the big difference is you get the relaxation of driving roads vs mashing trigger buttons to tighten straps as you Skyrim-flail your way down a mountain.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,WTF is Football manager 2020 doing on that list?  The whole thing is suspect.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,The only crime here is PUBG
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I won't play it...but I like good games.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Steam Stats are a lie/fake anyways, check out the game ""Ark"", then login and count the total players.

Its usually saying 10k+ players on right now, if you manually count up all the servers theres about 500 people."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"That game does exactly what it says it does. Simulating trucking. Death Stranding was supposed to be this great game, but we were all decieved. Its a borderline giant fetch quest with long cutscenes. If they would have marketed as that people would be way more understanding"
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"But looking at any gameplay footage shows that the walking is barely half the game...

It's interesting that pretty much everyone openly loved Kojima even until recently but then he says something negative against Trump and suddenly you have people attacking him all of a sudden...

Also interesting to note that everyone quotes the US IGN review but none of the 14 reviews that gave it a perfect score (the most of any game this year) and none of the IGN spain, italy, france reviews that have all given it 9.0/10 and above."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"HEY DRIVING IS CONSIDERED FUN BY LITERALLY EVERYONE. Add to that that you do not need to eat or drink, or use real money in ETS 2 and BOOM. But Death Stranding? DEATH STRANDING IS THE PAIN AND MISERY OF ON-FOOT OR VEHICLE DELIVERIES.

Death Stranding is delivery, with THE MOST OBSTACLES. THE WORST DAY OF THE FUCKING DELIVERY IS DEATH STRANDING, BUT EVERY DAY IS SHIT!

ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,And Death Stranding looks chill af too. Throw on some headphones and just get immersed.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,I suddenly want to try it to see what all the fuss is aboot.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"Most important part is the **2**. Euro Truck 1 was so good and made enough money to warrant a sequel. Clearly some people wanted it or have enjoyed it. 

No doubt Death Stranding will find its players."

ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I got a USB Xbox 360 controller to plug into my PC for like...$20. I use it for all my driving games including ETS and Forza. Having that kind of control makes unhitching a breeze.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Essentially, there was a world-ending event that nearly wiped out humanity. The remaining humans live in separate cities that don't really connect with each other, and you are a post-apocalyptic UPS man who is tasked with trying to connect the cities together  by getting them to agree to link together via some sort of internet network. 

There is a combat system in the game, but it's not necessarily a main factor. From the sounds of it, you're supposed to sneak your way through most of the game. So, the core of the game is walking (and eventually building transportation networks) from city to city, and building your reputation so that you can eventually convince others to join your network."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,It's the Gran Turismo of walking simulators.

ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,Death Stranding is a walking simulator where you deliver stuff to people. The developers think they invented the idea of asynchronous gameplay and they are calling it a strand game because of this.

ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"essentially, people who've seen speculation by nerds who are guessing have shit on the game and tried to be edgelords about who should and shouldn't enjoy what they do or don't enjoy.

Even though there are leaks that show the gameplay, the tencent shills who don't want anything but apparently epic game store exclusives getting good reviews will take the opportunity to denigrate the game.

The problem is, the whole ""hey form your own opinion"" is not valid because you have to pay money to be able to do that. 

These games are in dire need of free demos. Every game should have a free demo. Problem with that would be that there'd be a whole lot of games that are polished immensely for the demo and fall off hard past that. 

But still, reviews fuckin' blow. I've agreed with almost zero reviewers I've read on the past dozen or so major game releases. Gosh, it's almost like everyone has their own life experiences that elevate certain media while diminishing others!

Like take this thread for example, literally 0 posts are even remotely scratching the surface.

Yet we have boner threads about RDR2 exclusive on epic for a month. Hooo boooyyeeee."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Hugely competitive scene with low entry requirement for PC specs. Combine that with high skill ceilings, and supported tournaments, and you've got a hell of a gaming scene.

You get to a point where better graphics =/= gameplay. We all know that. You also get to a point where the difference between a 2000 game and 2010 is huge, but a 2010 and 2020 game not as much. We're starting to hit diminishing returns on graphics for games."

ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"1.6 took FOREVER to fall out of favor, CSGO is the same. Other games  earlier on like Quake were exactly the same and hell... speedrunning games are also within that category for a smaller crowd.

I'd say you're bang on right."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Let’s take a second, longer moment to admire dota 2, who’s community is in a uproar due to the lack of updates causing player count to plummet.  And yet we are still the most played game on steam. 

On a side note if anyone is looking at getting into dota, we have a major patch coming at the end of the month and that would be a great time to start playing!"
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Yep skill cap is what keeps people around. That’s why games like csgo and dots will last another 5 years at least, while cod has to make a new one every year."

Most of the games feels very slow because of it. :( I hate PUBG for example. Can't even jump over a stupid window in 3 seconds. Wtf? I play paintball and in real life And I am way faster than that. It doesn't feel realistic.

ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,For me it isnt the lack of action putting me off it's the dull gameplay loop I keep hearing about which admittedly isnt for everybody (I also might personally enjoy) but combined also with Kojima cutscenes full of over complicated plot devices and long durations it puts me off. I believe I heard somewhere that it's like 2 or e hours before the gameplay actually starts I'm lucky if I get 2 to 3 hours in a week to play games sometimes.

ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Because i skipped 20 or so games and it seemed like a good way to show transition.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Just to show that i skipped 20 or so games. But it seems that i just confused a lot of people
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Some people like fishing, and they too can do much more interesting things.

I played ETS2, and it's mostly a relaxing distraction."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"Me, I'm one of those persons. It's very relaxing to just stay there and drive, listen to some music, see nice scenic, I love it. For sure it's not the only game I play, lol, but probably one of the most relaxing ones. It has a very slow peace."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I wanted for it to serve as transition between 4th and 22nd place.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"It's not even released yet. So nobody knows for sure. 

And Journey won multiple GOTY awards so even if it is just walking around it could be a good game. I personaly doubt i will like it as much as some other ""conventional"" games.

I guess that people expected this to be MGS6 of sorts and they didn't get it. Based on mgs games, i guess that this will be a series of games where this first game will act as an introduction."

ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Yes but unless you enjoy blocking roads, running into people deliberately and constantly honking your horn, you'll want to avoid multiplayer. 

Plus there's no AI traffic in multiplayer. So it's pretty damn boring driving on a road that's entirely empty. Coming into contact with people only happens so often unless you're in or close to a major city."

ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"The problem with Elite:Dangerous is that there's just too much thinking involved, even for simple stuff like combat. What weapons are best? Are they engineered? If not, what's even the point of running with them? Well, now you have to engineer all of your shit, because without engineering, everything you do is gimped. Oh, but then you need a bunch of materials to do  the actual engineering, then you have to run to all of the different engineers to unlock them. You can't even go out to an asteroid belt and shoot bad guys without making a job of it, and even then, the payoff is total trash.

Don't even get me started on mining. Exploring is the most fun, but that fun only lasts so long, until you get bored of being in an open expanse of literal nothing and realized it took you 8 hours of jumping to get there, so you have to take another 8 hours jumping back to the bubble, or just dying and showing back up in the station and losing all of the exploration credit you just got (which is basically the only thing of value you get while exploring other than cool screenshots)

Elite:Dangerous is one of those games that you fucking love with all your heart, and then realize you have no reason to ever play it. Elite:Dangerous is like the cousin of Eve Online that really wants you to work with spreadsheets, but can't really explain how they want you to use them, so it kind of just makes you guess at everything.

At least in ETS2/ATS I can just hop in a truck, do a quick cargo run (not even *picking* my cargo), deliver it, and be done. The sights aren't perfect, but at least it requires no more effort than picking up a controller."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"That's exactly what I love about Elite. Just the relaxing experience of space trucking. Instead traffic problems, I come too close to a neutron star that tries to overheat and destroy me, or a high gravity planet that tries to smash my ship on the ground, or a lovely pirate attempting to rob my of my tons of biowaste. I have a ship full of poop, man. Not sure why that's worth trying to rob."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I played it for a bit and thought why is there no autopilot?

surely a species so advanced could make a freaking autopilot.

totally broke my immersion."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I play both Elite and ETS2. Both are worth the price for the chill experience. Elite is more fun but also much harder to learn. I play more elite because I have the basic HOTA 4 joystick. Don't have any wheel to play ETS2 so driving with a keyboards get's boring and unrealistic.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Spin Tires is another great chill out delivery game.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Im gonna buy a cheap hotas next pay I think to get back into it.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"Man I really wish I could have gotten into that game. It was serious chill...

...until you began being knocked out of warp every time you moved to a different planet. It was a pain in the ass."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,Except there are so many controls you need 2 keyboards to play

ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Damn, that's brilliant."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"By ""local streaming radio"", do you mean to play whatever station is local to the in-game area you're in? Because there's a mod for that: https://koenvh.nl/en/projects/ets2-local-radio"

That sounds so much better than the ""Weird 3rd Person Shooter"" vibe people touted so much about it..."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"Prior to much of the information we have now, Kojima said he was trying something new to do with traditional Japanese story telling. Supposedly there are two broad devices in Japanese stories: the stick, and the rope. The stick is used to keep things a character doesn't want away from them (so: guns and other weaponry in most games today). The rope is what the character uses to keep thing that are important close to them.

Death Stranding is a 'rope game.' I *think* I remember Kojima saying that a rope game is novel/unheard of."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,And this is what we got instead of the Silent Hill game?
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-08,"Better question still: why the hell would a pc gamer with access to driving and flying sims - and all of the associated tools - even bother with this?

I mean, I'm all for trying something new - I find gaming a largely stagnant backwater hobby these days, full of tired copycats - but the something needs to be fun and engaging. 

What's engaging about watching your character stumble around?"
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,One thing I loved about the Xbox 360 when it first launched was that the platform had a requirement that all digital games required free demos.  It's a shame that practice is gone.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I had noticed this too.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"We are starting to get diminishing returns on increased polygon counts and texture sizes, but more nuanced graphical features still have a lot of room for improvement. For a recent example, check out some of the ray tracing in Control. It contributed more than I expected to the overall graphical fidelity of the game. Real time ray tracing is still quite new, and it will continue to improve over time. Other compute-limited systems will continue to improve as well, like physics simulation, which also has a big impact on the perceived graphical quality of a game (e.g. cloth or hair)."

ok makes sense

Moving mouse left and right -> rotates ship CCW and CW

?????

I'm pretty sure those are regular plane controls and real pilots use... but why isn't there just an option to enable ""I'm not a real Pilot"" controls that makes the ship control like most first person games, where the camera always points towards where the mouse moves."

ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"Ok, but what does that mean in the real world? What about this game is the rope?"
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Yes, lol.

But, to be fair, i'm sure Kojima would have loved to be able to take that IP with him."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,Your pc sucks then
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"Still, of the top 4, pubg is the only release in the past 6 years."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Is more like having active mp playerbase to see those top10
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,A lot of people also wait for sales larger than 30%
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"For me, I just play games that are familiar. I dont like being shit at games so I rarely pick up a new one. I dont think that means new ones arent good, I bet there are just lots of people similar to me. I played League of Legends and Hearthstone for like 10 years without ever playing another game."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Except that's not it at all. For one, this is steams playtime, so any game not played through it isn't counting. Then there's the fact that those games are in the most popular genre of video games helping their popularity immensely. Lastly, all those games receive major updates changing the game giving new goals to players. They also are heavy cosmetic to keep making money and keep people playing. 

So let's chill in all reality. I'd be more interested to see games played on consoles than steam as an actual representation of popularity. Steam doesn't even have league or WoW listed either.

Edit: also those listed games have thousands if not 10s of thousands of bots in them."

It's not a game you can casually pick up. It's a lifestyle game."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Same goes for League of Legends. I would start playing again, but it would take to much time to get used to it, so that I can play in ranked games again."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"The entire sub is throwing a hissy fit, and we have reached the lowest player numbers since 2013. I’d kinda amazed you haven’t heard about this. Also generally it seems reddit hates the new MM changes (I think they are just fine personally) but go on over and have a look for yourself"
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"You are wrong, PUBG holds the current record at 3.2 million (set in January of 2018). Dota 2 holds second place at 1.3 million (set in March 2016), and CS:GO currently holds 3rd at 850k (set in April of 2016) 

However I heard CS:GOs community is thriving right now, so maybe it’s on another run up the charts like back in 2016! That was the peak of the game for me."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I never said it was but you can't deny a huge part of the community is there for the skins
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Except then you have to deal with the physical repercussions and commitments of driving a truck.

ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Weirdly enough, the new F2P model heavily pushes places towards the ""end game"" and unlocking all the PvP modes, throwing everything at them at once without any baby steps towards learning the game or even the back story.

All the previous campaigns, including the Red War (which has the closest thing to a true tutorial for players) is hidden as purchasable items from Amanda Holliday - the shipwright who sells a couple vehicles. She's one of the few NPCs that doesn't get an obnoxious blinking icon when you arrive at the citadel.

I played it back when they were offering free accounts. If this was the first time I jumped into Destiny 2, I would be utterly lost, overwhelmed, and frustrated by the onslaught of information, the 5 minute ""welcome to D2"" mission you get tossed into first thing at the Cosmodrone, and the general ""you should already know these characters"" feeling you get speaking to any NPCs on any planet."

ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Honestly it should be played like a multiplayer game. There's way too much ground to cover and there's so much combat specialization and the enemies are ruthless.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"But you don't know how you'll like it unless you play it. If you told me to play a game where I just drive a truck around Europe, I'd tell you it sounds like shit. Reviews for this game have been mostly positive, and I think we should take that into consideration"
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"You literally can’t tell for sure yo I would hate the game without seeing actual gameplay , kojima loves his secrecy and I’m 100% sure the reviews you can find around are scrutinized and cannot include or talk about a LOT of things"

ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Having played both NMS and E:D I'd have to recommend E:D over NMS. NMS is alright, but it just doesn't have that ""Wow I'm in space doing crazy space stuff"" feeling that E:D has. NMS somehow feels small and confined. A never ending loop of shoot mining beam at rock, go to waypoint, learn word, repeat."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I was tired of falling through floor on my capship. -\_-

It is playable, and plot is nice, but game is SOOO unpolished. What do I mean:

\-old garage gates that don't work or even can't be built but still exist,

\-shield replenidhers and some wall things that don't work in custom rooms, only in those powered boxes...

\-inventory and storage management is something very opposite to 'comfortable',

\-ability to sell your ships doesn't even exist,

\-space battle and weapons have no balance, default gun is almost the best and the only one you need to beat the game.

ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Yep, you literally can't even just pick up cargo, and drop it off for profit (passenger missions aside). You need to actively look for the best trade routes, and if you're not using them, you may as well not trade at all."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"It's not math though, it's just pointless grinding and information dumps to do the simplest of things. Not one time has math come into play while playing it. KSP needs math. E:D just needs... patience? I don't even know, there's never really any payoff to it. Everything gets stale so fast."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"It's not bad at all once you've had a little practice. Also, you don't have to play Elite with other players. Playing in solo mode puts you in the same shared universe, but without other players present. Just NPCs."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"Every single control is customizable. Go into controls and set it to invert or Regular depending on which way your brain works. I know I do. The best thing you can do is buy a cheap HOTAS. I have the T16000m and an XBox wireless controller for the SRV, and it makes the game so much easier. Plus you can map whatever buttons to whatever feature you want. I doubt any two commanders shares a similar load out. KB&M are preferred by the stunt pilots who also seem to have mastered flight assist off, but they are rare as heck."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Theres a button to autopilot landings until you can get used it.

And when you use such items they can be seen in other players' map so when other people will traverse the same area where you put down your items they will become useful to other people and this supposedly make player connected to each other.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,The cargo I think.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,The connection you make between people... You're more than just a delivery dude.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I mean we could have gotten a small town horror story without the IP. It looks like his game was far from Keiichiro Toyama's games regardless. Change about 20% of what they had, I'm sure they could go, especially considering that Silent Hill was just a mash up of Jacob's Ladder and Stephen King."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Putting out a new iteration every fall definitely doesn't help.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,Exactly. Can't call the likes of witcher 3 and red dead redemption crap based on current playerbase.

ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Ok sorry. Football manager series is a 20 years old serie. 

It's like all the version of CS, keeps attracting people for 2 decades."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,These are my favorite comments.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,I haven’t played for 2 years and got back into it and it wasn’t as bad as you’d think. Just play the champions you already know and get slowly used to all the new ones.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-07,"I appreciate your reasonable resounded to my over reactive comment, but I'm not seeing anything on r/dota2 or r/truedota2. Seems to mainly be the same content as usual. Maybe I missed a key thread you're referencing."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I didn't say top ever I said according to that image so no I'm not wrong, go read what I posted. That one image right there have a look at it, see the one with the highest total concurrent users for that specific month, ah yes csgo not DotA, I know you may have miss understood what I put which is cool but I tend to stay on the topic at hand and not go looking for random things out of context to try and be right.


So yes let me clarify, I'm staying on topic with the data on the image alone."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Maybe in 2016

ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"I jumped in when it went F2P the other week. I'd never played Destiny at all before. 

I was completely and utterly lost upon starting it up. I had no clue what the tower was, or who I was supposed to talk to to ""start"" a mission. Didn't know how to start a strike, what Gambit or Crucible meant, or anything at all really. And no where I looked in the menus or in the tower told me how to. 

 Luckily, I had a few friends who played a fair bit to get me on track. I literally had never been so lost in a game and without the help from experienced players, I probably would've stopped playing. Good thing I didn't because I absolutely love it now. 

But yeah, they way they went F2P was very sloppy and unforgiving to inexperienced players."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,and that first mission they added on for new players is a copy and paste from the destiny 1 introduction

ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Yeah, which is probably why I'll never really get into it. I just don't really care to play with anyone. My friends are too flaky to play anything for more than an hour a week."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"I know the reviews are positive, I don't care. After learning more about it, I have zero interest in playing it. It's a 60 hour game and the gameplay loop is delivering cumbersome packages and inventory management. No thanks, hard pass. Whether or not it's a well made game, which I think it actually is from what I've heard, doesn't really matter to me."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"But I have seen actual gameplay. And heard people who have completed the game talk about it (some with bad opinions of it, some with better opinions of it). I've seen and heard enough to know I wouldn't like it. I don't care if there are things they can't talk about in the reviews. Having seen gameplay, it's 100% not for me. Almost nothing at all about the game appeals to me, and that's ok."

ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I came back and played it after not playing it for a few years.

It got way better, but other stuff was holding my attention."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I never played it until the VR update and have to say it is an awesome game. It's a crazy experience to jump into a cockpit and blast off from a planet, fly through space, and land on another planet in VR"
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Have you actually played it recently though? People like you spout this shit without having even recently tried it. I get it, you feel burnt by the release, but it truly is a pretty different game, not that someone so devout would actually change his mind, even if it was infact a good game now."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"The fact that there's, what 7 or 8 tutorials before the first launch soured me to the whole thing."

ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,That game gets stranger the more I learn about it.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"The BT's (monsters) are sort of dead souls. In this apocalyptic event, the world of the dead and world of the living became intrinsically linked, became closer.

ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I think that was a theory that now doesn't fit. When the trailers first showed rapid ageing it looked like the monsters (B-Ts?) caused it, and a cool theory was the baby acted as a respawn system - as in it was your clone, and if you were going to die through rapid ageing then your baby would also age, get your memories, and be your second life. Now you gotta go find a new baby. But from the reviews it seems the purpose of the baby (and there might only ever be one you get, called B-B?) is solely for detecting the B-Ts, and that B-B is a 'character' in it's own right (so can't exactly be replaced with a different baby if you die)."

ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-07,"Yeah, i believe this is the central idea. You're literal mission in the game is to connect people, but they also have the pseudo-multiplayer world building feature that is designed to have people work together to build better routes (aka also connecting people).

My personal fear is less with the concept, and more with the actual gameplay. I can see myself getting very frustrated/bored having to pay close attention to the act of walking from place to place and managing my inventory. And, idk if the story or community theme/mechanics will be enough to hold my attention. 

But, that's totally just me."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"True, but Kojima is a giant weirdo, so we get a walking and inventory management sim with some pee and blood grenades thrown in instead."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"People thay usually buy this games (sports) usually stick to that sport game in particullar. So they can afford buying a game iteration a year, most of those people more than a gamer, first they are sport fans."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,There's been a few but the most recent one would be the battle royale update which added a new mode entirely.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Yeah I got you, just couldn't resist when the game was also called 2020. No worries mate"
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-07,"You for the most party did, since they have announced the patch will be after the first major (directly after) they have calmed down, however there is still some tension on how well/poor the matchmaker is. Which I assume will be addressed within the coming weeks."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"So by saying “Dota is only the highest at the moment” did you just assume everyone would know you meant to say 

“At the moment, in the past thirty days, CS:GO has the highest peak player-count, while Dota holds the highest current players but not the peak players record.” 

See how much information you left out of your statement that could lead to my (and everyone else’s) confusion? If you don’t indicate a timeframe when your issuing a blanket statement then don’t get upset when people take it as a blanket statement. 

So there I guess you’re “not wrong” but you sure as hell are not right. but proper argument formation would have saved you ;)."

ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"But what if that gameplay loop is really fun? I mean something like Euro Truck Driver has the worst sounding gameplay, but upon playing it's really engaging."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Yeah, i'm not sure what the argument is. There is now a ton of content out there about the game that gives a pretty in depth idea of what the game is about and what its core mechanics are. You're a post-apocalyptic UPS man, and the core mechanics are walking and inventory management. Either you're fine with that, or not, but it's pretty evident that is what the game is at this point. obviously, the story is more in depth than that (hopefully), but as far as gameplay, that's what you're looking at."

ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-08,"Agreed.

They are basically killing their own game, since they could not be bothered to make quality game play. Its beautiful but boring as shit."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,In what way
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I agree, expect so far I have found NMS's flora fauna and planets to be pretty samey."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-08,"You're not getting those things. Ever. If you were, they'd be in by now. It's just maintenance mode now until lights out. Sorry mate."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Isn’t that what creative mode is for?
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"I ran out of fuel in elite dangerous and havent played it since.  I was basically low on fuel, low on ammo, and low on missiles.  Since the learning curve for combat is obnoxious and random ships higher level than you can knock you out of warp, oh, and space combat is basically just flying in loops... eh. I did my time with Eve, these days I just want to fly around.  NMS isnt infinitely better on it, but I found myself less frustrated."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I don't mind needing gas every so often, but you burn through soooooooooooooooooo much of it in NMS, and it takes some effort to farm some up.

In E:D, just get a decent fuel scoop and you can gas up at most stars. If you spring for a good one, you only have to worry about fuel if you run into a field of brown dwarfs or are riding the neutron highway."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,The things they promised.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"I just started playing it again. The content is way better but it's still wicked buggy. In the 4 hours i've played it's crashed to desktop 3 times, lost the HUD twice, stopped showing character animations temporarily 3 times and permanently once (my laser fired from my chest in fpv). The health bars on sentinels have also appeared like way off to the left of the actual object a few times.  

This next bit is just a gripe, but holy shit i've never seen a spaceman so unenthusiastic about shooting a laser beam to suck up rocks. I have to play in first person because the third person animations make me feel depressed and like i'm putting my character through an ordeal by playing the game."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,It's ironic how those who don't let their hate die accuse others of being the lunatics in the conversation.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,[deleted]
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"I thought there were more than that, but it's been a while since I've done them. They don't really show you what you'll be doing though. It's ""how to fly around"", ""how to dock"", or ""how to shoot things"".

They don't go into *any* of the detailed garbage you'll need to learn and perform constantly. Hell, even making a lot of money for the top tier ships, and the rank required for them as well, is a nightmare. The only way it was even moderately palatable for me was when passenger missions were giving out a shit ton of experience, and I got high rank before they were nerfed to the ground. That was still a horribly boring experience."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I'm pretty sure it's fairly recent addition. That or I overlooked it for the longest time.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,It's a Hideo Kojima title.  That's a given.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Jarate?
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Fair enough, didn't even consider sports but its the same thing. Was more thinking big name fps game that typically does this."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"Oh people play that? My friends list is full and it's almost all csgo players and I've not seen one of them playing it so I literally presumed it wasn't played.

My bad."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Maybe but why would I be speaking with regards to things which hold no relevance to the current discussion? I realise other people might do random silly things like that but not me, nope. BTW did you see that chicken?"
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"Play the game for long enough and you'll notice the complete obliviousness to problems in their game, addiction to illogical game design/grind and the slow as molasses development speed.

It's worth the price you pay for the game but not the time you'll eventually put in if that makes sense."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"Yeah, I definitely agree with you on that.

Both kind of fall into the ""mile wide but an inch deep"" trap unfortunately, E:D is amazing until you've done everything, unless you REALLY like something you've done it'll get really boring at that point.  NMS skates by a bit further for me just because I don't like playing E:D in open anyway, and stick to private groups or solo play which dampens the potential of the game."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,I just found a ship with an S class launch thruster and now don't need to worry about launch fuel at all. Love it. And pulse jet fuel is stupid easy to get in mass quantities.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"There’s two solutions to this - the Fuel Rats, who are the most awesome player group of all, who will come and rescue you, even if you’ve got like a few seconds left of oxygen. The second solution is to always carry a fuel scoop. Even a little one will help as long as you scoop from every scoopable star along the way. The third is to plot carefully and just make sure the last stop on your journey is either scoopable or inhabited or both. You can set route filters to make this happen automatically, such as Only traveling via KGBFOAM stars and those that have a population size greater than 0. You won’t need to do this once you’ve played it a bit more. 

I have a ton of hours in ED, and learning to fight in open so I can fight Thargoids and get my third Elite. Recently I bought a VR headset for my birthday, and playing in VR has really opened up the game for me. It’s just like being in space.

P.s happy cake day!"
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"exactly. if it was easier to get, or lasted longer, i wouldnt care about getting it

but it just drains and hard as hell to find"
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Such as?
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I was the biggest NMS hater. But the things they promised ARE in the game now and then some.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"The new tutorials are much better than the old. You only get to see them once. 

Mining has made the money grind much easier now. I literally bought an Asp Explorer after about 2 hours in my new second account, and after a little longer, I had a tricked out Python miner and then the Krait I really wanted. The grind for materials for engineering is way way way harder than money these days, and that took me until the very last day before setting off on Lost Souls 2 to complete. I now have four ships including a Type 9, a 70 ly Krait Phantom, a 192 t Python LTD/painite miner, an Asp Explorer, and a well engineered Vulture within two months of weekend play only. This took me nearly 2 years the first time around."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Well it's good to know.  I keep meaning to fire the game back up and finally learn how to play it but it seems so daunting so I haven't yet.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,"You  know, just a random thought, but Kojima would be a really good guy to get on the crew  of an  lovecraftian-game, consindering the bizarre weirdness he cooks up."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"Something doesn't need to be popular now to have helped kept a playerbase at the time. When it was first released, it was popular. For people playing competitive it was a nice change of pace and relaxing, allowing them to take a break from competitive. For those bored with the game it was a reason to come back, play a bunch again, and then get drawn back into competitive. 

Major updates aren't always about getting players to play new modes for a long time, they are about keeping players playing the game. There was also updates to the game released with Danger Zone. Other major updates were big in game changes that would adjust the meta, how maps were played, which affects the high end skill cap a lot. This keeps people playing more."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,[removed]
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,The ability to make my life worth living through its promised near infinite ability to let me do anything and everything I always wanted and didn't know I wanted to do. Is that so much to ask?
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"The real grind is Corvette/Cutter, even though Cutter just isn't the same. That shit took me forever, even cheesing the money/rank grind.

But for exploring, AspX is still king for me and the most fun to fly. Python is fun, but not really the kind of ship I like as my main.

Still, the problem is that there is *so* much in the game that you just never know about, but are gimped without."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"There’s two new assists - super cruise assist to make getting to Hutton Orbital that much easier, and the Advanced Docking computer that can both land and take off for you. My advice is to have one when you buy a new ship, watch where it takes you through the slot, and practice a bit by hand. After a while, you can land or take off much faster than using the docking computer, and in fact, recently when I decided to use the docking computer on my Corvette at Jameson’s for this exact reason, I nearly killed another commander. I generally don’t use them because I have every slot full, but for new Cmdrs they are the best."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I would love a lovecraftian game by kojima
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,I wanna see Kojima join Fromsoft. Him and Miyazaki would get along like a house on fire.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,They are planning on making movies in the future
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"My statement was purely for this on topic picture, I don't get how you can't see that."
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,Why can't more games just do that. Lazy devs is why i tells yah.
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-06,"So you're saying you would **love** a lovecraftian game **crafted** by kojima?

   

^ill^show^myself^out"
ds050x,2019-11-05,2019-11-05,I would buy it.

ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,"Thank you everybody for the birthday wishes! You don't have to, but it's definitely appreciated that you took a little time out of your day to do so. I hope you all have a great rest of your day/have a great holiday!"
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,"Take Sam outside and shout, he'll shout ""Today's my birthday"", and the echoing voices will cheer."
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,What a nice gesture. Kojima has a bit to say about gaming and loneliness (not implying anything about Op) I'm sure this is inspired by that.
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,For a while the only birthday email I got was from a place I torrented h-games from. Sure meant a lot.
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,"Hey happy birthday buddy, if you’re ever feeling down and need someone to talk/vent to just send me a PM!"
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,"For me, my greatest betrayal ever in a game... was brain age for the nintendo DS. Bottom line I was insanely paranoid in my early 20s... half my friends only knew me through an alias... and I was on par with Ron Swanson on keeping my birthday quiet. However me and my roomates played brain age on the DS... the first thing when you start is make a profile... and the head at the begining basically says ""tell me your birthday, I promise I won't tell anyone"".


well since the game was supposedly about training the brain... I actually answered honestly. I shared the game with my roomates. On my birthday when they started with their profiles... the talking head announces to them ""HEY did you know it's _____'s birthday, you should wish him happy birthday"".


Never have I raged at a game so badly... why on earth did they explicitly say ""I won't tell"", and then tell...."
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,"Heh, I remember when I was out of my town for several months for studies on my 30th birthday. After I did all my homework and learning stuff at 10 PM I started my Nintendo 3DS for an hour of Pokemon. 
Entering the Pokemon Center it was gloomy and dark for some reason which made me wonder, but a second after it got a huge birthday cake on the display and Ms. Joy was gratulating me with some confetti and such. Made me kinda tear up, so I know how you feel.

Also happy birthday btw ;)"
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,Sagittarius gang wya
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,This reminds me that the only happy birthday wishes I get are in emails from services I signed up for. Kind of wish my credit card would also send a gift like $25 off my balance. Lol.
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,Happy birthday!
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,Hey nice! I was wondering if that was why it wanted your birthday :) Happy birthday!

ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,"Happy Birthday, but the cake is a lie."
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,Oh...is that from the game? I thought it was real omg
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,"there's a small chance, since you posted this 5 hours ago and that would be very early in the morning here, but if you're in europe i'd love to bake you a late birthday cake"

ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,"The cool thing is that the cakes are real cakes that were 3d scanned, polished up, and put in the game. Kojima bought a cake for you."
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,Hideo kojima is cool like that. Had the base sing me happy birthday in the phantom pain this year. It was nice to have a cake somewhere i guess

ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,HAPPY BIRTHDAY!  Now play Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain so that they can sing you a really cheesy birthday song.  Kojima is really cool about celebrating birthdays.

ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,"Happy birthday man. Get yourself a cake, you deserve it"
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,"Seeing these messages in video games is always a wonderful (and usually unexpected) surprise!

I remember actually tearing up a bit after walking into a Pokemon Center in Pokemon Sun on my birthday after having a long day at work. I was exhausted and generally feeling miserable after having such a bad work day that I nearly forgot what day it was while playing the game to unwind. Then the confetti and ""Happy Birthday!"" when I walked in followed by the music box version of the pokecenter theme got to me emotionally. 

It's the little things sometimes."
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,"Happy Birthday, and it does matter, because Birthdays are about celebrating the fact that you were born.

Those who care about it are the ones that matter."

ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,"Happy Birthday <3
I love when games do this. I noticed it in newer Pokemon titles as well. You would enter a pokecenter and everything is dark, then they turn on the lights to greet you with a big Happy Birthday! It's really adorable"
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,Happy birthday

ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,"Happy birthday! Thats also true for Phantom Pain, Snake gets a birthday greeting from Lance when he gets to the base on your birthday. Pretty cool of Kojima to put this little thing in his games!"

ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,"Happy Birthday!

I had a similar thing happen with Metal Gear Solid 5.  It came out on September 1st, and I bought it on release, but didn't get to start until late at night because of work.  My birthday is September 2nd, so some time after midnight as I'm going along the cut scene comes on when I get back to base with everyone singing happy birthday.  [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9EyEwlgVUQ) the scene if anyone is curious."
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,Kojima is a good man.
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,"I thought this was a real picture, turns out the cake was a lie."
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,"It took me a while to realize this wasn’t a real cake... 
happy birthday and happy holidays!"
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,"HEY ! It's my birthday as well!  


Happy Birthday to us!!!!!!!!"
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,This game is terrible
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,"Aw man, all I got for my birthday today was constant anxiety attacks."
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-23,Cool...
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-23,It's funny cuz no one really cares about you
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,Will they want to test his stool sample after eating the cake? Red velvet cake ammo.
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,And keep on keeping on.
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,Unless you’re on a subway
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,"Found the Canadian, eh?"
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,"this is why kojima gets fired. you know he wasted so much time on making that cake look perfect just for such a little thing, and that's why we love him. he is the king of ""neat little touches""."
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,"You don’t have to take my birthday wishes, but it’s definitely appreciated that you took a little time out of your day to receive my acknowledgement. 

Happy Birthday stranger"
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,Hello fellow 12/21er. Here's to us🍻
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,"It was a real cake!

They took a high-rez 3d scan of a real cake (and then ate it).

There are pictures of it somewhere."
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,I thought this was on /r/softwaregore at first... It looked like only three of the candles were lit...
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,"Happy birthday. Whether you celebrate or not, its healthy to take a second and recognize that no matter what, you made it another year in life and survival is sometimes a lot."
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,Happy B-Day! What an aesthetically pleasing design on that crimson cake
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,"This ain't much but i Hope It makes you feel better. 

Happy birthday ;)"
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,Happy birthday!! Hope you have/had a good one!!!
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,Hey it's my birthday today too! My twin!!! Happy birthday!!!
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,Happy birthday! Today it’s my birthday also but I cannot play DS today so I won’t see the cake myself but this made me smile! Thanks!
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,"Oh! Also, I think cliff gives you flowers when you connect with BB on your birthday"
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,Happy birthday my dude!
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,Happy birthday!

ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,happy birthday
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,I don't celebrate my birthday either. So I will simply congratulate you on your successful run at not dying.
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,Happy birthday! Keep on keeping on.
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,Happy birthday
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,Happy birthday! You should try baking a cake! Super easy recipes out there and it's such a calming process. Plus then you have a cake that you don't have to share with anyone :)
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,Happy birthday dude! I hope you have a fantastic day!
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,Just want to wish you a happy birthday my dude

ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,Same here. Was in high school when it came around and was disappointed I couldn't control demons and fire and shit. Oh well
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,How about this. The Mayans said we would die in 2012 but I’m pretty sure they meant the planet.
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,[removed]
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,I stayed up all night playing GMod with my best friend and blasting gross pop music.
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,"They meant the baktun, which roughly translates into era, or Kali Yuga. It's not just the Mayans, they just had the most accurate calendar.

Also, apocalypse means tearing the veil, like how mushrooms only reach maturation when the veil tears to allow for their spores to drop."
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,"Every year at 31st December I'm completely dumbfounded because my calendar ends at that date for some reason, so it must be the end of the world."
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,Are you high? Because I'm high and you sound high but also 100% spot on.
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,"I can't remember if MGS1 has the birthday stuff but MGS2 and onwards ask for your birthday and then acknowledge it somehow when the date rolls around.

Did you ever ""break"" all the kerotans (including the motorcycle level and the bosses)"
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,"Also, you can bypass The End’s fight in MGS3 by waiting a week."

ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,"Your comment made me wonder why we don't say we're high on caffeine. It's kinda a drug, right? A mild one. I guess we're more medium on caffeine."
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,"Also, in MGS3 if you save at the prompt when snake gets thrown in jail, if you quit and reload you'll load into a black and white ""Dreamworld"" that's reminiscent of Devil may cry with zombies, if you get hit you wake up.

(I don't remember if you have to actually wait a day before loading that save to get the dream level I sorta remember it might  need a day for snake to ""fall asleep"")


MGS3 had the best hidden stuff"
ee0g3x,2019-12-22,2019-12-22,"A remaster was actually made for the PS3 and while killing him through waiting wasn’t achievement worthy, killing him in the wheelchair was. Along with killing Ocelot when you first met him."

1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,It'll be the second strand type game for sure.
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"That exact moment in the picture I'll never forget, getting thru that BT area and seeing Port Knot City from the hills, and the soundtrack. It's a game not many will understand, or it's just not their thing, it's understandable. But for me, it is really special."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"The gameplay loop was surprisingly satisfying once you figured out what usual game conventions you needed to ignore.

That said, Kojima's brand of weirdness in narrative and dialogue just never did it for me.  

There were brief moments where I'd start to feel it, but inevitably I'd get hit a character action or dialogue that were supposed to be serious but ultimately just made me think ""This is just f\*cking stupid""."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,I never played it due to me hearing it was a walking/ladder/backpack/package delivery game.  This is despite my initial interest so maybe my patientgamer mentalities are leading me back to it?  Seems like a decent fit for Steam deck too right? That is my gateway to gaming these days so I have to keep that in mind.
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"That game was paced like a really long book, which turned people off. I really liked it, however, and it made the big moments of discovery (often coupled with the unreal soundtrack) hit that much harder. 

I probably won’t have the time to immerse myself in the sequel the way I did with DS, since I had a lot of down time during covid, but that game came at a special moment in time like lightning in a bottle for me."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,It was a boring sounding concept that actually sucked me in
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,It was truly a special game. The OST is fantastic as well!
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,Walking?
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"Really struggling with this game. Doing a mission or two a night, but it's been quite boring. Love a walking simulator, but this is extreme. Haha. Just got access to the bike a couple nights back, so we'll see if that helps me enjoy it more. Also the games UI is absolute garbage."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"I have played this game like once. And I have question, why didn't they use any flying machine for deliveries."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"Excitement isn't a word I would use for that game. It's beautiful and inspiring and epic, but damn it is slow"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,😴 this game put me to sleep
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"I bought it a week ago and am about 20 hours in. It hasn't really snagged me yet, and I've started playing other stuff too, but I will keep at it. I know I enjoy these type of long games, though the BTs stress me out more than I had hoped they would."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"For me its the most interesting and special game I have ever played. I am not saying its GOTY or GOAT of gaming, but its one of the games I come back and will remember for a long time. Cant wait for next one."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,The movie with interactive elements.
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"Watching Higgs go from ghost-controlling goth-boy to cyber-clown with a lightning-guitar sword fighting a robot Samurai with some of the smoothest videogame choreography I've ever seen?

Sign me right the fuck up"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"I think it depends when you played it. When released it probably felt living with all people update structures, but when I played it I was probably alone because I had to build everything, so it broke the main point of the game. Still finished it though, not a bad game."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,Im looking forward to the sound track
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,Try dead space remake on a oled screen.
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"How, just tell me how to deal with this GAME ? I started 2 times , put sum of 20 hrs into it and I really wanted to like it, but just can get the feeling of it. It is seems just a work to me. Also make the travel annoying too you always have to be too careful where to go and how .

Is there a good way to play it ? Maybe just focusing on the story and making the minimal package delivery ?"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"It was one of three games to get me through lockdown (the other two being Animal Crossing and Red Dead Online). I loved the mechanics, and that 80% of the game play was just getting from one place to another without dropping your groceries. The player collaboration was also novel, and moving, building roads together. I could use some more of that right now."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"I remember when i played it first, i was out after 2 hours or so - didn't took the time and tried to carry just too much and fell on my nose constantly .. or got eaten by the goo, so frustration was high.

A year or two later and gone from PS4 to PS5 i thought i try it again and also got the Directors Cut for cheap on top of that... Played it thru in ""one go"" (aka not playing anything else beside) and had a blast.

So yeah, i guess i'll tune in on Part 2 aswell."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"I love the game, but once I beat the story, built the roads, and got a star from every location, I felt like there was nothing else worth doing."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,Personally and I might get a lot of hate for this.. I skipped all the cutscenes and only played the game for the gameplay and had an amazing time!
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"I'm not a person to really appreciate any sort of art, but that game is probably as close as it gets for me. The visuals, story and soundtrack selection just gives of a very specific vibe. Going into it completely blind, clueless about any aspects of that game, definitely 100% worth it."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"still cant get into this game at all. SO boring..to me.  But glad it has a good fanbase and hope more people try out these ""weird"" games"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"I want to play this game. I really do. I mean I hear its cool, & I even got it for free on Epic a few months ago.

But damn I just cant bring myself to install it. I dont see how I can like it. Im just lile a Fedex guy running stuff around with a baby on my back or something right? It just doesnt seem like it'd be fun...."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,100%
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-29,Hell yeah
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-29,Upvoted because name of game is in title. Thanks for not triggering me.
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,Deliveroo simulator with amazing music and long cut scene...
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,Not too many share this opinion but I found the game spectacular!
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,It has the greatest atmosphere of any game I’ve ever played. Thought I’d hate it because I’m usually an action RPG player. Running around the world and listening to the music was honestly the best part of the game.
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"Hot take: This game was such a huge disappointment. Walking simulator with cringey and overly overt references to connections/relationships. Like the poem of a teenager who thinks they're subtle and deep, but it really is just pure cringe and shit."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"lame story, good gameplay."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,Will this be sponsored by Monster Energy Drink again?
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"I got the first one free with a brand new gaming laptop with an RTX card in it (obviously to show off the card).

I had to wait a few weeks for the game to be released, and then installed it and played it.

No doubt, the game was VERY pretty and ran really well on my laptop.

I'm not a fan of cutscenes, but I let them play out because they were *engine* cutscenes (i.e. the computer was rendering them, they weren't pre-rendered).

About 2-3 hours in, I realised that I'd done almost nothing but walk forward and then get lost, and then walk forward.  I started cancelling the cutscenes (which is really difficult because it tends to just skip to the next ""scene change"" in the cutscenes, so you're often clicking 10-20 times to get rid of a single cutscene.

Even then... I couldn't find any gameplay.  I'm sure there's some somewhere.  I just didn't have the free time any more to bother to find it.

It was at that point that I stopped playing and uninstalled the ""game"" and never touched it ever again.

Instead I went and played games I was previously unable to, where I was thrown into the action in the first 10 seconds."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"Bought the first game and won’t buy the second. Death Stranding was boring and pretentious, indefensibly bad gameplay, 0 effort in the world. Asset flip with cutscenes in between"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"I don't know, I found it quite disappointing if I'm being honest. I'm a massive kojima fan, MGS made up most of my childhood.  

But this, it was 3 hours of cutscenes, 35 hours of 'walk from A to B', followed by another 35 hours of cutscenes.  

Yes, later in the game walking from A to B got easier due to better equipment, but the land felt to lifeless and baron.

I'm hesitant to pick up 2."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,Completed it twice. I guess I just enjoy the grind of building roads and getting deliveries to people.
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,I wonder if any Porter made level 500 in all the delivery ratings yet.
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"Me too. Also… *whispering* idgaf about GTA. 

Excuse me, I must now banish myself from civilized society."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"What do people like about the game?

I was excited for it. Then I played it and it's just stacking shit on top of each other. Like whut."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,The mood in Death Stranding is unique. I can sense your excitement hope the movie is as good as everyone is expecting!
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,I understand why everybody was bored with this game but I had a great time. Pumped for the next one.
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-29,"It's 50% off on steam right. I finally decided to get it. Initially I heard a bunch of bad things about this game being a ""walking sim"" but as more time goes by I keep seeing people talk about good experiences. Time to check it out."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,Saw this post literally as I am loading the first game up for the first time. Watching the cut scene right now when the dude is on his bike with the birds flying over head.
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,Bro just get a doordash job
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"Same, it was the main reason for me to buy a PS5."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"Slow pacing might not be alot of people's cup of tea but man this franchise is so underrated not every game got to be action packed but something about the first game just gives me some peace when I play it it annoys me when people call it walking simulator because every big game franchise is walking simulator example Crash bandicoot,Super Mario bros,Sonic etc."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"I like this game too...but I suck at video games. I got to the other map (not sure how far into the game I was), then gave up when I still couldn't understand the menus."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,Mario and Princess Beach
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"I had forgotten to take any annual leave the year that came out, and my annual leave days were due to reset in October and it was August, and I had a whole month I was going to lose if I didn't take it. I guess thanks to my line manager who allowed me to take the whole of September off at very short notice, I spent almost all of it playing DS. I'm honestly not sure if I regret it, and I'm not sure if I understand the story (what the fuck was with the giant lady on the beach?), but at the time I really clicked with it - the pacing of discovery, it just forced me to slow down and chill out at a very stressful time in my life. Totally bizarre, but I liked it. Similar to the top comment, I don't think i can play ds2. I'm already dreading final fantasy 7"

It's one thing not to like a game because it's not your type of game, but to say it sucks is dumb. Probably the same type of people that don't like movies that don't have a lot of  action lol"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"Man, the game is crazy af. I just went it totally blind as of 5 days. BB’s, chiral particles, Sam Bridges Porter working for Bridges, BT’s what the hell it stands for, falling down when in the forest, then having a rest at one of the bases and getting ready and balancing gear for another walk out. I have no freaking idea what’s going on, but I’m really into it."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"Hope Kojima finds a good co-writer because the first game narration and story wre unbearable.

The gameplay was dope tho, one of the best gaming experience, just like every Kojima game."

1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"I'm playing through Death Stranding for the first time, and I've just got the mission for Port Knot City. Narratively it's been sorta low key but I already see comments on society, cultural norms, that weird Kojima-style way of pulling out one idea to an extreme (the lore of the MULEs), the fact that Sam looks like one of those medieval-Japan cartoon-style couriers with all the stuff on his back is comedic - though the balancing act stuff isn't always particularly enjoyable. It's a great narrative so far. Not sure what that narrative is yet, but I'm interested to find out."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"I thought it looked awesome and then when I went to play it , I just couldn’t get into it, gave it a solid hour or two but nah . Not for me . 
However I’m always here for the excitement of a new game coming out kinda feeling"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,Death Stranding is a blast. It was such a fresh concept. I’ve had my head in the sand so I didn’t know there was even talk of a second.
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,I wish I could have gotten into this game. People say it’s a masterpiece and I don’t doubt that. But I just was so bored I didn’t even risk my time.
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,Funny thing is i enjoyed the calm and relaxed feeling and having to plan out your route but at the second half of the game they just throw enemies at you that you can't sneak past then i stopped after that
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"The exploring and delivery parts of this game seemed awesome. The story and combat parts seemed horrible.

If someone ever made a mod for it that stripped out all of the Kojima nonsense, I think I would love this game."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"I find OP's sentiment a bit weird. Primarily because while I enjoyed the first game, I don't think the 2nd will really add much. Yeah we'll see a new map, which is going to be good but idk, there isn't *another* game that is that exciting? Lol.  
  
I think maybe if the story was good or something I could understand being hype but Kojima unchained is too whacky when it comes to story telling. So, at least to me, there's only the gameplay to look forward to and while delivering packages is a lot of fun, I wouldn't describe my feelings toward the sequel as being hype, especially because I don't see how there will be much improvement."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"My most anticipated game. It was KCDII until recently but now it’s DS2. Since Kojima owns the IP now, I hope it means PC will get it day 1 as well."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"The crying BB made me quit the game unfortunately, it stressed me out too but as a parent."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,Idk...Ive done Postmates and Uber Eats..... It's very meh.
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"i just didn't love Death Stranding. I'm like, who's idea was it to force us to carry around a baby on our back?! And a crying baby at that. lol"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-29,"This moment from the screenshot is so damn beautiful in the first game... Right when Asylums for the Feeling starts playing.


This moment and ""Bones"" are still etched in my brain ever since I played it in 2019. They're top tier just as Red Dead Redemption's musical moments."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-29,I just could not stand endless cutscenes every time I enter the base or do anything. Maybe should give it another try though
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-29,"I was so disappointed with this game I didn't even bother watching the trailer for the sequel.

Awful gameplay. Boring story. I never felt a ""strand"" between me and other players. It just felt like I was playing an online Minecraft server where everyone else was offline and just left their shit everywhere."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,I hope they at least announce new flavor of monster energy in this ad.

1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,Not sure that excitement is the right word
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"Excitement? I don't think I've ever heard anyone use that word in relation to this game.

Ftr, I have no hate for the game I've just genuinely never heard it called exciting."

1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,I just couldn't get into this game. A walking simulator is not what i expected this game to be. Im sure its a good game if you can get past all the walking.

And even then, it may be just to have something on the second monitor.

Apocalypse UPS man was an interesting concept for sure but it's definitely a super niche game."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"I \*really\* want to enjoy this game but I just can't, and it for one reason only, the BTs.

Everything else is a 10, I love the atmosphere, the environmental puzzle, talking to people, it's all fantastic. But when I am literally forced to slow down to a crawl because the game decided it's oil people time, the game loses me, I don't want to start walking slowly and possibly lose all of my stuff, it's boring at best and tedious at worst and it happens way too often for me to not care."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-29,"It's an incredibly atmospheric game bogged down by, no, not the weight of your backpack, but the 25 million unskippable and annoying codec calls telling you the most obvious and boring shit over and over again. I hope to never hear the sound or Guillermo del Toro saying ""Sam!"" again"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-29,"The best thing about it was Mads Mikkelsen. Beyond that, the game put me to sleep. It also didn't help that every character in the game was some celebrity that Kojima knows. It's just not my kind of game."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-29,"I was excited for this when it was announced but I've looked at lots of videos for it and to be brutally honest, it just looks as dull as dishwater. I havn't seen a single video about it that showed any excitement at all! It just seems a seriously boring game."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"Right, is this literally just walking or is there more to it?"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"Oh boy, walking...."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,You know you can go for walk in real life right? And far less exgausting one.
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,This can barely be called a Game. Its just boring trash.
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,Man likes to watch paint dry and call it exciting too lmao
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"serious question. what excitement? I really dont get that game. it looks like a walking simulator, with a popular actor as main protagonist. what IS the actual gameplay loop and why can you be excited with this screenshot?"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"Ahh yes, the game that prevents me from preordering anything ever again. Even Kojima can release a stinker 😭"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,Kojima used to be great but now he’s everything wrong with the medium. Hollywood name dropping? Check. Hire established actors who don’t need the fame or money? Check. 4 hour long cutscenes? Check. He should go hang with his Hollywood buddies and start making movie.
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-29,"This game is really boring .
People that liked it are probably pot heads  like kojima."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"Yeah it’s a unique and interesting game… but I’m hyped for GTA 6, pretty sure you can walk in that game too!"

1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,It's so funny you say exciting when it's literally 90% just walking but honestly it is so fucking good at walking. Literally dude figured out how to make walking a fun mechanic that wasn't just silly like QWOP. I love figuring put a route and being a lil Postman.
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,Death stranding is actually already the second strand-type game after Knack 2
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,Beeg if true.
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,My favorite moment was climbing that mountain in a blizzard. Felt like I was physically there.
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"When the song starts, omg... Such a beautiful moment"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"I thought I didn’t enjoy the game, but I beat it the first time with a “meh” review on release.


I replayed it for the directors cut on Steam a couple years later hoping to see some changes. There aren’t many, but all of sudden the game clicked for me. It’s like golf: you see how efficiently you can get to the goal with as little effort as possible. It requires planning and utilizing left over help from the online world."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"I played the game during deep COVID and man did it hit different, like Kojima time travelled from the future to base all the themes around the pandemic.

A fantastic game if you know what you’re going to play and like that sort of thing. I totally get everyone bummed it wasn’t another MGS action fest, but I loved this post apocalyptic Amazon delivery driver simulator"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,The song it starts to play too is great. Fits the mood perfectly. The soundtrack is low-key a banger while never doing anything besides ambience.
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"And the fight that ensues when you get there is what got me sold on the franchise. The story was a god dam masterpiece of wtf, but no other game has given me the level of anxiety as Death Stranding has when you have to go through an entire area full of BT's."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"Yeah. I really need to get back to my replay. I had just gotten past that when life stuff distracted me. 

Such an amazing game"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"That BT area reduced my life expectancy by 10 years not gonna lie… I ran out of all piss and shit grenades

When I saw that hill and song kicked in, I must have sprint the entire section."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-30,"The sheer amount of exposition killed it for me. At one point after like the tenth hologram in a row I actually yelled, ""oh my God, shut the fuck up!"""
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-29,This game sucks lol
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"""Hey, let's give some of the most complicated and unnecessarily big worded dialogue to someone who clearly cannot speak English, and give her a whole quest where she talks non stop about complete nonsense. Yeah they'll love that.""

(The Chiral Artists daughter is clearly someone who is not typically a voice actress)"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"I honestly thought the story was supposed to be super campy, so I enjoyed it through the whole thing."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"If you haven't played them, the Metal Gear Solid games are spectacular, with a much more tolerable level of weirdness. Also, I've never thought MGS felt fucking dumb, whereas the 'Princess Beach' and similar lines were so bad I'd prefer someone walk in on me watching porn than these cutscenes"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,">Kojima's brand of weirdness in narrative and dialogue just never did it for me

I haven't played it, but this is also why I don't plan to. The story and dialogue just seem so dumb and artificially complicated."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"I'll be straight with you, I did not particularly like it when I played. It's not for everyone. My impression was very much that it was primarily just walking and awkwardly trying to balance packages. There was some combat that I hated. Some of the stealth sections were okay but not fun enough to keep me interested. Also just a bunch of weird, nonsensical shit scattered all over the game and the story. Overall not particularly impressed by this game. Just to give you a different perspective because I know anytime someone says they're apprehensive about a certain game there'll be like five hundred people telling you it's great. By all means try it but if you don't like it, nothing wrong with that."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,Runs great on deck btw
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"that is what it is. sure, it is more in depth like having to turn yourself to balance the weight whenever you make a turn and managing weight/equipment. But thats pretty basic considering walking around making deliveries IS the gameplay, kinda like how a racing game is going to have more detailed driving than GTA. So if that doesnt sound fun, its not going to be

some people get really into the story but its classic japanese/kojima weird randomness so very subjective if youll enjoy it"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"It sounds boring but it actually isn’t. It’s not just walking, it starts by first guessing what the best route would be, where can I cross the water? Can it climb over that ridge or do I take the longer route around it? But also how much stuff can I bring? Do I bring extra ladders/ropes or weapons? Then the actual walking is also kinda neat, getting over steep hills requires some coordination and skill. 

Then as the game progresses you get access to more gear and can start building roads and stuff so you do some resource management.

At the same time you also have to avoid or fight enemies.

As a bonus there is also an off the walls story that only Kojima could come up with.

Great game and one of the most unique ones I’ve played but I can imagine it is not for everyone"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"Recently completed my 2nd playthrough of Director's Cut on the LCD Steam Deck. 100+ hours, no issues. Can run offline, online features give you the 'connection' with other players."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"Don’t buy it, it sucks. It’s 10h cutscenes with a 40h walking sim. Some terrible boss fights in between"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-29,"I'm a Kojima fan myself, played every MGS title for at least 5 times, but I couldn't get into Death Stranding myself. I had to put it down after 15 hours.. it just didn't click."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"it is 100% a walking simulator with janky controls and a pretentious story.

that being said, obviously lots connect with it. it puts some ambient melancholic music over a good landscape and people love it. plus, add a confusing story that might seem grand in scope and thoughtful, and a lot of people are going to eat it up. not to mention Kojima exclaiming he created a new genre 😂

i am excited to see what DS2 looks like. Kojima is the most talented hack in the industry!"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"It's really slow. Even once I got the motorcycle the game was really slow, it doesn't have shit for charge. Slowly walking through the BTs is more annoying than suspenseful. Combat sucks. Slowly walking down the hills to keep from falling over, slowly walking through the water to keep from falling over. Everything is just a bunch of walking slowly, then picking up all your damaged packages and walking slowly some more. Graphics are great, story is weird and cool. It's probably the worst well-done game I've played. I got it for free, put 20 hours into it and it was probably fun for 15 minutes total. 

If you want a really slow game that looks cool, this is your jam."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-29,"I think the only 'real' appeal this game has is the design/setting. A ''new'' world to learn about, lore, it's characters and their 'development' and the main character's backstory. How it ties in with the overall story etc.

The gameplay itself isn't that interesting and quite bland instead."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"personally this game single handedly carries getting PS+ Extra, i was never gonna buy it myself knowing it could be a walking sim but game seriously does a nasty nasty job at getting you hooked on doing what you may few as “the least”"

Don't worry, H5N9 is coming."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"I played this and Metro Exodus back to back, just when I thought I couldn't cry as hard as I did in Exodus final mission, then Death Stranding's final delivery came, what a game, but yes, I can see that not many people will like it, but if anyone want to give it a try, keep in mind that the 2nd half of the story is a lot better than the first half, so you won't be disappointed if you're patient enough to get into the good part."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"Wasn’t a fan of the monsters and the whale etc 

Prefer it to be slightly more grounded but understand how Kojima used it as a plot point"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,">I probably won’t have the time to immerse myself in the sequel the way I did with DS, since I had a lot of down time during covid

Haha me too. This and Jurassic Park evolution literally kept me from having a mental breakdown during covid after I was let go and spiralling a bit before getting onto a university course to respec. Just giving small achievable goals."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"Yeah on paper it should not work and it's not like the game is any different than advertised ""you plot a route, walk it and deliver a package"" that is what you do, but God it's so... addictive, it's fun, it's a little dopamine hit every package delivered and a horrible tragedy when you drop something. Honestly if they cut out all the ghosts and baby and extraneous Kojima-ness of it all it would still be a fun walking game."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,I put it off for a long time because the concept just sounded so bland. I finally took the dive when it was on discount and I was sucked in almost immediately. The soundtrack is the best game soundtrack ever to me for how much it made the moments in the game feel epic.
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"The moments, when you're walking into a new area and the music kicks in at full volume - *chef's kiss*"

1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,Wish every other game made walking as fun as it was in Death Stranding. Survival games for example could take so many inspirations from how you moved your character.

1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"focusing on story is what i did until Work 2, then you can connect everywhere so that your roads are easier, do deliveries that up your stars and unlock level 3 items and stuff, you can the necessary bulk of your road done before chapter 3 ends as long as you unlock the chiral map. also im sure world 1 has unlocks i skipped since World 1 is harder than World 2 with roads"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-29,"It's a game set in an apocalypse where most people are living in shelters due to random rains that rapidly age anything they touch, along with random appearance of monsters composed of anti-matter. This makes normal travel impossible and extremely dangerous, to the point that even ONE person dying to a monster results in a ""voidout"" basically an explosion of nuclear proportions.

Which is where you come in as one of the few people that can deliver life saving materials to the many remote locations. A lot of the travelling at the start is on foot, but as you progress in the game you unlock the ability to create vehicles, build roads and other tools like ladders that facilitate faster and safer travel across things like rivers, as well as ziplines which are extremely satisfying to plan, build, and use.

It's not a game packed with nonstop action, so I can see why a lot of people with low attention spans bounce off of it, but the core gameplay of choosing orders, planning your route, building structures, avoiding (and sometimes fighting) enemies, and of course, safely reaching your destinations with all of your cargo (in good condition) is quite good."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"Not a hot take, everyone who saw what it was just moved on"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,They removed that from the directors cut so I’d guess the relationship is over lol
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"definitely anything but pretentious, i was scared of that too and am thoroughly surprised."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"You probably shouldn't, as what you said makes it clear it's not for you. But, hey, the man is still young, maybe his next IP could unite Kojima fans once again"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"you ever beat mgs4? or 5 and peace walker? 
Because it ain't much different, except you have more stealth and less go from A to B, while DS is the other way around. But what you described is also applicable to 4,5 and pw"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"casual aint really the word, specially taking into account the survival horror elements, boss fights, stealth parts and gun fights. I wouldn't call it chill to try to deliver things while dealing with all that "
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,Well the crazy thing is that they somehow managed to make that fun (or at least interesting).
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"This comment screams ""I only play twitchy shooters"".

And that's allright, just don't think your perceived way of being excited is the only one."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,right? but hey some people think being a fake border officer is peak gaming (Glory to Arstotzka)
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"It is if you get what the gameplay loop is about or overall like the style of it

I was literally hooked to play every day and make deliveries

Its pretty mad that the man made a game which gameplay is built around walking fun"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-29,">and don't encourage you to be perfect with the goddamn S ranking system

That's the whole point of the S rank though. You don't need to get it to finish the game."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-29,"It's part of the challenge, and a lot of the game mechanics are around helping you get around them faster. You sound like a journalist."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"You need to deliver x from place A to place B. That's the goal. 

But there are no checkpoints between A and B. So it's like planning out a camping trip. Plan for items you need. Paths you should take. What happens if the weather turns. And how to balance the items you need to deliver. While allowing space to pick up items you find on the way. 

The planning a trip is incredibly fun and rewarding."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"Apparently, at some point, you also get a motorcycle. I don't know. I gave up after 6 hours, after I've spent 40 minutes on a ridiculous delivery walk and then got killed or something by something I couldn't even see.

1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"Kojima never lied about wanting to direct movies, but with games he built a wat better medium to express his ideas, even before MGS1."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"If you think he should make movies you never played a Kojima game.

1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"My jaw was through the floor when (spoiler) the network dropped and you had to traverse through most of the map without anything built or left by other players its so powerful to realise how much you were relying on each other throughout the entire game. Nothing made me reflect on the actual world quite like that moment because it’s the same, we each build stuff to solve our problems but then all use what others built an it’s so easy to get used to it and take it as natural but it really isn’t. I was spamming likes on every rope and ladder as much as I could since haha"

1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"Yeah, the ending does it for me when BB's theme started playing. I cried a little. 🥲"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,I still listen to the album lol so good
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"The rope and knots finally hit me similarly, and I made considerable efforts to build and maintain structures for a period of time. 

The subtle concept of it being an open world multiplayer while still being single player also hits deep, because we are only actually responsible for our individual lives and choices but participating in the social contract and being involved with each other is what makes the game (vicariously life) easier for everyone, ourselves included, and we feel better for it. 

I dunno, when cliff handed you to yourself (and in such handed BB as a grandparent to a new parent) as he died and the moment of realizing each of our parts in the process of progress and our responsibility to each other and each generation just fell on me like a ton of feathers. It was still heavy, but not conceptually the same as a ton of bricks if that makes sense. I can't not tear up thinking about it. Just weird."

1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,Exactly every rpg game is walking until a boss battle these gamers just have no attention span its sad to see you can tell they're just kids to tho so I'm going to allow them haha.
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,I played only a few hrs but isn't the walking just press forward and hold both shoulder buttons to keep balance? I really thought it would be a little more involved
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,Bro thought he did something with kiddo
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,I said one word and you judge me?  Get bent.

1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,I’m playing the Director’s cut and had no idea what this comment was about.  Honestly even the presence of an energy drink to restore stamina is a bit of a turn off.  A sponsored drink is a bit too on the nose.  I’m glad that’s out.

1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"It's not though, because at least with the metal gear games you have options of how to approach a situation, whether you want to go all in, or sneak around.  

DS is literally 'here's some boxes, go from A to B'. The combat is minimal until towards the end of the game and even then it's just repetitive 'oh no, slime ghosts/monsters'.  

As someone pointed out, it's obvious the game isn't for me, even though I did end up finishing it a few days after release."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"Yea, about as “fun” as a root canal"

if a challenge has tools to get rid of it, it's not a good challenge and adds nothing to a gameplay.

It's like saying ""oh ye there's a guy that stops you every 10 seconds in Forza but you can shoot him"" and? I still don't like that I need to stop to begin with, what's the point of adding the guy if all it does is mess with the gameplay flow.

This is what BTs are to me. They don't \*add\* anything, they're just making gameplay slower and more tedious. You get nothing by engaging with them but lose everything if you do not engage in the forced stealth mission they provide."

It’s pretty damn clever as a gameplay mechanic, further solidifying Hideo Kojima as the David Lynch of video games."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"Ha, fair enough. I find MGS to be charmingly stupid which is part of the appeal. Never to the extent of rolling my eyes and cringing at the same time, though. 

Mind you, I still think DS is a masterpiece, but Kojima needs people to pull on his reins."

1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"Oh sweet, so Death Stranding's map has a complex layout full of secrets and unique encounters? Deep and versatile build variety? Combat that challenges you and let's you choose your own playstyle? Loads of stuff to collect?

I've never played it, I was under the impression that you mostly just walk and watch nonsense cutscenes."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"It's not about finger dexterity on holding you balance, it's more about decision making while walking. Where to step, where to cross a creek and how to pack your load and such."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"Not really. That's mostly to keep your balance on flat surfaces. 

For example, when you lose your balance while running that only makes you fall forward on your face. Or when you are hiking and you have to go sideways, you'll have to balance with one hand touching ground. Also based on how rough the terrain is you can gauge how much running Sam will endure before losing balance and you can run longer distances when you let go of forward button for a second. 

You are right though, it could be even better, but it's way better than just pressing W for 15 minutes."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"If you're creating a world it's pretty easy to come up with a lore reasons which basically just reads ""fuck you, that's why"" :D"

There is still a lot to open up in terms of equipment and that, but If you genuinely dont feel like its fun and the story is the only thing keeping you, just watch the story on youtube

Even if you want to go guns blazing you can kill mules, but you have to cremate the bodies and transport them.


So what you're describing doesn't add up. 


also  DS combat and mechanics and some animations are very close to mgs5 even though the engine is different. cheers"

>if a challenge has tools to get rid of it,  it's not a good challenge 

Tool don't get rid of them, they're for dealing with them, a BIG difference. That's like saying weapons in games are dumb because they help you kill monsters.

>You get nothing by engaging with them

Completely wrong. You get a tonne of Chiral Crystals and that for a brief time, Timefall in that area will stop. So, it can sometimes be quicker than dodging and weaving through them and can clear the way for certain deliveries.

You definitely haven't played the game."

Look, you enjoyed, good for you, I'm not gonna go to the Steam forums or anywhere and shit on it.

But the bigger point is, I think just about EVERYONE agrees there is a LOT of silliness and cheese in the MG series. And that's a MAJOR part of the charm. 

It's VERY odd to hear someone claim ""MGS never felt dumb"" when the dumb portions are such a big component of what makes it feel special."

1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"He is trying to make a point that compared to something like Elden Ring, the actual walking is the gameplay loop. In other games, the path to the destination is pretty much a boring walk without proper dangers in the way and the destinations are what makes those games good. This game instead is built around GOING to a place and so it makes a on paper: A to B walking gameplay incredibly fun

So yes, it is a walking simulator, but there is so much more to it than hold W

A game doesnt need to have builds and variety and collectible filled map to make gameplay good

TBH game devs should look at Death Stranding and see that sometimes its enough to make an otherwise dumb gameplay mechanic entertaining and unique

Just to make sure, I am not throwing off that Death Stranding is a 10/10 flawless experience which it definitely isnt and that is the most unique thing out there and that there arent other games that have entertaining exploring. BUT, It is something other studios should take something from and know that they dont need to make every game Elden Ring or Witcher 3 like to be succesful and good"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,Bro you're not getting the positive point I'm trying to make there's no need for your sarcasm everyone's has there type of game but just because Death Stranding isn't Elden Ring etc doesn't mean its bad I don't know how clearer I could explain my opinion that everyone has there type of game and not everything got to be over the top or action packed chill.
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"Solid explanation. I also think this is one of those games where your choice of difficulty matters a lot. I see a lot of people complain about games being boring but then find out they're playing on easy mode where the mechanics are so watered down that it almost stops feeling like a game. 

Personally, Death Stranding set to anything other than hard and very hard gets pretty dull and starts to hit that ""walking simulator"" description that naysayers often gives it"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,😂 true
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"Hmm.. Not sure I expect anything. Perhaps longer missions with a little less stress from BTs and MULEs? I love the hiking/walking aspect. 

I suspect I'll beat it. It's not unusual for me to play multiple games at once and keep coming back around to them. 

I appreciate your replies. Don't sweat the downvotes. I swear bots go around and downvote everything."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"Dude I played it nearly 5 years ago. Forgive me for not remembering every single detail. I remember fighting a dude on the beach, then there was a silly little segment where you a tekken style fight with him and also the floating 5 bodies as part of a cinematic"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-30,">and that for a brief time, Timefall in that area will stop

wow no raining, fantastic

  
I have played the game, I simply dislike the BTs as a mechanic."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,Yeah building the zipline across the map was so much fun.
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"I did that too! I like to walk everywhere once and then, if I don't have to walk, use other means to traverse. It's especially rewarding to build a zipline over tall peaks."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"Lmao same, i have a complete zipline park around the souther mountainous area. I never build anything other than roads, but i had my chirap network completely full multiple times just from making ziplines"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"> MGS2 had some real eye roll moments

Laugh, and grow fat"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"I mean yeah, there are.


Even though, there aren't so many of people kinda forget how serious the series is. 


Like you have NATO killing childs in a bombing in a game that came out in the first 90s"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-29,"Kojima can say what he needs to not get sued, sure, but he still named the character what he did. He’s John McClane from Die Hard."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"As a big introvert and a gamer, I also enjoyed the lockdown. Plenty of time to game and enjoy some peace away from people. Though it sucked that a lot of people died."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"game does a dangerously good job at keeping you confused, hooked, and motivated whilst having you doing what some would describe as pretty menial tasks gameplay wise, definitely give it a try and don’t be afraid to watch a cutscene and then be like “im too tired” and come back another time, im not finished myself and sometimes i get like that to where im like damn you had me enough energy to play but sat me thru a lil movie right there, but alas the walking sim meme shit just doesn’t give it enough credit."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,Steam? I got it free on epic
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"Again, haven't played the game, but what you've said here makes a lot of sense and I can get behind it.

But if that's the point the person I was replying to was trying to make, it wasn't clear in the slightest."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,“BRO STOP YOU’RE NOT UNDERSTANDING MY VAGUE STATEMENT BROOO 😭😭”
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,Nothing in the comment I replied to even slightly alluded to anything in this one.
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,It also becomes much more fun the more you play and understand what you can do with the balancing. I think I played it on Normal setting and was going to play it on the hardest with no HUD when I beat the game. But playing with zero HUD was too much.
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"I would actually say keep up then! The game wont really have less MULEs and BTs, actually more maybe,but you will get so much more equipment that it will be easier to make routes dodging the BT and MULE zones"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-31,"Yes, being able to avoid Timefall is a huge benefit, as you can move quickly through the area without worrying about your packages getting damaged.

Plus, it's really telling how you ignored the other benefits as well."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,First thing I built was a zip line to bypass the forest of BTs by the wind farm and after that I had to build them wherever I could. I should play again…
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"For sure. That's huge part of its charm. It's EXTREMELY heavy. And silly. Cynical and sentimentally cheesy. Kojima is all about playing with those contrasts.

Which is what I've continued to enjoy in Death Stranding. Hope we still get a few more series out of Kojima in his life."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-29,So in another timeline he could be called Policeacademy4citizensonpatrolman.
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-29,That's some r/LowStakesConspiracies nonsense right there.
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,Nah gifted
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,It's not about understanding. it's a simple conclusion. You're clearly a child. If you can't see that.
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"Again, we are just going of topic listen it's not so simple to understand there's racing games, ya just race, do you complain then? There's the same shooters that are released every year, like Call of Duty, and people still buy them. Do you complain then? There are sports games with the concept of the sport like ufc or fifa etc do you complain then? But with death Stranding is just a slow pace adventure game it's that simple to understand. You can't just watch a horror movie and then get angry because it's not a comedy. Everything is different, and it's just fine if it's not for you, but it doesn't mean others can't enjoy it. Just like how life can't change, just for you get on with it and pick something else."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-29,"When playing without HUD, you eventually figure out when to press the balance buttons based on Sam's body language XD"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"Yeah, that started my project too. Fuck that forest lol"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-29,Kojima is too much of a coward.
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,“MOM THEY EXPECT ME TO EXPLAIN MYSELF IN DETAIL LIKE AN ADULT 😭😭 THEN IM JUST LIKE YOU ARE A CHILD IF YOU DONT UNDERSTAND 😂😝🤣”
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"I didn't complain at any point. I think maybe you should reread my comment. I don't think the game looks very good, but I might be wrong - that's why I was asking you to explain what you meant. None of that is me complaining, because why would I? I haven't paid for the game, I've lost nothing.

I just think 'every RPG is just a walking simulator' is a dumb point. In most games, the walking is what you do to get to the fun stuff, and ideally the exploration is fun in itself because the map is complex and curiosity is always rewarded. In Death Stranding, the walking seems to be the whole point: from what I can gather you're expected to find fun in the act of walking itself. 

I can see that working in a game like Mario or Spiderman where the traveral is fantastical, but in a game where the traversal is supposed to be realistic, I don't see the point unless there's something else special going on?"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-29,It is fun to start shit with the forest BTs with an late game arsenal though.  Eat blood missiles you dolphin bastard!!
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"Why are you pissed off over a simple conversation? How else am I meaning to explain something so simple and by the way you're replying I can tell you're angry I made a valid point on a reddit post lol, and once again people like you are giving reddit a immature atmosphere have a good day and ask your parents to buy you the new call of duty for Christmas."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"How am I coming of like a douchebag when I'm replying to the guy replying to me in quotes? Honestly use your head it's not that simple to understand genres and slow pacing it's that simple ye lot are getting upset because I'm trying to give a positive opinion to people that start giving hate first on this and then can't take the facts but I'm the douchebag no it's just called simple logic.

Edit: 
(A guy just Deleted he's comment imagine calling me a douchebag just because he's trying to explain genres) it's actually hilarious how easy it is to upset people on reddit minute you make a valid point lol"
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"pissed off? Angry? Lol I wrote two mocking sentences each comment. Took 20 seconds at most each time.

You fill in the gaps from what other people say and assume things about them that are incorrect. Then you expect people to correctly fill in the gaps of your original vague statement.

Have fun with all of that. You have a lifetime of friendship and healthy relationships ahead of you."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,It's called a genre grow up and just realise something simple if it's not for you that's completely fine now get on with your day all you're doing is just dragging something to nowhere and doing nothing but make yourself look childish it's not that deep.
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-28,"Right back at you, bud. It’s not that deep. Go be upset about actually important stuff."
1ic059j,2025-01-28,2025-01-29,How am I the upset 1? You came at me angry first😂
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,So basically there's the Extinction Entity that must destroy all life but she changed her mind because of love.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,It‘s Mario and Princess Beach. Simple.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,It would be more unusual if you did.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"I played that game through twice , 70 hours of gameplay. 

Magnificent, beautiful, I have no idea what's going on."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"Not at all. It's a very convoluted and often unnecessarily complicated/not-complicated story.

It's funny how it can sometimes be really confusing, yet people are often named so comically simple things like Deadman, because he's not technically alive, and Heartman, because his heart has problems, or Die-Hard Man, because he.. well, dies hard, man."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"Kojima is not known for straightforward and coherent story telling, so it's not weird at all"
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"It's actually not that complicated, Kojima just has never told a single story in a normal way. 

Humanity discovers the afterlife and figures out they can use it for instant communication. Turns out, fucking with the afterlife is a bad idea. Eventually a huge disaster happens that causes time and space to be distorted. Some humans get weird ghost powers due to all this.

Humanity is in sharp decline and is basically going to go extinct. Amelia is the harbinger of that extinction and is supposed to use her weird ghost powers to destroy everything. The villain wants this to happen because he's a weirdo nihilist. Sam does not want this to happen because Amelia is basically his real mom because his actual mom was a shit mom. He saves Humanity with the power of love, giant water bears, and a lot of piss grenades. Due to this, the distortion of time and space ceases. 

There you go. That's the nutshell version with all the fat trimmed out."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,One does not simply 'understand' a Hideo Kojima game
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"It's like an onion and has layers to it
  
Spoilers ahead obv. 
 
There's the story of Fragile. Betrayed and used by hugs to blow shit up and make more baddies. 
   
There's the story of Sam that is super convoluted. All the ""feedback"" videos you see are not you BB s memories... They are yours.  The main bad guy that's chasing you for your BB?  No, he's chasing you but doesn't know it. 
  
There's the story of amelie, who isn't really real. She's from the other side. She's technically the final boss because this universe is falling apart. Even if you defeat her, she will be reborn and do her thing. 
 
The story of each of the named characters and even some bunker people have leanghty back stories. 
  
There is however, no story for ""lou"" she's just a random BB."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,me when i played kingdom hearts
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,death stranding is the kind of story where you don’t understand anything the whole way through and then you watch a youtube video of some dude explaining the plot and you still barely know what’s going on
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"Welcome to Kojima world. 


 But yeah I think I mostly got it, good plot twist at the very end."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,All I got from it was you’re upgrading everyone’s Wi-Fi.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,No one does and if they tell you they do run
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,I don’t think Kojima even knows what it’s about
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,The Ghost Technology part or the Infinitely Repeating Frankenbaby part?
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"I think there’s multiple levels to the story, the mundane moment to moment gameplay, the family dynamic, the other family dynamic, some side plots, and then a lot of that is filtered through Kojima crazy.  The main problem though, and I attribute this to any open world, it’s impossible to have a well paced story with player choice.

You’re going to be drawn to whatever it is you feel is your current objective and that doesn’t always align with a narrative beat.  Hours can pass in game between these isolated snippets of story, and if you’re a casual gamer, that could be weeks to months.  If it was easy to remember what happened episode to episode in series, shows wouldn’t cram “on last week’s episode” before the upcoming one.  You’re never given that level of courtesy in games."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"Not understanding the plot of Hideo Kojima games is, like, 90% of the charm of Hideo Kojima games."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"That’s a feature, not a bug."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,No that's typical Kojima game. The critics would say it's like emperor has new clothes situation while his fans will say it's still interesting even if you don't understand any of it
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"Not at all, I bowed out because the story was non-sensical to me and just pain weird, I mean one of your main weapons was poo\\pee bombs, so yeah."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"Honestly, nobody will blame you."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,Sometimes if I’m walking somewhere on my own (and haven’t brought headphones) I will pass the time by trying to summarise the story of Death Stranding to myself. It’s like a Zen exercise.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,It’s all fuckin mental. Babies in bottles can detect dead things that drag you into oil and morph into giant crazy things that kill you until you wake up in the sea and have to fly back into your body and look at a baby inside your throat and become alive again. All the while everyone still wants Wi-Fi and Amazon packages which you carry about like a bellend. Some mental porch pirates want your packages and will blow everyone up to get them and whales can fly even when they are dead. Simple really.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"It's nearly 16 years, I'm still trying to get my head round Liquid Ocelot. Don't blame yourself if you don't get Kojima stories."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,fact close resolute aloof full absorbed jar mighty act thumb
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,"I'd be more worried about the state of your mind if you understood it without an issue on your first playthrough.

It took two playthroughs for me to start understanding what exactly is going on.  

The story relies heavily on Sam being a plethora of coincidences rolled into one person. People like to throw ""Mary Sue"" around for any gifted individual in a story but Sam has just got it all. And it doesn't even come off as a bad thing because there are other people in the game that are far more gifted than he is but they seem to squander their potential by being melodramatic.

Sam's there to get shit done and everyone around him just wants to monologue."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,"Did you read most of the emails or whatever they are in the game? A lot of them elaborate on important stuff and helps you stitch it together. It's a pretty abstract game, definitely need to be paying attention."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,"It's not weird that you didn't understand it. As others have said, much of the in-game dialogue is quite vague. The actual nuts and bolts of the story are really primarily explained in the emails. Of course, I'd forgive you for not reading all those emails; it's fair enough to just watch a video summary online."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,What didn’t you understand about it? I didn’t find DS’ plot especially convoluted because there’s so much exposition with Deadman and Die Hardman that you just need to listen to.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"i doubt that even some of the people working on it didn't understand it. 

but i respect Hideo for being so bold to make something so abstract."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"No, it would be if you did"
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,It's a Hideo Kojima game.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,I played it through and had no idea what the hell was happening. I gave up trying to understand halfway through and just took in the cutscenes for the visuals and vibes. Great game though!
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,On the surface level it's incredibly simple. The problem is the deeper you dig the more nonsense and batshit Kojima lore you encounter. Personally I love it but it takes a certain degree of willingness to accept the absurd.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"The big reveal is two hour ending sequence. Lots of pieces come together there but you have to understand the pieces as you gather them, so to speak, throughout the game. It's really fascinating, and worth investigating more, like you're doing here."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"To actually answer your question, no. Not that it's super complicated but there's a lot there and you get more out of repeat exposures. 


Details you probably glossed over early in the game when you couldn't tell what information was and wasn't important are more visible on a second playthrough. Also with the basics in place you can think more about the themes of the game and less on the minutiae. "
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"I think the story can best be described with a meme comment I saw under a YouTube video of the trailer:

*Kojima: ""So, what's this game about?""*

*Interviewer: ""What?""*"
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,Its a Kojima Game ...half the story is in pickups / audio files and text documents
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"I didn't either but this game is the tits so I couldn't care.

This game and Tenet are two things I love a lot and don't really have much of an understanding of"
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,"Is it weird that you *don’t* understand the story of Death Stranding?

Is it weird… that you… do not understand the story of a game made by Hideo Kojima?

I got news for you. Hideo Kojima doesn’t even understand the story of Death Stranding. So no, it’s not weird. In fact, it would be extremely weird if you *did* understand it. Like, you would need to be locked up immediately if you did."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,no
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,Its fine. Kojima is crazy.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,Am I the only one who didn't understand anything and had to quit the game because all missions are just same? Become a delivery boy.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,I love Kojima and I'll play any game he creates. But ya it was hard to follow wtf was going on with the EE. But and maybe it's because I have a son now the ending fucked. Me. Up. Having to go to the incinerator for BB had me fucked up.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,"No, I don't think that's weird at all.

Every day I played that game I'd learn something new about the story, and at least half of the time when I play it the next day I find out that that new thing was actually bullshit. It was convoluted and it started making me laugh whenever the game would pull that shit on me."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-15,It would be weird if you did.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-18,[deleted]
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"It’s kind of stupid. I like MGS as much as the next guy, but why does anyone still let Hideo Kojima write stories anymore?"
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"No, it’s utter gibberish. 

Kojima has the narrative cohesion of a four year old on crank.

“And then, Die-Hard-Man says *NOOO!!!* but Sam is all cool and rides on his cool futuristic bike through the rain that makes time too fast for some reason.”

(No hate, I enjoyed it, and appreciate his enthusiasm, but goddamn is it just a pile of *stuff Kojima thinks is cool*, with no regard to anything making sense.)"
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,Anyone who says they understand it is just wrong. It's an incoherent mess. Your stepsister is the ghost of your mom but it's not her because it's a cosmic being bent on destroying life but it won't because it wants you to connect the wifi even though connecting the wifi is increasing how fubar everything is.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"""Even now, I don’t understand the game""  \~Kojima 

Anyone saying that they've got it all figured out is pretending they know more than the person who made it.   I see boasts from people saying ""pfft,  I understood it. Not hard""   Oh really?   Then why is there a baby in Sam's throat?"
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,It’s fine no one did
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,I understood pretty much everything of it but I did read the emails as I played and they explain a lot of important world things. The only things I didn't get were things like people casually talking about Sam being a repatriate when it's revealed end of the game he was the only one. (But I chalked it down as his mom and die hardman pretending like they were rare but a few were around to protect him) I think If you are not paying attention a lot of things will go over your head too. But definitely a hard to grasp game I agree
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"It's probably the most extreme case in gaming where the ""text logs"" are pretty essential to understand what's actually going on in the world, I didn't touch them in my first playthrough and was clueless. Read them during my second playthrough and there was a lot of detail in there that clarified things a lot"
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,"Wait, you mean the story wasn't, ""Oh... so *this* is why Konami was reluctant to give Kojima full creative control.""?"
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"It would be weird if you *did* understand the story of Death Stranding. At least, intuitively and at first glance."

1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"No, it's not odd. I get the gist, but I wasn't following closely. It's a Japanese video game, the odds of being able to understand the story are pretty low."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,I stopped paying attention to the story. Too convoluted and I didn't care enough.

Nah , it adds to replay value if you’re interested in it.  If not carry on and enjoy the gameplay."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"No. I like Kojimas games, but admittedly it's like something written by  a first semester economics major with ADHD."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"Yeah the game isn’t really about the story. In fact, I’d say the story is pretty… bad? I don’t know. Feel free to argue with me.

But that’s not what the game is about. The individual stories told within this convoluted and confusing world are what the game is about. The moments of vulnerability and human connection. The arc of a man alienated from everyone to the point where he’s literally allergic to human touch learning to trust and love again. These stories hit home even more with the insanely good casting, acting, and direction. 

Then there’s the actual social connection where you spend your time and hard earned resources to literally just help other people playing the game have an easier time. You build highways together, you build bridges and zip lines together. 

That’s what makes it a masterpiece. I wouldn’t give the game a 10/10, but I would consider it a masterpiece."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"It's a kojima game, so it's probably more surprising if you do understand it"
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"There is a 7 hour video from whitelight on YouTube if you want some more in depth explanation of the story.

1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,My favourite part of the plot is that the ancient Egyptians were right all along
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,It’s the usual for a Kojima production. He makes pseudo-interesting fever dream stories tied to fun and interesting gameplay.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,you'd be lying to yourself if you said you did
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,it's just nanobots
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,Death Stranding is just a long Star Trek episode
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,It's a Kojima game so no.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,I’m right there with ya
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,I understand only because I've played through the game like 4 times and have read every note and email meticulously lmao. No normal person I think would be able to understand what's going on just in a regular playthrough. My first one I remember being so confused lol
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,I'm replaying it right now and like...... man.... I'm just so confused. I'm enjoying my time! Don't get me wrong. But... I'm just trying to understand man.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,Not at all I feel you're weird if you can fully understand the lore of any of Kojimas games
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,I enjoyed it but yeah there are parts that were just not making sense. I suppose that’s how his games go though. At the first ending when on the beach and Amelie is going on and on… I’ve never heard so much dialogue that explains so little in all my life. It was truly fascinating.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,Be weirder if you did tbh
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,I'll be honest I'd probably think you were weird if you did understand the story
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,Connections.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"All I know is that water is bad, so I stopped showering. For safety reasons."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"I am playing right now, and the whole point is about forming connections with people. But whenever i play the missions these fuckers won't shut up. Every time i move i get the alarm and 'Sam..."" arrrgh!"
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"Just ends? It takes like 20 hours to end, I’ve never sat through anything like it ha ha.

I’m torn with Kojima, I love the passion, and the attention to gameplay details, and want him to continue making games till the end of days, but he could occasionally benefit from a filter and some help with editing."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,Thats just called getting Kojimbo'd
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,I think that the gameplay is really long
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"# Welcome to Kojima's world!

Still. Like everyone said, one does not simply understand a Kojima game, that's why we call him the Big Boss of gaming writing."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"It's written by literally the worst writer in the history of existence. MGS is somehow worse. Great game, incoherent trash story."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,It would be weird if you did understand the story.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,The expansive lore reveal was at heartmans place. Also there are droplets on information which it expects the player to link together themselves and come to independent conclusions.

Jvl"
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,I’ve not found the gameplay relaxing.. I’ve found it weirdly stressful. So much I can’t get into it
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"I watched a playthrough, didn't understand the story. Watched an explainer, didn't understand it. TBH, the game is beautiful and looks like it would be fun, but the plot makes no sense at all, to me. It felt like they came up with the phrase ""death stranding"" and then spent a bunch of effort to try to build a strange world around it."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"Sounds about right. I'm tempted to play it because the mechanics seem interesting, but I *loathe* the typical Kojima Bullshit"
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"Not at all, I found [this retrospective](https://youtu.be/zg2Y5rxlg-M?si=BWOUMoXd-ah1ad7a)which lasts a whopping 7 hours and does a good job of explaining the story and the background and I still don't get it fully.

I am thankful that a mind like Kojimas exists but it's crazy the way it works"
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,I don’t think Hideo Kojima even understands his games. Metal gears and samurais go brrrrrrr.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"It's not weird, but take it as motivation to read / view more complex and abstract stories."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"Literally just finished it tonight. I understand some of it, but not all of it. Still got some emails and stuff to read, though, so maybe that'll answer my questions.

I still don't get why time fall is a thing. It's cool, but I don't get it."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,No. Kojima loves to be overly convoluted for the sake of it.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,Couldn't bring myself to finish it but I guess they are saving the explanations for the sequel
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,No because it’s terrible.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,Hideo Kojima made the game. Its normal to not understand what makes no sense.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"It's not a literal story it's a metaphor on our condition and relationship with the Internet in a time of global warming. The extinction entity, to me, was in part a representation of our death drive and hatred of what we have become. This is stopped because at the end of the day we love each other and want to find another way. 

I do think the last act is just mumbo jumbo tho....but that's every Kojima game."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,That’s Japanese writing for you. I am similarly lost often with stories written by Japanese people.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,"More than 70 hours, all achievements, many things built to help out other players, I'm still confused about the story. I'm just happy to traverse difficult terrain, delivering packages and connecting people. Also, building stuff to help other players is so cool"
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,Neither did the cast.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,"No, not weird at all. The last third was a mindfuck."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,Mads.....(sigh)
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,Don't worry about understanding it too much. Feel it.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,Definitely not weird
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,It's a Kojima game. It would be odd if you understood it fully.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,"The acronym ""DOOMS"" Does not have an actual extrapolation. It is just named that to sound cool and also confusing."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,Kind of. Deadman and >!your sister!< both have like 20 minutes of cutscenes where they exposition through every plot point
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,It would be weird if you understood it. Its a kojima game after all.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,"Just keep on, keeping man"
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,It's mostly jibbirish
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,"It’s a Kojima game, enjoy the ride and don’t think too hard."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,"I kinda feel like you're not meant to do that with a Kojima game (more about the experience than anything else), but I have only heard about them off-hand so my perception is probably a bit skewed."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,Every cutscene I just get more wait what?!
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,"It's Kojima so no, not weird at all. Kojima probably doesn't even understand his own bullshit. The guy is in bad need of a co-writer and editor."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,"The story is mediocre at best


Everything else in the game is superb. The side stories when connecting shelters to the chiral network are actually better"
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,not that wird. I understood the story but can´t understand what makes the game good or fun but that just be as long as people like the game that´s totally fine.  Just not a game for me.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,[removed]
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,It's okay... It's just Kojima. It's just Kojima...
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,This whole thread makes me sad. The game's story and metaphors are wasted on most gamers.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,"You're Amazon in a post-apocalyptic America with Shadow beasts.


That's basically what I got out of it "
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-03-12,"I've played about 10 hours, so that's scratching the surface. I will say, however, that the writing is bad - I don't know if it's the worst thing I've ever seen, but the dialogue takes me away from the game. It makes me not want to watch the cutscenes. 

Every idea could've been better had it just been called something else.

""DOOMS""
""Chiral/Chiral Network"" 

It's pretty cringe - I want to believe in what I'm being shown but that's not what's happening for me. You could've just called DOOMS ""psychosis"" or chirality ""hands"" or even ""jazz hands"" and it would've been better than the bullshit here."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,I don't believe anyone that says they understand the stories of any Hideo Kojima game.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,>!Basically your sister is also your mother but like two different people but at the same time responsible for mass exctinction.!<
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,Thought that was the point xD
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,Eeeh the story is kind of up its own ass.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"I didn't play, but for what I've seen, you're a guy that delivers packages (and sometimes, flash drives) on foot for some reason, but the mean mountains won't let you do it. There's also a baby (might be DLC) that you have to deliver, I guess. The rain also seems to delay the deliveries somehow. People cry."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"It's the Evangelion effect, throw in a bunch of wacky shit that you as the creator personally thinks looks cool and let the fans worry about meaning."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,It feels like you haven’t actually watched the credits and post credits scenes. There’s a good hour of explanations there.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"No.  Kojima's not a great story teller.   He's a master of aesthetics and design, but narrative structure is not his thing."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"I haven’t played it, but I’ve played other Hideo Kojima games. I think I played Metal Gear Solid all the way through like 10 times as a kid.

I think even back then, I wouldn’t have been able to tell you the story."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"You get some of it through hard to parse dialogue, some openly told to you, and some through messages and recordings. It's fine to not get it if you weren't doing some minor deep diving, I suppose, but it's not an inaccessably complicated story if you do the digging a bit. Not every single recording, mind, just the ones that are clearly related to what happened. But it's like someone else said. They're living through an apocalypse. There was no manual and they, like you, need answers."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"I'm like this with most games. I've just finished (I think, I've had end credits twice now) control and I've absolutely no idea what was going on."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,Stopped playing the game like 2/3rds of the way through once I realized there was never going to be a coherent explanation for what was going on in the game
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"Death stranding had a story? Lol jk yeah no I had no idea what was going on other than everything has gone to shit and you're in charge of fixing everyone's wifi for some reason. Also, baby in a tube."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,That steaming pile of a game had a story?
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,I didn't play this game for the very reason that I thought it would be a pretentious art piece that would leave me having to reach my own conclusions about the story.   From what I'm reading here it was unnecessarily convoluted.  I still think I'll pass on this one.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"Everything is pretty much explained in the data section, but I guess people hate reading."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,Nope. I've played the game fully through three times and the story is an incoherent mess. The third time through I just skipped all the cutscenes since I just wanted to get back to ziplining.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,"I fully understood the game just from playing the game and reading the in-game lore notes, I don't really get why people think it's complicated."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,I thought I understood the story.. now not so much.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,Aww. Just like an episode of Star Trek.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"For years, I never thought it would be possible to describe the story in one single sentence...."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"And also her act of saving a dead baby (which turns out to be Sam, the protagonist) with her EE powers caused the world of the living and the death to merge hence the “Death Stranding”."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,Didnt she create sam even though she knew he cant change anything.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,I know kojima is an USA fan but if this isn’t the most American plot.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"as a kojima fan there are some things i simply cannot justify.  this line ^ , ocelots arm, love deterrence"
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,And that is typical of Kojima. I get it his fanbase is super defensive but most of his games have a story more comparable to the ravings of a madman than something coherent
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,I think the only way to really understand would be to take a bunch of psychedelics but then you would forget what everything meant when the drugs wore off anyways.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,Yea I had to look up a breakdown video after I beat it and thought there's no way I got any of that while playing
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,You make me so happy I'm not the only one.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,[It's like watching Twin Peaks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjDa-_Vq51I)

I don’t even remember the exact cause, just that I suddenly noticed it got a lot more tedious for an already intentionally tedious game and that was it for me."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,Its just so weird in all the right ways.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,And I’ve watched the DS2 trailer like 4 times now. It’s the electric guitar axe. It’s one of the greatest things I’ve ever seen.

1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,"I liked it when this 3rd person open world game became a side on fighting game.

And no I'm not making that up."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"That's because kojima is notorious for hating naming characters it's why metal gear has 5 characters called snake and if you are paying attention in death stranding the characters you deliver to are the same, here's an example a guy called Albert Lake Is next to a lake or a guy called Bill West is west on the map (the names are not right but check yourself and its how they are named lol)"
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,Diehardman had the stupidest name imo. Deadman and Heartman sure but...fucking diehardman?! Literally anything else my god.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,Hideo Kojima loves names. Ask Pyscho Mantis and Revolver Ocelot
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"I assumed that was part of the world building, they live in a world in which connections, including family, are collapsing due to isolation so they’ve switched to defining themselves by role or callsign instead (which is probably seen as more important due to the precariousness of civilisation). Eg Sam Porter Bridges isn’t his “real” name by our standards, it’s his first name followed by his job (a porter for BRIDGES)"
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"Hmm, I like death stranding, but your comment about how it's ""convoluted, unnecessarily complex, but not complicated story"" rings true.

That's how I would describe metal gear and FF12, and that was my biggest criticism of both, and it turned me off from them, hard, when they first came out.

 Yet I can forgive it for death stranding? Maybe I should give FF12 and metal gear solid another look. I've been considering it for a while, but there's a lot that's higher on my list"
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,Thanks for that. Now about metal gear...
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"> Sam does not want this to happen because Amelia is basically his real mom because his actual mom was a shit mom.

Slightly inaccurate here... though I figure you simplified this as to not over-complicate the description. 

President Strand (the one you say was his shit mom) was his *adopted* mother who also murdered his father. His biological mother became braindead, causing Sam to be one of the original BBs (Bridge Babies). His father died trying to save him from being used as a tool.

Amelie technically IS President Strand, being her soul (more or less) that split from her physical body when she had uterine cancer at a younger age. The story obfuscates this by saying Amelie is Sam's sister and he believes this to be true himself until the very end of the story.

The whole thing with President Strand and Amelie is, to me, the most overly complex part of the story. I don't *hate* it but I think it maybe could've been a bit less convoluted."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,Dude his actual mom was not a shit mom. She was in a coma then was taken off life support by Mads. Did you even play the game?
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,And then when it’s laid out like that you see all of the absurd plot holes.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,It's Lou and it's a she.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"The memories are Sam's and not Lou's? When did that get revealed or explained?

Amelie isn't real? I thought her and Sam just had some kind of connection?

Man, I thought I understood the plot and then you just flipped it on me."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,Brian David Gilbert did a hilarious video about the plot of Kingdom hearts.

1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,"Actually laughed at that, so true lmao (And the same applies to most from software games)"
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"Why are so many people who supposedly finished DS clueless to the story? It explains itself in game, but it doesn't hand it to you on a dinner plate. It actually expects gamers to use their brains to think about things, mabye too much to ask reading these comments.."

1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,I think I was never quite sure how the apocalypse happened or exactly what Cliffs motivation was.

1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"Yup, I'm getting the feeling that the reason Sam has a literal stop motion magical puppet on his waist is because Kojima really like Del Toros Pinocchio. Will it make sense ? Probably not."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,i feel like anyone who reaches this conclusion when narratives aren't told in the simplest form possible would be better served by classic works of art such as *The Very Hungry Caterpillar* by Eric Carle. really enjoyed all of the vibrant colors in my kindergarten years.

1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"MGS3 had a relatively straightforward plot. There's plenty of depth for sure but it's easily digestible as a sort of ""James Bond during the cold war"" videogame."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,">I get it his fanbase is super defensive but most of his games have a story more comparable to the ravings of a madman than something coherent

There's usually a smaller scale, more comprehensible story. But it's always couched in a larger background story that makes next to no sense, with little promise -- based on Kojima's reputation -- of any resolution in future releases. 

And *then* he'll do something truly outrageous, like resolving a 25 year-old plot hole through Metal Gear Solid V that no one actually needed resolved!

But in doing so, MGSV continues a theme that's been coursing through the franchise since the first game, which is that legends are bullshit, and *anyone* can be the hero (or villain, as the case may be). 

So there's a semblance of consistency mixed with a lot of inanity. It can be maddening."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"His stories aren't really complicated, he just conveys them in unnecessarily convoluted and confused ways to add a layer of mystery (which I enjoy anyway)."

One moment dracula dressed in spandex rises from his coffin but its really the crow/joker then he is fighting a giant spandex robot baby but he fights it with an electic guitar and uses it as a gun, oh and there is also a sentient doll on his waist. And dont forget the living hand glove face masks/cigarette holders. Absolute WTF.  But shredding on a  electric guitar so much it becomes a weapon is kinda cool tho. "

1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,That really only applies to MGS2. The rest are fairly straightforward.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,"The stories aren’t usually… convoluted or difficult, just weird. 



The story itself isn’t even usually what’s weird, it’s usually a pretty basic plot that gets weird when the bisexual vampires show up, or a photosynthetic sniper, but they seem to pretty frequently boil down to “there’s a big bad with a new super weapon, they must be stopped”"
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"No, the plots are super simple. They’re just incomprehensibly told."

Death Stranding is about an entity who can cross the boundary between life and death, with a plan of bringing everyone over to the death side of things, but because of love she breaks the cycle and delays her extinction event. Simple.

But when you play the game you're like ""wtf is going on?"""
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,Because mostly Kojima's plots are kinda dumb.  The unnecessary complexity and convolution is an attempt to add depth to plots that are usually pretty bare-boned if you strip them down to their core concepts.

1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"Isn't there also something in there about Sam being part of the root cause of the extinction event? Amelie met him on the beach and sent him back, due to this Sam is effectively immortal and also a conduit for the beach things coming into the physical world?

1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"Just rolled the credits a couple days ago - it gets revealed at the end when you're seeing Cliff interacting with Die-Hardman in the hospital looking place. You're seeing all the same stuff you saw from each of the BB cutscenes except now you're seeing it from a different angle. They weren't BB's memories - they were yours.

There was also the last fight with Cliff where he explicitly says something along the lines of his son being named Sam Bridges."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"Towards the end I think your last or second to last fight with the army dude he says he was looking for his BB and hugs you.
  
Amelie is real but she's on the other side of the beach. She can only interact with you when you're dead / at the beach or via holograms using the chiral network ( that uses the beach like an optical cable).
 
She's basically one of the giant dudes, but bleach logic ( so much power it be ubserd to just be big)"
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,It's hinted before but there's a huge section at the end of the game dedicated to Sam and Cliff and all the pieces come together.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"All the flashbacks are of Cliff speaking to his son. At the end it's revealed that Sam is his son. BB/Lou in the game is just a BB. But I think the connection to Sam is what triggered his repressed memories, and they formed a connection because Sam is basically a BB who was released from his pod and allowed to grow up. Now Lou is too. That's my take on it anyway after literally finishing it a couple of hours ago."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"I watched that one before playing the whole series (at least all playable on the story so far bundle), and it amazingly explains everything very well without spoiling anything."

As for well paced story with player choice, and really what I meant was in exploration, I stand by it."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"The Universe from time to time decides that life on Earth has to be extinguished and renewed, so it causes the birth of an Extinction Entity (EE) with the ability to open the doors between the world of the living and the world of the dead, letting chiralium, timefall, beached things and tar pass through to cause a mass extinction."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"In Death Stranding’s lore there’s this thing called Extinction Events (EEs) with the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs being one of them, and in the present the human race is undergoing another one in modern times hence the game’s post-apocalyptic setting.

Cliff is >!BB’s father, but for most of the game we’re led to believe his BB was Lou when it was actually Sam as an infant. He eventually finds out after getting a good look at Sam and his soul passes away peacefully in his Beach after meeting his son for the first time.!<"
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,"Get off your high horse. You sound like every Kojima fanboy saying ""it makes sense if you play the game"" as the one and only response when someone who actually understands it asks wtf is even happening.

In fact, go ahead and try to expain the story. Prove you understand more than the absolute shallowest levels of ""connecting people"". I'll bet you either wrongly believe you understand it perfectly or you'll make up some bullshit about metaphors being everywhere, and then fail to understand what the metaphors could be."

Oh, and that game had a fuckin ghost and a villain who controlled lightning like a Mortal Kombat character.

I’d say MGS3 is pretty Fuckin’ weird."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,I’d say MGS1 is the most straightforward. Just a relatively standard Mission Impossible style action spy flick with heart. Then shit got really really weird
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"That’s the thing. Kojima has a rabid fan base, myself included, because he does something that a lot of us gamers clamber for: Plots that are simple stories, executed in such fantastic ways. 

Like literally. All of Metal Gear can be broken down into to : War makes money, and a world always at war always makes money. 

But then you add in cloning, Psycho Mantis, Major Raidenkov, and nanobots and we got a whole fucking stew going."

Sure, I totally get confusion while playing. But by the end I've never felt like I didn't have a solid grasp on the story. Granted I've only played MGSV and Death Stranding but both were pretty easy to track and easy enough to understand. Everything made sense within its own fiction and sure there may be a ton of exposition for things Kojima is inventing but that doesn't mean it doesn't make sense."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"Firstly it released 5 months before Covid. 

Secondly, it’s difficult to concentrate on what the game is saying when the game is aggressively stupid. Why would I ponder Covid when I’m fighting tar monsters and invisible hands and babies and also there’s time travel to WW1 maybe?"
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,"We get it, you're more intelligent than other people. But nobody was saying his games lack real world relevance, people are agreeing that a lot of his plot points are nonsensical. Not all, but a lot."

You've got diseases that travel via spoken language, nano-machines that do magic, ghosts, a vampire, self-hypnosis, at least 3 different characters that go by the same name at one point or another of the timeline, wormholes, etc.

If the game didn't try to justify all the weird shit it would be one thing. A guy who can control bees is one thing. A guy that can control bees because he has some kind of parasite that allows him to secrete ""heterogeneous pheromones"" from his body, making him like a ""queen"" to them is another thing entirely."

Then in MGS 2, there's a ninja sword guy and I'm confused as to why he suddenly has a French accent. I found out later that they were not the same character so why make them so much alike? 

People keep saying La-li-lu-le-lo and I have no idea why.

Why is the president of the United States fondling my genitals?

In 3 why does Raikov look so much like Raidan?

MG 4. So. David Hayter exists  in the MGS universe as well as providing voice work? So that means....what exactly?

Why isn't Liquid Snake missing an arm?


In MGS 3 I played as Snake.
In MGS 4 I played a character called Snake who looked the same so naturally I thought they were the same person.

I thought Big Boss was Snake's mentor in MGS3. And that Snake then took on the mantle of Big Boss. But now they are talking about Big Boss and saying that Liquid wants to recover ""his"" body. So who exactly was/is Big Boss?

If you're making a long-running game series why on earth would you give multiple characters the sand look and name?"
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"Sam was just the ""trigger"" for the Extinction Event. Amelie was going to cause one through her actions no matter what and Sam just happened to be the first big step towards beginning the event. 

Really, Amelie being effectively immortal is the biggest issue. When she split from President Strand she stopped aging. Theoretically, if Amalie had not split from President Strand, the continuation of the Event would have likely stopped at her death. But Amelie has near infinite time to continue the Extinction Event (as well as attempt to hold it at bay, which is what we ended Death Stranding 1 with her doing.) 

It seems like previous Extinction Entities also split from their previous selves since we see their ""spirits"" occasionally (they're supposedly [these things](https://i.ani.me/0166/3414/screenshot_434.png), despite previous EEs not being all humans.)

But, with all of that, we're getting into the REAL complicated (and possibly contentious) meat and potatoes of Death Stranding lol"

1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,"i can actually explain the story if you earnestly want me to (obviously you don't because there are plenty of sources for that info.) There's quite a lot that one can criticize kojima for or that really just comes down to taste. I would say as a foil to kojimas style, Sam Lake/Remedy do a much better job at playing with narrative like the meta narrative/autofiction style of Alan Wake.   


Kojima's stories are relatively simple compared to something like the works of David Lynch where it's purposefully created to lack a discernible conclusive explanation so as to let the viewer interpret their own meaning, having just enough to put a narrative together.   


The actual story can be summarized as a scifi post apocalypse where humans have accidentally merged the world of the living and the dead and are now dealing with the consequences of that at the cusp of extinction. just like MGS is at it's core a story about war, humanity, and a bit of a gaze into the mirror of our own reality at its most hyperbolic interpretation mixed with scifi elements.   


you too can learn to more easily digest media by really engaging with it as you consume it. ask questions, don't just write things off as shit because there's symbolism and layers and humor that you might not initially understand. no work will ever really be perfect because it's made by humans which is the beauty. consider how it makes you feel and reflect to take your own meaning from it that you can carry with you. that is such an important part of the relationship between artist/art/consumer."

1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"I didn't make it past season one. I remember it was like episode 5 or around there when they introduced ""tall sleepy girl who eats a lot"" and I said ""I thought this was gonna be a serious anime based on the first two episodes"" and the typical anime trope just killed the whole vibe for me.

I hear it gets amazing though."

1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,"I think she meant it as in ""the princess is in another castle"" since we'd spent the whole game walking over there to say hi."

1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"1,3,4,5 are all pretty straight forward and easy to follow. MGS2 is the only one with a ""confusing"" plot. 



There's plenty of goofiness and random stuff contained in the plot that makes no sense or is wacky, but the main plot is clear and straight forward. "

1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"I don’t think it would be a Hideo Kojima game if he didn’t play a large hand in the game creation, specifically writing and directing. If he took himself out of those roles completely, and created a new IP, I think it could be a good game but it wouldn’t have the same feel.

PT was where Hideo would have fit in and shined the best, a true psychological horror. It matches his style very well. A game similar to Evil Within but with Kojimas influence (and Sonys money) would be incredible."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,"The core of his narratives make sense, but they're always couched in a wildly overambitious secondary narrative which is nonsensical. You see this in MGS V as well as Death Stranding."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"So? The point is you don't even have to stretch far or jump into someone else's shoes to get a feel for the world when we've basically all lived it ourselves. No one can go outside without fear of injury and we're all hanging in there due to a combination of front line workers operating critical infrastructure and supply depos and getting by in what entertainment and connections we can make.


It's difficult to relate to some parts of the world and the story because of fantastical elements? That's like saying you can't empathize with the ""soldiers coming home after forever being changed"" feelings at the end of Return of the King because there's wizards and dragons and rings of power."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"Yes… because that’s the final reveal of the game. That’s the twist at the end. Of course you wouldn’t know (apart from some foreshadowing.)

And again that proves the point. MGSV is simple, boss used a body double to increase his legend. It’s quite simple."

1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,It's as much of a Christmas movie as Home Alone.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,"Part two is also Christmas movie, and I love it."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,If you were to take planet earth out of the plot everyone would die in the vacuum of space. Your point is meaningless.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,"It would work, it just wouldn't be Die Hard. You'd have to change the soundtrack, decor, and some of the more memorable scenes and technical details. I have no idea what they'd replace ""Now I have a machine gun, Ho Ho Ho"" with.  


But an action movie about a grizzled cop flying in to see his estranged wife on their anniversary, and she's busy with some big work event and prioritizing that which then gets attacked by terrorists, and it's just some random day in LA? It seems reasonable. I can't remember anything in their plot that requires it to be Christmas.  


But the movie as it was originally made is absolutely a Christmas movie."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,You could easily set Die Hard at any other time of year and it would work

MG2: Oil, super deep story for a 90's game, all in 2D.  
MGS1: Nukes, relevant. One of the first ""cinematic feel"" games out there. GREAT voice acting for the time which still holds today.  
MGS2: It's even more relevant now that it was at the time. Suberb graphics as well.  
MGS3: Do i really need to speak about this one?  
MGS4: Way too many cutscenes, but it was meant as a closure game. How he managed to tie up so many lose ends is still amazing, even with Nanomacheens son.  
MGSV: Can you still feel it? Superb gameplay.  
Death Stranding: Funny how it was released before covid hit. People closed down and all. Wacky story.

1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,"The plot is all over the place but it’s not convoluted or hard to understand (maybe 4 and 5 because Kojima got away from his editor).

Bad guy wants walking nuke tank for evil deeds. That’s the games plot. Everything else is just set dressing. Half of your concerns are just devices for boss fights and have no bearing on the plot."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"Have you played the games? This is all explained.

Ninja died in one. He was squashed by a million ton tank. Why would he be the same character? He’s dead.  And of course (s)he’s similar- the whole point of 2 was to be as close to 1 as possible to recreate Snake. There was a 5 minute presentation about it. 

President is a stupid joke. 

Raidobivich is a stupid joke. 

David Hayter video is just a Robocop reference. It’s all it is. MGS has always been loose with 4th wall breaks. Why does this bother you but Campbell talking about the Triangle button not?

Liquid Snake only had arm removed after death. Why would you think it weird he had both?

Do you not know what death is? Snake/Big Boss ‘died’ before MGS series started. Why would you assume your him and not Solis Snake? Your making illogical assumptions. 

No, The Boss was the mentor. Naked Snake became Big Boss. When Liquid talks about the body of Big Boss- it’s Big Boss. 

Lookalike characters? They’re literally clones. Who else looks alike?

Have you actually played the games?"
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,"Yeah yeah. The story can be summarized into something coherent that makes sense. That's the same shit r/DeathStranding keeps repeating.

I asked every fucking question possible and the story is absolutely nonsense. There isn't even enough in the game to say that BTs and Beaches are definitively the afterlife. Sometimes it makes sense if rhe beaches are the afterlife. Most of the time it doesn't. Sometimes it makes sense that BTs are the souls of people, most of the time it's nonsense to even suggest.

The only way to make sense of the story is to ignore the 90% that proves me right. Ever tried to figure out repatriates? Or chiral crystals?

There is explanation as far as why the player has to do a thing, and that's it. The player needs to worry about the weather because uh, chiral rain, it uh ages the containers that the porter in the rain proof gear is going to be carrying. Why doesn't his suit get ruined too? Because that wouldn't be good gameplay.

When you learn to do more than ingest the barest of minimums, come back and we'll talk some more."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,She's saying only yes.. but have you considered: no?
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,I was more so talking about the original DragonBall when Goku was a kid but yeah Vegeta's arc in DBZ could also qualify.
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,The Vegeta arc has been done to death in every form. Eric from true blood is the most Vegeta like character in all Vegetas that existed since the original.

1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,"I mean, that's what fiction does? Not always popcorn flicks but think of all the books we read in English class. Is the takeaway from 1984 the literal plot events that happen to Winston or is it a painted picture of a dystopia where the government has the tools to completely control the flow of information and convince the populace to submit themselves to the unified will of the state? 


In Star Trek is the takeaway the literal plot events of some engineer tries to forcibly reassign Data to his lab in order to disassemble and study him but he refuses? Or is it to get us to reexamine what we all assume ""life"" to be and in the struggle to properly define life and what it means to humans find that this Cybernetic Creation meets the same criteria of free thought and will we'd apply to ourselves?


I don't know by which weird standard we're applying where games can't explore real world ideas and conundrums in its fiction the way other mediums do. They're as much a means of human expression as anything else."
1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-13,"I played Death Stranding when it released Nov 19 when Covid was only just beginning. So how could it relate to something that hasn’t happened yet? You’re arguing from hindsight. 

No, because LotR the dragons and wizards are relatively minor factors. Both final films have 45+ minute battles so war is a key element. Death Stranding the isolation and echo chamber of online world is only in the data logs I believe? And people being alone in shelters isn’t really dwelt upon. Not really. 

A better example would be like someone saying ‘LotR shows you what it’s like to live with an old senile person who’s rotting into nothing’ I mean- sure? That’s there but that’s what you got from this? It’s also buried under so much other stuff."

While it's an action film, it takes place on Christmas Eve at a holiday party. The festive elements, such as decorations and Christmas music, juxtapose the intense action, creating a unique blend that has led to its classification as a holiday movie. Additionally, themes of family and redemption are present, aligning with traditional Christmas movie motifs. Even the cinematographer  and producers have stated that although not at the time of filming, they totally now believe it’s a Christmas movie. The movie ends with snow fall, in LA!

1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,"all of that actually does have an explanation.... which circles back into my point that there's plenty to criticize kojima or DS for. like hiding a lot of the lore in text files that you get via the messaging system. also while chiral crystals in the game are simply a byproduct of death in that world that are also used as an energy source (baby explanation is that it didn't exist prior to sam's death/rebirth which set the extinction event into motion) the name and various themes come from real life chiral theory. there's actually a great post on that sub which does a deep dive into the parallels.   


i think instead of making yourself look stupid kicking and screaming over this, you could instead just take the route of ""this kind of story is too much effort for too little payoff"" which is perfectly valid vs ""everyone who disagrees with me is wrong"" which just reads as immaturity. i don't know. i'm wasting my time trying to give a genuine response to some no name on reddit with one braincell. christ help me."

1apxpan,2024-02-13,2024-02-14,I thought he transplanted the arm purely so he could have bypass the security measures based on Liquids DNA in MGS4?

And even when he *does* get to meet a few people face to face he has severe touch phobia that also manifests physically as skin injuries, making him permanently touch and affection starved for his entire life and all foreseeable future. And this isn't even touching upon how every other character lives similarly sheltered lives, never going outdoors, only communicating via radio or sometimes only written correspondence and almost every mission and task has to do with helping them and addressing their needs.

It even reflects the majority of most people's modern outlook of Christmas where they talk about caring for other people (other terrorists in captivity) but are really in it for the presents and themselves (all a decoy so they can steal bearer bonds and get rich and be happy capitalists and don't care about politics at all). It's like there's moral lessons to be learned about the real meaning of Christmas and everything!  


If Home Alone is a Christmas movie because he lightheartedly plans the the torture and possible vigilante murder of a couple of criminals for his own and our viewing enjoyment, then Die Hard certainly can be."

sometimes i ask myself the same, be it regarding movies or videos games.  
I mean: i'm not asking for logic in a Marvel or Transformers movie.

zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Wtf. I thought the left one was the game
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-20,I can't believe you had a baby just for the cosplay
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-20,[here's how this photo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SwV9xneZdo5fixj0mGiZh5PeuUXmRaQw/view?usp=drivesdk) looks with and without editing. Took me a crazy long time to get right!
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-20,Are you lea seydoux?
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-20,"Wait, which ones the real one..?"
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"I haven't seen the original, I don't know which is which."
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,New dark souls 2 remake lookin off
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Finally the Nintendo DS is getting a true direct sequel after the 3ds spin of got multiple sequels.
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"Lea Seydoux, is that you ?"
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-20,'They are the same picture'😉😅
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"It actually took me a few seconds to figure out which one was the cosplay and which one was the game. Crazy how far game graphics have come. Also, very nice cosplay!"
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,The second true Strandlike game
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,You look more like Fragile than Fragile.
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"Shit, there's a 2?  I still need to play the first one."
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-20,So are you the actress or just made for that cosplay
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Who’s who!??????? Goddammiitttt !!!!!!!
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Nailed it!
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,The attention to detail is stunning! Great work!
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,This looks so thrilling and cool!
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,The fuck. Yours is the left one.
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"What gave it away was the actor's name on the bottom of the right picture. I'm not even joking, that's what I'm using to assume the right one is the real one. Add that to yours and you'll fool many more."
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,there’s already a death stranding 2? jesus i’m getting old. feel like the first one just came out and totally missed the second one
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Dual Shock 2 looking good
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Is the the new rtx 5080 ti?
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Incredible editing! I couldn't tell which was which until I saw your original
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Hell yeah! Dark Souls 2 remake! Shanalot looks like she cut her hair. Where'd that baby come from?
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"Honestly...

No clue which one is the real one!

Nice job!!"
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,They're making a sequel?
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"Fragile? Why, you must be Italian!"
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Doppelgänger
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Wow that's incredibly good
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,You even got the dark circles under your eyes right!
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,RTX OFF/ON vibe
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,on PS4 | on PS5
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"The rendering is incredible, the staging, the atmosphere, the likeness and the role play are so successful I am a fan. One wonders what is the real side"
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Which one is which???
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Somehow u feel like ur complaining is less realistic that the actual one
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Which one is the cosplay? That’s a testament to how accurate it looks
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-20,"I've been staring at this for a straight 5 minutes now and I'm still confused on which is the real one because they both look so real, my mind keeps playing tricks on me."
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,You look more like Fragile than Leah does herself in this comparison. You nailed the editing too.
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Oh snap I thought yours was on the right and game on left! But I was wrong!!
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Which one is the cosplay?
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"Nice, I guessed wrong haha. Top quality cosplay."
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,I thought the right frame was real until seeing your hand. Cool.
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Now THAT is some on point Cosplay. Well done!!!!
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"These games are getting scary good at faces, and you also killed it"
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Wow before I read your words I thought your pic was some sort of graphics upgrade. You really nailed it
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,as someone who hasn't even heard of that game. which one is you?
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,This is like when Dolly Parton lost a Dolly Parton lookalike contest. You look more like Lea here than she does her own self lmao
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"Damn, I couldn't even tell which was the cosplay and which was the game! Brilliant job! :)"
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Done very well
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,If you get better wings for the baby it would be impossible to tell which one is which.
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"Spot on, very nice."
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Someone really takes detailing seriously.
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Which one is the real one?
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,This is amazing! An actual good cosplay!
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"So they're casting you for the part in the movie right? Because this is insanely good. I was fully convinced the pic on the left was the cover until I saw the unfiltered photo you posted.

Bravo 👏"
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"Complete failure, that doesn't looks like Darksouls 2 at all."
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"Damn, she even got the tooth gap just right."
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Wait wait wait...one of these is cosplay? You've nailed it perfectly!
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"Really good cosplay miss Seydoux, i love your character in the French Dispatch"
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,You look more like Lea Seydoux than the in game Lea Seydoux
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"Very cool. An underrated character. Or, at least, I don’t see enough about her."
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Oh wow what a flex. That is an amazing display of knowledge and execution. Well fucking done!
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Freaking spot on!
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,which one is the cosplay?
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,That’s really good I genuinely couldn’t tell which was which
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Dayum!
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Are you the same person this character was modelled on?
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Must be italian!
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Yours looks better
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Basically the only way I realised the game poster was on the right is because of the baby’s hand
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"I haven't played the game so I can't tell which one is real. Either this game is insanely high-quality, or you did an amazing job."
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,It looks so good that I can’t tell which is the actual one…
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Wow that is some next level shizzle. Very impressive.
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,If this as a high stake scenario of me having to shoot the imposter I'd probably fail and end up shooting the right side one
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,I thought this was a trick image! That’s incredible OP.
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-20,Holy crap great job
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-20,Which one is the cosplay? Lol
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-20,"if not the wings on baby being too ideal on original, i honestly wouldn’t have guessed which one is which correctly, especially if the text would’ve been copied to the cosplay pic, an amazing job, the comparison is shocking.."
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-20,I would have believed you if you just said they casted you in Death Stranding 2
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-20,I'm seeing double. four fragiles
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-20,Nice bro. I thought both are original like two takes until i read caption.
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-20,Amazing. You absolutely nailed it.
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-20,"You look familiar, not sure why."
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-20,wow
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"...You're the one on the left right? This is so great OP, real fun picture."
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"Very nice, and you are absolutely gorgeous."
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Is it just me or does the cosplay look better then the original lol
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-20,"select the highlights in your hair and then select the red tones to match it. the hightlights from the window in your orginal is pretty obvious and would just finish it up nicely. add a little more grain and lighten your blacks just a bit.  
past that, fucking great work."
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Real baby?
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-20,They're making another one?
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-20,What happened to the hands on the baby’s neck in the right image
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"Wait, there’s a second Death Stranding!?"
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Yours actually looks better lol
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,[removed]
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Instagram please
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,I don't really see the point of low effort cosplay. I guess just to prove you can achieve a  similar look?
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-20,Holy shit there is a sequel to that game. I remember seeing massive amounts of advertising and hype for the first one and then literally nothing after it launched. Didn't even know they were making a second one.
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,I can't tell which is you because they're both just CGI
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Death stranding was the worst game i ever beat.
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"Hi Lea! I loved your work in Death Stranding and originally fell in love with you in the Bond movies. I'm surprised you'd taken a liking to cosplaying! A fitting first cosplay to play yourself, love it."
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-20,Gross
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Is there anywhere we can gaze upon thine arse online miss?
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"That's not Fragile in that bit, is it? She shows up later in the trailer. I'm pretty sure the person you're cosplaying is Elle Fanning's character, >!who I think is Louise grown up!<."
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Lol i thought the one in the left is the cosplay one
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,You look more like the girl than the girl does
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Are you that Fragile?
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,mind explaining which is which?
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Dirty sprite 2
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,RTX V2.0 ON
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,which one is the cosplay and which is the game screenshot?
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,The thing that ended up tipping me off to which one was real was that the sleeves on the baby clothing on the right looked too smooth to be real. Incredible work!
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-22,"I saw DS and thought Dead Space. Then I saw the title and realized it’s death stranding. This abbreviation could also work for Death Star, the space station from Star wars"
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-22,"You're fragile... but you're not that fragile  :D

Crazy damn good -- great job !"
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-22,Wait which one is the cosplay?
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-22,This is amazingly good cosplay.
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"The only way I could tell is in the photograph that is real, the baby looks more fake.  Somehow that makes sense."
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-20,Me too. It’s crazy how photorealistic games are nowadays. It’s amazingly impressive.
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-20,Me too xD
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Is this kudos for the cosplayer or the devs haha
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,I was going to say they look more cgi then the cgi…
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,One of them has credits listed
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"Seriously? I know game graphics are good nowadays but they come nowhere close to real life. Picture on left is obviously real, you can tell by the details on the hand, neck, and shirt. Her mouth looks better defined."
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"Considering one is a famous actress and other isn't, I think it's pretty obvious which one is real."
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Ikr
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Wait it's not?
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,The plastic baby was what gave it away for me.
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"I seriously cannot tell, and somehow the right one looks more realistic. Obviously because of the red light saturation but still its impressive."
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"I did too. And I looked pretty closely. I would have left thinking that too, had you not said anything.

Really well done."
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Well this is the most human thing Zuckerberg has done.
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-20,"She's Fragile, not fragile."
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-20,I was thinking the same thing. This new generation of cosplayers is taking things to the next level. That's some serious dedication.
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,WTH! This whole time I thought the game was on the left and you were on the right!!
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,I legit thought your one was the game one and the other was real. Wow we really are in the future man
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-20,I still don't know which one is you. lol
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-20,Soo many hours in editing! I don’t think the average person realizes how much work that is.
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"Omg you're really the one on the left?!          
        
I just decided to watch the Game Movie on YouTube because I didn't feel up to the gameplay, and you literally look more like Fragile than the game poster/graphic.         
I really thought ""Well, that's pretty close I suppose. Nice"" and thought people were trolling."
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"Not gonna lie, I wish you were scanned as the base for the character. Simply exquisite!"
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-20,ahaha  I was about to ask the same question
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-20,Left picture is a real person.
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,The one without credits listed
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Nintendo's new Dual screen console isnt promising
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-28,Live action Emerald Herald looking fine
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,It's a reimagined 2DS of course
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,It's a weird game. Very kojima.
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"It's a great game, especially in how it predicts a lot of societal changes caused by the pandemic.

As usual, Kojima has a very good idea of what's about to happen in society, and he put that all in a brilliant game.

It's also extremely fun and relaxing - the learning curves for mechanics and difficulty scaling are *masterfully* done.

Plus Guillermo del Toro is just a gem. Well, they all are - but I particularly love Guillermo's character 'Deadman'."
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"I followed the games development since the first trailer and finally started it last week. I had some free time and was able to borrow my brothers Playstation. Cool game, it's truly unique! Was fun finally playing it after waiting 3 years."
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Need is a strong word.
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"They are not, the actress looks exactly like the character"
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-20,"Look at the arm of the babies, one is plastic. That's the cosplay."
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,This is clearly meant to represent my lack of respect towards the second installment in the trilogy
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Left
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,There it is. Bravo.

You can tell that the left one is because of the way it just does due to how be by the way it is itself like."
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,The story in death stranding was phenomenal and if you actually played it all the way you would understand that it is such a engulfing story. Part 2 will be amazing if not even better
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Bruh yall are taking this way too seriously...
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Nope. The left one is the cosplay. Look lower in the thread for the OP comment showing the unedited picture. Very impressive work.

After a few minutes of figuring it out, I thought the one of the right was the cosplay... nope, turns out left is the cosplay. Then I look at the right and it looks more real than the real one. Only OP's 'before' pic convinced me the left one is real. Then I finally realize the DS2 one have text/names on it lol"
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-20,"Yep, but they don't need to. I believe the result is what matters the most. Still, it's really nice to see someone appreciate the work that goes into creating a cosplay picture like this one. Thank you :)"

zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Neat!
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Didn't think of it that way
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"Thanks for clearing that up. 😒

/edit A few easily fixed things give the cosplay away. The vertical 'strands' (Hey! I see wot they did there! Clever. 😩) are subtler on the original, and once you notice it they kind of stand out on Miss Cosplay's otherwise amazing effort. Also the actor names are missing."
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"Oh I thought the baby on the left looked fake lol

Edit: Nvm that's because it is a fake baby, hadn't considered that"
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"but it's not ""too much Photoshop"". 

it's literally a lighting change and an edit on the baby."
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"You've probably associated photoshop in your head head with being a cheap way to doctor photos with unrealistic standards

However it can add so much to pictures and even in this scenario it did nothing to take away and it only added, it also takes some effort to learn it"
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"The most obvious giveaways here are the baby's hand and hair, the lighting on the wings of the baby's clothes and the reflection on the nose and lips of the right image. 

The skin on the right seems kinda plastic and the shadow of the wing looks too dark for the lighting present compared to the rest of the image. 

Just to give you some pointers on where to look."

zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,I believe the original unedited photo is better.
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Lmao so did I
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,Pretty straight forward to tell. The game is obviously the version with the more detailed character model.

zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"Lol, they're complaining about photoshop, but it's literally bring out next to a video game... what do they expect?"
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,"The lighting is a different angle and style in both pictures which is why the are seeing some of your differences.

The highlights you see on the right are due to stronger lighting and less makeup. Skin is oily and will reflect light causing highlights. Makeup is used to remove that which OP did along with softer lighting at a different angle."
zr0wi6,2022-12-20,2022-12-21,I thought the game went too far out of its way to explain literally everything that was happening in excruciating detail. I can understand not getting it if you miss any of it though.

fgllph,2020-03-10,2020-03-11,"There's a few things to worry about here. The upright position of the baby is problematic for their ability to keep their airway open, the possibility of the filter getting clogged or pump running out of battery,  as well as oxygen deprivation if the air is refresh correctly and builds carbon dioxide inside the thing. I really hope the thing isn't as air tight as it seems. No amount of planning is worth risking so much on such a little life that really has no way of telling you something is going wrong.

Not going to lie but using a PAPR for the baby is a neat idea considering. The little one is getting plenty of air btw due to how the powered air purifying respirator works.

Reality is, you tools live on the internet reading clickbait bullshit and don't realize that while a medical site will recommend you position the baby however, not doing so equals a .02% chance of complications and thus the baby is not in any real significant danger.

Basically you read all this bullshit online meant to grab your attention, think you are enlightened by a 2 page read, and then start forming opinions around complete and utter bullshit.  It's an epidemic and the worst part is people get so fucking cavalier about it because their two paragraphs of poorly written clickbait make themselves and expert in their eyes."

fgllph,2020-03-10,2020-03-11,"Can't read Chinese but the screen appears to be measuring various parameters of the inside of the case like temp and air quality. I'd assume O2 content is on there as well. There also appears to be an air pump attached to the filter (filter by itself wouldn't be that big or have an LED on it). That being said it looks like the actual case is just a modified zip up backpack which would probably not create a good seal but at least he took steps to ensure air supply to the baby within.

edit: and now that I'm thinking about it... as long as he's measuring air pressure in the tank he can actually use the lack of seal as an air output and just continuously intake air through the filter rather than going in and out though it. Not as good as an actual isolation chamber but might still work."

Also there's the obvious fucking hose with an air filter on it.  Even if you missed it yourself, how the fuck did you miss me mentioning it in my last post?"
fgllph,2020-03-10,2020-03-11,"The same way the baby’s room only gets air flow from a air vent behind the dresser. The difference is that with the “tube” that has a air filter you know what’s inside it.

Have you ever cleaned a house’s ventilation system mr cristi? I can guarantee they are not very sanitary after a year. Even more so if you haven’t changed the filters and god forbid if the house hasn’t been lived in for that amount of time. All kinds of nasty things could be in those vents.

But let me put it like this. You might think the guy in the post is stupid and dangerous for putting his baby in that enclosure and you might be right if he didn’t take the necessary precautions but I see it as overly cautious and down right paranoid but judging by the language on that little monitor screen and the overpopulation problems on top of the outbreaks they have I don’t blame him.

It's truly hard without NG+ and the possibility of using whatever paths you have already traced.

By the time the last act started I had built a funicular railway network through which Sam was able to freely move from the peak of the tallest mountain all the way to the start of the second area.

That was one of the coolest gaming experiences I've ever had, since the climb of that mountain is extremely time consuming and can take up to probably half an hour or more.

Also... That princess Beach line would be fucking hard to endure once again."

zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"The game was so good and made me so mad at times when I trip and drop every single package known to man all over the place, or when I try to shortcut through mountains and fall over and have to start over.

&#x200B;

But man, I have to say, the soundtrack and the feeling of accomplishment when you finish the game, after hours of walking is like no other feeling ever, you just feel great.

I was lucky that I built alot of ziplines through the game, because it helped me tons near the end."

Definitely a very unique experience and I'm glad I played it, honestly think it had one of the best soundtrack I've heard in recent years.  Thank you Kojima for introducing us to Low Roar.

When I want a chill relaxing time (for the most part) I will seek this game out. I also just love the weird ass stuff Kojima puts into his games. It looks like he's taking that weird and dialing it up to 11, and I can't wait to see what we get."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I'm still playing through the first one...
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Walking simulator 2. I'm hyped
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Hideo san just sold a million ps5s.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I'm so excited
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"The thing i really want to play Death Stranding, but i am always intimidated by the length of the game. I would love to sit down with a cup of coffee and a cigarette to play the game for hours but the stupid college hours doesn't allow me to do that. Too much work, too much assignments, too many exams. I couldn't even finish rdr2, I am stuck in the John Marston in the ranch section. So many games I wanna play, but so little time. Hope after my first semester is over I'll have some spare time and I promise I ain't sleeping, I'll be stuck to my pc and finish the unfinished games and if god wishes, start Death Stranding. Wish me luck guys."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I can't exactly describe why I liked the first one so much, byt it was one of the most unique and enjoyable gaming experience I've ever had. So I'm going excited that there's a second one!"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Death Standing 2:  Walking Boogaloo
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,First Kojima game I'm not excited for. I tried DS...TWICE...and still couldn't feel motivated to continue it.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I mean yea why not… I’ve always been into FedEx
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Great game that alot of people seem to not understand.    

Really hope he doesnt go the make this a standard third person shooter to please the mainstream crowd but based on the director’s cut, its probably going that way."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I honestly wasn’t excited, I couldn’t even get into first one cause it got so boring to me."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Will need to boot up the first one closer to when this comes out. Never beat the game. Will need to give it another go.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Who gives a shit
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,OKAY THEY NEVER SAID STRANDING THEY NEVER SAID THE S STANDS FOR STRANDING. IT COULD BE SNEAKING. JUST SAYING
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Did we need a sequel though.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Idk man, the first one was boring as hell for me. Delivering packages isn't fun. The graphics and boss fights were cool, but making a game where you play UPS driver isn't fun to me"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Y'all motherfuckers like W A L K I N G real slow up hills and shit? With a baby in a jar? With spooky ink ghosts? With famous(ish) actors? With long ass cutscenes? With abundant product placement? And some contrived ass overcomplicated story shit?
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,???? I thought the first one was ass
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Ok guys now walk this way....
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I love kojima. Mgs is my fave series. But cmon! Yawn…….
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Damn. I was hoping Kojima would do something else because I’m a huge fan but don’t like Death Standing much. Bummer.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Holy shit, are we working for Ebay or Uber Eats this time? What a visionary."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"FEDEX SIMULATOR!

YAY!"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,why
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,walking simulator 2
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Kojima is a hack that likes to sniff his own farts
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Already sounds like a game I won’t buy.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I hope they get rid of the delivery aspect of the game and becomes more narrative driven. The fist was not a really fun or enjoyable game.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,but why
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Did anyone ask for this?
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Here I go watching 3 hours of cutscenes again…
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Walking Simulator 2
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Looks like shit and a terrible main character.. yikes
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Can’t believe they made a sequel to the most boring game ever made
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Guy gets the most freedom of any game director ever and goes on to make another damn sequel… boooooooo
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,[deleted]
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Who the fuck is funding this shit
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Do we need another walking simulator
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,LOL why though
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I fell asleep 10 min into the game cant wait for the second one.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Did ppl even enjoy this walking sim?
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I wonder if the gameplay will be just as boring and the writing just as bad as the first game
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"DS is just gathering dust, after 3 hours of playing I completely forgot it, crazy boring"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Ahahahah Kojima is really pushing his luck with this one! Why would anybody wants to play a sequel of one of the most annoying games ever released?
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Oh..... Yay
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Walking simulator 2 hell yah
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Let's walk here and back again the videogame 2
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Yay walking simulator 2 and with  babies again it seams. Is kojima wishing for kids or something? Or whats hes deal with it?
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Oh I can't wait for the sequel of one of the games of all time, thank you Kojima."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Why
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Should of kept this. One of the biggest duds in gaming history.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I was surprised they would bother to make another one. Boring game.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Duble the game, duble the disappointment"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I hope this game is LGBTQ+ inclusive
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Seems to be Lea Seydoux who’s done the mocap/acting.

And everyone hates her"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Can't wait to strand some more death
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,The Waitress?
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I genuinely wonder why they kept saying DS2 and not just death stranding
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I haven’t even finished the 1st one yet
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,You guys know you can go outside and walk. You don’t need a video game simulator to do it.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,So nice of Kojima to announce Dark Souls 2!
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,THERES COMING OUT WITH ANOTHER 3DS???? I CANT WAIT
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,This could be completely different game in same universe and hes playing with name😁 hes done stuff like this before
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"hated the first one myself, but can't deny how popular and we'll received the game was. Still looking forward to the clips of the game and to see how the world looks. I most likely won't play it but hooenits a good game for others to enjoy!"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"So instead of deliveries, it is now time to be a porch pirate"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I just started the first one 2 days ago. Good timing.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"That's actually Dark Souls 2, I can't believe it's finally coming out"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Reminds me: I never finished Death Stranding. I’ve been busy building roads in Montana.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I thought they were remaking Dead Space 2..
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Garbage made by an overhyped clown dev who is (for some reason) worshipped as a god because he made a couple of spy games 15-20 years ago.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Cool?
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I look forward to other games he does, but wasn’t really a fan of DS"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"lol, I tried so hard to enjoy this game, what a waste of time."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Baffles me that people care. I can see Kojima’s games having niche appeal but they’re just not that great. He’s just a batshit crazy narcissist who writes overly weird shit and people act like he’s a revolutionary auteur.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Here gaming industry I help you:

Something 1,2,3,4

Something: Ultimate Edition, Standard Edition, Digital Edition, F-word U Edition

Something: Pre-Alpha, Pre-Beta, Pre-Finished

add yours please"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,People actally wanted a Walking Simulator 2?  To each their own I guess.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,As much as I like strand type games. I low key just wanna run deliveries with my friends
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,DS2: Returns - You go around picking up all the packages you delivered for returns.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"The first one was such a massive disappointment, I'm not even going to bother with the sequel.

The hiking mechanic was half-baked and got repetitive really quickly.

The shooting is the worse I've played in a long time. How the fuck can the same dude who made MGS5 make the combat in DS so awful?

Boss fights are garbage. Completely unfun. Not to mention you can literally just run away from almost every boss fight.

I wanted to give up half-way in, but I only continued to see the story through. And boy oh boy was it NOT worth it. Kojima at his worst.

At least Kojima is working on other, non-DS games."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Thats really pretty cool that they managed to get emo Toby Maguire from Spiderman 3 to make the announcement.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I have nothing against the first Death Stranding but the gameplay looked so boring and uninteresting I completely avoided it. I am hoping the second time around the gameplay ends up being something I would actually like to engage with. Still love Kojima though, and just for good measure fuck Konami..."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Alrighty
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,"More like Dark souls 2, this fucking game got me so stressed i started to get white hairs, and I'M 20 YEARS OLD"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-13,Has anyone noticed that fragiles skin is clean & young in the trailer?
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-16,"May god have mercy. The first one has tanked and was so boring, how can you do a sequel?!"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"""it's the most innovative genre I've played in years!""

SUPER--  wait no..."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"That line alone is how i know Kojima is a narcissist. Death Stranding is just another 3rd person action/adventure game, it’s not a new genre even slightly"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,Certainly one of the games of all time.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,He’s making a nintendo ds2. dont tell them
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,He loves strand-type games
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Hey, he had fun when he played it the second time. Maybe when he plays the second one the second time he'll have fun too!!"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"The first thing I told my wife after seeing the announcement was “Dunkey is gonna have a field day”.

My body is ready for more Strand Type jokes."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"He hates that he likes it, a tsundere gamer"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Y'all are trippin

Dunkey likes the game and has completed it like 3 times 

But people only remember his first meme review and shit on the game when really it's an incredible experience"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"He'll make a video bashing it and going out of his way to intentionally make the game look clunky and unintuitive and then when everyone calls him out on it he'll make a second video where he says ""okay I was wrong"" but still nitpick about things."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I can’t stand that guy he’s always wrong and annoying af and always has been… never seen his appeal
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Supposedly the horror game is the one he's making for Xbox
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"It had a slow start, which turned a lot of people off. But it got really good, and was satisfying to play."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Most accurate description of the enjoyment of the game.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,you probably like strand-type games
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I remember watching livestreams thinking it was kinda boring, then I bought it and I really enjoyed it at my own rhythm. Really different experience."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,What a glowing review.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I still look back with satisfaction on all the zip lines I build. It took days and days of gameplay, but it was super rewarding in the end."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I played it on release, and the social aspect aliviated much of the early game difficulty."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Currently going through the Director Cut as my first playthrough on the PS5.

I love it! Refining my paths, MacGyver'ing up a bridge out of ladders to drive my truck over...

And there's always a progression of a neat new toy to use. 

Once I'm bored with the loop, i finish the roads that other players have mostly built already.



More came to mind;

It's immersive as hell, *without stopping you from enjoying the gameplay*. 
The character actually moves and interacts with the environment around them in a believable way. I never broke immersion because Geralt decided that desk looked like a stairway. Or Arthur awkward stepping/bumping into everything.

I'm sad more games haven't tried to take the improvements in how you move across the environment, like so many did with BoTW. 

I find myself playing other games going, *damn, if only i could drop a ladder here, or a climbing rope there.*

Good game, 👌"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2023-03-06,Princess Beach was Just a joke. You americans are too serious. Thats why i hate your games and just care about japanese productions.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"That moment when it turns into a side view fighting game is absolutely magical, The man is an absolute maniac and no one can stop him"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"This is just pure my speculation. It looks like both Sam and Fragile lives together, got attacked, and Fragile use her ""team"" to do revenge stuff and ask Sam to join...  


Probably MC still Sam but Fragile will have a bigger role rather than fast travel"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"That image looks like Lea Seydoux. I’ve yet to play the first, so I’m not sure if that’s a spoiler. Maybe I’ll start it this week."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Yea I loved the whole concept. He mentioned he wants people to break down the video to find hidden stuff so can't wait to check videos about it.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Actually the opposite.

I could be wrong here.

But at the end >! Amelie seemingly states it's destiny for the world to end and for her to end it. But after talking with Sam he kinda just goes ""hey what if you didn't"". And she's like the world's already fucked Sam. But Sams like ehh we're making do. So she caves and goes off to the beach leaving the world exactly like it is. Nothing is actually resolved. !<"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"And it's a fantastic walking simulator, so I'll gladly take a sequel"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"It just needed some more threats while delivering or variation with the ‘Events’ 

They became too predictable and easy to avoid

I’d welcome combat but I really hope it doesn’t just go the Shooter route. Give us more auxiliary robots or a mech to control as a means of combat"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I'm convinced that Kojima is a hack and that the gaming community just hasn't realized it yet.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"...but Death Stranding IS a third-person shooter already. It's just awful at it.

Remember the boss fights? Complete garbage.

If anything, DS really needs to improve on it's shooter combat. Badly. Hell, DS needs to improve on everything because the story is shit and the hiking mechanic is half-baked too."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Yes, I hope so too. Death Stranding had a good amount of those sections. But doesn't need to be all that."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Fair enough. I personally thought it was phenomenally created. Didn't expect to enjoy delivering packages so much, but the mechanics around it made it so enjoyable and satisfying. Loved every moment of it. I'm very excited for the sequel."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I’m so sad. I loved Hideo Kojima’s work and then it fell flat with Death Stranding. I bought the pre-order bridge baby… it was the best part.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Same, I played it for 2-3 hours and just couldn't get into it either...   Just not my cup of tea, but I'm happy for those that enjoyed it that they're getting sequel"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Agreed. Not sure why you're getting down voted. Game was just not my cup of tea. Too slow and boring.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,So don't play it
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I'm pretty sure he's got more projects on the go. At least that is what I heard and seen from leaks
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Search for the shirtless dude who leaked Overdose
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"That's like 75% of the game, I highly doubt they will. Probably just improve it further. But that's fine if you thought it was boring. Understandable, I personally enjoyed it a lot"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,">Death Stranding was an innovation to gaming.

What did it do that other games adopted?"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,The publisher :)
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Sony Interactive Entertainment
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I had to push through the first 10 hours and then I was hooked. One of my favourite games ever
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Yes, and calling it a walking simulator isn't an insult because it is a walking simulator and that's not a bad thing"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,You mean when he was making MGS he was wishing for war and stuff?
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Absolutely not lol. That would belong to bf 2042 or some shit. Just because you don't like the game doesn't mean it's bad. It's not everybody's cup of tea but it definitely has it's niche.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"it's literally not, Death Stranding is phenomenally made even if you like it or not. There are so many other games that I could list that are fully duds"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"It was played by 10 million people and the original port got 94% positive reviews on Steam from 88k voters who actually bought the game, on Metacritic it get the not bad rating of 7.4/10  from 18k voters."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-16,How has it tanked?
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,....SuperHot?
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"To his credit, he did arguably create the stealth genre with the original metal gear games. Although I’d agree with you Death Stranding was not genre defining"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,When did Kojima say it was?
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Tell me you didn't play without telling me
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,It’s actually Dead Space 2 remake.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,The FromSoft fans or the Nintendo fans?
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09, I loved wondering around and taking in the atmosphere.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Nope. This time he has to play it for the fourth time to have fun.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,It is a rare experience playing Death Stranding and i quite enjoy it.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I don't know what that dude goes for lol. Nobody knows when he's meme-ing or serious so I assume joke unless he's praising aspects directly
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,wait he did liked the game and beat it 3 times? not that i dont thrust you but you have a source?
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"The music and otherworldliness had me hyperfixated tbh

I’ve never spent so much time building roads"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,There was something just so peaceful about it. After a long day from work I couldn't wait to play it
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Memes and edgy twitch streamers turned a lot of people off it.  DS is an absolute masterpiece of the gaming industry and should be required study material for anyone looking to become a developer.  The only real limit was the map size and anyone who says different is just parroting vitriol to be part of the cool kid club
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"At which point it becomes good?

The slow start was so boring for me.. I tried it about 10 hours and then never touched it again. If you don't have too much time to play videos games (that's me as a 38 old father nowadays) wasting time by just walking somehwere an hour just feels wasted.

Don't get me wrong.. maybe the game is really good, but then I'm one of the people that got turned off."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I actually quite enjoyed the slow, shambling start where it really is a walking/hiking simulator. I'd go so far as to say that the game almost got *too* easy once you got your hands on the motorbike and other vehicles/tools."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Tbf,the whole game is pretty slow. But to me,it was super rewarding when you'd finally get whatever package you'd be delivering to it's destination and they'd be really thankful and then someone else (forgot his name)would come on and say you're rebuilding America. Made the whole trip worth it.

But I can see how that'd turn people off."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"The reasons I couldn't play it: I couldn't skip the long cutscenes, the game was too difficult for me, I had to play a lot to get to the actual fun stuff like the vehicle, and I didn't like being a relative of the president, because I can't relate myself to being someone important or special and so I can't feel connected to the character I'm playing as. I am nobody, you know."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Yeah I could never explain it. Just walking around trying to do a simple job felt relaxing. I couldn't wait to play it whenever I got back from work
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Nope, never played anything like it before. It was just different and I enjoyed it"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,Is the online aspect still active and populated on PS5? Ii upgraded to the ps+ with game catalogue on black Friday and was looking to start DS after I finish GoW2.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2023-03-06,"I am Italian lol

And you're a weeb from what I can see."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I wont be surprised if we start as Sam and later play as Fragile, kinda like mgs2 and snake/raiden or Kojima is baiting community that will happpen but it wont XD"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I kind of assumed the Fragile scene with the baby took place before DS1, since Fragile doesn’t have old lady body due to timefall exposure. 

If they can “repair” damage caused by timefall though that’s a game changer for the whole universe, arguably moreso than than the Tar Ship (unless that’s acts like a fast travel system, like it’s able to travel between Tar Pits by submerging)."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Something I'm wondering I thought fragile had time fall on her skin? At least I couldn't tell from the video. Also Sam having gray hair but his face didn't look especially old. Think his eyes are different color too? 

I'm wondering if we'll be able to travel around in that ship. Like a moving hub of sorts."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Lea is a secondary character in ds1, not much of a spoiler. She's in the trailers and shows up in like the 1st cutscene."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,"I love that the cast were famous names and Hollywood actors. But it didnt impede on the immersion. 

The way you are constantly being given more gadgets in your inventory to tackle the map was amazing. 

I really enjoyed the whole concept."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Yeah I kind of forgot about that part and was mainly thinking of the immediate dangers of Amilie, Higgs, and Clifford were resolved. Forgot Amilie going away didn't fix the death stranding."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,You are the secret genius.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"He's good, but he needs someone to tell him to chill.

He's in a George Lucas situation where he has complete control and no-one wants to tell him no."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-11,"Kind of agree with your point.    

The main gameplay is traversal, getting from one place to another as fast as possible without damaging the cargo in the process. Fights should be avoided and when you get into a fight, its often using the rope or bolo to subdue.   

This is a huge contrast to the boss fights which are pretty much all gunfights. I agree they really suck and dont even fit the theme of the game. Sam is a delivery man, not a soldier. Why are we in the trenches trying to take down a military unit? Nevermind the fact that there is no cover system, advanced guns use health, no dodge or slow aim. Makes sense since Sam is not a super soldier but it feels unnecessary. Furthermore, players who play the game properly shouldnt get any experience with the guns early game so the boss fights feel like punishment for drastically altering the gameplay. I agree they suck.   

The whole point was traversal though so they should go all in with the traversal and strip gunplay away (hell, go back to the stealth mechanic of MGS). Since that wont sell, they will probably work on improving gunplay and make it a generic third person shooter though."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"The boss battles against Mads were very jarring as a result imo. A game where you are encouraged not to kill and use the rope to counter and disarm and you are suddenly thrust into a one v many fight. Given the fact that you also dont really get much experience with the guns in the game, its not great.    

The traversal was interesting though and the faux multiplayer was my favorite implemented, second only to couch coop with friends. Given the fact that it received a mixed bag and Kojima mentioned that he needed to focus on “fun,” I do think DS2 will be more generic third person shooter for better sales and critical reception."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Not a dig at you, but I’m truly surprised at how many people weren’t completely turned off by the inventory/encumbrance management. That’s usually the shitty part of the game that you put up with, and they decided to make it a core mechanic! Glad you liked it, but it was not it for me at all."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,He's LONG past his best anyway. After MGS Peace Walker it was all downhill. That was the last great game he made.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,Oh thank you
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,">that's not a bad thing

zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,.............it was a joke not a dick do not take it so hard..........
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"It has some interesting ideas, but the way it's implemented is just...awful.

The hiking mechanic is half-baked. It's just...holding the triggers down. It's so fucking boring. You can't do anything unique or creative. Unlike MGS5 where you can do whatever-the-hell-you-want.

The combat is just...bad. Let's not even debate this. The boss fights suck. The shooting sucks. The combat sucks.

And whether you like the story or not, the way it is conveyed is also pretty bad. 50% of the ""cutscenes"" are just you talking to a hologram.

DS get's way too much love just because it's different. But different doesn't always mean good."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Cool. That’s your opinion and I have mine.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,It's not. It's wonky as fuck. If it didn't have an interesting tone and visuals it would be regarded as a piece of shit. Just traversing the terrain on the bike comes down to simply ramming it into shit until you bounce over it. It's scuffed as fuck.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-16,"In comparison to his old games. This game is a farce! Since MGS 5, his games are utter trash."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,"SUPER

HOT"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,He said it during the pre-release marketing during interviews. He said he believed it was venturing into a new genre. The whole “strand-type game” meme is a direct quote from him
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Tell me you’re a Kojima fanboy without telling me.

I did play it. It wasn’t a bad game, it just wasn’t it’s own genre."

I'm playing it now."

zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,He made a second video on death stranding
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Err, his second Death Stranding video... he says it's his third time playing it."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,First play through: building all the roads. Second play through: building a zip line network. How tf are *tasks* so damn fun?!
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I’m thankful to death stranding for introducing low roar to me
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Yeah, I loved wondering around and taking in the atmosphere. 

&#x200B;

I still built the roads though. Once you realize you can farm 2 mule camps for all of the supplies you need, it's pretty easy. Plus it's fun to practice clearing camps with stealth take-downs."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"That was one issue. Then we also live in a world where alot of people don't like a slow burn. It applies to other media as well. There is a reason games like COD and Fortnite, pretty much any shooter is always top."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"It's absolutely not a masterpiece. People need to stop throwing that word around. The controls are fucked, traversing the terrain on foot and on the bike is wonky as all Hell. There are multitudes of issues. You can enjoy it all you want but it's nowhere near a masterpiece."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I mean it's missing one of the key aspects of a game - it isn't fun to play, not even remotely. If you've been hiking IRL before then the scenery is nothing special, and for a game based entirely on walking the walking controls are exhaustingly awful.

I've played many games that I didn't find that enjoyable, but still finished for the sake of seeing the full story. I literally couldn't do that with DS because the game was genuinely so unpleasant to play.

Yes, I played the game just after its release, and specifically ensured to go in blind because it seemed like a new type of game and I didn't want to ruin the surprise. Maybe the reason everyone seems to disagree with you is just because most people didn't like it? In fact, could you name some upsides to the game? Besides having good graphics there really is nothing positive I could say about it. Story, dialogue, gameplay - all painfully uninteresting. I can't even see why someone pretentious would like it."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Saying you played 10 hours doesn’t really mean anything without knowing what chapter you got to.

The game really opens up around chapter 3"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I loved DS but putting in 10 hours is definitely more than enough to tell whether you'll like the game or not. Its a polarizing game for sure and its not for everybody.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,The slowness was actually what I enjoyed. I found it to be a really nice and relaxing break from hyper action focused games after a long stressful day.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I liked the slow pace as well. But later in the game you have more tools available to you, which does make it easier, but also means you have more ways to approach different problems. And that's fun too."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Yeah, I'm reading comments here and they're gonna make me go back and try again. ""Walking Simulator"" didn't turn me off. I love weird and ""boring"" games. I love grinding materials in games, ""work"" simulators like Papers Please, etc etc but this game didn't grab me.

But reading about building roads and ziplines definitely sounds interesting.  I don't know what chapter I made it to exactly, but >!I delivered my Mom's body, got back, talked to my sister, and was about to embark on a longer more distant trip (to see her or find her I think?), and that's where I stopped. !<

I think a second attempt (with no real expectations) is necessary now."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2023-03-07,"I just dont give a shit about american productions. Games written like movies to be super serious all the time, since ""adult = serious all the time"" no matter how silly the premise (zombie fungus, robot dinosaur) also, the most influential games ever are Japanese. Mario, Zelda, Metroid, Metal Gear, Biohazard, Street Fighter, Virtua Fighter, Tekken, Shenmue, Ico, Demons Souls and so on. The best artists, designers, composers and so on. Americans only know how to eat fast food, watch shitty NFL, smoke weed and shoot everywhere."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Tbh looking Fragile holding the baby in the trailer gave me a goosebumps
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,"Ahhh shittt I totally forgot about her ruined skin

I was too exited when i knew Lea is coming back

I knew she should have a much bigger role in the first game. 

So that baby stuff happened before the first game? Like prologue?

Then the question is, why she never mentioned that like ever, and who was the baby?"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Honestly, I was surprised how much I enjoyed it.  It became a sorta serene  cathartic experience.  It was a bizarre hiking simulator, but it made me understand why people like games like Farming Simulator, even if I can't get into that game.  If you couldn't get into DS1 I totally get it. It was not for everyone."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"well no, because it is a walking simulator and a very good one that excels in what it's trying to accomplish"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Only problem is you expressed the ""didn't like the first game"" sentiment to a post that couldn't scream I don't give a shit if you didn't like the first one, more. It's a post talking about them making a 2nd game in the series. In fact, Kojima is saying he doesn't give a shit that you didn't like the first one so hard, he is actually making a 2nd Death Stranding."

They blocked me lol anyway here you go.

zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"It's ok to not like it, the game isn't for everyone. However for the people who did enjoy it's super memorable. The story is pretty simple. It's a post apocalypse setting, except instead of a nuclear wasteland or aliens/zombies this apocalypse consists of the world of the living, purgatory and the afterlife merging into one. It only seems complicated cause the writing is trash, terminology and events aren't explained in the cutscenes so it seems like the characters are babbling nonsense. If you read all the text logs in the game, things become much clearer."

zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"People say this about every game when someone says they didn't finish it. ""Oh you just have to play MORE of it"". Ten hours is more than enough to tell if you won't like a game."

zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,I've been seeing theories mentioning possible time fall reversal. Think the baby is Lou so probably continuation from ds1. Maybe she was healed and settled down with Sam? Or is an aunty to Lou? Not sure but can't wait to find out more.

zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Proven by who? You? Plenty of people would agree with me. It was in development forever and turned out to be an incredibly dull and boring game with good graphics.

It intentionally makes you feel lonely and small at the start of the game as you work towards physically connecting the world and emotionally connecting with others.

zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Its one game I believe people saw the gameplay and wrote it off without trying it. This may sound werid but I do think it was a game designed with older gamers in mind. Most who called it a walking simulator were younger gamers
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I mean I played it for like a couple hours and never went back. I dunno, maybe I’ll go try it again someday, but holy fuck did it not interest me."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Come on man, we should be better than just dismissing every single person who didn’t like the game. You and I loved this game, and others didn’t. Their opinions are valid, and you have to be very ignorant to not understand where they’re coming from."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I did. It had one of the worst UIs I've *ever* seen in a game (how many clicks just to save the game?). The game severely disrespects your time as a player. Valid criticism is not ""being edgy"".

This popular Kojima stan talking point that anyone who doesn't like it must be some dumb COD or Fortnite bro who can't handle anything not being spoon fed to them is immature at best."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I played it for about 10 hours I think.. it was just boring in my opinion.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"You can spend 10 hours in the first two chapters if you wanted though and they suck. 

Once you get to chapter 3 it becomes much more fun but there’s nothing forcing you to advance to that chapter so a lot of players (myself included) didn’t push to that point because I wanted to do the side activities but quickly became bored.

I’m not saying op would’ve liked it just that 10 hours doesn’t mean anything since there’s so much optional content"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-10,"It's like bad TV show recs.  ""It gets good after season 1!"". When almost everytime that just means the person has awful taste an just consumes whatever they can think to.

zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I'm not denying people find it boring. There are plenty of games I find boring but that doesn't make them bad. I've tried multiple times to get into the first 2 Bioshock games, but just never can. But I've seen a lot of praise for the games.

It's exactly the same for DS, you find it boring and dull, but that does not make it a dud. There's a lot of praise for the game and people who enjoy it."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,I'd say it's proven by being the first strand-type game to get a sequel
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"The game wasn’t designed to appeal to the masses. Hence why you’re opinion is shit. He’s an auteur in the video game world, the whole point was to provide a genre defying experience, something in which Hideo Kojima succeeded at. This is why auteurs of the film world like Nicholas Windn Refn and Guillermo Del Toro were included in the cast, sharing a collective space for creativity. It has nothing to do with the game being a “dud.” It’s your inability to differentiate the subjective from the objective."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,It could be. That is kinda something that the community decides.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"It's not, the gameplay changes a lot as you go along, gaining new traversal tools, a bunch of different ways to interact with other players' creations. What you describe is the first hour of gameplay."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"It opens up significantly afterwards, that mission ends the ""tutorial""."

zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I’m a 32 year old gamer and really enjoyed death stranding. That said, it fell flat for me a little around chapter 10ish. It just started losing some of the mystique and feeling more repetitive. I still finished it but my point is that i don’t believe it was a ‘perfect’ game or is undeserving of any criticism. It is a walking simulator to many extents but the logistics that go into encumbrance management were deep and provided some interesting gameplay. I wish the ‘events’ had a bit more variation and were less easy to avoid. The pay off of building the networks and roads was short lived and I wish the game utilized them more. Eg optional chase events that benefitted from an established zip line network/connected roads or something."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Zero clicks? It autosaves. Or is that a feature they added in the directors cut?
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I am not interested in opinions or fallacies.

you are the one acting like its an objective truth."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Lmao no, it isn’t. It’s not s matter of opinion. If people suddenly decide that Modern Warfare II is a new genre compared to Modern Warfare 2019 does that somehow make it a new “modern warfare” genre? No, it doesn’t.

Death Stranding is a 3rd person action/adventure game with some cool elements, but it’s not a new genre"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"i agree with with a lot of your points. its not without flaws and critic. i understand why the game would be too slow for alot of people. where i am in life and with responsibilities with family and walk, it just hit a sweet spot for me. it s not a game i would ever recommand to someone who likes shooter like halo, COD or fornite not even people who like hack and slash."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"The real problem is those autosaves all stack and you can't delete them. You can only delete your entire save file for some reason, unless it's been patched.

It's why I stopped playing the ps5 version, my save file was 2GB and all I'd done was build road networks around the 2nd region. 

By the time I finish the game the save file will be as big as the game itself."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,You can also manually save. But it takes going through 3-4 sub menus just to find it.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,How is that different to something like Soulslikes?
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"That depends. Society dictates everything and the majority usually win. When you die and pass along if society decides it was genre defining, never before done. Youre just a corpse that cant do shit about it."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"I critique it for similar reasons as I may critique breath of the wild or Project zomboid. Death stranding is in this category. Games that are so close to flawless game design to me but have some glaring issues. 

Botw, lacked unique shrine/dungeon design and was plagued with too much combat repetition and lacking in difficulty. But was otherwise a masterpiece and a refreshing revitalization of the Open World genre amidst so many Ubisoft clones. 

Project Zomboid is in my opinion one of the best and most logically realistic survival games ever made and only continues to get better. While the modding community adds a lot of quality of life improvements, the overall game is a bit limited and combat is clunky. The upcoming NPC (and I assume improved zombie Ai) and animal husbandry update should help fix some of these issues.

Death Stranding is one of the most captivating worlds I’ve ever entered. I was hooked from the first ‘event’ atop that mountain. Chilling visuals, a beautiful score and surprisingly realistic encumbrance mechanics. I wanted more from the world building and while I understand that feeling of isolation was the intent of the developers, I wanted more. 

Like botw and project zomboid, I’m more inclined to critique altruistically because the game is near-perfect and clearly represents good game design ethics. It’s easier to levy critique when a jigsaw puzzle has nearly every piece. On the other hand, a game that is truly bad doesn’t merit that same level of thinking or critique when there are too many issues to fix or puzzle pieces missing and the ‘good state of the game’ is too blurred behind the haze of flaws. 

Death stranding just needs a few tweaks to the gameplay and threat-frequency, maybe a bit more emphasis on Re-utilizing old roads and routes to help connect the world building and it’d be perfect. I have high hopes for DS2"
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,Literally just Start -- > System -- > Save Game.
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Because soulslikes have a myriad of unique elements that made it into a unique subgenre. Death Stranding’s gameplay isn’t ***that*** unique. It has some cool elements but it’s really not as different as some people make it out to be.

Maybe if a bunch of other devs decide to make Strand-likes it could become its own genre, but as it stands it’s not a unique genre."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,"Lmao no. It doesn’t matter what people say or how many people say it the facts don’t back it up. You can’t just call a game a new genre without good reason, and Death Stranding has no good reason to be called a new genre."
zgjwxy,2022-12-09,2022-12-09,That last part is what I was trying to say. Sorry if I didn't put it well.
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Every new trailer raises more questions than it answers 
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,what in the sweet heavenly FUCK is going on
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Don’t let the trailer distract you from that future umbrella. 
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I like the idea of non-infinite bag space, it looks like what you carry is represented on your back and by drones?

The baby is insurance policy against being time dilated to your death? If those things touch you, you go forward.. so make a clone baby of yourself? Heck. I dont know. But I want to."
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"""Oh, I get it now!"" said no one."
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I don't fucking know what this game is
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Baby butt intro killed me lol

8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,wtf is this some sort of USPS simulator
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,That scene where he removes his toe**nail** made me nauseous
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Kojima should be hospitalized. What the actual fuck.

When can I buy this?"
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,holy shit this game is expensive as fuck. 
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I want whatever Kojima smokes...
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I think it's about a guy who has to reclaim dead bodies from hard to reach places, like on Everest or something? Then some anime shit happens? I love it."
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"In Death Stranding you play as a deliveryman in the upside down. Your backpack baby helps you detection invisible package thief's that will drown you in bile if you're spotted. Also, don't breath."
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Well...he showed us gameplay this time. Can't complain about that.
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Uber Eats Adventures is looking neat
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Norman Reedus and the funky fetus
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,3 years later and I have no idea when or where this game is taking us but I will always follow the reedus fetus 
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I hate when trailers reveal too much I basically know the whole story now smh 
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I have no idea what's going on but it looks freaking amazing. 
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,This could be a walking Sim and I'd be thrilled to play it.
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"WHAT THE FUCK KOJIMA?!

WHAT IN GOD'S GOOD NAME ARE YOU PRESENTING TO US?!

HOW DO WE INTERPRET THIS? WHAT'S HAPPENING? WHY CAN'T I FEEL MY LEFT ARM?"
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I STILL KNOW NOTHING! WHERE THE FUCK IS EVERYONE ELSE FROM THE OTHER TRAILERS? AM I A FUCKING MAILMAN. IS THIS FALLOUT 5??? SO MANY QUESTIONS!
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Unexpected Lea Seydoux.
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"All I know, Kojima is free. "
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,this new MGS looks good
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The more I see about this the sadder it makes me about Silent Hills not happening. If you don't know wtf is going on here, add on top of it the dread of the dark and the unknown in a haunted town."
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Those things are Dementors and the Baby is a Patronus
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Oh, now I get it."
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"You play as ""Gaseous"" Reedus (""Gaseous"" Reedus) to take on the global AntiFederalists cell which is plotting to take control of war as we know it by using a nanomachine virus that selectively targets people who liked Dances With Wolves. From the brilliant mind of Kojima is the newest tactical crawling simulator. "
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Backpacking on LSD simulator
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"This is so unearthly cinematic, so incredibly obscure but endearing. This trailer makes me feel like this game is one of those truly artistic interactive experience that cannot be replicated in any other media form.

I am very excited to see what Kojima has done with this and I am super depressed it's a console exclusive but I'm excited nonetheless for what it appears to offer.

Such a well made trailer with such deeply haunting imagery and gameplay. That toenail rip made me wince like that was my own foot. The tension and fear as the invisible creature walked toward the protagonist. Everything felt so lucid but dreamlike at the same time.

Very excited to see more"
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,THE FUCK IS THE POINT OF RIPPING OFF YOUR WHOLE TOENAIL
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I don't think I'll be playing this game because I don't feel like screaming out of fear and pissing myself. 
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Kojima is the second coming of jesus.
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Any theories? lol
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Holy shit this game looks beautiful. 
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,So its a hiking sim
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Don't be talking shit about Norman Reedus and his Norman Fetus.
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"His bags  become guns, this show up very quickly in the final montage of press, i thinks the game is not only about hide from shadows."
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Half budget of this game gonna be for Kojima's cocaine and other things.
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I don't drink or do drugs but I want whatever shit Kojima does because it's gotta be the best shit on Earth.
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Am... am I high?
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"It's interesting, but gameplay-wise... what do we actually have in here?"
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It's like they took the subtleties of Kojima's elusive facial expression and storyboarded them into whatever in the fuck this is.
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Oh man, I'm sooooooo glad this trailer cleared up all my questions from last three confusing trailers."
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I want this but I don’t know why. 

Classic Kojima then. "
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I really hope we don't see fps drops, the game looks amazing"
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"It's so simple guys, it's a delivery/parenting/apocalyptic/thriller/SciFi/story driven/open world/adventure/rpg/simulator. "
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Right so it's like space courier who hears voices and hides from invisible things. Also inexplicable character interactions and mouth baby...got it
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Ohhh I get it now
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Norman Reedus and the Funky Fetus 
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I feel like this is Kojima's answer to the question ""How do video game characters carry around all their inventory?""

"
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"So far from the gameplay I can tell the following:

It's a carrying heavy shit cross country simulator with spooky invisible monsters who want to stop you."
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"All jokes aside, between this, Last of Us II and missing the last Uncharted I think I should buy a PS4. had a PS3 but sold it ages ago.

I'm going to assume Red Dead II is console only at launch."
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Look at my backpack, my backpack's amazing!

Give it a lick! ooo it tastes just like raisins."
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"So apparently when there is an element in the gameplay that's a little weird it just shuts down people's brains and suddenly they have no idea what they have seen.

The gameplay shows a man who makes deliveries to distant places. There is a crapload of environmental storytelling going on. Sometimes the man needs to traverse difficult terrain. Sometimes the man deploys little robots that help him carry things. Sometimes there are treacherous areas where you will need to use a rifle to make your delivery. Sometimes there are treacherous areas where you will need to use a baby-powered vision enhancing device to stealth past the danger. There are also cutscenes while you do all that. Something is wrong about the world you play in. There is a woman that you probably had to deliver somewhere (as a package) and once there she woke up and had a conversation with the protagonist.

These are all understandable things to me. The only thing I wonder about is what will be the ratio between just the protagonist traversing places and some sort of stealth or combat action. It feels like Kojima is going for the feel you had in Shadow of the Colossus, where you had a lot of lonely traveling and occasional action."
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Such a kojima game. it's like acid and cocaine buttfucked a horror/thriller game
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Creepy AF. Details when?
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I am even more confused than before, jesus."
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,So it seems you get a baby bro to help and some invisible creatures that gives you allergy rashes. Also this game looks amazing ! That scenery and how the guy was walking on the rocks looks freaking awesome.
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I was more confused by the way Sony executed their conference than this game. And this game is WTF
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Still have no idea what is going on, still just as excited."
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,This is the David Lynchiest thing I have seen in a video game.
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I'm guessing all those ""empty"" landscapes we see aren't actually empty at all. "
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,So you're a courier. Fallout new vegas 2 confirmed!
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,So this is splinter cell with a fetus and windmill?
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Oh! Ok! Got it....delivery sim. What?!
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Give me hand in cryptic trailers
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I have not seen this season of walking dead. Did Deryl get thrown into an inter-dimensional portal or something?
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"With the carrying of stuff on hills and mountainous areas, I’m getting some serious LOTR vibes. 
"
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Game of the show! 

Those massive vistas looked drop dead gorgeous. "
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,One is sure about the gameplay \- in this game you do stuff. 
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,...wut?
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"And jamey summers there at the end, wow. Thats the bionic woman for you whipper snappers."
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Is no one else going to point out that when Norman says that they are closing in the guy on the radio says it doesn't matter if you die because you will come back but the surrounding area will be a crater. 

I'm guessing that some sort of time event took place where all timelines take place at the same time.

The ghosts are enemy's in the past or future and near the end of the trailer they are dragging Norman into there time period."
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,First half looks like Planet Express the video game
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Why doesn’t Xbox get any good exclusives like PS4? This looks fucking sick 
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Im just excited to know i can get aroused by a digital Lea Seydoux 
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I think I will finally buy a PS4 only for this.
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"This is basically ""Carry Stuff While Being Scared in Space: The Game""."
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Y’all joke, but I guarantee the rhyming of Reedus and fetus had something to do with the origination of this crazy ass world during the brain storming part of development."
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Finally a game where you can climb up steep mountain sides. Scramble on up champs.
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The way that woman ate that weird grub thing...

Not my proudest fap."
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Looks like your run of the mill delivery man simulator in world full of man-eating ghosts that sucks the life out of you or pushes your years forward A LOT. This probably explains why he straps on a baby clone of himself so if he gets ""eaten"", his baby clone grows to be the same age as he is now. Pretty messed up, but par for the course for Kojima."
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,So its an extreme backpacking game? I'd need a Flextrack whipsnake for that!
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It looks...... barren......
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I understand Kojima's flair for the mysterious and all but I really wish at some point, he'd show the game off a little bit more. If you wanna be mysterious just show us some platforming or combat or something out of context.

I'm not really digging this new trend of games that are sort of interactive movies that you just progress through. Creativity is great, but I need more than a whacky-anime-story, QTEs and a new walking animation every 40 feet to make me wanna spend 70 dollars."
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Norman reedus and the funky fetus
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"This might be an unpopular opinion but I have absolutely no interest in this game whatsoever. It is too wacky, too outlandish, and too purposely confusing for me to even begin to enjoy whatever it is. Maybe I'm just an idiot and can't see the masterpiece that this game is or something, but I think I'll give this one a hard pass."
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,This is fucking stupid. 
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Huh.
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Really diggin the look of this and I'm all for cerebral games.
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"So far, we know we can walk in this game.... oh, and crawl!"
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,3 trailers and I still don't understand shit. I have more questions.
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Good ole Kojima mind fucking. 
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,wut
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I see Iceland landscapes, Sci-fi setting, time-travel, Dark theme... Im hyped"
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I need to know what is happening!

Bright side, at least Daryl finally took a shower."
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"This is a perfect example of a video game so weird, it’s pretty interesting to see what the fuck will happen next. "
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,What even is Hideo Kojima at this point
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Walking simulator 2019

8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Oh it makes total sense now. 
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Well, w.t.f. "

8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Hideo Kojima's Otherworldy Apocalypse Delivery Simulator is the most interesting game of this E3. Can't wait!
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Surely this game is some elaborate metaphor for Konami fucking over Kojima and his baby metal gear?
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I have no fucking idea what I just saw... But I kinda liked it!

8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I have only vague ideas about what's going on, but I fucking dig it so far. 

I feel like there's going to be heavy time travel shit and the reason he pulls out an Emergency Baby is because it might be a clone of his? And getting .. attacked? eaten? whatever? by those Frieza-looking shades might age him rapidly, maybe killing him (Indiana Jones style) but maturing Emergency Baby enough to continue a mission? 

I don't know tho. That's just my wild stab in the dark. "

8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"So I’m guessing:

Those things are either aliens or extradimensional entities that have invaded the world and ruined it. Norman Reedus/James is a delivery guy who takes important packages to people. Since he has to travel through the wasteland where those monsters are he has tech to protect him. The babies may somehow be connected to the invisible creatures since iirc the very first trailer showed tiny baby handprints appearing just like the ones made by the creatures. Also they seem to have shadowy umbilical cord things, so maybe those babies turn into those things. No idea about the maggot thing that woman eats, or who that woman is, or who that other woman is, or what Mads is up to."

8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Was legit googling this right before it showed up on live stream and was delighted. Then extremely confused. 
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I honestly cannot wait for this game. I'm fucking stoked!

Kojima truly is a genius. I know the man is not infallible but my God, he is so talented at what he does. He creates these works of art that are beautiful in their own right, while at the same time, being totally open to interpretation. And of course, like any great creator, he injects his own personal truth into them!

If I had to guess, this game is about death and rebirth. It is about the ""baggage"" people carry with them along the way. It is about how many times we allow the darkness inside of ourselves to haunt us and follow us everywhere we go. But it's also about hanging onto our humanity, our child-like wonder, to get us through those times and shine our light!

My two cents, anyways... I think everyone gets so caught up in having something that is a literal story. I am sure the game will have one. But make no mistake, he's cutting these trailers and being this ambiguous for a reason "
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"He says he makes deliveries, I wonder if he means acting as a surrogate host? Like he retrieves body's and regrows their fetus, thus bringing them back to life, that's a hell of a job."

Oh cool a Kojima game

There's a lot of walking, it looks like you can even fail at it.

That dude is carrying too much.

Oh the walking guy is the guy from the walking dead.

Oh a sexy penance cosplay.

It's an invisible handstand monster.

8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Kojima said that the gameplay will be unique. I think that the game will be a sort of strategy stealth. You don't need to worry much about dying but reaching to your destination is the challenge. You can go into some location and suicide while the enemies remain there after that the area will be clear and you can continue  , also your death might change some of the environment according to kojima in one of his interview. The weapons and combat is only used against human enemies that been shown in another trailer. "
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Does anyone know why Konami fired Kohima? I mean from a business standpoint it seems like the dumbest move. Was he hard to work with? Did he want too big of budgets? I mean they fired him off the tail of MGSV selling 6 million copies.

8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"It's very simple. You see time traveling Guillermo Del Toro created the nanomachines which fused with ancient man's vocal chords, (which is why you hide by covering your mouth) but they also created the shadow gooblies which gave Mads Mikkelson the power to control postal systems (which is why you play as a courier) but Norman Reedus is fighting Mads in a custody battle over the weird baby and all this actually takes place after MGSIV but is ACTUALLY taking place during the late Permian period."

8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,At least this makes more sense than the last E3 trailer.
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I love Kojima and know he'll somehow make this atleast have excellent gameplay if nothing else, but the gameplay isnt exactly reassuring. "
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The one thing I know for sure is that the environments are absolutely breathtaking, and that walking around them and managing my baggage is going to be better than it sounds. Have you seen this fucking engine!?"
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Right?
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I guess you're a transporter of goods and can be intercepted by other players. That's the only thing that would kinda make sense. The rest, I have no idea."
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"So seeing as I see no actual answers. Some people on the youtube trailer theorised that the gameplay is about the rain. 

In the trailer they call it timefall, not rain. Meaning the fetusses are clones that you can switch consciousness to probably. So that if you stay in the fall too long, the clone will have grown mature instead. 

After hearing that I think they're on to something. "
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"That is my problem with this game in general. Am I the only one who is frustrated with not knowing jack shit about this game?  I understand that you can't go and spoil the game but some information is would be nice. It's been 2 year since the first teaser and while it looks gorgeous, no one knows anything about it. "

> to drive or leave ashore

> to bring into or leave in a helpless position

In other words, the dead are in limbo?"

8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"No I don't think that's what the baby does. If so, why would he wake the baby up to look at the floating shadow people? "
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,This is it for sure. 
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Thays what i was thinking, the baby is avtually a cloe of yourself so if you get caugjt and age into dust your duplicate ia still there to carry on your(seemingly) improtant task"
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"i don’t think so, because in the first trailer we see norman reedus waking up and crying holding the baby which won’t if the baby was just for respawning and later the baby disappears leaving those black crawl marks, also when norman dies and comes back their is a supposed to be a crater as seen in the 3rd trailer and mentioned in the latest one. This has to be related to some weird explainable physics thing ( i think this, because in the very first poster for the game their were some equations written relating to black holes on the dog tag)"
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Baby may also be a sort of camouflage as well? When he said he had ""an idea"" he ""hooked up"" the baby and the light thing started fluttering and focusing on the demon thingies.
I'm thinking that the ""demons"" are in another dimension, kinda like the upp-side-down in stranger things, and babies might not be seen or whatever by the demons.

8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"This makes a lot of sense! I'm thinking when people are killed by the floaters they get trapped in a pocket space which resembles some of the weird landscapes from previous trailers, Norman & co. are tasked with recovering the bodies (which saves them from an eternal nightmare). So game-play could involve entering various weird dimensions. "

8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Stealth gameplay for the most part I assume. I feel like those shadow dudes will pop up very frequently when you e.g. walk up a hillside and suddenly you gotta activate Emergency Baby to see the shadow dudes. Could be very intense.

8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Yeah, people forgot about that. Now whole movie plot is in the trailer. Like they shown twist in beyond good and evil 2. It would be so much better to be surprised in the game.

8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Yeah I'm loving this trailer because as far as a video game goes it's both raising ambiguities in the actual story while giving you insight into the unique gameplay, but also raising deeper questions there"
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Yeah but Kojima has a long history of whattisms and wtfuckery so this pretty much confirms more of the same.

8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,No? I'd much rather know enough about the gameplay to understand what kind of game it is than not. That doesn't mean it needs to spoil the entire game/movie which is common among trailers.

8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-13,"Kojima is a master at keeping his cards close to his chest. I still remember pre-Metal Gear Solid 2, all the footage shown was gameplay and cutscenes with Solid Snake. When the game came out (or at least when reviewers had copies) it was revealed that was only a quarter of the game, if even that much, and you'd spend the remainder of the game as a completely new character in a setting that wasn't previously shown at all."
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I got the feeling that it might be more of an experience than a game. I know many people are skeptical of that, but I've seen some amazing games pull it off. The one this reminds me the most of is a weird Wii game called Fragile Dreams Farewell Ruins of the Moon, where everyone except you dies and you then you run into someone else who bolts away. You spend the game wandering the planet looking for her and learning about how everyone else died."

8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,This'll be a walking simulator of sorts I think. There's gonna be some amount of action with that one dude opening his space suitcase and unpacking a rifle. 
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"He said on Twitter that he wanted to make a silent trailer,  so I guess the lack of action fits thematically - I’d imagine the actual game is a bit more action. Kojima is known for story but also definitely a bit of a gameplay buff, he always seems very interested in satisfying mechanics it’s what separates him from a lot of other writers. 

I guess it’s also why Neil and Bruce worked so well together (Come back Bruce)"
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-13,"He does equip a weapon eventually, doesn't he? So we're not seeing some of the gunplay. "
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Because I bet it not even actual gameplay. This was just another teaser. I will wait for the trailer with the release date at the end for the actual gameplay. The ending of the trailer makes it feel like it was just a short teaser movie made especially for e3 and too get people saying wtf is this game. He's building the hype for the final trailer and the release date. 

His other teasers were just like this. this just gave us a little more back story. "
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I agree. It seems like an interesting concept, but when you remember this is a game and games are supposed to be fun, wandering around a barren empty wasteland seems like it would get old fast."
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It looks like a 4th dimensional umbrella meant to protect against 'time fuckery'. See how it shimmers in and out of existence?

8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"From what we've seen we can at least make out some general themes/world building.. I could see him carrying all those boxes be a thing in this world in a sense that just casually driving stuff around would be far too dangerous because everyone who does try it just dies. So people carry stuff on their own to other locations. Maybe Normans job was it so deliver a child somewhere else? The thing the woman ate is definitely what would become the child we've seen that develops inside a person, or maybe even in Norman as seen in other trailers? The children seem to give Norman the ability to see those monsters by linking it to his device thats normally running on ???; seems like he run out of energy and had to link it up, normally he's only able to sense them. Its not ""just"" the monsters that make people age as we've seen now.. Its also the rain whats causing it, which also links back to all those whales or other sea creatures to wash up on the shore.. if the rain has been bad for so long.. the sea must be just as fucked.

From what we've seen there are maybe around 4 groups at work..  
~~Civilians (Guillermo del Toro)~~ (He has a pin of the company ""Bridges"" on his suit so he probably works for/with them and had to take over for one of the,  
Delivery Companys: Porter, Bridges (that Norman both works for, maybe freelance) and Fragile(, Handled with Love(which the woman works for))  
The monsters  
And what it seemed like a faction who harnesses their powers? (Mads Mikkelsen)"

8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I don’t think the shadow creatures are revealed by light (at least not something that simple).  I remember Reedus’ character saying he can only feel the creatures but not see them.  I want to say only a few characters can actually see the shadow creatures.  I think the light shows that the fetus is able to actually see them.  The light may be some kind of way of projection of what the kid sees. Maybe some kind of child’s imagination resemblance.  Also I’m still trying to understand the shadow military characters from earlier trailers.  I’m guessing this is some kind of alien life form that’s taken over earth and the shadows are host seeking to take over your body once taken to the darkness and eaten.  Like the time fast forwarding is them eating your soul all while they take over your physical form which did not actually age.

Just guessing like everyone else here. "

8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,And maybe the mark on the back of his hand and his knuckles are related to his past lives! The most obvious connection would be the 3 dots and what looks like a skull.
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Also rain, is called timefall. Probably the rain ages you too, so they have a back-up baby clone with them? "
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Yeah...you nailed it here. The trailer would still have been intriguing without it, but that shot of the baby at the beginning took it from 0-60 on the weirdometer and didn't let up from there"

8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"If we're being serious, we really dont know enough to guess how expensive the game is (we've really only seen cinematic trailers and snippets of what is most likely gameplay).

The engine was developed by Sony-Owned Guerrilla Games to make Horizon Zero Dawn. Since the game is a PS4 exclusive they most likely got the rights to use the engine for free.

So with the engine out of the way you've got the normal game stuff like writers, voice actors, level design, asset creation, corporate, etc. Nothing special. Just kojima being kojima."
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It also makes sense with the title of the game : Death *Stranding* as in they are stranded in their death ? :O
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"This is likely, if you have seen the other trailers you see that people try desperately to kill themselves if they get caught.  It must be something much, much worse than death. "
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I honestly wouldn't have believed you could show gameplay footage and walk away still not having at least some kind of idea of what the game is.

The end was still attached when I was at the hospital, they simply pushed the ""finger"" end back under the flesh and wrapped it up.

The new nail grew under the old one, and eventually pushed it off."

8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Reminds me of Dear Esther.
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The feeling from the trailer, yea. But, knowing Kojima's track record and Sony letting him do whatever he wants, I doubt it'll just be ""an experience"""
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Kojima mentioned how the two primary mechanics were based on ""ropes"" and ""sticks,"" the earliest inventions of man, so there is bound to be combat of some sort. Otherwise it's ""dragging a corpse up a hill simulator."""
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,yea remember the first trailer with that army and those weird as fuck biowarriors
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Yeah, I suspect a good part of the game is making deliveries while avoiding the shadow monsters. Since you can't see them, that means the entire time you have no clue whether you're safe or not. That sounds terrifying."
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"But then again, from the other trailer there's flesh tanks and skeleton comandos, so i'm sure we'll be seeing combat too."

8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"While yes, I think it is supposed to protect against that, I'm pretty sure the 'rain' that is falling has something to do with the weird physics. It seems like Reedus avoids the rain, and bad things happen when it rains. Someone on youtube is doing a weird ""Death Stranding is MG0"" video series, and I gotta say, its pretty interesting. Kojima has a connection he likes to draw between rain and death, mostly visible in MGS3, with the Sorrow and his rain."
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,The game comes with free temporal anti aliasing.

8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It sets the people on the edge.
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Exactly my thoughts, and the fact that it's linked by that umbilical cord is probably a way to transfer memories. No fetus = instant death."

>  And maybe the mark on the back of his hand and his knuckles are related to his past lives! The most obvious connection would be the 3 dots and what looks like a skull, maybe hinting that he has died thrice.

"
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"you're shitting me, really? i thought the baby could see the others?

you know, at the start of the video the guy over comms asks if he can see them and he says no but he can sense them.

so with the baby and the weird antenna thing he can make them visible, not just sense them.

that was my take at least."
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"He pulls out the gun as he approaches some buildings. Maybe it's for the people, not the shadow monsters."
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,The gun is for them to kill themselves because being consumed by those monsters is far more horrible than just killing yourself. You've seen another person try it in the other trailer and then after dropping the gun begging Norman to shoot him but that would reveal Normans location to the monsters so he had to suffer.
8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"You're right. In article sourcing Kojima, it states that you'll be able to shoot your way through the game if you want, but that its not the ideal way to go about it. You will have multiple paths to tackle any obstacles in your path, and the game isnt so much about combat and killing the enemy so much as 'reconnecting the world'. But combat will be there, a leak even went around saying everything from swords to machine guns. So who knows.

8qf5sj,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Not even just a little gameplay. That was like, *a lot of gameplay*. And it told us literally nothing except that the game will involve carrying boxes. "

w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,We share a bday!
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,!remindme April 26
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,"After I dropped off Facebook, I, sadly, found out who actually remembered my birthday.  
My wife's situation was worse, because some of her own sisters forgot :/"
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,I have at least 4 games that wish me a happy birthday and give me gifts. I always make sure to play each and every one of those games so i at least know my digital friends care
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,"To be fair, after a point birthday's kinda cease to exist. I'm 27 and my last two or three birthdays I didn't even realize were my birthday until halfway through the day lol"
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,True
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,The only reason I've kept a facebook account is because it reminds me of upcoming birthdays.
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,You share the same birthday as me fellow Internet stranger!
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,No way we share the same birthday!
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,Bro most of my friends only tell me Happy Birthday cause Facebook told them it was and that doesnt even happen anymore because I dont have Facebook. Its overrated. Rather have online gaming friends anyways.
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,My first time seeing something like that was on the ps3 with Metal gear solid the phantom pain still love it to this day
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,"This was me with Animal Crossing. And again on MGSV:TPP

Was really cool!"
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,RemindMe! 26th April
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,"Wait, your B-Day is April 26th? We’re Birthday Twins!"
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,"I remember when this happened to me in Phantom Pain; big celebration with all the Diamond Dogs, complete with Quiet literally shooting a happy birthday message into boxes on my birthday… good time"
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,Tomodachi Life moment
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,"oh man, I remember the first time I found out that happens in Pokemon...I was playing Y on my bday and a bit sad (forgot why sad) but as I entered the Pokemon Center, the lights dimmed and I was wondering if the game crashed...

""Happy Birthday!"" it was so unexpected and nice, I teared up."
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,My friends never give me a cut scene.
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,How fucking sad Kojima is the only dude that wished me a happy birthday since MGSV :(
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,"If you're not a kid, throw a party and invite your friends to celebrate with you."
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,Your birthday is april 26 then
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,our birthdays are one day apart
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,Why would the game wish your friends happy birthday when you're the one playing the game?
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,Pokemon Sword did this to me
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,Why would a game know who my friends are?
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,My friends have never once made a cutscene for my birthday.
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,Accurate which is why I rarely use or check Facebook..
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,!remindme 281 days
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,"Happy birthday, birthday buddy!"
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,"I had to remind my friends it was my birthday, one bought me fast food."
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,"Haha, my birthday is also on the 26th is April"
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,Example 1 of many why ORAS is peak main Pokémon
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,"This was me with Animal Crossing New Horizons....my birthday two years ago was absolute shit and my ex-bf and the people I was living with forgot about it. So I played animal crossing all day. I cried when my villagers sent me bday letters 🥺

Birthdays since then have been better 💜 better partner and better friends. But I always thank my ACNH villagers for helping me that year"
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,Yoo April 26 bros
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,One of the best birthday presents I ever got was when animal crossing gave me the NES Excitebike and I realized I could actually play it
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,MGSV.
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,"Pokemon does this, as well, on the systems that track the user's bday.

Getting a happy birthday from the PokeCenter at midnight was pretty funny."
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,RemindMe! 281 days
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,I missed the metal gear solid 5 cutscene because I was playing just shapes and beats for the first time.  The Xbox port had finally came out and I finished it on my birthday
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,I once had forgotten it was my birthday until Animal Crossing on the GameCube reminded me.
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Feels

w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"PUBG wished me an Happy birthday and a a B-day gift, and my friends didn't even remembered it"
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Me when I clocked in for work at Walmart on October 7th and the corporate wageslave clock in machine is the only thing to wish me a happy birthday
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,April 26 buddies what's up~
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,"Happy birthday, congratulations! Happy birthday, with salutations! Happy birthday, may your sky stay blue! Happy birthday to you! 

This might be the best version of the song"
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,That moment was awesome
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,My mate has sent me the mgsv video for my birthday since it came out :) he's a good dude.
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,"I remember MGS2 had a brief 'Happy Birthday!' message as well, super-sweet"
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Kojima’s a good writer
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,Oh shit i gotta make sure metal gear is downloaded
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Exactly what I was thinking about
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,Is animal crossing on pc?
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,At least they threw me a party 🥺
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,What If I don't have any friends? Where can I buy some
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,"I only know if my friends birthdays if they tell me a few days before, heck one time a friend of mine forgot his own birthday!"
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,"It's approximately 2 minutes of work to put birthdays into your calendar. If you can't even be arsed to do that, whoever it is is not your friend."
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"First parents can’t remember their kids in a car now people can’t remember their friends birthdays either. Literally today, I recalled a coworkers birthday was coming up and they asked how I remember that. Seriously, it’s just cause I care about people….and my children. Next people will be forgetting kids in their cars on their kids birthday that they forgot."
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"But it still hurts, specially your bestfriend who you have spent all year together"
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,"Yup 26 april was my birthday and my last time playing because i got all achievements on that day, it had a special bday cutscene and also a cake in our room lol"
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"It asks you to confirm your birthday when you first start the game up to make this happen. The joke is on them though, mine is in February and I'll be long done with the game by then!"
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,You don't wish your friends happy birthday when it's not their birthday? Real homies say happy birthday everyday
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,"I honestly don't remember any of my family's birthdays other than my dad, and I only know his because it's December 31st and kinda hard to forget."
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,"Meanwhile, I'm turning 32 next week and have been making sure everyone knows its my birthday month."
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,"I know that feel. Sometimes I don't even remember if I'm 26, 27 or 28."
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,I know my DOB but I've lost track of my age. I refuse to do the math.

w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,You don't need to I am here wanna be friends?
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,I've heard that [getafriend.net](https://getafriend.net) has some good deals right now.
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,"Start doing something.  A hobby, a sport, just anything that gets you out of the house and around other people.  What interests you?  Find other people who are also interested in it.  Be polite, be friendly, just be the kind of person people want to be friends with.

Friends are nothing more than people you've spent enough time with."
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,"So I'm not a real friend to my friends because I don't put their birthdays in my calendar?

The calendar I don't even use I'll add."
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,"People normally don't tell you their bdays, and asking them is kinda weird

Like, when is your birthday? And while on it what are the last 4 digits on your social credit number?"
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,well i'd have to know their birthday to put it in my calendar
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"I just don't see how remembering someone's birthday shows you care.

If someone remembers mine I don't think that they care. I usually just think it's weird they bothered to remember. But I don't celebrate or even tell people about my birthday so there's that.

If someone tells me it matters to them tho I'll try to remember it."
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,Its simple but good love the Dev's for a lot of mini details like this
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,"Hey, that's my birthday too."
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,"Mines the 27th of April, birthday neighbours!"
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Long done u say. Try out threadmill as controller and finish this game. IDK the guy's name but he manager to make this game into healthy lockdown exercise
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,"depends what animal crossing he was talking about, new horizons is on switch (aka yuzu emu) but previous installations of ac are on other i
Nintendo consoles (honestly new leaf is my favourite animal crossing)"
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,Yes
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,funny how I thought it's real
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,I was joking but i do appreciate the tips
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"I think it's almost entirely dependent on how one views their own birthday. I used to not care about my own birthday and I only remembered my mom and sister's birthday. Now that I do care more, I remember more people's birthdays. I take the time to put it in my phone when they tell me and shoot them a text on their birthday because that's all I really want from others. I may be overthinking it."
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,Same!
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Does it match the distance accurately?
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,If I could swap the new horizons music with new leaf music I would not hesitate. The vibe still wouldn't be the same though.
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,Yessssss I have a friend baby!!!!!!  So uhmn what games do you play?
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,"Excellent! Now my friend, let me tell about few millions I have stuck in a foreign bank and how your help will be greatly rewarded! You only need to send me 500$ to help me unstuck them, and because you are my best friend I will share half of the million!"
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,No worries!
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,I don't think so. You're probably pretty spot on. It sounds natural that people who do like it  think about it more. And people like me who don't care much rarely think about birthdays even being a thing.
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,Me too
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,Any chance you play online games?
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,There's dozens of us!
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,Yes
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,DOZENS!
w2qbm5,2022-07-19,2022-07-20,So what do you play?

1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"You really don't have to walk, 95% of the missions can be done with a bike and a couple constructors to build generators to charge it on borders."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I found the deliveries cathartic. I also really enjoyed the atmosphere, characters, and music. Story was confusing at times but I loved the game. It's still my favorite for the last few years. 

I still think about it on a weekly basis and have the urge to go back, restart from the beginning, and do it all again for the fourth time."

1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,My Motivation was to build Streets :D
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Not every game is for you. Accept that you find this boring and just move on. Life is too short for forcing yourself to play stuff ""because it's from the same creator' when you're not actually enjoying it."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,Play podcasts during normal gameplay.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Don't try and 100% it. I did the main missions, but rarely delivered any of the packages that I found around the map. I did some building, but as soon as I felt like it was getting boring I just stopped. Overall, I had a blast by just doing what I found was fun and finishing the game when I felt like I was still having a good time."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I honestly think it comes down to your current state of mind as to what you get out of this game. When it initially released I like you, played a couple of hours and bounced off it. A couple of years later, towards the end of the pandemic my mind was not in the greatest of places and I was being particularly unsociable at the time, for some reason I started a new game of it (I think possibly because the directors cut was on PS Plus) and this time I played through in its entirety and was absolutely captivated.

The world traversal that I had initially found monotonous and annoying now felt completely engaging and just slowly wandering around the world and completing deliveries gave me an overwhelming sense of melancholy, the soundtrack obviously enhances that feeling and I’d guess that’s intentional from Kojima. The story imo is the main draw but slowly putting through world back together and connecting people felt so productive and profound too.

I’m not suggesting you need to be depressed or in a bad mind space to enjoy this, I just think if you mentally approach DS2 as an experience you’re going to take part in as opposed to a game that needs completing then it can be an extremely profound experience, if you don’t then it could just be the “walking simulator” with a weird story that many complain about.

TLDR - your enjoyment of the game will entirely depend on how you mentally approach the game - enjoy it as an experience and not as a traditional video game."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Have you got to the second main area yet? It has a slow start and the first 4-6 hours were a bit of a slog for me, but when I got past the first main boss fight and into the second area then that was when the game really opened up for me and I found it a lot more interesting and was compelled to stick with it. If you're enjoying the gameplay at all then I'd suggest keep going until you get to that part.

But as others have said, if you're just not enjoying it at this point and your up to that area then maybe it's just not for you and that's fine."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"My advice is to take breaks and don’t force yourself to play it like a traditional game. Treat it like an experience. Deliveries may seem repetitive at first, but when you start seeing the impact you’re having on the world and connecting with NPCs, it feels meaningful"
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,The first map until you reach the harbor is still tutorial area. After that you get much more utility and travel options. I had much more fun after the first map. iirc you can go back later and make some route easier after you got some upgrades.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I 100% it. But it took me also 3 tries to finally ""get it"".
Get invested in the story admire the cutscenes and play for the lore."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Eventually you are in gun fights similar to other MGS games, but you always got to worry about falling over which is hilarious to me. That’s why I kept playing."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,Not a MGS guy but I have maybe 25 hrs in DS and thought it was fascinating but I can only play it on Adderall
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,Huge MGS fan too. Tried but I just couldn't get into it.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"First time I played it I wasn't too keen. I got to i think act 3. I read somewhere that if you dont like it at this point you are probably not going to. I gave up on it and I sold my copy. Gave it another go a year later. Got passed this point and that was where the story pulled me in and I really got into it.
There benefits to do side content of course, but if it hasnt hooked you in yet I'd stick with the main story till it does"
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,i usually play death stranding as a camping and hiking simulator.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I am currently playing the game however i am still in the early region. Personally, i treat the game as a way to relax after a hard day since i find walking in the game is actually calming. I do have other games on the side that i play other than DS though"
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"It’s one of those games where it starts out as a slow burn. It’s mainly for world building/learning about some lore, taking in the sights, and getting used to deliveries. 


At one point, you start unlocking some cool new gear to help with deliveries. The impact you start leaving on the world and seeing things left behind by others is pretty cool. 


Making deliveries at one point becomes a good way to unwind. Kinda like playing Minecraft. Once the entire map was unlocked, it became like a road trip. I would go from place to place. Seeing how far I could go without resting, only really stopping to fabricate supplies if needed. It’s one of those game it’s more about the journey than the destination."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,The joy is in the challenge and planning of your route. It does get more interesting when you get the motorcycle. At the end of the day this is a problem solving game that feels more like the puzzle genre than whatever mgs is.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Enjoy the walk. If you don't enjoy it, then it might not be the game for you. And that is okay."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Everyone else is already saying sometimes you just don't like a game and that's okay.


And they are right. But if you really want to give it another shot and just have to see if the game has anything in it for you, I think the best advice that the game doesn't give you is that the entire first map is a tutorial zone, and despite a warning that you won't be able to return, you will eventually unlock the ability to come back. Maybe rush to that first Knot City, skip those early deliveries, and get to the main game map, and start the actual story.  Personally I enjoyed taking things slow and completing deliveries as they became available, but if that bores you, you can absolutely just go ahead and get straight to the meat.  You should know the entire game is still just deliveries, and the optional side quests only unlock abilities and equipment that make those easier, but maybe you'll feel more compelled to do them once the plot really gets rolling.  That opening section can easily take hours if you try to do everything, and at that point in the game you wont have much story to motivate you. I've heard from a lot of people that just rushing to the first Knot City is the best way to go."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I'm not a fan of MGS games, but I enjoyed this game"
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I kept hearing ""get through chapter 3"". So, I pushed through. It was definitely a slog to get to there. But once I did, the entire game becomes really amazing. It also helps to play the Directors Cut of it as it includes things that should have been there the entire time to make chapters 1 - 3 better."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I can’t really stand the From Software punishment games (Dark Souls, Sakiro, etc.). Everyone else seems to love these games but not for me."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Goes in my top 3 games.  After the beginning, the enthusiasm dies down, but later it catches on nicely.  Leave the side quests"
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,By modding it to have unlimited zip lines and building the biggest networks of it that ever existed.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I think of it more as a puzzle game than a walking simulator if that helps.  It's more of a ""how do I get from here to there safely"" than ""go from A to B""

The story is wild and sometimes you just have to go with it.  As others have said, your techniques get way more advanced as you go.  I'd advise trying to at least get to Mama's first meeting because you get a huge quality of life upgrade there."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Left it for a while, fancied playing again on ps5 & had a go on the directors cut when I was off work & smashed it in a week"
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"This was me with Witcher 3, death stranding, and a few others. Forcing yourself to play something you’re not enjoying is not going to make it better. If you’re not having fun and it feels like a chore to play a game then it’s not for you."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I had fun creating roads, zip lines. I tired to create an efficient transport system so I could do the delivery missions easier. I got great satisfaction from playing the game like that"
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,My reason is a bit morbid but my father was dying when the game came out for PC and Death Stranding was the perfect mixture of distraction and at the same time working through my emotions at that time. I drew a lot of strength and good vibes seeing the thumbs ups from other people for streets and things I built and the slightly melancholic vibe of the game was just exactly what I needed back then.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I just loved it ngl. Playing during lockdown meant I had more time, but it's still really fun. I enjoyed the realism, deliveries, dialogue, the music was PHENOMENAL. It's a cool concept and I'm not normally one for walking sims. The horror isn't massively prevalent but the idea of the BTs was amazing. Holding your breath desperately trying to sneak around them. I platinumed it, which was a ballache, but worth it. Only time I remember getting annoyed with it was sneaking around a BT area trying to get something I realised was inaccessible, trying to sneak out with my loot, and it falling through a 1 inch hole in the floor somehow which pissed off every enemy in the area. So that was a waste of time. But otherwise it's great."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Gotta admit, I had a hard time getting through the first 10 hours, and quit twice. One day while bored I finally got over the hump and the story started getting WILD. Then I HAD to know more. I definitely agree with someone else here though, skip all the side content if the gameplay isn't doing it for you. The story for real though blew my expectations out of the water."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"It is a different game that's for sure very different but it has it's charm and not so pleasing stuff (i wasn't a fan of delivering stuff at first).

But this is what made me stick to the game, the story was the main factor i know Kojima can get weird in a good way and all i needed was that moment to make me realize ""yeah this shit is gonna be worth the ride, even if it's a long one"" i won't lie it did take a while (like 5 hours) to find that moment but holy shimpt was it worth, as soon as i saw that shit i knew the game was gonna be a banger.

I'm a sucker for good stories, great graphics and beautiful scenary and the game delivers if you like that, the voice acting is amazing and the music even better.

Like i said i was not a fan of being a UPS boy but all the rest that the game delivers was worth it and it easily became my top 3 game of all time.

The game is also very generous to your gaming sessions because the important bits of the game are distributed very well and far apart meaning you can game for like 4 to 5 hours see something important for the story and then take a good break, come back later or a few days later even.

I would recommend getting a notepad and take a few notes as you play because the game can be a info dump sometimes, just like this comment.

TL;DR: The worst part of the game is the very first few hours like 5 to 6 but then the game clicks and it becomes worth sticking to the end. At Least personally it did."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,I just tried to enjoy the scenery and nature. Running around became like a puzzle.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,It's a solid platformer
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,Weed.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,Loved the gameplay
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,It was the first game I have skipped no single cutscene
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Robot pants!  The exoskeleton upgrades that help you stay upright, or carry more, or run faster made the game a lot easier for me.

The tow sleds (can't remember the actual name) help a lot, too.  Here, sled, take these two giant drums of old movies.  Ah, my back feels better!

Delivery bots help you get a lot more deliveries in, and thus more XP.  200kg of tactical underwear for the other side of the country, that's your job, Sparky!  ""You got it"" *hmmm hm hmmm* tromp tromp tromp

I didn't get into building roads.  I built some and kinda wanted to build more, but I wasn't good enough at harvesting materials, they require so much!

Finally, seek out the Wandering MC.  ...well, seek out his house, he's not a fellow porter.  But I bet you'll be glad you did!"
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I lost interest about 15-20hours in. At that point the postman in a post-apocalypse dodging spoopy monsters and asshole bandits game that the game was initially started turning into a generic third person shooter in an open world settung as the weight system became irrelevant with the vehicles and exosuits and their upgrades. The mosters and other enemies were no longer threathening as you could just mow them down with your gun and its upgrades. So you no longer had to engage with any of the mechanics that actually were unique about the game.

So if you make it to the part where the games unique systems start losing relevance it might click with you as basically just a shooter."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,For me personally the key was to pretty much just rush the main story.   I know a lot of people love all the other aspects of the game but I couldn't be assed to care about it.  The story however really kept me engaged while it lasted.  I strongly encourage you to at least do all the main story missions even if you don't care about the rest.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"The story is incredible and really kicks into full gear at the end, you wont be dissapointed.  
  
 But along the way I had to find joy in traversing the terrain with all the fun tools you get, enjoy the sights and music, and just started to see it as very therapeutic honestly just hiking along the vast open spaces. Also its fun to try and build some kind of network to speed things up I had a whole zipline system by the end.  
  
 But if you are worried about burning out you can always just ignore side stuff, I did most of it because I definitely got a dopamine hit delivering the supplies to the different communities lol"
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,You don't have to enjoy every game.   Stop trying to make it happen.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I played 12 hours of the game and remember enjoying it and been planning to go back to it. I’m playing starwars outlaws rn but I did want to go back into the death stranding world and beat the game before the sequel. The main things bringing me back is the haptics/ triggers, the graphics, and the crazy/ creative story."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,I treated it as a post apocalyptic parcel delivery sim with some tedious paranormal bits.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,Music Atmosphere and finding out more about each story through deliveries. Really enjoyed it.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Once you get linked up, build the roads and get vehicles it moves along pretty quick. The cities are pretty spooky and once you get to the mountains you're pretty invested and nearly to the end."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,The music's good.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I liked the base idea of the game, enjoyed since first travel, so didn’t really have problems continuing"
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"On a technical level, I really like what they’re doing.  You’ll notice it fairly simple at first, the paths you take start showing signs of wear and tear.  Over time, more and more player’s builds jump in to side you.  That’s when I realized it’s not simply a single player game, but a community taking on these challenges.  That drove me.  I wanted to build things that’d help other players during their own journeys.

That said, I find the rhythm of the game pretty infuriating.  So many damn menus, mission summaries, and needless cutscenes. I’d love to see another version of this game that removes all that bloat.  Also, give me a damn timer for cutscenes.  I don’t know if it’s a 30 second thing or a Kojima stream of unedited thought that runs for 5 hours."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I stuck to the main missions for the most part. If a side mission was along the same route, I would take it. Otherwise, I didn’t bother with anything else. I didn’t build many roads but did contribute if it were close to being done."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,The ps5 DC has a lot of tiny improvements that streamline things a bit.  I never beat it on ps4.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"The pedestrian gameplay is deeply tied to the story’s themes. Helping others by building is also fun. 

If one or both of those things click for you, it can be a great experience. 

You just can’t go into it expecting the standard AAA game engineered dopamine drip."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I love the game, and here are why:

- The atmosphere, both when it's calm and nerve-wracking moments
- The road building.
- The NPC interactions.
- Combat; I actually like the gun fights in the game. At first, I was sneaking past BTs, but later on, I just started killing them instead, and I also love raiding Mule and Terrorist camps.
- The story.

I also recognize that it isn't for everyone. If you have to force yourself to play it instead of genuinely having fun while doing so, maybe it just isn't for you."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"The same way someone would stay interested in Stardew Valley but add in more story. 

The gameplay is satisfying as a resource gatherer, machine building sort of game. You get your deliveries in, check boxes, build up an area and watch your missions get smoother and easier. It’s satisfying to build efficiencies like that. 

The story is also exotic and unique. That kept me interested in its own right."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"The scenery, then the building and connecting parts, then the vibes"
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,I love open world games like that. Exploration is interesting
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"If you're not enjoying it from the outset and getting past the first map, where you unlock roads (and thus maintain them with the community), you're probably not going to enjoy the rest of it. The gameplay loop is basically the same as the outset, just made easier the further you get for unlocking things (like the road and ziplines) where making deliveries becomes much faster and easier as long as the community/online ""strand""s are available to make things connected and fast for you."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I like to play games very slowly, Death Stranding is the perfect game for that, not in a rush to do anything you're just in your own, enjoying the ride"
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,I ate magic mushrooms
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Took me three tries myself. At one point it clicked. It's a slow build. The gameplay doesn't really change, but the scope of the game does, and what used to just be a game of take package from A to B becomes a minor step in a multileveled approach to rebuilding a civilization."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,"That's the fun part, I didn't!

And I tried, twice.

With every Kojima game, it's like I'm being forced to watch someone's homemade auto-fellatio videos."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,Keep going. It goes places.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"You don't. It either clicks with you or it doesn't.

Don't force yourself to play it just cuz it's Kojima."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I didn't. Got a little ways through and while I appreciate many things the game does, it just wasnt a fun experience for me. I did get it for free so can't complain about that."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,I didn’t. I put the game down after an hour and have no intention of ever picking it up again. Some people think it’s a masterpiece and some people think it’s hot garbage. That’s okay
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,Watch dunkey’s video about reevaluating death stranding. He lays it out nicely.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I've been meaning to go back to it for ages but I played at launch due to Amazon's old Canadian preoder discounts, and loved the deliveries before I discovered i had ADHD and the repetitive action made so much more sense.

I stopped when I decided to try to kill one of super reliable, always in the exact same location, big land shadows in the first zone after the first boss fight. I won, but it took me more than 40 minutes and tons of resources. I was happy with the new interesting drops...

But the next time I did a delivery in that location the exact same big shadow spawned in the exact same space, meaning my effort of killing it and blowing 80% of my resources was wasted. I was disgusted and quit. Haven't been back in years.

But I want to try again, but I hate the idea I can't even temporarily make a safe zone x.x"
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I didnt play it, because its boring trash."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I tried but failed twice, both times I got to knot city I believe."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Hi op, I feel you. I also love metal gear, I've played every year. One of my all-time favorite series, kojima is one of my all-time favorite directors. 


This game though, it never got great reviews when it came out for a reason. It's slow, it's repetitive, I recall when this came out everyone was saying basically the same thing and everyone was a little stumped... That's just the game. I don't think you have to force yourself to try to like it. In fact I would say just let it go. There's other games that you will actually enjoy out there. 


Kojima tried something different, I love that but it didn't work with me. 


This is just my opinion but I feel the same way about Red Dead redemption 2. Since it came out. I have tried it three times over the years and I've made it close to 10 hours total on steam now.


But I just am not feeling it. The controls are so clunky, I recall getting like 10,000 controlled prompts, how to play the game and then every time I would start the game up after our several days. If not being able to play it, I'd have to somehow try to remember the 10,000 controls again... I just can't do it. One of my best friends says it's the greatest game he's ever played so that's why I tried it again about a week ago for the third time and since then I just can't force myself to go back. 


Again, there's other games out there, games that are way more enjoyable so I'm keeping my eye out for something that I know I will really dig."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"i did not . deleted that game after couple hours . Should have known better too, i cant stand kojima games"
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I don't mind the gameplay and setting, but I keep having to quit because of the story any ""weird for weird sake"" character quirks. 

Question for those that have finished it: does any of that stuff ever pay off? Or does it stay ""look at how wacky and unique we are!!"" level of character development?"
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Treating it like a nature survival simulator worked for me. I got really obsessed with building highways. My gf was watching me play and I didn't want to advance the story without her so I just went around building highways while she wasn't there. 


Building a complete zip line network to every location was also a satisfying project."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I wanted to figure out what the heck was going on in the world.

After a while the deliveries actually became kind of relaxing. You pick out the equipment for each mission, you carefully plot your route…you kind of get into the zone. But primarily I wanted to know why I had a baby strapped to my chest among other weird mysteries."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,I listened to an audiobook during the really long trekking sections with little or no dialogue. I don't know that I would have stuck with it otherwise but it was a perfect way to get through a book club pick while also doing hour-long sections of near silence aside from nature noise.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"One thing I really liked was seeing the tools other players had placed or built in the open world. It made it feel more like communal experience, sort of like seeing messages in the Souls games."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Episode 3 was ruff to get through for me, but once I finally got to chapter 4 is was so much fun, started become even more rewarding because of the unlocks."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,I just use the game to chill. For me it's almost meditation
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"After a while, it just becomes kind of cathartic.  There is just enough there to break up any monotony, whether fighting humans or ghost thingies, or constructing network stuff.  Its one of those games where you don't have to feel like you have to rush the story."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,The start of the game doesn’t do it any favors. The “intro” alone takes 2hrs. I’m a fan of Kojima and even I got so bored and wanted so much to be able to skip all the cinematics. The game really only starts once you get to the second region of the game. That’s when it starts giving you actual traversal tools.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I didn't.  I played a couple hours and quickly got bored, but I got it for free from Epic Games store so I felt no compunction about abandoning it for things that I enjoy."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"The pedestrian gameplay is deeply tied to the story’s themes. Helping others by building is also fun.

You just can’t go into it expecting the standard AAA game engineered dopamine drip."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I fall in the same boat as you. I love Kojima. The visuals, the story is weird... It has all the stuff I love on paper. But when playing, I did get bored. Sometimes it's my setting, sometimes it's because I have other games lined up that I'm subconsciously more excited for.

I just resigned myself to the fact that I didn't actually want to play the game, I just wanted to experience the story. So I watched it on YT and came away appreciating it more."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,I watched my roommate play it instead of playing it myself
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,If you don’t like a game don’t play it.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,I never finished it. I got pretty far but eventually lost interest. I got some enjoyment out of it and can see why some love it. I just couldn’t get myself to complete it.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I remember reading somewhere that kojima wanted us to feel the tedium at the beginning and to trust the process.

I'm really glad I did. It was an incredibly profound experience"
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Not the answer you're likely looking for....but in the opening hour, when you're approaching the base, and that song kicks in from Low Roar.  I knew this was a game for me and never lost interest"
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,I didn’t and I don’t quite get the love for this game
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I didn't. I slogged through it just to see the story done. It wasn't worth it. It's okay to give up. You're not missing-out on much. The game...isn't good.

I mean the gameplay is boring and tedious. All you mainly do is hold R2 and/or L2. That's it. They didn't turn hiking into fun gameplay. Unlike BOTW where hiking/exploring is super fun and engaging.

The stealth? WTF happened? We went from MGSV's game-changing stealth to playing Hot-and-Cold with ghosts. It's terrible.

The shooting is some of the worst I have played in a long time. And there's at least 3 mandatory shooting boss fights.

The story is so-far up-it's-own-ass. It reminds me of Star Wars episode 1. Like everyone was just too afraid to tell George Lucas about his bad ideas. Same with Kojima and DS."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,You gotta enjoy the vibes and boring slow parts. If your mind is distracted with real life matters then it's harder to immerse fully
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I present you with a third option: I greatly enjoyed the first four hours and then, having had enough, walked away from the game with pleasant overall feelings about it."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I was fascinated in the plot and the world around me so it wasn’t much for me to play through it. I was soooo hungry to see what Kojima had been cooking up and the quality did not disappoint. The gameplay was a breath of fresh air, people wanted to boil things down to a glorified delivery sim but obviously there was much more to it with mechanics and structuring that felt unique. I enjoyed trying to master the unique terrain with the tools in front of me, the moments of tension from action sequences or sneaking were fun, and the scenery was a sight to behold. I loved just the feeling of adventure I got while playing and listening to that wonderful soundtrack. I also must mention how great the motion capture and performances were everything was super cinematic yet subtle and immersive at the same time. Call me a fanboy but Kojima is really a genius to me."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,I honestly played it when it was free but with in a few minutes I gave up
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,You shouldn't have to try to like a game. That is a weird mentality. The only thing your're missing out on is playing another game that you actually enjoy.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,get past the first few hours and it opens up and becomes a fun game. seriously like the first 5 hours are brutally boring idk what they were thinking
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,I didn't find it interesting. So I just quit
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,Higgs was a cool villian
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,It will never compare to Metal Gear as a series. Period.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Weed, lots of it."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,I enjoyed it so I kept playing it.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,You dont
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I tried this game for like three times before it clicked. i don't know why or how, but it just clicked. Maybe because I was playing it on a handheld, which makes getting into the game, doing a couple of deliveries here and here, and then taking a break from it rather easy? I would have never played this game otherwise, because I would find it boring and laborious (which this game can really be sometimes) if I had sit in front of the TV and play it like that. 

But what I can suggest is just...stick to it. Keep playing even if you aren't interested. Give it a few hours. Get past the first ""map"" and then the story kind of picks up and you unlock more stuff.

It's such a brilliant game. Kojima out did himself. It's so unique and different, there isn't a game like this elsewhere, and no one even tried to copy it because it's freaking wild, lol."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"The music that plays when you go over the hill and see the first delivery station gave me a feeling I have never felt before and frankly something I can never explain. 

It's one of my all-time favorite games"
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I realized that, when carrying a giant stack of packages, you could deliberately lean Sams weight in order to gain acceleration.  Basically, Sam could trip and stumble in a zig zag pattern to gain max running speed.  It was insanely difficult to do without wiping out and it kept me engaged through most of the first half."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,For me it was understanding it’s not just a video game but it is a journey and a unique experience. As you are connecting US cities and the story unfolds you are also discovering more from character around you and from even yourself. And this is true also in life. It gives you a hint to look at people around you from a different perspective. I don’t want to spoiler but deliveries are just a narrative excuse to “force” you into this journey.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,Same happened with me. I tried it twice and couldn't get into it. Every time I see it in my game library I really do want to try it again but never do. Same with dragons dogma 2.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"It’s a unique experience. I enjoy unique gaming experiences as long as there’s some elements I enjoy like action, exploration, etc. I suppose those who don’t necessarily like the novelty of a new experience or seeing the artistic vision of the devs may not like the game if the gameplay isn’t what they’re used to"
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I tried 3 times, couldn't get passed the first 30 minutes."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I didnt start from scratch. I stopped playing for several months after  episode 6 or so. I picked it back up on a whim, they started talking about extinction and prehistory and it intrigued me enough to finish the game. Granted i understood a bit of what was going on in terms of what ive been doing, but not the actual lore.

I also found it exciting to trivialize areas with ziplines, knowing people might use the network ive built later on."

1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,One of the games central themes is loneliness and how difficult it is creating connections to other people literally and metaphorically). I’m super introverted and instantly connected to that. Allow yourself to feel the total isolation of the environments and spend time alone with yourself. I really enjoyed that experience.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,I just really liked hearing my BB laugh when I almost fell off of cliffs. Then I became super obsessed with driving my truck on the roads I built and maxing places out with deliveries.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,I just watched a YouTube play through 😂
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,You know you don’t have to play it right?
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,I didn’t
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,It was the story that did it for me. Then I decided to 100% the game. Done it on ps4 and done it on pc.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,It's an amazing game to play stoned.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,I didn’t. I got to the last area and the story was just coming in such small bursts it wasn’t enough to keep me going with just how much I had to keep traversing that map to gather the resources I needed to start building the electric zip line things to make going back and forth over those snowy mountains not the most tedious thing in the world. But that process itself became tedious and I had other games to play piling up so I bailed.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"What I found addicting early game:

- farming resources from mules using stealth and then running away while they chased me

- maintaining the highways to make deliveries easier

- stocking up on tools and such to make difficult on-foot deliveries

- stealthing through BT areas.

What I found addicting late game:

- The story gets really good

- Trying to 5 star each location

- fighting the BTs when you have late game weapons

- connecting the whole map with ziplines"
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"By allowing my brain to turn off and having the time for it. If it weren't during covid I never would have had the time to play it. I spent so long finishing the roads and building an extensive zip network through the mountains, it was fun and mindless, which is what I needed."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Like RDR2 I enjoy just traveling, i don't know how but they  just make going from place to place interesting, even if it's an uneventful trip. Like I could just walk to a location and enjoy the scenery and that'd keep me going"
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,I didn't. I barely cleared the first area and lost interest.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I couldn't get into it. I'm not going to force myself to like something, and neither should you."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I built every road I could until I reached the mountain shelter, then I kinda lost interest and gave up. I think I had enough. I was very impressed with the game though and think it's great and the models are quite cool, but I just had enough."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"It's conceptually silly, so you have to relax that part of your conscious that warns you you're wasting your time."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,">I really enjoyed all the Metal Gear games, and I want to love this one since it's the same creator.

This is a misguided view. If it's not for you then it's not for you.

The best chef in the world can make your favorite steak but if he makes fish and you don't like fish, then what?"
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"It's very atmospheric. You don't want to treat it completely like just another game. A significant part of the game is the loneliness of the character and the emptiness of the world. 

I often tell people they shouldn't play the game unless they're in the mood for something weird. This is a game that's more about, not quite savoring but similar, the experience. You take in the world, you think about the missions and what people say, you look around and you take it slow. 

It's a very particular game with a very particular experience and if you aren't in the mood for what it offers it's much better to wait until you are, rather than spoil the experience by forcing it."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,It clicked for me when you get to the main map and it opens up each new trek gets new gear to help. I recently done a second playthru with the directors cut and the few early upgrades they added in my opinion ruin the beginning struggles a bit too much.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"it's like a series of puzzles and unlockables. Game was unique but i 100% would not play it a second time.

I think the only copy i bought was the ps4? seen the pc version for as low as 2dollars and still haven't bought it."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,I just went into the game expecting a walking simulator and was pleasantly surprised by the cutscenes and story. I literally was playing trying to get perfect package drop offs hoping to see the next cutscene soon and it paid off with one of the best stories I've seen in a while from gaming.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,I genuinely enjoyed the story and the world created and wanted to learn more.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Setting up ladders, climbing ropes and zip lines, really got me invested.

Then stacking as much cargo as possible, and still being able to complete routes became addictive."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Too stress full after the boat trip.

Got caught in the progression part of the game where numerous bad things are over whelming for my kit and fucking whales stress me out."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Not sure how far you’ve made it, but you really need to get to Chapter 3 before things open up. At that point, traveling becomes fun, and quick depending on what year you use.

But also, this game may just not be for you. The story never fully makes sense, there are plenty of exposition dumps, and it’s all around just Kojima weird. I loved it, but I understand its polarity."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"These are two completely different games. Don’t force yourself to play something you’re not interested in.
Death Stranding is a whole vibe. You need to give in to the fact that it’s about atmosphere and having time to solve problems over time. The game gets fantastically better later on and there is more action…but if you can’t even be at least intrigued for the first few hours, put it away."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,Build roads. help America.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,I think there's also something to be said that you just need to zen out a bit and enjoy the process of deliveries and conquering the terrain. Being able to build your own path and process to reach each location was what hooked me.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"2 things.

The management system like shoe wear, gear and packages, and ropes and being able to be like aight, so I have to cross this cliff and river, gonna need a rope, and ladders, so like have to pack away my trolley skateboard. Idk I like that shit.

Building the super highway cos fuck the rain, fuck all y'all, I'm going 100 on the hauler with every package."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,The Other Castle Podcast did an epic episode on this game.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"It's truly a hit or miss for many. Story wise, the prologue jumps straight into the action then proceed to be extremely slow until the end of Chapter 4. Imo, after that the story takes off dramatically, but the major downside is that this is already several hours deep into the game. By that time many may have already gotten bored of it not realizing the turn it takes with pacing.

Gameplay wise it's... soothing? You go from Point A to Point B anyway you want and you get to see the structures other people have made. The community building aspect is the ""Strand Type"" gameplay that was the main hype but you don't get to fully see and appreciate it till deeper into the game.

Staying interesting in the first few hours is difficult on the first play through, but once it sets in it ends up being a great experience. If you want to finish it in full just beware that the earlier sections are very slow. Let Chapter 4 be a marker. If you still find it not entertaining after that then it may not be for you."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,I skipped every second of the story and loved it
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,By not playing it
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,When you understand that walking and watching the landscape IS the game
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,"This is a game I am CRAVING at the moment. Although there are a lot of critiques, I LOVE games that give me time to reflex, and games that I can (somewhat) play while doing other stuff. People usually say that the first few chapters drag for waaaay too long, but I haven’t played it yet so I can’t confirm"
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,"I'd say it helps to actually buy into the atmosphere of the game.  Once that happened for me, I was enjoying it."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,I wanted to watch the next cutscene. I wanted to understand the intentionally obtuse cutscenes they had been using to market the game.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,Do something else with your life
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,I didn't
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,"I had a friend playing it and he enjoyed the gameplay loop. We both thought the story was nonsense. I just put a rubber band on my controller to ""skip"" the beach scene at the end. I also uninstalled twice cos of that fucking baby screaming in my ear. But I persisted so I could talk about it with my buddy.

Also I don't care how much exposition it contained, no one in their right mind would think a mile long treadmill you _HAVE_ to run along to progress an hour long interactive cutscene is a good idea. Let alone the actually story is hidden at the very end of the game, up until then you're literally just doing side stories most of the time and I don't give a fuck about how nice that old guy suddenly turns after being a bastard for hours of gameplay. Or how the main antagonist sends you on literal pizza deliveries with insane complications. The only worthwhile survivor was Conan and that's for what? A singular line of dialogue that's supposed to be funny?. I legitimately think Kojima is taking the piss out of us with stuff like this. The whole time I played I couldn't help but wonder ""how the fuck are people loving this?"". 

Kojima is out of his depth and the rest of the fanboys keep stroking his ego like he's some sort of god and then we get dumb projects like this. It's not metal gear, it's not that thematic or grand in scope. I totally understand the hate for the game and struggle to see the love. 

That being said the mocap was amazing, the animations/graphics were great, and it was truly unique being able to stop monsters with piss bombs and poo bags. It's just a shame it's marred by Kojimas ""masterful storytelling"" cos, it wasn't lol. I blow a little air out of my nose every time I see someone even compare this game to others. I've seen children's shows with more compelling story lines."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,"The story, the graphics, the gameplay. I thought I wouldn't like it, but once I stuck it out. It became my all time favourites."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,Chapter 3+
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,You playing the director’s cut? Early pacing is much better.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,"I liked creating good efficient paths, and making progress.  I might be weird but I genuinely enjoyed the story."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,"Idk I took it as a meditation on the human condition at the time and metaphor for our position after the internet connected us and ""destroyed the world"" as we knew it

Making infrastructure for other people was a big motivator. Going hard on infrastructure prior to connecting a grid and then opening the floodgates to see what others chose to do or getting likes to show others appreciated your efforts was really cool.

The game ramps up on the main map with the mountains and such. However the final act is a slog like every Kojima game.

I liked the cast of characters and the general vulnerability of each plot. Momma really was so beautiful and the initial intro of the villain was so cool I needed to know more. 

Once it got to the terrorist plot after the mountains it kinda slowly was back to ""meh"" but I loved the first 3/4ths of the game so much it didnt matter."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,Walking is never the thing that bothers me I love slow immersive movies. But too much delivery is the thing that made me quit the game.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,I tried 4 times and have never made it to chapter 3 even. Final nail for me. Games just not for me.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,"Just keep on.... keeping...

.... on...


2nd playthrough I'm refusing to build roads and will turn off player structures. The game is very zen to me in terms of walking...

plus my 2nd run is on PC and I can bypass OST limitations somewhat."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,I didn’t
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,"Podcasts. Find a nice podcast to listen to during all the walking. Also playing online makes the world feel a little more lived in, with other people building helpful structures you can use, it feels on theme since you're supposed to be restoring structure to the world."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,"The mood and music of the game lured me in to start. Plus it was just weird enough that I wanted to know what happens. The biggest factor though is I have a completionist urge in a lot of games where I need to do and finish as many side missions as possible. And this game was kind of repetitive, and missions stacked so you can complete 3 or 4 deliveries walking along the same path to the next story mission. So of course I had to pick up all deliveries along the way and complete them. 

And I got obsessed with installing as many of those short cut things as I could along the paths, and building roads. There was always one more section to complete so I can get to this part of the map faster. 

Basically it was addicting while playing. I think back on it fondly and enjoyed it, but I would never replay it though."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,"Death Stranding was the first Kojima game I really got into. A lot of it was down to timing of when I played it due to being stuck at home.

It was building roads that got me hooked, and the lonely but community feeling the game gives. Didn’t care much about the story."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,"I didn't. Interesting concept, I just think it wasn't my kind of game. I watched a story playthrough video on YouTube and had a blast though! Kojima is wild."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,Pizza delivery and making sure Elder gets his pills.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,It is not metal gear and it's ok to not like it. You can move on and still be a Kojima fan. The game is not for everyone.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,"I think it is a game where you need to be very open minded about and see what the world offers to you in your role. Once it clicks, it can be a lot of fun. Also you need to pass the first few-ish hours until the full world opens up. The game completely changes from that point on but it takes a lot more time in comparison to regular ""tutorial-like levels""."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,By having good taste
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,Played my own music while I played the game
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,Whats wrong with you. You don't want to keep making deliveries? You've got to reconnect America Sam.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,I didn't at all.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,My favorite part of death stranding was going to make a delivery and seeing the thousands of abandoned vehicles piled up and the base of hills and down ravines and stuff.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,I have 150 hours ingame. I enjoyed every minute of it but i can safely say that its not a game for everyone.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,I enjoyed it throughout but it really started to click after the initial farm trip
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,"I spent 10 hours watching the story on YouTube, I found it intriguing at first but it got boring towards the end"
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,"For me, you have to give in with your expectations of what you want the game to be, and also become comfortable with having no idea wtf is going on. 

You are the great deliverer. Your goal is to find a way to just enjoy walking/driving around and delivering packages in an efficient way, with some light music, and get those stars up. 

That way you can just let the story unfold and also enjoy anything extra that happens. 

But by the end of the game I’m just a delivery guy. And that’s okay."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,"By skipping all cutscenes and foucssing on the gameplay. I was so tired of watching a cutscene and then having 4 characters repeat to me what I just watched, paraphrased slighlty differently. It was peak Kojima having his head up his own arse."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,"As obvious as it seems, it's a game you either enjoy or not. If you don't like your time with it, I suggest you dropping it and moving on."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,Once I got the roads built it wasn’t too shabby but I couldn’t get past the mountainous region or “kill” the monsters fast enough so I put it down. Still a pretty game overall.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,"Game sucks imo. I've also started it twice and quit. Sure the story is intriguing, but you can watch that on youtube."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,There’s few hours in the beginning of the game that can be a pain but when you unlock some upgrades it become so much smoother
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,I just kept going and then enjoyed the story more and more
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,"Well, it's a matter of taste. I quit the game after 10ish hours. Not my type of game."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,"I only got a few hours in and gave up. At first I thought it was great Sony gave him complete freedom, few hours in and I thought “maybe a bit of creative control wouldn’t have hurt”"
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,"Try Marvel Avengers, you might like that more. Or SpongeBob takes Bikini Bottom"

1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,I didn't...  I found the gameplay annoying as all get out and then the utterly unexeplaiable unfightable attacks just made it stupid.  Super glad I waited to to play it for free...  I would've been pissed if I'd paid $full$.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,"You need to push past Chapter 3. Then it all clicks into place.

That's what someone told me and they were totally right. My GOTY"
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,"I heard about the game a few weeks after it released, and I didn't have a PS4 game. It sat in the back of my head for many years.

I got a PS5 in June 2021, then I heard about a remaster for the game was on the way. After the remaster dropped, I heard the updated version made certain additions that made the game a little easier to manage. By the end of the year, a former friend was telling me it was a bad game. I was looking to spend around 50 dollars during Days of Play 2023, and It came between buying Ragnarok, or getting two games. I got the DC with GoT. I only played around 2 hours worth (just barely getting into Chapter 2). I jumped into GoT, played that a ton, took a break from PS5 for a month or two, and I jumped into something else (SM2).

I got back into my PS5 in June 2024, and this game was on my mind to complete. But I wanted to deal with the ""essentials"" of my backlog, which were GoT and Ragnarok (I got it in November 2023). I worked on a couple of games, then I felt like trying something different of an experience. I got pretty hooked. It was more about just about building the roads and getting vehicles to drive with. It was a pretty big platinum, but an interesting one to say the least.

I finished it in September. Put about 69h into the whole thing. It was also to see if I wanted to try the sequel if that released (not at launch, but maybe down the road from it. It's more about the cost of a game to me)."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,I got bored half way through and when I realized that all my infrastructure is also slowly breaking I beelined the main quest. What made me finish the game was the weird story I wanted to see the conclusion of.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,make it to chapter 3 ASAP. nothing is missable and you can either change difficulties or come back to get any and all trophies. but if oyu get to chapte 3 youll unlock vehicles and mods that make chapters 1 and 2 trivial in nature. so dont get bogged down trying to 100% each area like say skyrim or something. its also meant to feel lonely. yyou are there to connect the country. give it a chance to tell you the story its an a+++ game.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,"It looked like boring, pretentious dogshit from the very first trailer."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,Don't focus on 'finishing the game'.  Enjoy the journey.  Find your 'favorite place' and stick around there for a while.

1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Kojima always gave me good games so i trusted him. you should try to see the true meaning of the game, linking people together  
A lot of people misinterpret his games, for example MGS a lot of people who started with the phantom pain expected a call of duty with stealth while the true meaning of the game was anti war and anti nuclear ideas, The question of identity and true goals"

All this is really just the tip of the gaming iceberg.  But the point I would like to make is this… I would rather play a lifetime of ET on the Atari while scorpions danced on my balls than play some Patience Simulator or a Walking Nightmare like Death Stranding again.  This game is my number 1 gaming regret.  I wish I could have back the $60 and multiple hours and attempts I have spent trying to like this unlikable excuse for a game.  Every downvote I see here just confirms that people who actually like Death Standing are complete tools who just wanna masturbate to that bumpkin from Walking Dead who tries to get with the Jamie Lee Curtis lookalike because he’s “Deep”.  LOL"

1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,You like it or you don’t. Games shouldn’t be hard work.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,I didn't.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Sheer frustration and spite.    
    
I paid $60 for it, I was gonna get my money’s worth and finish the damn thing just so when I complained about it, I’d have experience playing through the entire thing to back up my complaints about it.     
      
I bought into the hype with the trailers and interviews and stuff. It was a Kojima game after he got shit canned by Konami. His new venture without corporate strings.   
    
After I started to play through it, I understood why Konami did so and I stopped watching any of the people who hyped the game up.    
   
Stand type game, get the fuck out of here. It’s “big” innovation is allowing multiplayer like mechanics to work without needing PS+.     
    

I played it during the lockdowns too, so I was under a similar mindset as most others but I couldn’t help but to critique everything the damn game did. Like it was so bad I started to wonder what the fuck I liked about the MGS games if this slop was supposed to be a masterpiece after them.        
    

     
I have to give props for whoever did the sound design that had those soundtracks come out during hiking across the country. If it wasn’t for those well timed ones scattered throughout the game, I’d have dropped the fucking thing entirely."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,I didn't stay interested because I did not have any interest to begin with. Still don't.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,I thought it had some good and bad aspects. One thing that removed any desire to replay it was the crying baby mechanic. If that same mechanic is in the sequel I simply won't be buying it.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I didn't, I failed.

It's a walking sim.

It's the most technically advanced walking sim with the most going on, but at its heart it's still a walking sim.

It's the kind of game where you hope the enemy AI suffers a bug that stops them from noticing you and you shouldn't *want* to avoid gameplay."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I haven't played the game yet, I've been wanting to check it out. All I've seen is jokes about the main character being an Amazon deliverer."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,"Your first mistake was thinking fans of Hideo Kojima can accept any sort of criticism of him or his games.  Not that you openly criticized them per se... but in the smooth brained fan boys of Kojima simply asking questions is deemed a no-no.  

Idgaf though... bring the downvotes... I've always found Hideo Kojima to be over rated.... always thought Metal Gear was a goofy series."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,You're not missing out on anything. Just look up the story on yt and save yourself the boredom
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,I didn’t. I was a huge Kojima fan but that game sucked for me. It is not my cup of tea. Looks nice. That’s it for me. It felt like a hollow shell to me.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"If you've attempted it twice and you didn't have anything that kept you hooked then maybe it's not a game for you. Just because it's the same creator doesn't mean it's the game for you. Believe it or not this is just a parasocial mindset, you're just attached to this creator for no other reason than you have some attachment to this creator. But realistically you don't actually have an attachment to this creator, you liked some of the games that they made. People need to break these parasocial relationships they have with people they have never had any form of contact with aside from giving them money indirectly through a store front that goes to a company that goes to an account that feeds into their stock that then this person gets money from. Stop thinking that you are connected to somebody that you are not connected to, it's not healthy."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,Cause i paid for it and hoped to see more things and twists which never happened
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,Still couldn’t get into it tried so so hard. Being a futuristic FedEx delivery man in an evil world wasn’t that fun
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,using a trainer.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"For me it was a pretty relaxing way to keep my hands busy while enjoying a podcast or listening to music. I didn't treat it like a ""game,"" it was really more of a digital fidget spinner. I also played it when it was included on PS+ so I had no sunk cost into it which probably helped my state of enjoyment – if I'd paid release price for it I probably would have been annoyed."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,Road builder and zip line connections and the game is so chill
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"For me it was the zip-lining.   
Once I really understood how it all worked the game basically became about building a network that gets me everywhere fast. Then 5star all the outposts, then back to the story."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,This was also particularly motivating for me and I really didn't know why. Then I 100%ed the game and now am eagerly anticipating the sequel.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Ok I gotta say, I got this game cause during Covid the only PS4 hardware I could find to purchase was the Death Stranding edition. I knew nothing about the game and didn’t pay attention to it at all. 

And now I’m really really into building roads in survival games and I had NO CLUE what the mechanics of this game were and it’s been sitting untried on a shelf since Covid. Argh! All anyone had to say to get me to give it a go was “you build road infrastructure”, and in all these years, I’ve literally never gotten that much info about the actual gameplay to make me want to try it until now and I feel dumb, lol. "
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"You're making the game easier for others that play. We are all strands, but some strands impact more than others."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,Doesn't the game have like full blown highway system now that it's been out for few years and players had time to build the infrastructure?
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,Same here. I was having doubts about the game but when I crossed the lake and started getting into the real meat of the game it hooked me.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,I built everything for the likes. Upgrade every road. Build a whole zip line network in the mountains. Put those sign posts down in high traffic areas for boosts. Everyone benefits. We’re rebuilding America! 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,Same omg every time I pick up the game I tell myself I’m gonna complete the story and stop building roads nope as soon as I get back in I’m pulled back to building roads
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"For me, it was ziplines."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I got turned off by the game when I started seeing roads and stuff on my game 😅
Those sweet landscapes, massacred by human concrete 😭"
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"The game really does come alive once you unlock the greater building mechanics for ziplines and roads. The game's biggest flaw is that the first 2-4 hours (depending on the player) is basically the tutorial, and you might not get invested until 6-8 hours in when the mechanics and storyline have gotten moving."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,Ok. Good! I'm glad I can get a mode of transportation. That's the tip I was looking for. Thanks!
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,"There are also different kinds of exosuits which greatly upgrade character's speed and jump distance. Anyway, with bike you can get virtually anywhere while a car can fit a ton of cargo for multiple missions at the same time"
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I feel like you have to treat playing Death Stranding the same way you play RDR2. It’s a slow burn but also very immersive, atmospheric, and interesting"
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,It’s the same for me. My goal was to deliver things safely. And then I didn’t like the creatures killed me the first time. So I vowed silently that I’ll come back and get rid of them.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Fragile, not fragile"
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I've given up on Disco Elysium, Hades and Outer Wilds. The 3 highest rated, supposedly loved by all games. Tried each many times and can not get into them."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"As I've gotten older I've really leaned into this.
There is nothing wrong about not liking a game. We all have different preferences. Just because a it's a Kojima game doesn't mean you /have/ to play it. 
I can still appreciate what Kojima does without playing DS (I've tried multiple times and always drop it)."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Life is also too short to be working constantly(full time here ahhhhhh). I wish I could cut to part time my mental would be 10x better and I would actually have time for my hobbies and maybe even appreciate games more rather than being extremely picky the first 5 mins of the game. For example, I tried playing ac odyssey and not even 20 mins in, I felt bored and questioned to myself why I’m even playing when I only have a couple hrs of free time. If I was a kid I would have probably given this game a chance and even enjoy it since I had more time. Now I give games very little chance If I don’t feel engaged from the get go"
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Yeah, I get that. I just didn't want to give up so quick. It took me a few tries to get into the Witcher 3, and I really enjoyed that game once I did keep with it."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Agreed! 

I didnt enjoy Baldurs gate 3 as much as i'd like to, even though thousands of people have better time with it. My first playthtough was about 27hours, while it's expected to have about 50hours mainline scenario only. I rushed to complete it and i know i'll never go back.

However, I can't 'like' cyberpunk. I love witcher but CP just sleeps me out. I made my peace with it and I'm ok with that"
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"this is kind of immature. sometimes things don't click right away. your favorite game is probably something that took its time to get going that you didn't push through. 

obviously if you've given it a fair shot then don't force yourself to play something that isn't for you, but to say that if you're not entertained at every moment you should give up is a pretty bad way of framing it."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,This is great advice. I did the exact same thing for Horizon and the Witcher 3 where I didn't get what all the hype was about.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,This is an interesting idea. Thanks!
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,Oh god I actually tried to max a lot of the random locations by doing a ton of deliveries. You do unlock a few neat things but it’s incredibly tedious.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I haven't made it that far this time. I didn't make it that far the first time, either. I'll make sure I get that far this time!"
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,Very much this. The start of the game is just stumbling around with a lot of packages on your back and holding your breath. After that first boss fight it feels so different. Yeah at the end of the day you are still doing those things but there is just so much more going on that it adds a lot of variety and strategy. A lot of the early game frustrations fall off and tout can really get into it
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I’ve yet to start this and I have directors cut PS5 version. 

When I start I would like the full experience but I’ve read playing online it populates the world with so much stuff. 

Is that true even for a fresh player?"
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"This 


The game implies many times that it is okay to take a break sometimes and I think the first time you press circle to rest and sleep, the game says that if it's time for Sam to sleep maybe it's time for you, the player, to sleep as well


And the game gets much more fun in the next region when you expand chiral network and can acess other players' structures, it doesn't make the game easy but it makes many QoL changes


Plus the game actually appreciates you for making connections via likes or emails and makes it a super relaxing play after a stressful workday"
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,This. Blow through the beginning area and unlock the real traversal tools and go back.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,Haha. Ok!
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Yeah, I'm afraid that's gonna be me, too. I knew everyone said it's ""a walking simulator."" I just thought maybe it went deeper."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,Thanks for this! That was all very helpful and makes me want to keep going!
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,Ok. Cool! I do have the director's cut.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,You can stand them?
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"So, that's why I am trying to enjoy the game. I did the same thing with The Witcher 3. Then, after my third attempt, I really enjoyed it! Maybe it was my mindset the first two times. I dunno. If that makes sense."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,lol. Nice.

1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Yeah, his stories are always insane. All the Metal Gear stuff is just so ridiculous, but the game play was so unique in them. I'm trying to find that in this game."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Yeah, I have pretty much any game I could want to play. I do the whole buy all the games and never play them. Or, I replay the same games. I just wanted to play one that was new to me."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,I just wanted to drive one of those semis so badly
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,The limit on zip line connections kinda tempered my interest. I wanted to build a zip line from end to end which isn't possible so I just did it over the dangerous places.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,"Man on my original PS4 save I had all the roads built and ziplines set up in key locations that matched up with other peoples' ziplines who were in my world, to the point that I could zipline all around (and over) the mountains, to any settlement, across the map, anywhere. Deliveries from one side of the map to the other didn't take more than a couple minutes."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Super unique if nothing else, I was several hours in before the hook hit then it hit pretty hard.  Unique music too which makes sense for a “walking simulator”"
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,I believe each instance pairs you with others that are at a similar part in their playthrough.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,That is the game to me
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,I hear you but I felt like I was fixing the apocalypse
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,There are more then the bike too
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,"Not just the bike. You can get a truck that you can load up with quite a lot of stuff. You can also build roads to make it easy to drive across. Kind of the whole artistic idea behind the game is that the players are building connections and are doing it together, because your roads and buildings can show up to other players and vice versa and people can thank others if the building or other connection was helpfull. Though questionable how active that side of the game is."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,"I don't care what anyone says, I'll simp for Kojima's terrible dialogue until the day it stops being entertaining. The man can make the dumbest lines sound...as dumb as they are, but still manage to make the scenes hit on an emotional level that the lines don't detract from it. 

MGS 4 had sooo many moment like that."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,[deleted]
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,"> I've given up on Disco Elysium,

This hits me right in the feels. Don't get me wrong, I've zero problem with people not liking the game, it's just that it means so much to me. The game resonated in such a weirdly good way to me that a game has never done, and doesn't help that it's such a fucking incredibly unique game. I always recommend people give it a play, but I also understand why so many can't get into it. 

It's like a visual novel in a way, but...there's still proper gameplay elements to it. But it's also not a traditional game in any sense of the word, either."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,"Yeah I didn't get even an hour into Disco Elysium and I also gave up on Outer Wilds. I never tried Hades since I've never liked roguelikes. I tried a few and they always frustrated me. I finished Death Stranding and enjoyed it, but when I finished it I never had any urge to go back."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Disco Elysium is interesting, unique, probably one in a million quality.  I don't recommend it to any of my friends as I doubt that someone who plays CoD, Forza, Madden or Diablo 4 is going to appreciate it.  You will learn a lot from it if you are willing to but it's not an everybody will like it.  The people on the subreddit are f'ing insane and treat it like its their therapist or a religion. 

  
Hades is fun, ticks all the right boxes for me but the grind killed it for me.  Finished it about 6 or 7 times but the randomization of whether I'll be able to increase the relationship with NPCs in a given run is big no for me.  Everything is amazing, the art, the music, the dialogue is hilarious but I simply don't have 5000 hours to dedicate to a game anymore.  I'll probably get the sequel, tho. 

  
Outer Wilds is another unique game, the concepts, are very nicely realized.  Like Dwarf Fortress, I prefer watching or reading about other people playing them."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Yeah disco is a lot less fun if you aren’t obsessed with feeling smarter than everyone else lol. A lot of the concepts are so politically driven in a weird high school know it all type of way. I loved the game but, some aspects felt so pretentious, took me out of the reasons I enjoyed it."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"As the game progresses the player start to see a lot more combat, reach new areas and unlock a ton of new mechanics, tools, weapons, exoskeletons, vehicles, infrastructure types to establish transport networks and other features that make the gameplay loop never stop evolving until the last moment, but if the basic concept of making deliveries while navigating through rugged landscapes is not your cup of tea you will probably still not like it later no matter how much it evolves, or maybe yes, or no, it depends too much on each person's taste."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"This. I love the mad max franchise but found no redeeming qualities about the mad max game.  The combat was bad, the driving in a car centric game was bad.  Sure the visuals were cool. But it felt the only thing mad max about it was the aesthetic.  

I’ve given it multiple chance and just have accepted I don’t like it and won’t finish it."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,Then don’t give up so “quick”. Or play something else. Make up your own mind.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,BG3 is one of favorite games of all time but regardless I’m genuinely impressed if you actually did manage to beat it in 27 hours the first. Surely you must have been pretty under leveled for most of it?
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,"BG3 is a great game, but I prefer the first two myself. More varied locations and a longer story, more dialogue choices (even if most aren't voiced), and a sense that I'm never going to get close to finding everything.

BG3 would have needed even longer in early access if it wanted to match the amount of content from the first games, if only because writing text only dialogue trees is much easier than animation and getting voice actors in. Older games that don't voice act or animate every single line of dialogue can add such content much easier."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Repeating deliveries doesn't really do anything. Most of the time you can get S rank on your first try, and then you never need to do that delivery again. They keep showing up, but at that point they are mostly optional. Once I figured that out, it got a lot better. Less of an endless slog and more of a satisfying checklist."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Don’t spend a lot of time in the first area. Push to get to the first knot city from DC and then the game opens up with more tech and you can always return back later.  The early deliveries are very bland, while the later deliveries come with a lot of environmental challenges with more terrain variety that are more fun to deal with."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,"The game really opens up in the second area, and you get a lot  more tools to deal with enemies and obstacles.

I played it two times up to this point and gave up. It feels like a natural place to stop. But the third time I persisted, and suddenly the game clicked. It is now among my all time favorites."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Yes, even as a new player, online mode will populate the world with structures from others, making things easier. For a more isolated experience, you might want to start offline and switch to online later if you’d like."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Yes, and that's the way the game is intended to be played.  It's smart about spawning stuff in, you'll only get items from other players that are around the same level as you, so you won't get broken overpowered equipment right away just because everyone else has been playing longer. And everything, including buildings, has durability, so if stuff gets spawned in that you don't use, it'll just naturally decay over time. If you really don't like a certain thing that pops up, you can delete it, and you can even blacklist specific players if you find someone is repeatedly doing stupid stuff that keeps populating your game, but I never had to use that feature.


You can play with this feature turned off, but it's more of a challenge. You're intended to rely on other players for help. Without them, you'll find yourself short of resources often, and you'll rob yourself of those beautiful moments where you're out struggling in the rain with broken boots, low batteries, and overburdened with heavy cargo, and suddenly crest a hill to find someone has left a shelter for you to use."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"The “intended” experience is to play online. The games story revolves around the unseen help you receive from other players worlds and the name stranding itself comes from the social strand system that Kojima thought of for the game.  You’ll never get an entire logistics network of stuff from another player, it might be a bridge somewhere or a ladder or a charging station for a vehicle, but you aren’t going to get everything you need for every delivery just handed to you by the game.  If you want to challenge yourself then play offline and you will need to solo populate your worlds stuff."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,The game adjusts so you are not fully connected in a way you won't receive too much help. I think the game design aligns with feeling hopeless and finding a bike someone gifted the network and being thankful your return from a distant place is easier now. Then you feel good dropping some bikes ammo or materials to other players in case they need it.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"It gets a lot more complex and interesting, but all that gameplay depth is put into the delivery system, the traversal mechanics and everything around them, unlike most open world games where that design complexity is put into the combat system. The game never stops introducing new features, tools and devices of all kinds until the very last moment, if you give up at the beginning you've seen almost nothing."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,Walking Sim type games are ones i generally will watch some one play through or just the cutscenes. Being a Kojima game the cut scenes are basically an almost 8 hour movie. the Genre is not my cup of tea.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"I would say get to thr first ""boss"". That's when the game really opened my eyes to what it is. It really became a Metal Gear with a different mechanic at that point."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,Edited.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"There are guns and once you get the zip lines, traversal becomes much faster."

1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Uh kinda.

There's some boss fights that require third-person-shooting.

Warning...it is some of the worse third-person-shooting I have ever fucking played in my life.

How the fuck Kojima went from MGSV's combat to Death Stranding's combat...I will never understand."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,Unintentionally.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Why you keep posting this, mate? This gameplay footage looks terrible.

Holy smokes, look how dumb the AI is. Mostly just standing around half the time.

Not to mention these enemies only show up in designated zones...which you can just go around. So you can completely avoid all combat if you want.

This isn't showcasing the combat. This is just someone fucking-around with the brain-dead AI.

Compare this video with 2 minutes of MGSV gameplay. It doesn't remotely hold up."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,I guess it's so you can't cheese out the game and only make it where it's required aka mountain/BT territory while also not being s replacement of the highway
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"At the time, everyone was trying to avoid spoilers and stuff and I just couldn’t get enough context about gameplay to want to try it. 

Now, I’m realizing it’s exactly the sort of thing I like and I’m kicking myself for not getting into it during Covid when I was trapped inside for a literal year. 

However, the console for it is just objectively a cool design and a nice looking console even if you’re not a fan of the game though. The clear yellow controller speaks to my inner 90’s kid, and the graphic is just cool even out of context, so, no regrets. It’s over at my partner’s now or I’d give it a start tonight."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Yeah, basically you won't see any structures that you haven't already unlocked yourself yet."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"how long did you actually play it for? Because it's clearly not a walking sim once you play more than 10 minutes. Even if you don't end up loving it when you finished, I find it hard to believe that could possibly be the case of ""most boring"" or ""walking sim"" unless it's the only game you've ever played."

1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,">making deliveries while navigating through rugged landscapes

Those were the best parts!"
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,Username checks out
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"He might be looking for an answer like at the ten or 15 hour mark the game changes or you unlock something that makes it much more exciting. Don't be an ass, ass."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,Maybe I’m misremembering since I played it near launch but couldn’t you rank up each delivery location? Get them to 5 stars? Took an annoying amount of time
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Yes, I've always felt like getting bogged down in the first area is the #1 reason people can't sink their teeth into the game. It's all just tutorial stuff with unavoidable light horror encounters before you have all the tools to trivialize them or the many traversal tools that are what make the game."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,Ok that sounds fine
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"[https://youtu.be/R9yi\_t54Jwk](https://youtu.be/R9yi_t54Jwk) , [https://youtu.be/UlUB3rS5x3Y](https://youtu.be/UlUB3rS5x3Y) , [https://youtu.be/pfG2z62wiY8](https://youtu.be/pfG2z62wiY8)

The game has 10 hours of cutscenes, if it were a 15 hour game it would make it more of a movie than a game, but it is actually a 40 hour game whose Platinum lasts 100h, the real 100% lasts 200h, not to mention that the gameplay loop is immeasurably more complex and interesting than the absolute reductionism with it's haters defines it, and this is coming from someone who played it expecting to find it boring. It's more of a logistics game like Eurotruck Simulator but travelling through rugged natural landscapes, with shooting action, touches of horror, tons of unlockable devices of all kinds to optimize your deliveries, an indirect multiplayer system in which you can collaborate with other players by building structures, donating items, signaling dangers or points of interest, and other curious gameplay gimmicks.

It's not a concept that's trying to please everyone, but I'd love for people to hate it for what it is and what the game is trying to do and not for some reductionist and inaccurate meme spread over and over again by people who clearly didn't play it."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,I suspect you will enjoy it!
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,What happens when no one is playing the game?
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-04,True. It has some of the most fun traversal and space flight I have played with. I loved just flying around in the spaceship and jumping and jetting around on low grab planets.
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-05,"I get what you are saying.  I have nothing against people using the game to get interested about learning about political ideas.  More politically aware people is always a plus in my opinion.  I personally felt some identification with how Rhetoric paints the GARGANTUAN task of rebuilding communism: 

  
""! \*You\* will reverse the fortune of the workers of the world. You alone, against every living thing, against every human alive: eight hundred trillion reál in the hands of an \*impossibly\* well organized ruling class; towering city blocks of bank-men who have the ears of prime ministers; million-headed armies of nations and the love of your own mother! You — against the atom, the charm and the spin. Where the whole world failed — matter failed to bend to human will; human will failed to get out of bed and tie its laces — you alone, single-handedly, will rebuild the dreams of the working class. You are The Last Communist. Now get to work, comrade.""

  
I am more of a social democrat but FUUUUUCK...I tried to get people in a former job interested about their rights as workers...people then called me a syndicalist (my country's term for unions).  Putting aside the lack of class consciousness and how most feel they are THE most special worker that will someday join the hallowed ranks of the oligarchs...the absolute apathy of people for knowing how not get exploited kills the spirit.  

  
I was referring at the people who spend most of the posts disguising themselves, dressing, cosplaying, etc."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Yeah, but you did it by getting multiple separate deliveries up to higher ranks. Repeating the same deliveries didn't do anything."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,"Structures don't disappear. You can get matched up with someone who played the game years ago, but you won't see those individual structures until you unlock those pieces throughout the story. 

Many people have played this game over the years, so you are guaranteed to find structures everywhere once you expand the network more and more. 

However there is an option to play completely offline so you have to build everything yourself. Kinda takes away the fun and point of the network itself, but the option is there for people."
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,I never said I repeated the same deliveries?
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,Don't structures degrade or something?
1gilqhp,2024-11-03,2024-11-03,Structures do degrade but it is very slow. I think in my playthrough a post box from the early game was around 30% integrity near the end. I also believe you drop materials into them to repair it. I never saw a highway get destroyed.
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,Me expecting a Bloodborne announcement 🤡🤡🤡
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,Hopefully a new IP in the mix. I want more reasons to want to buy a PS5. 
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"I want to preface this by saying I absolutely loved Death Stranding, big part of that goes to Low Roar( RIP Ryan Karazija), but I think DS in the way of MGS Phantom Pain would be an actual banger."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,I have been waiting for this moment FeelsStrongMan
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,cant wait!
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,Come on Shadow of the Erdtree gameplay reveal trailer.
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,If it gets a release date I finally have a reason to buy the ps5
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"Predictions:

- Death Stranding 2 release date

- Bloodborne announcement, either a remake/remaster or a sequel or both.

- Ghosts Of Tsushima 2 announcement

- Insomniac Venom announcement (we already know it exists)

- concord and fair games will be shown but will be underwhelming 

- Helldivers 2 deep dive, will look better than anyone anticipated

- No announcements from Santa Monica or Guerilla.

- Naughty Dog teases their next single player game. Either last of us 3 or new IP.

- A brand new PSVR2 triple AAA project is announced. Most likely it will be Capcom porting more of the RE remakes into VR because that’s been popular.

- Uncharted 5 announced, not made by Naughty Dog. You will play as Cassie Drake.

- One new IP game gets announced, and it will be from Sony Bend."

1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,I want something to be excited about for 2024. Not a FF fan and there’s not much that captures me so far in other releases.
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-31,Bloodborne Remaster? 60fps with added content and zero load times?
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,I'm not sure I'm going to finish DS. Are you supposed to enjoy playing this game? Because it's mostly been frustrating and not really that interesting several hours in. Does it get better?
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,Finally!!
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,Can't wait. Loved the first game
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,I sleep
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,Ghost of Tsushima 2 or God of war remastered (Greek saga)
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-31,That makes sense. I look forward to seeing more of it. Maybe we'll get a better look at how it plays.
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-31,Wonder if they’ll announce any pc ports
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-31,Please give us a AAA PSVR2 game. Particularly a FPS. I would kill for Sony to bring back Killzone and feel like PSVR2 is the greatest opportunity for a revival of the IP.
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-31,"Please, I am a simple person, some Death Stranding 2 and Silent Hill 2.   Pretty please.   I'm perishing and withering away waiting for news on them."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-31,"Man I should go finish my DC of death stranding, things got in the way and now its been like 6 months since I last played."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-31,Praying for resident evil 9
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,Wait so do you get to jog in the sequel or is it just walking again?
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,Yawn. Super boring. Can we get something new and original please? And stop the Kojima circlejerking.
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"oh great. so it's gonna be boring, with a sprinkle of duck sucking.."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,Hideo Kojima has to be the most overglazed dude in gaming
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,[deleted]
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"I can't believe I'm not even looking forward to a Kojima game. I used to religiously expect them to be fantastic. And I didn't even think that death stranding was bad, I really enjoyed the gameplay. But after mgs4, 5 and ds failed to recreate the awe i felt from 2 and 3, I think I'm finally at the point where a Kojima game is just something that I will eventually check out. And I used to buy consoles only for these games. "
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,The Kojima cultists downvoting any negative DS opinion in this thread is wild man
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"More Kojima worship. I get why he's a ""creative"" talent in gaming but man I'm so sick of hearing about this guy and how weird his content is."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"I really could not care any less about this game, god I hope it isn't the main focus"
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"Love Hideo, could care less about another Death Stranding."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,Please don’t
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"Uh, doesn't Kojima already has a horror game in development? Wouldn't it make more sense that it's a new trailer for that than DS2?"
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"Damn, not another walking sim. I wish that other horror game project was for ps5, not this."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,I played and enjoyed Death Stranding but I don't think I'd bother with a sequel tbh
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"I hated death stranding purely for the boring story and cutscenes, if the second just doesn’t have boring storytelling I’ll definitely play it bc I LOVED the traveling in the first game"
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"As soon as I see the name “Kojima”, my eyes glaze over and I stop paying attention"
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,I deleted Bloodborne off my SSD so we will finally get the announcement
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"Yayyyy, more delivering shit ! 

Remember how back in the day this guy used to make games where you quite literally could never predict what would be going on in the next half an hour ? So glad we are over that now :)"
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,I have no fucking clue how anyone could fund a Death Stranding 2 after the first Game was such a failure.
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"This guy took my them about U5 I was gonna say Nathan Drake, daughter is the next tomb raider game by naughty Dog :/"
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"Another walking simulator sheesh, anyone got an update on ghost of tsukima PC release date or maybe an GOT 2 announcement? "
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,Death stranding 2. Why?
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,Me expecting dark souls 4 💀
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,Announcements of PS games for PC hopefully. About time Ghost of Tsushima and Bloodborne to get their PC ports.
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-31,We can only dream

1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-31,I set myself up for disappointment every year with Sony. 
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,The last of us 1 & 2 remake bundle exclusive edition. Take it or leave it
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"Stellar blade. Rise of ronin.

Granted both are coming to PC also but yea NEW IP

They did also state that there are gonna be 15+ games."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"The Final Fantasy 7 Remake made me buy one. If you haven’t played it, it’s 100% enough of a reason to buy one"
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"Now that Uncharted is over with, I’d really like to see a new IP from Naughty Dog. I’m curious what they’re going to do next."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,Do you not play sequels to games? Also we already know Rise of the Ronin. Stellar blade and Concord will be there
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,I’ve been rocking Xbox this generation because of their game forecast and GamePass. Had a PS4 last generation. I was saying I was gonna get a PS5 when death stranding 2 and FF7 rebirth are out but idk now. Both games will undoubtedly be fantastic and exactly what I want to play but I really want to get some things out that made PS4 great. Ghost of Tsushima & Dreams come to mind.
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,If you don’t buy one the terrorists win.  Or something
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"I'm hoping for a price drop, cause ps5 pricing right now out of control."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,Stellar Blade is coming 
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,by the time you'll want to get a ps5 there will be a ps6.
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,Lol it’s been like 4 years and there still isn’t any games for the damn thing
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,What do you mean by that
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,Do you want MGSV recruitment and base building?
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,wasn't it the case already ?..
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,If I had a dollar for every time people predicted a Bloodborne sequel…
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,">Bloodborne remake/sequel 

Y’all just love playing yourselves, don’t you?"
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,No way they don't have at least a new trailer of FFVII Rebirth to advertise and hype since it comes out in less than a month.
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,Prepare for disappointment
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"Damn that is like the wettest dream of a list.

It's like very biggest IP owned by Sony lol. Expectation are high for you"
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"Silent Hill and Metro is rumored to be featured as well, which would be awesome if true"
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"You are 100% going to be disappointed. I hope I'm wrong, but we're expecting too much from a State of Play."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,They are 100% showing more FF7 Rebirth
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,New Metro game. Metro Awakening. Probably the AAA VR title
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,Give me more God of War. I want a full blown remaster of the first 3 games since I never got to play them as a kid or a sequel to Ragnarok (preferably with less atreus game time)
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"Venom is a good bet, but I wouldn't be surprised if things are still really messy with them at the moment. They might be wanting to go dead silent until they have to start marketing, so they can only show content that has not already been leaked and not address the issue much.

Ghost 2 would be pretty hype. Feels inevitable it gets announced soon."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,Shadow of the Erdtree pls
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"I’m wondering if Death Stranding 2 will be the big PS5 holiday title this year.

I’m sure it’ll be a great game, but I don’t know if the gameplay will appeal to everyone."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"In addition to Venom, wouldn’t be surprised if we FINALLY get NG+ for SM2"
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,I would actually pre-order the game if they announced Bloodborne.
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"Also, an announcement of a remaster of Until Dawn for PS5 and a PC port"
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"As a PC gamer, a bloodborne sequel would make me buy a PS5."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"State of plays are not the place for a bunch of new announcements. They provide more information on already announced games. With this many reveals, this state of play might as well be a showcase."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"If we get 3 of those would be a reach. Death Stranding is a given, but man, you might as well just predict a new God of war, the last of us 3, and horizon 3 and it wouldn't be far from your expectations"
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,Bend Studios? Man they gotta make Days Gone 2 already...
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,Bend Studios? Man they gotta make Days Gone 2 already...
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"If they announce a Bloodbourne sequel, that might be enough for me to buy a used PS5.

Kinda shows how powerful exclusives are as system sellers, no matter how much we hate them."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"We haven't heard from Sucker Punch in a while, but I agree it doesn't feel like this is the place (hopefully I'm wrong). I would epect to hear something about GoT 2 before the years over tho."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-31,"It can feel really frustrating at times, but I think it's still a great game. I got all the way up into the mountains before I had to reset my save file (switched from Epic to Heroic), and I'm having fun getting back to where I was. 
Might I ask what part of the game you're at? I could try suggesting some stuff that might make things a little more enjoyable."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-31,"You gotta be invested in the story and the vibe. The music playing as I made my way down to the coast sold me forever. I don't think I've ever wept as much as I did at the last 2 hours of the game, either, but being a parent the entire experience hits ten times harder"
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-31,I found it more fun when I started chasing for the plat trophy. Otherwise I felt like I was just being inefficient and getting nowhere.
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,Right? Buddy should just go direct a movie at this point 😂😭
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-31,"He persistently makes games which stand the test of time.


Hell, the guy made pt, one of the most infamous demos ever."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,No way homeboy said that last part unironically
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Death Stranding. The main themes are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of parapsychology and homeopathy most of it will go over a typical player's head. There's also Sam's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterization- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this game, to realise that while it's not fun- it says something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Death Stranding truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the symbolism found in Sam's existential energy drink ""Monster Energy,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Hideo Kojima's genius unfolds itself on their screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Die-Hardman tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎"

1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,Found the person who hasn't completed Death Stranding.
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,“Erm…I didn’t like the game therefore it’s bad.”
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"Apparently he's still doing it because you still think Death Stranding is just a boring delivery game when it's actually a very detailed stealth action + logistics game with a lot of options, mechanics, weapons, tools, vehicles, infrastructure, gadgets, enemies, boss fights, environmental hazards and systems to be aware of that the player discovers throughout the game. Not to mention the outstanding visual and sound design, the completely crazy and creative sci-fi lore, or the asynchronous cooperation system taken further than any other game.  
The man is not reinventing the wheel but he is certainly putting together ""already seen"" pieces in risky ways never seen before and that's why people still praising his games and companies like Sony continue to finance his projects."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-31,"Death stranding was one of the most original titles I've played in a while.

Both from a technical and thematic perspective."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"I totally agree. Apparently if you hang in there through the seemingly endless and completely joyless experience of being a glorified Amazon delivery guy, you can eventually play a fun game."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,I don’t get the decision process behind letting him make another one.
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,Failure how? It was well reviewed (mid to high 80s on metacritic) and turned a pretty large profit.

1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"I love it but man they have so many instances where they force you to walk sooo slowly. I get the old transition crevices you need to go though that's fine. But they make you start slow walking at sp many points in the story long before anything happens. Or when you enter a building. Let me run if I want! Same with when you swing your sword to break crates open for items. The ending animation is like twice as long as the swing and you can move during it! Like I said, loving the game but dang, t-t-t-today junior!"
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,Stranger in Paradise is a very interesting remake. Would you recommend it then?
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"Depends if you like that style of game. I personally hated it, and would advise that no one buys the console just for that game."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"As far as I can tell, their plans are to alternate between remakes of TLOU1 and TLOU2 until entropy consumes all matter and energy in the universe."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"I think the PS5 is hands down a better console experience than the PS4 across the board. Hardly any worthwhile 1st party games out but it’s been really nice to play a bunch of PS4 games I’ve been meaning to get around to. Sekiro, MGSV, and Yakuza Kiwami 2 all look and play great. The OS is fast, load times are great, lots of neat features, and remote play works really well (for me with my internet). That being said, if you don’t really have any games you’ve been meaning to play then I would just wait for a nice bundle or sale."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"Salty PS5 owners downvoting you lol (am a PS5 owner myself). I regret getting mine, but it's what all my friends are on, so it was that, or find a whole new group of friends to play with (not gonna happen).

1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"No I want the infiltration part which was the focus of 90% of MGSV’s missions. A story with mystery, interesting characters with motives and presence in the game other than a hologram and exposition."

It's not a game that focuses exclusively on the narrative and anyway movies are very short for the stories that Kojima proposes, not to mention that interactivity and how he use it to transmit various sensations to the player have always been an important part of them."

It's a statement in-reply to those saying it is ""*just* a walking simulator"" and/or ""boring"". Many of those such statements can be found in this post.

As you well know, there are multiple other modes of transport in the game. Oddly I don't see any other game referred to as a walking simulator (especially with such frequency), yet many others are more suitable for the term. Such as Elden Ring, Skyrim, Fallout, No Man's Sky, Journey, GRIS, Final Fantasy Remake, and Witcher 3. All games I've definitely enjoyed and all of which are far more of a walking sim than Death Stranding. To say that Death Stranding is ""just a walking sim"" suggests that person has spent little if any time actually playing the game and they likely suffer from a short attention span.

'Boring' is obviously subjective; but, let's compare to other survival adventure games. Survival games typically have you tediously collecting resources for long lengths of time to make small movements through the tech tree, craft things, and repair items that constantly break. Survival games often have you eating a dozen full course meals a day, drinking numerous gallons of water, and running out of breath after a brief five to ten second jog. Given all that, I would say that Death Stranding has better respect for a players time. A world crafted intentionally, with a healthy quantity of moments of interest as you progress through it. I don't expect everyone's going to love or even like Death Stranding; but, to call it ""boring"" appears narrow minded."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"Oh, also I missed the news that announced DS2 was in development, sorry."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"I gave it a fair shot, but after about 10 hours I had to give up and accept it wasn’t for me. The gameplay can be fun in a calm way, but the goddamn plot...it’s so awful I’m still salty about wasting time watching all these cutscenes. Kinda wasted the acting talent involved. Also I can’t stand needing to build/construct stuff in games, so that was the final straw. 

Absolutely adored most of Metal Gear games, but this one is where he lost me. Glad people enjoy it, so he can make more (hopefully non-DS) crazy games."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-31,"It has nothing to do with originality. I just think Kojima’s shit is bad. People act like he’s some genius but he’s just weird. Weird games can be cool, but not if their weirdness is their only selling point. Kojima’s writing comes off as a drug addict writing down their hallucinations. It’s just bad.

Plus I don’t play Destiny anymore."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"It definitely IS a boring delivery game, in which actually a very detailed stealth action + logistics game with a lot of options, mechanics, weapons, tools, vehicles, infrastructure, gadgets, enemies, boss fights, environmental hazards and systems to be aware of that the player discovers throughout the game **is used for FUCKING UNEVENTFUL DELIVERIES BACK AND FORTH AGAIN :D** 

That's like a basic conceptual fuckup overall. Hey, if at least something of any interest happened in between these deliveries, stuff that is impossible to expect (which is countering the base logic of the game because you are supposed to plan your deliveries... which is in itself is fucking mind-numbing as is... and I have no idea what kind of a booooooring cunt would like to do this kind of thing after work hours... and I did work as a Glovo delivery driver in real life back in 2021 summer) then it would've been at least somewhat intriguing, but no such things happen unless they are scripted. 

The man is not reinventing the wheel, he's just pretty much regressing from the insane awesomness of the absolutely unhinged and eventful Metal Gear Solid games that were linear roller-coasters of constant ""guess-what ?""s all around the place, both story-wise and gameplay-wise. Shit... that was fucking amazing.

Anyway, I'm back to replaying The Wonderful 101, a game you people probably haven't even heard of, because you are defending its literal counter-force. 

BOOM !!! :D"
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,Death Stranding was great from start to finish. Idk why people always act like everyone was just pretending to have fun.
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"Supposedly the thing is REALLY beloved by most quite a lot of people. Which is kinda revealing that there is indeed a surprisingly large request for less awesome excitement and despicably boring, mind-numbingly repetitious tedium. 

These people are anti-fun. Quite literally. It is amaaaaazing."

1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,The two biggest games I’ve seen suggested are both upgraded PS4 games. I don’t think I need a PS5 yet.

1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,I mean I’m a huge lore fan from growing up playing the originals so I savored every moment of slow dialogue delivery. It’s a story game first and foremost

1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"It really doesn’t. 

And if a Bloodborne sequel was actually in the works, FromSoftware would probably not be a part of it either way. They’re busy on other projects."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"Yeah, at some point the loss of 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 has gotta be 2024's gain, right? Practically everything is jammed up — either delays, cancellations, or years of silence while everyone pretends that certain game companies have just stopped existing. Sooner or later, you gotta restock the shelves!"

1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,I really don't care what the difference is. I want a good looking visual and audio upgrade and it to be playable on my ps5
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"Well that sounds better, although for me enjoying the game or not is more reduced to each person's personal taste and not something much deeper, so it certainly seems quite silly to me how certain people reduce it to garbage that does not deserve fans or a sequel just because the proposal was not to their personal liking.  
I also take the opportunity to say that real walking simulators are simply narrative games without deep game mechanics, in which you just walk to experience the story, something that those AAA games don't fit into and neither does Death Stranding which literally simulates walking and the experience of climbing mountains as one of its tons of mechanics."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,I don’t think it’s fair for you to talk about the story/amount of cutscenes when you only played it for 10 hours. You barely even played a quarter of the game.
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,">the insane awesomness of the absolutely unhinged and eventful Metal Gear Solid games that were linear roller-coasters of constant ""guess-what ?""s all around the place, both story-wise and gameplay-wise.

You just described Death Stranding but okey. If it are getting a sequel and a movie, has very positive approval on Steam and won best direction, best acting and best soundtrack at the The Game Awards of 2019, it's probably because everyone has bad taste except you."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"You literally have to be resourceful and plan a strategy to overcome environmental hazards to reach your destination and deliver, also throughout the game you unlock a lot of tools, weapons, exoskeletons, vehicles, infrastructure, mechanics and more to optimize your travels, not to mention there are also a lot of encounters with enemies and boss fights, but of course it's better to trust the haters who didn't play the game or did not pass the tutorial area and believe that if a game is not to their personal liking it means it's trash that no one else deserves to enjoy."

1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-31,"I didn’t say that, it had more mystery than all of MGSV. I’m talking about the new game I want him to make. Death stranding’s mystery with mgsv playstyle."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"And the only reason we even got Bloodborne is because Sony shelled out a lot of money for Fromsoft to make them a game.

But since Fromsoft games sell incredibly well, it might be better for Fromsoft to not take the deal and just have their games on all platforms.

Sony basically has to give Fromsoft enough money to justify not having any sales on any other platform."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-31,There's supposedly one more Sony/From exclusive set to release at some point. Probably not bloodborne 2 unfortunately tho. I think either way it'll be good cause magic happens when they team up same as Bandai/From.
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,This is a star field excuse.

I’m sane enough to drop something that’s not for me after this amount of time. It’s fine, not saying it’s a shit game, just some aspects don’t really work."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-31,"""Overcoming environmental hazards""... Shit like rocks, rivers, rain, snow and chasms, strong winds and mountains... To eventually deliver some boxes and make some numbers go up...

Is this supposed be a post-apocalyptic adventure or a literal job you get paid for ? Because it sure as shit sounds like it.  

No, seriously - how eventful a person's life has to be for them to view this kind of mind-numbing bullshit you waste literal hours on ?)"
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-31,It’s so interesting how a phrase you see once on a window that doesn’t matter in a room that doesn’t matter became a thing fans of the game still say/enjoy 20+ years later.
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-31,"I don’t understand why that’s a reason to not get a PS5. It literally runs PS4 games better, and many even have specific versions built for the PS5. Exclusives are going to be less and less of an incentive to buy consoles going forward if you haven’t noticed already. They shouldn’t be the only reason to upgrade. The SSD is worth the price alone."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"Considering part 2 of the remake comes out in a month and it comes with the ps5 version of part 1 I’d say yes, 100% worth it."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,Yeah. The Yuffie DLC is one of the best dlc I’ve played in a while. It was really fun and introduced a new battle mechanic that is going to be used in Remake. 100% recommend it.
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-31,"Ummm it went to 4k resolution, has added ambient effects, overhauled lighting and shadows, completely redone skyboxes, way faster load times, higher res static textures like doors (if you know you know), and a performance mode.

Not sure who gave you your information but almost every important texture was improved plus more"
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"I mean not for me, but I get that people want different things out of their games"
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-31,This is literally the first time I’m hearing of a supposed PlayStation FromSoft exclusive. What are your sources?
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"What does that even mean? It's also not an excuse, it's a very valid thing to criticise when someone else is going off on something they don't even know or haven't experienced."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"Kojima has a large cult following that would happily buy a turd he shat out, painted gold, and proclaimed to be his latest gaming masterpiece.  They would claim that every person who critiques the paint-encrusted turd is simply too dumb to understand true art.

These people suck.  You can't win with them if you try to even respectfully critique anything he does.  They'll tell you some version of how he's a misunderstood genius underdog who is brave enough to try to share his vision with the world.

If you want to get under their skin, though, you can point out the fact that he is, without question, the single most celebrated name in gaming.  Then they get *really* upset when you tell them Death Stranding was a massive blockbuster that achieved over 16 million players, because it absolutely wrecks their underdog narrative."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-31,"There are people who beat soulsborne games with dozens of self-imposed limitations and die thousands of times in the process, other people simply enjoy playing a lot of COD or LoL matches with their friends, other people enjoy games where you just grind to get the most OP things, others just want to enjoy good narratives, others play fighting games, others enjoy racing games, others get hooked on Animal Crossing, others enjoy strategy games with isometric view, others enjoy weird and innovative indies or things like the car wash simulator.  
Not everyone expects or wants the same things from videogames and if a game is not to your personal liking doesn't mean that automatically becomes trash that no one deserves to enjoy and whoever does it's fool."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-31,"Every ps4 I've seen sounds like a jet engine taking off, the ps5 actually being quiet makes it worth it alone"

1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-31,The starfield company said that you have to play a ridiculous amount of hours to start enjoying the game or something.
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-31,"What do you mean ""no one deserves to enjoy and whoever does is a fool"" ? **Are you implying that when I call out other people's taste it affects them enough that it stops them from enjoying said trash ?** Well, that's just ridiculous, isn't it ? Because they WILL keep enjoying said trash, regardless of how much I ridicule it and them for it.

The kinds of games I enjoy don't come out anymore. They simply don't. At the very least on the same scale as they used to, that's for sure. Almost every JRPG franchise lost its identity by stepping into an action control scheme, big-budgeted real-time-strategy games simply don't exist as an occurence anymore, literally every single survival horror game nowadays is either a third-person or a first-person shooter with good old lovely fixed camera angles and tank controls being obliterated by morons who don't understand how limiting player's control over the camera and movement enhances the stress and forces the player to be carefully strategic and adaptable... What else...? Hideki Kamiya, the god among men who gave us some of the most incredible games in existence (among which is the absolutely majestic and completely underappreciated gem which is **The Wonderful 101**) left Platinum Games after having worked on whatever ""Project G.G."" was supposed to be for three and a half years subtly stating ""creative differences"" **when talking about higher management of the company HE helped put on the map exactly thanks to his own vision and creative thinking !** That's a fucking atom bomb right there ! And Rocksteady has been working on what is basically a yet another live service always-online shitshow for the past 7 or so years !!! **And to top all of this (and more) shit Hideo Kojima, a guy who was always somebody to go to when you need a well-crafted linear experiences of utter batshit insanity... is making open-world borefests about grind and deliveries...**

To go back to your last post, which is essentially about ""let people enjoy the things they enjoy""... **Am I allowed the same courtesy ?** May I get more of the things I at this point USED to enjoy ? Because as it turns out the last game that made me enjoy myself was ""Hi-Fi Rush"", a game that took seven years to make and which is anything BUT boring. 

So the least I can do is lash out against who I perceive to be... the popularizators of boredom and death in my eyes. 

Woah, I'm on a roll today ! :)"
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-31,Oh god for real. Playing Horizon Forbidden West on the PS4 sounded like it was about to explode every time I shot an arrow. Upgrading to the PS5 was completely worth it.
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,I mean if you want to play the first part before the second part comes out I’d get it now. The PS5 version of part 1 has a lot of new story added
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-31,"Okay, so how does that have anything to do with me saying you should finish the story for yourself before commenting on it? I specifically mentioned OP talking about ""story/amount of cutsccenes"", nothing about enjoying the game or gameplay itself."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-31,"About that first paragraph, I'm just saying that a lot of self-absorbed gamers think that their personal taste is the absolute truth, which in my opinion is very silly.

And actually I quite agree with half of those other takes, a lot of important franchises and genres disappeared or survived becoming something that seeks to satisfy the highest denominator. Also most companies instead of wanting to make games that are worth it, only want to have a hit ⚡***Game as a Service⚡*** full of microtransactions whose only purpose of existing is to print money, fortunately most of those games fail because the developers focused on having well-made loot boxes and battle passes instead of make a fun game, without bugs and with satisfactory progression curves.

But that's the way things are, times change and people are voting with their wallets, they like different things than me and that doesn't make them more fool and normies, much less makes me more intelligent and alternative, for me it's quite obvious why most people prefer action games with instant gratification rather than anything slower and harder to get into.

Also, are you saying that Kojima no longer makes well-crafted linear experiences of utter batshit insanity? Yes, because now he makes well-crafted open-world experiences utter batshit insanity:

(Mild spoilers alert) In DS one moment you are walking slowly in the rain trying to keep your balance while admiring the beautiful landscapes and the melancholic soundtrack plays, another moment it becomes a stealth action game in which you fight against bandits addicted to deliveries who want to steal your cargo, or separatist military groups fans of extinction and chaos whose armors are based on Egyptian things and they enjoy killing people because since the world of the living and the world of the dead have come together now the corpses that are not cremated become antimatter ghosts that at the slightest contact with normal human beings cause nuclear explosions that makes cities disappear, in another moment it becomes a truck simulator, in another you are teleported to the first world war to fight against Mads Mikelsen and skeleton soldiers because for reasons he wants to take your ghost-detector baby, in other moment you are in the snowy mountains with hypothermia trying to build a zipline network or road sections that can allow you to travel between cities without even touching the ground, also the corrosive rain ages everything it touches and you have a canteen that turns it into Monster Energy, also eventually unlock a lot of futuristic equipment and tools that allow you to make bigger and faster deliveries, at other moment the main antagonist appears to entangle you with a lovecraftian tar monster, there is also shower water grenades, at other moment you're watching a really heartwarming movie that leaves you in tears (basically a long and important cutscene for the plot), in another scene you are in the shower with Guillermo del Toro's character to share government secrets without being spied, at other moment you deliver pizzas and I almost forgot to say that during boss fights or miniboss fights other players come out of the mud to throw you weapons and ammunition.

And I could go on for a while with the autistic sci-fi sh\*t that Kojima pulled out of his hat just to convey the message that >!people live better together than apart!< and Amazon truckers keep our society running."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,"But then you don't get the first part included in the price of Part 2, no?"
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-31,"Idk man, I’m just explaining what he was trying to say."
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,You get part 1 along with part 2 when you pre order. So you could pre order part 2 and be playing part 1 while you wait for part 2 to launch. Thats what a buddy of mine just did last week. It’s a pretty good deal
1aeo7r5,2024-01-30,2024-01-30,Oh ok that's pretty dope 👍

j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,"Well done and well deserved.  


I loved Death Stranding. I know people felt tedious but its another one of those fourth wall breaking special meta thingies. The game play gets called tedious etc, but lets be real when hasn't carrying stuff (IRL) from A to B been tedious.   


And that to me is brilliant."
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,Does anyone have a link to the cosplay? Looks very accurate in this pic but it's only the upper half of her face.
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,I seriously thought the entire image was cgi
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,"Alright im fuckin jealous, also why dont people lile the game like its just so good like i dont understand. I am disappointed in myself, i was doing a playthrough with my dad, put around 50-70 hours into in(maybe more) and when we god to the i wpuld say last 1-5 hours of game i fell asleep and now im sad because i fell asleep, guess im just gonna have to do a solo playthrough"
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,that's awesome !!
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,"I may be fragile but im not that fragile. 

-Some Spoiler Type things may be mentioned bellow.-

Fragiles story was very cool. I think she is one of the few female characters in a game that is never sexualized. There was that one seen where she was showering but that was expository.

 I like how Sam doesn't like her at first and throughout the game they become closer as he begins to understand her and see her for who she is. Which is how he acts with most of  the characters. Even himself. And maybe thats how the player is supposed to feel as well.

You begin with a sort of ""This is it? I just walk places?"" Then,  as you play and learn more about the world and it's systems, you come to appreciate the simplicity of it all and begin to see it for the cool fun experience it is. My favorite part was building the roads. Taking out the camps to get the supplies I needed. Farming BTs for crystals. Good game is good."
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,I just looked at your profile and that pic of you with Kojima is so cool.
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,I thought this was her! Well done!
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,I actually thought its fragile herself ingame... What an amazing cosplay!

j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,That's a very fragile keychain so be careful not to lose any keys.
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,That’s amazing. You look like you’re happy that the OG creators appreciated your cool cosplay. I can’t imagine how good that must have felt!
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,You're Fragile.. but not \*that\* Fragile..
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,Cosplay? Thought that was an in-game screenshot
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,That's awesome. Can I see your cosplay?
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,Now cosplay the reverse trike!

j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-12,No one is linking to the cosplay? The nose up looks pretty legit like Fragile though
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-12,You deserve it!

Then I toss a grenade at them while they're sleeping and throw their corpse into a crematorium after taking their shoes. 10/10 fuck with my delivery and find out"

j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,I swear you almost look like you're in a game. Something bout the face is making me think that. Are you using a filter?
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,The publisher’s a simp
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,Are you a man or woman?
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-12,It's probably because they have so few..
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-12,"Can we appreciate what a weird name Fragile is? And how dumb her “I’m fragile, but not THAT fragile” voice line was? It was a good story but  that part was dumb"
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-12,"You could be a actress or something else, because this ""game"" is already a movie"
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,Lmao completely forgot Death Stranding was a game. What was the plot again. All I remember now is Darryl from TWD and a baby on his back.
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-12,Probably the only person who likes the shit game they made.
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,They did this for every fan of Death Stranding.  Cost them very little to send it to.... you.
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,"Ah, it's such a nice feeling being recognized :з Thank you!"
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-12,Hahahah i wanted to write the same thing :) her work is amazing. I was thinking about doing a cosplay for myself inspired by her of course.
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,"I loved that game as well. The intense interactions with the BTs, MULES, and terrorists made me appreciate the boring walking parts, without making it too frustrating."
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-12,I loved building out my zip line network
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,"People just hate actually different games, and ignore this idea that just because something is great doesn't mean it's for everyone. Pokemon is a great game, just not for me."

j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,You need to schedule a visit with your eye doctor
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,"Can definitely recommend your own full playthrough! 

Being a Kojima game, people either get the game or they don't it seems. With a lot of people not looking past the ""Walking simulator"" meme, so they discount it fairly early on, meaning people miss out on some purely fantastic characters. 

I 100%'d the game in just over 100 hours, and frankly I wish there was even more content than that because of how much I simply enjoyed it all."
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,"Yes! Ageed, many people hate it for no reason. 
It's pity you fell asleep, but in case you didn't get it spoiled, it's totally worth playing for yourself."
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,"It's aimed at a certain group of people and it hits the nail directly on the head for them. It's an exploration game, with resource management, and a certain degree of upgradability to reward the player progress. 

I was saving this game for my PC upgrade so I'm only partially through it, but the combat/stealth isn't as built out as much as other games and there isn't really any way to fight back against mules until 10 hours in. This is a game for people that like atmosphere, gathering resources, and using their imagination to fill in the gaps of the story. If you like Elite Dangerous (the new one), The Last of Us, Shadow of the Colossus or Dark Souls you'll probably like this game. If you like fps, arena games, party games, etc. you probably won't stick with this game. 

Also it takes a lot of intuition to figure out how to level up certain skills if you don't feel like reading through the massive wall of text they have for tips. There are ""hidden"" (they are mention off-hand once) systems and rewards which take a certain type of player to uncover which some people might stop playing the game before they find them.

I absolutely love this game, but couldn't recommend it to any of my friends in good faith because I know they wouldn't like it."
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-12,"This is just my opinion on the hate for the game however, I've not played the game myself. From what I've seen and heard, it just wasn't what people were expecting. The lead developer, Hideo Kojima, made Metal Gear and that's what everyone immediatly started comparing it to when the game was announced. Many people assumed what the game was going to be like and when it ended up something completely different, they got mad and hated the game for not being something they wanted. It also didn't help that a lot of Metal Gear fans got the game just because of the developer and to me it seems to be a different genre entirely."
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-12,ok
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,For me it was the lack of reward for doing anything.i was basically incentivised to leave stuff behind and just walk to the quests over everything else. It made an already tedious game far worse.
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,"It's a walking simulator, a lot of people don't like that"
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-12,"As someone that played about five hours and quit, carrying shit from one place to another and trying not to tip over just was not interesting at all for me."
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,"Thank you! My cosplay wasn't that good back then, but the picture somehow came out great! I'm very thankful to his photographers, it'd break my heart to have a pic with THE Hideo where I look goofy x)"

j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,I first did a cosplay of Fragile before the game came out and before 505 Games started being associated with DS. I'd be kinda mad in case I was somehow advertising all that time and they only sent stuff to me now

j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,"This.

The game is great, even tough I have not played it my self. Kojema (I ruined his name, sorry) said that it was mainly for himself, that walking was something he loved.
And I think we all did.
The haters are against a healthy life, it think XD"
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-12,"You can pee on them, use weapons, or simply outrun them. If you're lucky and quick after they capture you,  you can still escape"
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-12,"Yah, bringing them to the correct person would upgrade your connection level and you could get upgraded gear. Run faster, longer, lift heavier"
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-12,"I agree that the gameplay was meant to be slow, but it's not the only way apparently. My brother rushed through the game, he didn't ever get distracted on side quests and played on the easiest mode. I guess I'll be recommending this way to people who dislike such gameplay from now one, heh"
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,"He called Metal Gear Survive a stick poking simulator and led everyone to believe there were no guns or anything and 90% of the time someone shits on the game they repeat it or just say ""but Dunkeyyyyyy saidddd"".   


I kinda hate the guy tbh. He lies in his videos and he's a one trick pony. He called LoU a choking simulator. Survive was a stick poking simulator. He called Death Stranding a walking simulator. He just gets like 7 jokes and modifies them over and over.   


/rant"
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,Personally I don’t think you can say a game is great without playing it yourself. I don’t I guess to me looking at other people’s reason for liking or hating a game is different than playing it yourself and forming an opinion.
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-12,I guess Im dumb then
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-12,I might go back to it since I clearly didnt pay enough attention to the games details.
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,Exactly. There's plenty of games that got mediocre reviews that I've absolutely loved. Sometimes the low reviews are just people that didn't get the game *they* wanted.
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-11,"True, I should play it one day as well."
j98sgx,2020-10-11,2020-10-12,Hope you'll have a good time with it!

9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,90% sure this a cooking game.
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,"At this point, I honestly can't tell if the eventual full plot disclosure is going to be preferable to the mysterious phantasmagoric bullshit tidbits we've been getting. There's something magical about the teasers so far - it almost gives you the impression that you're looking in on someone's recurring nightmares."
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,So it's like Pokemon or something then?
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,I still don’t understand what it’s about....
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,I do like that every time I see this game I'm just thinking 'what the fuck is that' at every frame.
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,I really wish I knew what this game is about 
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,Let's face it. This story is not going to make sense to anyone. 
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,"Man, Kojima should make video games. He'd be really good at it."
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,I’m starting to think this game is just one big acid trip
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,I stand by it being edgy Kingdom Hearts

9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,"I have no friggin clue what this game is about.  It looks like Kojima went ""I no longer have to have a story that makes any sort of sense at all!"""
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,"I have a theory of Death Stranding: 

the world is like Bloodborne's as you can see some ""elders monsters"" in the sky controlling the world and mantaining the order. Humans have been living trying to adapt to this world. Sam (Norman Reedus) is just a messanger and transports things and people as you need to be really cautious while crossing between cities with the big guys looking at you. 

E3 trailer shows Sam has a ""power"" that let him sense these monsters and that's why he is asked by Lea Seydoux to be part of an organization that would be ""La resistencia"" and try fighting for freedom. The golden mask guy probably is probably Sam's rival and will trigger Sam to join Fragile (Lea's organization) and fight to save the world.

9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,Are you able to play this game? [gif] 
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,I can't wait until they start making a game from this movie. 
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,This is some Princess Mononoke shit.
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,"I am willing to bet this game is going to be “less than fun” at best. Looks gorgeous, but I smell a let-down. "
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,I’m becoming more and more convinced that all were gonna get for this game is trailer after trailer until Kojima runs out of famous friends. No game even exists. 
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,"True dat. And with Kojima at the helm, you'll get to watch a LOT of Death Stranding. And play a little bit. And then watch a lot of Death Stranding!"
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,All the stuff that they have show is just pushing me more and more away. 
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,"This looks interesting, but I have zero faith that it will be anything other than utter nonsense with Kojima at the helm. The man isn't a storyteller."
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,So is Kojima gonna put every cutscene in the game in a trailer like he did with ground zeros and mgsv?
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,I have a feeling that once you beat the game you’ll be even more confused.
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,Is Death Stranding even a videogame? Because I don't believe in it. I'm a Death Stranding truther.
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,Its just a giant elaborate tech demo. When the game comes out it will have nothing to do with anything we've seen. Because kojima.  
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,What the fuck is this game.
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,"Konami has released a creative monster and Sony gave it freedom to do whatever. Noone should go into this game thinking they know anything about it. 

Kojima started his career, creating a new genre and has sense done the best he could to push boundaries. he is a man who has found a love for cinema and the surreal. attempting to understand the creative nature this man has is like trying to figure out the Dark Souls story.

When I think back on Kojimas Metal Gear series, I think of the highlight moments. the Psycho Mantis fight when u have to switch your controller ports. when u have to find the code on the back of the game case to call a NPC. the bait and switch that is Metal gear 2. the first person views in MGS3 to see Sorrow floating around and even helping u in 1 situation. These moments and many others give me hope and excitement for Death Stranding, but also it worries me. what if he goes to far and it just doesn't work? "
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,The sheer fact that every trailer i see just makes me have more questions is what gets me excited to play it. The entire game is just going to be a big mindfuck and I'd be surprised if we even fully understand any of it by time the credits roll.
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,"What made you say that? Was it the baby that gives a thumbs up? Invisible monsters/dude stabing himself while floating away/tar aliens/anime nazis/gold skull, cousin of red skull/pregnant daryl/walking? That would be sorta strange woudnt it?"
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,"Don't know, for me they took some of the mystery with that trailer, hopefully he hasn't the same old bad guy formula we see so often."
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,What is this game?

I get it's got a big name behind it and a well known actor (or their likeness) in it. But all the little clips we've seen of it have just looked fucking weird to me, and i don't understand why so many people seem to think it's going to be amazing and not *just* fucking weird."

Can any of you tell me what this game is about? What the powers or abilities actually are? What we're going to do in the game or spend most of our time doing?

Cuz so far, all I've seen is some crazy trailers, a fetus in a tank, and the name of both the game and its creator.

I'm supposed to accept this at face value?"

9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,"Everyone is trying to find out what the game will be about...
I don't care, I'll buy it anyway, because it's got Daryl. That's all I need."

9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,"For those of you who aren't aware of how kojima games work, I'm convinced it goes something like this:

* Step 1: Have your game designers and concept artists come up with crazy and cool ideas and characters

* Step 2: Implement all the ideas no matter how poorly they fit the setting or how outlandish and weird they are

* Step 3: Their official writer quits because of how ridiculously stupid the story is getting and they pay two college interns strung out on LSD to try and link everything together 2 weeks before the deadline.

---

This is why, for example, Kojima's most famous series - metal gear - tends to start out as a stealthy spy conspiracy thriller and then halfway through, crazy things like zombies, psychics, and people with magical powers start showing up."

I dunno what the shoulder-mounted dealios are though, looks like some kind of field-projection device perhaps?

9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,"Do you need to know exactly what something is about to enjoy it?

I think the story being extremely bizarre and confusing is *part* of what it’s about, in a way. Seems like a really physiological mind-fuck story. If there isn’t something within the story making bizarre hallucination-like events happen, then they’re probably using heavy metaphor and stuff. 

Either way, it looks epic. If you watch some of the trailer stuff that’s been released you’ll see a slight inkling of plot. Two dudes seem to be exploring some foreign plant surface in space suits when really weird shit starts happening. (And from screenshots and other video clips, it gets WAY weirder.)"

people put a lot of faith in them, then they didn't back up those promises . The Dev of this game has over 30 years of experience with numerous critically successful games. Also, they didn't really promise anything yet. Just teased us with insane shit. "

9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,"I mean that's cool, man. It's obvious you're passionate about it, and I can dig that. It's frustrating when you share your passion with people and they don't take it the direction you hoped, but that's just how it is.   

I think you gotta keep in mind that even if no one in the world shares your passion, it doesn't invalidate it. You can still get something out of it, even when no one else does. Just don't try to force the conversation in the direction you wanted it to go because that's a sure way to get more opposition. Write it off as different tastes and move on.   

Keep on keepin' on :)"
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,"That's what I mean though. We've seen 2 trailers and people are crying ""bad storytelling"". If it looks good or doesn't that's fine but people judge things they have no idea about."
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,"One guy in my thread accused me of being terrified.

Like, being cautious because of being burned before isn't the same thing as being terrified. The fuck?"
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,"Bungie was in the same boat and then launched both vanilla D1 and D2. Both are great now, but at launch? Oof.

9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-26,Agreed. The rest really failed to balance the spy thriller and vampire ghost psychic ninja stuff
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-26,I'm sure metal gear had a lot of producer input as a whole though made with his style. He probably leaned more towards what others wanted since it was more a konami game than his games. This is definitely all him though.
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,">Metal gear 5 is the only one that doesnt fit.

Ummm, did we play a different game? I remember a mute stripper who shoots your enemies and absorbs sunlight for food, I remember some kind of zombie ninja operative group that took about a billion bullets to take down, I remember some kind of supervirus that responds to ancient native magic..."

Of course, because it is a pointless statement. Nothing will ever make sense if you don't know the context of the game and the rules of its world.

9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,4 movies. Worth.
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-26,"I enjoyed MGS3 as well, it pulled back from the surrealism of MGS2 (which I didn’t really appreciate at all until I watched a YouTuber cover it and explain Kojima’s intentions) but MGS3 still had some bizarre stuff. In 1 the weirdest stuff we had was a guy with powerful psychokinesis, and a shaman with some spiritual abilities. It only pushed supernatural aspects to a level where you could believe it was being experimented with by the military on some level, the rest of the stuff they had was sci fi and 90s action movie. MGS3 had a guy that could control bees, a guy that could control fire, a chameleon ninja, a plant man, electric man, a ghost, and maybe more that is escaping me. Still one of my favorites though. 

If I had to rank MGS stories I’d go 1>3>4>5>2 and gameplay would go 5>3>4>2>1 so 3 in my opinion holds up the best all around. "
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,Don't forget about the fiery vengeance ghost accompanied by the creepy psychic child or the giant robot that went on a rampage after that same child put the consciousness of another child into it.

9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,"It was announced at E3 over two years ago. Every so often they release little cinematics like this to keep people interested. And I get it, Kojima is a legend and maybe it really will be fantastic. But I’m skeptical about it living up to all the hype. "
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,You’re right it’s not hype exactly. More like endless praise for what is basically the same type of video over and over again. If it weren’t Kojima people would have moved on by now. 
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-26,"MGS 1 and 3, for the most part, make sense.  They have a few plot holes but are hardly nonsensical.

MGS2, despite its reputation, does make sense.  The issue is that the cutscenes near the end bombards the player with so much information that it is very difficult to process it all on you first or second viewing.  If MGS2's last two cutscenes were a book then it would be easier to understand since you are reading it at you're own pace rather than watching it at an established pace.

MGS4 is really the only one that is a huge mess.

MGS 5 for the most part isn't complicated (granted there wasn't much story to begin with).  Though the twist at the end though opens a huge can of worms when viewed within the established canon. "

And auto down voting doesn’t negate my point.

The red dead redemptions trailers make sense I can understand the game even if I don’t know any characters names or the location.

9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,"MGS 2 is about information and how we process them. It even said that memes will be more relevant than genes in the near future. If i am not mistaken it was the only mention of memes in the mainstream media except a book from carl sagan who coined the expression.

Of course this has not much to do with what we call memes these days. Where every picture with text on it is called a ""meme"".

It is a high concept art piece, but in no way is it meaningless. It is just highly inteligent and the subject matter itself (the game and its marketing being part of the games story itself) makes it hard to grasp.

9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,I'd agree if they weren't elements in a purposefully overly convoluted story about government and military espionage with multiple uses of pseudoscience and goofy technobabble. In a game that feels the need to explain every single *other* detail unnecessarily the existence of unexplained magical powers sticks out like a sore thumb.
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,Bannerlord when?
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,And yet what do we have after two years? The same cryptic videos with subtle differences. I mean they’re still hiring voice actors. I’m not saying it won’t be good. Maybe it will be the GOTY. But you can’t argue the amount of praise this game has received is out of proportion with what little information we have. 
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-26,"To each their own.  

To me the wackiness is part of MGS's charm and doesn't always need to be explained.  I can understand needing to explain some of it like vamp's ""immortality"" since you need to kill him eventaully.  But finding out ocelot wasn't being controlled by the ghost of liquid was  underwhelming.  

And while MGS4 certainly tries to explain everything, the result is a very mixed bag.  Some explanations work while some just give us more questions than answers or just don't make sense.  Kojima was trying to wrap up way too many loose ends in a single game.  

"
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,You either are hideo kojima or just a massive fanboy
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,"Jumping in really quick...

I get your point. And what I'm doing about it is to not buy the game until I read reviews. I have, without a doubt, a feeling that this game will be crazy and confusing but that doens't mean I'll buy day one. It grabs my attention enough to stay on my radar but I won't commit to it until reviews are out and I can get multiple opinions.

Now some will get this game day one, and that's OKAY. Not everyone will and that's OKAY. It's fine that we all have our own opinions of this game right now. They could change in a day or well after the games release. The point is, you shouldn't let others lack of apparent knowledge of a game or opinion of an upcoming game bother you and ruffle your feathers. Make your own decisions (which it sounds like you have) and let others have theirs. No reason to bash people over it. Now if you want an honest answer or opinion, I wouldn't expect much solid evidence yet.

From what I gather on the game you are a delivery guy of sorts who has to travel far distances for clients. The world appears to be in ruin or has an unsettling emptiness about it. There is some sort of phenomina or creature or intelligence (I'd go as far to say its some sort of time warping do-thingy) that causes any who touch it/them to be forgotten from the world. The main character can't see them but he can sense them with the help of the fetus in the jar thing. There are those that can see the creature thing(s) though.

Now for my little theory. I said I think the creatures are related to time. And a quick google search yielded that the phenomena is called a ""Timefall Rain."" So I am guessing that this rain somehow captures beings (humans, dinosaurs, other natural predators and possibly other worldly things) and traps them or controls them like a husk fostering *something.* Maybe these trapped beings are reaching out for help but it only pulls those they touch to another place/dimension. All I do know is that when, what ever the fuck they are, touches you then you are ""forgotten"" or removed from history/memory. The main character just so happens to remember his daughter or SO who was taken by this phenomena as we saw in a trailer as he looked at a photo and a line was spoken that he stills remembers.

P.S. just realized I may have been writing this whole thing as a misunderstanding to the comments being made. I put way too much time into thinking of this so I'll post it anyway. But yes I agree with you 100%. People just aren't aware that trailers like these can be completely misleading to a game; both game play and story."
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-26,But they are explained... theres only 2 characters with real magical abilities. The Sorrow and Psycho Mantis.
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-26,"Except how and why some of the bosses got their powers has no bearing on the plot or character motivations, so at best it's just fluff.  That's why I feel it doesn't need to be explained, sometimes.

If anything whenever kojima does try to fully explain these weird superpowers it just gets unnecassarily convoluted and creates more plot holes (MGS4 and 5).  And these kind of characters aren't uncommon in MGS games so they hardly stick out like a sore thumb. 

Personally I like that there is a bit of the supernatural in the MGS universe and I think it's better when Kojima doesn't try to fully explain these elements (MGS 1-3) and leaves some of it to the player's imagination. "
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,"Maybe Im missing all the praise that it gets, but really I see more confusion and theories than praise or hype."

9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-26,"I'm not saying I don't like the overall idea of having magical superpowered characters in a military spy thriller type story. But the powers have no rules. There's a guy who controls hornets and another guy who's like a vampire and a woman who breathes through her skin. It's like X-Men but at least X-Men explains that there's a mutant gene and it's unpredictable. In MGS you get the feeling that Hideo needed bosses and just said ""Fuck it. How about a guy who controls hornets?""

There should be rules so it doesn't feel like a child thought it up."
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,Come on. We both know Kojima is releasing these weird ass clips bc it would need to be a four hour video to actually attempt to explain the story at all 
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-26,"Fair enough though there never was a ghost of Liquid. It was just psychotherapy that Ocelot went through to fool everyone, mainly the Patriots."
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-26,I believe it was explained in MGS V. He had a strain of parasites that gave him resistance to pain and the ability to control insects
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-26,"Here's the thing though, the mutant gene and the X-men's powers are integral to the comics's plot and themes of prejudice so it makes sense that they would need to be explained to some degree 

Most of the the time in MGS, how the bosses got their powers is not integral to the overall story of most of the games.  That being said it is usually at least hinted at that they are either born with their powers (genetic) or receive them through technology and/or gene manipulation.  In MGS1 we can assume Mantis was born with his psychic powers since he has had them since he was a child.   MGS 4 flat out says most of the superpowers in the game are explained by nano machines, like vamp's ""immortality"" and in MGS5 most of the superpowers are caused by some weird parasites, including Quiet's abilities.  Although the funny thing is that MGS4 and MGS5, despite going out of their way to explain all the weird superpowers, are generally considered inferior in writing quality compared to MGS 1-3.  Ever since MGS4, Kojima has had this weird obsession with over explaining how these weird superpowers work, and unfortunately its been to the detriment of the games' writing quality. 

Sometimes less is more, and trying to over explain superpowers in fiction can hurt suspension of disbelief rather than strengthen it.   "
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-26,"Before MGS4, it was widely considered that the ghost of liquid was controlling ocelot's body.  In MGS3 it's revealed that Ocelot is the son of the Boss and the Sorrow.  Since the sorrow had some kind of link to the dead, afterlife, or whatever, it is possible that ocelot inherited this link and the ghost of liquid exploited it to take control of ocelot.  

I don't think it was a coincidence that kojima made ocelot, a man who was seemingly possessed in MGS2, the son of a man who had a psychic link to the dead.

The explanation given in MGS4 is most likely a retcon.
"
9iqsrt,2018-09-25,2018-09-26,That made me laugh.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,I'm not ready to go to no damn wedding I'm trying to get all the groshen!
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"""Tutorial"" is heavily exaggerated, it's about 40% of the content in the game"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"To be fair, Trotsky is far from the tutorial area of the game."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Kingdom Come: Deliverance II


For those that think people should spell out acronyms "
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,I'm playing the first one right now for the very first time before I get the sequel. About 40 hours in and I'm just really figuring things out. Glad I'm playing it before I jump into the sequel.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,That’s crazy. I felt like I spent a ton of time doing every quest and I only hit 50ish hours before getting to the 2nd area
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,What is KCD?
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,What's the whole name?
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Don't you fill this crusty jaded heart with that beautiful and precious hope. 
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,For story/lore purposes do you need to have played the first one to enjoy the second? Or at least not be completely confused and lost?
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,I'm glad shadow of the colossus is in your list of greats
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,The sound design and weather changes/effects are so incredible good in this game.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Is this what the game actually looks like?  I haven’t dove in yet or seen too much but other than Henry this is the most photorealistic game I’ve ever seen without mods, and by a pretty significant margin."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"I'm about 50 hours in, I'm learning leveling Drinking and Horsemanship at the same time is very efficient."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"I wish I had the attention span to do this! 65 hours was my play time to complete it. I bloody loved it and found myself 100% wanting to do more side stuff, but this happens with every open world game I get into. First 40 hours spent doing every possible side quest, exploring as much as possible, getting completely absorbed. 10 hours of ""hmm, I'm not finding this as fun as I was"". Then end up hammering the main quest until I've finished. 

Damn good game though, absolutely loved it. Will definitely come back to it to do more side quests or start it again."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,[deleted]
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Sounds 🔥🔥🔥
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Hi. Just started and reached the point where apparently I'm a jackass according to Hans. I would love some guidance, i.e. WHERE I CAN GET A BED FOR THE NIGHT. If you'd be so kind.

Also, I can't praise the devs enough for their improvement over the first game, specifically the graphics. It looks amazing and I've yet to experience any stutters."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Spent about 58h before I moved on to the next area. Did more or less all quests, talked to basically everyone, explored, looted, crafted etc.

Currently at 85h and I just walked into the city.

This game is phenomenal. Haven’t felt this immersed with a game since Skyrim or Witcher 3."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Haha, you know, I've spent *at least* as much time there and I was wondering if I was in a FF7/Midgar situation, where I didn't even realize there was a huge, wider world right around the corner. I've already maxed out some skills lol"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,I have 20k groschen and nothing to spend it on. 
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Is that a photograph? I might be tweaking
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,I thought this area was already amazing until I got to the next area and was in awe all over again
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,I spend the first 30 hours just sneaking around stealing everything I could. KD2 stealth and thievery is a beautiful improvement from KD1. They did an amazing job.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Kcd2? What's that mean
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"I've just restarted the first KCD after being put off by the combat. Decided to really put the effort into learning it and joined the tourney in rattay and replayed it until I won. Fell into the trap of doing it before learning combos and ripostes which nearly filtered me again, but then it clicked. Really into it now, looking forward to get trough it and start 2. 

Has there been any substantial improvements/changes with the second?"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,I wanna play this game SO BAD because of the map but the gameplay is so clunky to me...
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,To everyone asking how it took him so long. Weed. The answer is weed.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Omg this picture 

Rarely any pic made me want to try a game so bad

Gawd damn the nature!"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Just finished the first one and now just started the 2nd one and it's a treat to continue the story like as if it's a huge dlc to the first one
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Not the tutorial area of the game
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,That sounds like me in Witcher 3. More than enough reason for me to NOT pick this game up right now
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Can I fully skip the first game's story?
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Oh, shit... really? I haven't even found Mutt or Hans yet, I'm sitting at 50 hours, lol."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"I miss demos of games. Like, why not let people play the training area or something to see if they want?

Im not dropping 80 on a game just to try it out."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,I wasn’t much of a fan of 1. Just small things here and there but I’ve been intrigued by 2. I’ll end up getting it on a good sale but this game looks so pretty in everything I see.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Bruh, same, lmao. I've been loving/hating the game last week. The number of times I died to some random bandit to restart to half hour  to an hour earlier then spend like another hour trying to get revenge. I finally got Mutt by my side, and it's slowly gotten a bit easier. Also, I almost got screwed over from food poisoning for a while. Then there was the Voivode amulet quest, which had me and my friends laughing our asses off since I knocked him out for the amulet just to be told it loses its power because it wasnt given willingly lol."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,“Tutorial” area meaning the first entire map that’s basically half to a third of the game I guess.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,GOTY material.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,There is 36 side quest and like 10 main quest in that first map there is A LOT to do
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,I usually avoid side quests like the plague since games these days are all fetch questing and feel almost generated. But they did an amazing job making all the quests unique and interesting.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"played first one quite a bit as well, but i never got a hang on the combat, it just feelt unfair and like i was just weaving around. 

in 2 tho, im about 80h in its amazing, i feel like i have mastered the longsword and can pretty easily win all 1-1 fights, and 2-3 are pretty doable aswell"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,That's how devs intented to play this game!
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"42hrs in myself, still haven't been to that damned wedding."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Brother i cant possible advance the story before hustling my way into a decent pile of Groshen, having crafted 50 Saviour Snaps and done a million side quests."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Most fun I’ve had in an open world since RDR2.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Holy shit the game looks like this? Maybe it's because I'm looking at the screenshot on my phone but the landscape pretty much looks like a photo
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Is this game worth it I need a game that I will be heavily addicted to lol
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Crazy I spent aboutt he same amount of time. I just finished wedding aftermath and am at 66.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Morrowind? OK you just sold me in one word. I don't even have a system to play on and now I want one.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Never could get the timing down for the combat in KCD1.  Doubt the sequel will be much different
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,There's no wedding until this guy helps everyone on this map!
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,Well I've just found out I'm only in the tutorial area. Thought that was the game - I've got into so many shenanigans already
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,"I'm not gonna lie at first I hated this game. I'm not a big fan of first person melee combat nor medieval type scenarios if it's not fantasy based (magic and what not) until I realized the main problem I had in this game was that I tried to force myself to play this like every other game: complete the checklist of objectives. 

  
It wasn't until I said fuck it let me just slow down that I realized that I was the problem and wasn't playing the game as it was meant to be played: slow and steady. Started talking to more town folk, bartered my way into some decent clothes, led a group of bandits chasing me on foot all the way to Seline so that the guards can kill them and take their loot for profit and I said oh...this game...this game is special. Now I'm in my hut becoming a master alchemist before I even get ole pebbles back."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-20,All I want to know if can I become just a straight up blacksmith
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Damn, i really need to finish up KCD 1 and play this game. The graphics look insane"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,It’s not the tutorial area yall crazy. People say it’s 1/3 of the game lol
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Is this a super punishing game like dark souls and Elden ring?  Or can I turn the difficulty down if I get stuck.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"How good is it, from a scale of Starfield to BG3?"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,I'm 90 hours in and yet to press new game.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"With “tutorial area” you mean the first map, Trosky?"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,I am 95 hours into my first playthrough of BG3's Act 1 zone. But then I stepped into a circle of mushrooms...
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,[deleted]
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Oh fuck. That means I'm still in the tutorial area and basically max level.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Is the combat really that bad? It’s been the only thing stopping me from trying this game.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Should I start with the first one ?
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,I'm in the tutorial area? Lol
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"When does the tutorial end?

I HAVE NOT FOUND HANS IR GOT IN THE WEDDING! Instead I'm saving Ignatius... BAAAA!"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Is it worth $80?? Thinking about purchasing it. Might have time to play it as I’m away from the wife on a work trip 😭😂
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Gorgeous screen grab!
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Can you use your old save from KC1?
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"I'm playing KCD1 and have killed and robbed everyone I can in the tutorial area and first town, have made almost 1.5k lol"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Man i wish my pc wasnt hot garbage 😂
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,What shield is that? It owns and I want to go find it
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Now you get to spend 65 hours completing “Storm”
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"I'm playing through the first one, I'm about 20-25hrs in and I thought I was close to end game since I have great armor and a decent amount of money. Looked it up and I'm more like the quarter to a third the way through."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,How is the system requirements. I heard it is up there with ‘can it run Crysis’. Plus Cryengine is so good looking.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Beautiful game but I'm struggling with combat. Watched a bunch of tutorials cause I kept running into bandits trying to get to the first sword training. Ended up making potions for money to buy Pebbles and now grinding for more money to get the training done. Hope that helps me improve.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Hello, is it as janky as kcd 1?

I tried that but the euro jank was a bit much for me."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,I really liked the interactions with the npcs at the wedding who knew me from the sidequests i did before
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Tim?
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,So done with tutorial? 😁
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Genuine question, what's so good about this series?

I love me a slow burn game but I just couldn't get into KCD1. I thought maybe i just don't fit into the niche but seeing the sequel do so well, it's pretty universal game"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Wait.. 

The first area with the couple of towns around that castle is just the tutorial area? I thought it was the whole game lol, have only been playing like 20-25h so far and haven't started working at the blacksmith/miller yet"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,I am intrigued by this game but I am afraid the fighting won’t be my thing.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"70 hours in, wedding? What wedding? Where is Hans, who gives a damn!"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"im gonna be honest, a 65 hour tutorial is not a ringing endorsement"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Based
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,I'm trying to get the game for my birthday in June to play it and I can't wait. I've heard so much good stuff about it and I'm so excited to try it
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Thanks for sharing
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Bro is about to leave the tutorial with endgame gear
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Is it worth picking up? The first had promise but the combat just made it flop for me. Felt like I was playing morrowind as a child again, unable to hit anybody 🤣"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Do I need to have played KCD1 to understand 2?

And is this game somewhat like Witcher 3? These games are usually out of my wheelhouse but this game looks good"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"You can finally play from 3rd person camera view?? (it was only most annoying thing about KDC, that you could not switch to 3rd person view)

If so i would like to play it."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,I am waiting for my mini-staycation to start this game.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,How does the game play on the series s? Other new games I’ve played have a texture loading issue
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Not the game for me. The intro bit for me was never-ending. I'm sure it's a fun game, but not for me."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"So hows the game, is it woth it?"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Looks great this game. Waiting for my ps5 now 👎 Another week!
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,This was me in Cyberpunk
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Yeah I was at 70 hours before I realized I haven’t been progressing the story lol. I’m like level 20 in most skills and didn’t even go to the wedding
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Nah bro i was thinking that this is the map and its too small wtf am i doing there 😂😂😂
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,What if i tried the first and couldnt get into it? Is this more of the same or kinda different?
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Is it necessary to play the first one before this?
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Game is amazing but that god damn combat is killing my enjoyment
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Is this game good?
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Bro I it's been days and 20 hrs in iv not felt the need to get to the wedding
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"I heard nothing but good about this game!
Still need to finish kcd 1 tho"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,I am OBSESSED with this game rn
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Does the game actually have much story past the wedding? I'm playi g like the wedding is the end of the game
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Nice
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Don’t have the cash for it atm. Really want to get into it. Patiently waiting a steam sale
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"lol, you just made me realize that there may be more outside of the initial area... 

But, I haven't even figured out the basics yet! I'm not ready to move on!"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Sorry for the kinda stupid question but, do they even teach how to play the game in the first hours? Or does the tutorial drag along for much longer?"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,"So a good game. Did the same on Fallout, best 12 hours of cleaning I’ve ever had."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,Kcd2?
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,Damn dude I thought this was a real picture at first!
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,"I am blown away by the detail and realism in the foliage. The mix of plants, placement, patterns, etc...it just looks so real."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,"I've been dragging my feet with my KCD1 playthrough, trying to get every last little bit out of it that I can.  No idea why I put it down way back when it released - it's so good.  Pretty excited to start KCD2 in the next day or two."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,"Been contemplating playing this game for awhile, can anyone tell me if there’s a third person camera view for gameplay? All I’ve seen is a very Skyrim-style first person camera angle. Sadly it’s my only dealbreaker for games"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,"Welp, as someone who has never played this genre of game before that's high praise and I think that's my cue to give it a go."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,Yeah be sure to finish the poacher quests before the wedding
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,"I finished the game in around 100 hours, while doing 70% of the side content. For the longest time, i was running to different parts of the map, because i couldn't figure out how to call my horse."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,How would you compare it with the first? I played the first all the way through and am replaying it right now. Trying to justify spending the money on it when I finish the first again
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-20,"I really wanna get this game, although I didn’t entice the first game a chance although I bought it.
Idk what to do.
I’ll eventually give the first one a chance."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-20,I've spent about 30 hours before going to the wedding. But now I'm kind of afraid of being robbed by the storyline...
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-20,"What do you mean with tutorial area, I'm doing stuff in the area like helping with poachers, Bozhena and the Romani camp but don't feel compelled to go to the wedding yet and I also don't have an invitation after like 35 hours."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-20,"I tend to roam in spawn areas too, this environment does look fun to explore!"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-21,I've been chasing that feeling of playing Morrowind for the first time ever and have yet to find it. That's a mighty bold calm that might convince me to give this game a go then.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-21,I've been chasing that feeling of playing Morrowind for the first time ever and have yet to find it. That's a mighty bold claim that might convince me to give this game a go then.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-24,I'm still playing the original game. Didn't expect it to be so interesting.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Is it fairly optimised? They cleaned up the first game quite well near the end so hoping they took what they learned to the sequel!
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"I always keep collecting flowers and crafting potions. Then I travel to towns and sell my potions, play dice etc. I could play this game without combat, but it is so forced.


Every time I restart the game I just collect all the nettles from starter town, damn its so relaxing."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Idk, doesn't seem much fun basically having the best of everything before even map 2"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Have they dimmed down the sleeping, eating and washing mechanics? That killed the first one for me I don't play games that penalise me because I don't sleep and wash every 15 minutes."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Am I the only one who don't know what KDC2 is?
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"I'm probably not going to play this game because I didn't play the first one and don't have much interest in the genre, but can someone explain how you can spend this amount of time in the starting area?"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Dude I thought the first area was the only area... Blew my mind when things advanced.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,This pic goes hard af
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Geralt be like: finally a worthy opponent
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"wow, the landscape looks so untouched"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"After 50 hours and already >!in second map!<, I still got prompt not to hold W when riding hold.

I failed tutorial"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,I would get serious burnout if i didnt progress a game for that long.. but i also havent played kcd games yet.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"I'm like 25 hours in and I'm still looking for Mutt. I get side tracked.

Does anyone know if dead people are replaced or respawn? If not... It will be a very intimate wedding once I actually get there."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Yeah I did something similar... 40 hours before going to the main area lol.
It was about 22hrs before I even got my horse!  Bloody brilliant game."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"I haven't even left the first town, just been grinding potions for the first couple hours for fun."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"I find myself more willing to read through books, notes, and dialogues in this game because they don’t give a feeling of “someone made up this bullshit” compared to, dare I say, Cyberpunk 2077 & RDR2. These books, mostly because they’re records of real events, felt like they mattered to the writer and to me. I think I just discovered that I can actually enjoy story-driven games (which I previously thought I couldn’t). It seemed the case that I’m just bad at tolerating 70 hours of blockbuster writing. On the contrary, I find myself quite immersed in the KCD2 world and really appreciate the meticulous historical details. I feel like the devs didn’t try to dumb the game down.

That’s the impression so far. I will write a more proper review when I finish the game. I’m addicted so far though."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"I love that game. The first was amazing, this is a masterpiece."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Also, 65 hours in the tutorial. My kind of gamer. I get hundreds of hours out of rpgs."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"I'd give it an 8.5/10, really solid game."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Now that’s the true RPG experience—getting lost in the world before the game even really starts. Warhorse absolutely nailed it! 👏🔥
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Good for you
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,That kinda makes me want to avoid this game at all costs. That sounds really tedious.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,How???
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,thats not tutorial map... its 1st half of the game map.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,So the tutorial area is like a massive chunk of the game then? Like a third of all the content?
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,What is the tutorial area? Around the pond?
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,What do u mean tutorial area.... u mean my past 70 hrs have been for nothing!?
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,There isn’t a tutorial area
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,"For those not in the know the game is Kill Cull Destroy 2.
\J"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-22,"Same, one day i hope to be done watching the intro cutscenes"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,I'm 82 hours in at level 21 I have yet to attend the wedding. Love this game
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,[deleted]
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"I wish I could get into RPG's, but they just don't seem to ever click with me. Only ones I ever got far in were the Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Meh its nothing special.  
It doesn't really excel at doing anything beyond just flat out tedium in all honest."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"The problem is if you spent 65 hours in the first area, you certainly won't have any competences/level to get in the rest of the game wich will perhaps became dull and boring."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Congratulations?
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,The fuck does kcd2 stand for???
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Just beat the first game and sitting here waiting for KCD2 to finish downloading
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,It pretty beautiful
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"It'll never be a game I like, just like the first. But it's also something I'll keep coming back to until I beat and then I'll say good riddance and never think about it again."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Couldn't get into cyberpunk.  I need a story to hook me immediately and an hour later still doing dumb tutorials and knowing almost nothing about my character ruined it for me
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Omg your morrowind comparison comment might have just told me.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"I really wish I could get back into melee based games, but Chivalry 2's gameplay may have ruined them forever."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Funnily, I had the same thing happen in Assassins Creed Valhalla, but yeah 10 hours instead of 65 lol. The first area is a big recreation of Norway its filled with way more stuff than you would imagine for an area that you wouldn't visit more than 2 times in your whole playthrough."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Could you not spoil by mentioning the whole goddamn name
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,My only complaint is including Death Stranding with that list of great games.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"I burnt myself out doing this. I maxed everything basically and was lv19 or 20 before the next area. Now getting there I have like 0 interest in the side quests and stuff and gambling or fighting people for 10g, when I'm sitting at 40k. Soo.. just a warning I guess, enjoy the game at a normal pace."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,How old are you that you're comparing it to Morrowind 😂
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,You could use the full games name somewhere... you have a whole description. Just drop the name already
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Can we really normalize to write full game titles? Americans have to abbreviate every little word. If you don't like speaking/writing your own language, maybe switch or change something ..."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Is this that single-player game that requires an internet connection?
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Does the first game need to be played as a requirement?
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Did they fix the god awful fighting mechanic?
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Tldr on wedding+ sequence you need ranged weapons (better both crossbow and best bow you can find) and 200 armor penetraing ammo for them and 400 cargo horse from nomads. Its basically mandatory. Other things on your preference
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Neat 

Wish I knew what KCD2 was"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"If you say it's up there with Cyberpunk , you got me on board"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"I can idle in the first zone of Dark Souls 1. Doesn't make me better Dark Souls player or cooler person tho.  
Just a giant waste of time and I fail to see a reaon to boast about it. I mean there are people max leveling up in World of Warcraft without leaving starting zone."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Trosky isn't the tutorial area. Also elden ring is shit.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,What’s with this obsession with showing people how many hours you’ve spent in a region of a game?
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,You lost me at death stranding
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Is the combat fixed. It was awful in the first game
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Weird.🤷‍♂️
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Thanks Warhorse PR.  If it's as clunky as the first one, nty."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Most gamers do not have 60+ hours to learn every single mechanic a dev decides to implement- hence my reason for giving avowed a 10/10 review and a potential GOTY award.  The mechanics are refreshing yet very fluid and smooth while the hit detection is something that very few games can get right and I think EA has gone above and beyond what combat should and can feel like if implemented properly.  IMO kingdom come deliverance combat is ancient and more similar to a 15 year old rpg you may have played called Skyrim haha.  There was like a football field gap between melee attacks or magic uses and just didn’t feel very real.  I think Avowed has managed to attract many players from the soul genre because it is very similar.  It’s rewarding when you can dodge at the perfect time and finish a 3 hit combo.  What does Kingdom come deliverance offer?  You basically just stand there and take turns attacking each other.  I think the only reason it got the reviews it did is because there was no other challenger released yet.  If perhaps Avowed was released before kingdom come would it have got that much attention?   Very doubtful.  Anyways just one gamers opinion here but definitely a 10:10 must play IMO‼️
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Hey uhhh nobody cares.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Yeahhh I completed the whole map before going to that wedding
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Too busy making potions and living my best life
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Intro mission: ""Ha! You're not coming to that wedding, you're no noble at all!""

What ends up happening: ""I'm the noblest lokking motherfucker at this wedding!"""
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"just know that ""the wedding"" is fine to do. 

the game will tell you when you are about to go into events that are ""no return"", so don't worry about it"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,"I have done both the optional parts, now off to try and find my dog. Wedding can wait."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Haven’t played the game yet but this makes me think, I’d love to see an RPG like KCD2 but let time and scheduling happen similar to real life. Rather than taking infinite amount of time to finish all of the side content before moving on with the main quest, what if there are real time days and times that events occur? A wedding is coming up, you have three in game days. Better make sure you prepare for your trip so you can be there by 4 or you’ll be late and that will have consequences. Miss entirely? Other consequences.

Could be fun to move the game along at a specific frequency and let you as a character reap the consequences for your poor planning and time management. Would also be a good excuse for you to explore the map organically rather than combing it systematically for side quests and loot. Big event is coming up in a new town? You take the journey to get there early and now you have a day to kill before the event. Might as well explore the new town and see what’s up!"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Even still, I’m honestly confused when I see posts like this. I’m 30 hours in - completed basically all the side content and explored 95% of the first map & am on to the second map. 

Truly have no clue how people have like 60+ hours in the first half of the game unless your gameplay consists of slow walking and looking at foliage for 10 hours - which, no judgement! I just don’t understand how it’s possible lol"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Really? I feel like I mucked about for a while before the wedding like 60 hours or more, but it was mostly just with silly things like killing poachers or bandits, and a handful of side quests, that basically the first half of the game?"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,40% of the game is the tutorial level?!
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"I'm enjoying the tutorial a lot but starting to lose steam. I'm way stronger than all the enemies and eager to get to the wedding. For such a large chunk of the game, it feels like nothing has happened. The stakes are really low right now. 

I'm hoping that's intentional and it's about to go nuts, but yer, starting to feel a bit fatigued on map one."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,eh more like 25%. Kuttenberg map is twice the size and has lots more quests
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Trotsky was a communist, the castle is Trosky (translates to ruins)"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"They should if theyre making a post on r/gaming

Im a pretty up to date 30yr old  gamer who had never heard of Kingdom Come: Deliverance II until maybe this week. And even then only from a random ad on Youtube. I had to actually go searching in this thread to find the name of the game because KCD2 means nothing to me. 

CoD, NFS, GoW, WoW? Theyre all established decade+ acronyms that are arguably recognisable to anyone subbed to this community. They get a pass. Games like the ones posted here dont. 

So yes, for games like this, they really should be spelt out. Otherwise half the comment section looks like this"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Thank you. I was about to comment “looks cool, wish I knew what the game was called.”"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-21,"You're lucky they even gave you the acronym. Usually posts have titles like ""65 hours in this game, still no wedding"", or ""Anyone seen a greener lusher forest than THIS GAME???""

A sort of ""if you know it you know it"" flex"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,You made the right choice. First is a gem. And it’ll just make you appreciate the sequel so much more. Stick with it.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"I’m doing the same thing. I think I’m probably 30ish hours in. Honestly there were a couple of times that I thought I would quit because I felt the game was so restrictive. It turns out that in addition to actually improving at the game, I needed to work at getting Henry better skills as well."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"I'm glad I did the same, waiting for KCD II to drop on Gog in the spring. 130 hours later, 24% of achievements accomplished and I just started getting comfortable with taking on 6 guys at a time"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"I probably should do that. 


 I bounced off after I had to keep doing stuff over again because the quick save system is kinda limited.  It wasn't always clear why everyone in the village wanted me dead.


  But I could just be less stingy, or install a mod.  The concept was cool."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,I'm sure you've figured this out in 40 hours but master strikes are absolutely necessary in combat; my second playthrough I totally forgot they existed and had a very bad time for like 15 hours
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Yeah great choice!!!
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Same, just in the first area still"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"I'm also playing KCD1 for the first time now, really enjoying it :D Although I still don't like the combat now even though I have gotten a hang of it, I feel like you get punished for not cheesing it with clinches or perfect parries. I wanna do combos cus it seemed fun but that basically just seems to mean you will risk getting parried instead.

Also not being able to get all perks when leveling, without knowing there would be a limit kinda put me off a little. Permanently locked out of some perks I wanted because I was just picking perks as soon as I got a perk point to spend not knowing that if a tree has 10 perks I might only be able to pick 8 or whatever.

Other than that I am loving the game, the most beautiful nature I've seen in a game ever I think."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,yeah I started the first one last week. amazing game. dunno how/why I slept on it for so long. It has already become one of my all time favorites
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,The second is way easier than the first. No need to play the first for understanding the mechanics.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"SAME. I could not figure out the combat at all for the first several hours, but it finally clicked in the duel with Runt."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Just got to the second area after 45 hours. Couldve done some more random exploration. 

I knew i would love the game but it has exceeded my already high expectations."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,I'm about 45 hours in and I didn't know there was a 2nd area 😯. I've gotten so much out of this game already!
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"I just hit 60 hours and I’m well ahead. A friend of mine is hours ahead of me in play time, but we behind story wise. He gets caught up in crafting and just the vibes. Different play style for us all."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Kentucky Chicken Delivery 2
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Had to come down 20 comments to even figure out what the game was.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Kingdom Come Deliverance
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,It's the precursor to the XKCD comics. Randall went a little wild in his youth.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,I'm sorry I couldn't give it sooner
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"They do a pretty great job of summarizing the main story beats of the first game, imho"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,The story isn’t overly convoluted. I’d assume there are videos under 5 minutes that explain it pretty well. 
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,I don't think you need to have played the first. Have not yet encountered anything I felt I was supposed to know from the first. Past is mentioned often in dialogues and you gain sense of what happened & from where Henry is coming from.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,The game sums it up for you but if you do finish KCD1 you get better emotional enjoyment out of KCD2
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,"The game sums it up pretty nicely. I didn't play the first game but I watched the story recap on their youtube channel, it's just about 10 minutes and it covers the whole thing so you can understand some context and flashbacks in the beginning of the game as well as some early story bits involving your parents."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,It was my #1 favorite game for a long time
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Half the time it's raining indoors too, or people are complaining about the rain but it's a lovely day. Also in the bit where you're deep in a cave with a few NPCs in the middle of a storm you can't hear a word they're saying because of the wind and rain. Other than the gripes I have with the weather and a few other things here and there that are a bit rough around the edges, it's still a solid 9/10 game for me."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"The rain effects do not look good at all, but the sound is great."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"That's what is really immersive about it. Just the way the roads are remind me of the old country roads I grew up around. The birds and all the other animals too, the clop of your horses hooves and everything, it all just sucks you right in. Then you get into some of the bigger cities and you hear cats fighting, you hear mice squeaking, dogs barking. The audio really does a lot."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,I like the lightning that illuminated my way deep in the caves.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Yeah, it's a screenshot from the game on Experimental settings. Running it through GeForceNow."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,Levelling 'drinking'? What?
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Kentucky Chicken Delivery 2
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Definitely is. Its one of those games where I count the amount of hours I can play in a day.

Otherwise, you can find spots to sleep in barns, in camp grounds and in people's houses during the day - just don't get caught sleeping. NPCs are hyper aware of your presence in KCD2 than most other games."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"If you're in Troskowitz after the lengthy introduction head on the road north of town to Tachov, it's not far. Talk to the blacksmith and he'll hook you up. From there the adventure begins. I'm about 6 hours so not far in front of you and I love it so far. It's hilarious I haven't cracked up so much from a game for a long time."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"look at your map, if the icon says lodgings you can rent a bed there, 1night or long term(forever).

there's two camps in Troskowitz if you can't afford a bed. westward from Troskowitz next to roads, hard to miss. one is south west, one is westwards.

to earn some starting groshen gather herbs and brew potions. Bozhena taught you Marigold potion which conveniently heals. nettle and marigold are everywhere. use drying shack so they don't spoil. drying shacks are in almost any settlement. there's one at the alchemy bench in the Apothecary courtyard that's available to Henry pretty much any time. although at night guards will not be happy with you so brew over day without problem. then sell to Apothecary or the General Store. and get quests and move on, explore. herbs and alchemy are always there to start you up or fund your new weapon or armour or whatever you need. don't sleep on alchemy. don't.

/edit: btw drying shacks can make dried cheese or dried meat (hint hint hunt). dried food never spoils and i aim very quickly to sustain my Henry on these."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"easiest way to get started is money wise is potion brewing, theres an herbalist with a large garden from which you can freely pick flowers and herbs, look up the merrigold decoction or another worthwhile potion and youre set for the early game moneywise"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,You can visit the miller - he'll teach you how to lockpick and pickpocket and also let you practice it to raise a few levels. (you'll also get your own bed from him)
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,It's a screenshot from the game on Experimental settings. Running it through GeForceNow
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Kingdom Come Deliverance 2
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,">Has there been any substantial improvements/changes with the second?

Imo KCD2 makes KCD1 look like a well-done tech demo. You're in for a treat once you get to the 2nd one. They refined most everything."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Yeah, the first one's combat was so atrocious I bailed after a half dozen hours or so. Don't link the look controls to the weapon direction controls."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Yeah if it's not for you it won't ever be
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"How long have you been playing? You get used to the mechanics pretty quickly if you figure them out. In addition you can use bows or crossbows, poison on weapons or arrows. On top of that you can learn to master strike, which is pretty powerful against multiple enemies. I think you just need to try to use all  mechanics that the game offers and you will get used to them pretty quickly.

If it still doesn't work then try it a couple years later maybe in a different state of mind you'll be able to get the hang of it."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,I guess walking in the forest would make you quite happy then. :)
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-20,Thank you! 🙌🙌
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"No, but you dont have to play that Story, YouTube recap it"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,"Hans better hope I don't find him, the bastard's overdue for a shpänkin."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"you can just play it on steam within 2 hours and return it, if you don't like it.

The basic introduction at the beginning takes about 30-40 minutes, so you should still have some time to explore the open world.

You basically get a demo for every game on steam, without the developer having the additional work of creating a demo. I think overall it is a great system

EDIT: and the base game is like 59 EUR, not 80 like some other titles"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Completely understand. I'm not able to move forward until I complete as many side quests as possible & level up enough to steamroll everyone.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,The NPCs are the best I've played since RDR2. Which really helps bring the world to life.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,It is for me. I've  played nothing else since its release.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Nice! Yeah, the level of freedom and how it drops you in basically goes, ""Good luck."" is very reminiscent of Morrowind imo. 

You can also play it on GeForceNow, which is how I'm playing it."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-20,"Yeah once you get the hang of the game mechanics it's so satisfying. Like learning to roll up the boss's ass on Elden Ring actually keeps you alive instead of rolling back typically. Lol
Seriously though for anyone that likes playing games fast you gotta go slow & work with the system with this one. On a side note the sounds in this game are fucking great. I've gone into a forest on a calm day & intentionally fallen asleep to the sound of the wind through the trees. Also the rain ""ting's"" on your armor & that's so fucking cool they included that."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,I love how this game can double as a medieval life sim. And allows you the freedom to figure out how to progress in imaginative ways
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-20,You can literally just blacksmith and sell stuff if you want. The game doubles as a medieval life sim.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Punishing in a different way but definitely still punishing. However, it is easier than those games imo once you understand how to play.

There’s just a lot going on and forgetting to save for awhile can cost you a lot of wasted time. I lost about 20-30 mins of gameplay early on and never made that mistake again."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"No difficulty setting, and it's punishing at first, but you eventually overcome that as you learn the game and level up your skills"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,There are mods that can make it easier if need be. Definitely not souls like (which I abhor).
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"I really bounced off the first one, but am loving this.


I'd say if Starfield's a 1, and BG3 a 10, this is a solid 8/9. That being said, it's def not for everyone- it's not a fast paced game, and def requires some patience. I'm finding that immersive though, given the setting, kinda like RDR2 in that way, which was also a fairly divisive game."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"I would say it’s pretty damn near BG3 territory. Both games have their pros and cons when comparing directly, but I’d consider it of the same caliber.

It’s nowhere close to Starfield."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"The combat in the 1st game was a good idea on paper but terribly executed. The combat in the 2nd game is great, its the same system but its been worked on extensively. 

I reccomend you get the game.

If in the end you dont like it, you could allways refund"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,I don't think it is; but some people seem to really not like it. Its not flashy or fast paced and can be clunky at times but I like how brutal it feels.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"You don't have to, it has a great intro with backstory, but it will definitely enhance the experience. I'd recommend a YT summary at the very least."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-20,"I appreciate that, thanks!"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,">!Johnny the Gobs!< shield, acquired when running favors for >!Gules!< (killing his former bandit leaders) in Sebine (after his capture)."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-20,It can run on my Steam Deck reasonably well at 30 fps.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,"I’m not sure why some people are just calling it a “tutorial” area. It’s just the first area of the game, and there is another area later on. "
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,It absolutely is if it isn't mandatory.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"The great thing is you can beeline it, too. Doesn't have to be that long if you want a more focused experience."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"I would say it is, but if you're on the fence maybe watch some YT vids. Combat is more refined but it still reminiscent of the first."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Nah, you don't, but it greatly enhances the experience. That said the intro explains the previous one nicely.

It's like W3 in the sense that its open world, but it has survival elements that some can feel are punishing. 

It's kinda like a medieval life sim with a great story that reminds me of Monty Python crossed with the Last Kingdom."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,"Unfortunately, no, it's still first person. This is photo mode."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,And there's nothing wrong with that. To each their own. 👍
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,How would he know? He just finished the tutorial. Give the man some time sheesh
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"I'd say so, but if you're on a tight budget, I'd recommend checking out some YT reviews before purchase or waiting for a sale."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Enjoy & take your time! The side quests feed into the main one in many ways. I'm definitely glad I did them before moving forward in the story.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Probably best to check out reviews or wait for a sale then. Though i have read comments from people who didn't like the first but like this one. It's basically a more refined, upgraded and on steroids version of kcd1."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Not necessary but it'll enhance the experience for sure. They have a backstory explanation in the intro that's well done
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,"Very

I haven't been this addicted to a game since Witcher 3

The Devs even said they designed it to be the spiritual successor to Oblivion."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Ditto 🤘🤘🤘
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,Yeah the wedding is just the beginning of the game from what I've gathered.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,🙌🙌🙌
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,"There's a lot more! And you've got the right idea in taking your time. You can only play a masterpiece game for the first time, once."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,"Yeah, there's a basic mechanic introduction to the game. But they do kinda just drop you in and you've gotta figure things out. Like Morrowind back in the day."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,Thanks! 🙌🙌
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,Yeah they did a really great job with the graphics. Some angles look almost photo realistic.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,Still only first person.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,Have fun!
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,"Really? You have to do that before the wedding?

I remember seeing a message pop up that said if I continued, then I’d be locked out of the main open world for a bit, but it said all side missions would be available again except for one that I’d already completed, so I moved forward with the story assuming that all side quests I hadn’t completed yet could still be done. 

Edit. Or are you just referring to the first quest related to a certain alcoholic gamekeeper? lol "
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,I did. Love how the side quests feed into the main one.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,"Nice. I'm about 77 hours in now and am still at the castle after the wedding doing the quests that pop up, before riding to the fort."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,"KCD2 makes KCD1 look like a well-done tech demo. It refines, upgrades & expands on KCD1 in most every way."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-20,I'm literally in the same boat. I've maxed a few skills already. 🤦🏻
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-21,"Then I think you're in for a treat. From the freedom of choice, to the gripping story to the way it just drops you in and basically says; ""Good luck."""
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,I hve it on ps5 it’s super smooth 60fps consistently
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,[deleted]
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"it's SO much better optimized. my rig's 7-8yo, intel i5 7600k gtx1080 16gram ssd. kcd2 runs so much smoother than kcd1, i can play on medium 1440p and i see consistently 60fps. the game runs so well!"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Nah, those survival elements are still there. I have seen people comment that they didn't like KCD1 buy like 2. Maybe wait til a sale or a do 2 hr refund from Steam."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"You have a lot of Perk Points from the Beginning. You can use them for a lot of different QoL improvements and Difficulty adjustment.

I like the Combat as it is and dont need to make it easier. But I don't like all the pointless washing and  slow walking . So i put points into getting less dirty and washing heals you for 10%, so there is a valid point now to wash yourself. I've put points into sprinting so I move faster within a town.

Sleeping isnt like every 15 Minutes, but healing and saving is mostly the main reason to sleep"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,If there are any game mechanics that kill the game for you just mod it out. 
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Lot's of side content. 65 hours is insane having played, but 25-30 hours is understandable."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"So, the first map is basically a small introduction to all systems. There isn't a major advance notice that there is more game. The first map is big. The second map is bigger. I just reached the second map and it feels like an expansion to an already finished game that could use a decent climatic ending. Instead the story and map just opens up and it's so good.

KCD1 is Oblivion on meth, 
KCD 2 is Skyrim on cocaine and Adderall"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,It’s incredibly beautiful and abundant in things to do! It’s a great game and highly recommend the first and second!
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,The 'starting area' is probably 1/2 the total area of the game.  Early on in the game it becomes basically an open world game where you can freely explore and do a bunch of exploration/sidequests if you like doing that rather than progressing the main story.  When you eventually progress the main story then you travel to a different region with its own map which contains the 2nd half of the game.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Because the ""starting area"" is literally half of the game, OP is exaggerating"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"The total game is around 50hours for just the main story and about 80-120 for everything. Less than some games like Assassin's creed Valhalla which is around 180-200hrs.

65hrs is completely excessive, most will be out within 15, if you do everything around 25-30.  I think OP was just spending extra time because everyone's learning curve is different. If you didn't play the first, might take you longer and then if you're enjoying the game you will spend time messing around, crafting/learning the mechanics etc."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,It’s not. This dude played roughly 40% - 50% of the game and is calling it the tutorial for some reason
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,I refuse to let go of W. What if I forget to tap shift and I accidently stop for a second!
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,They do not respawn.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"This is some extremely casual take on a game,

It's not a tutorial area, but a decent chunk of the game like 40ish %? It took me and my friend between 25-30 hours to complete it with all the side stuff. If you're in for just the main quest it's probably 5 hours max."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Awesome. I'm just towards the end of the wedding. Haven't completed it quite yet.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Well I personally enjoy the combat 

I'm not ""overlooking the abysmal combat"" I genuinely enjoy it 

So I Don't think there's a double standard. Im just having fun with the combat and I didn't have fun with starfield

Different strokes for different folks y'know"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Have you gone and learnt techniques such as the master strike and the perfect block? Henry's not gonna be a swordsman again without some training and most people who complain about the combat are just missing 2 pretty vital aspects.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"At least if youve tried the Witcher you have experienced one of the best! Theres obviously more and different styles, but I feel the genre might not be for you if you couldnt enjoy some of Witcher 3. Thats perfectly fine too."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"same, i tried what feels like every highly regarded rpg under the sun and they all bored the hell out of me until i tried kcd 1, and now kcd 2 is even better both in my top 5 favorite games easily,"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,This is up there with Witcher 3. I couldn’t quite do cyberpunk but I love this.. 
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,100% an overrated game.  Same with the first one.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,I can totally see that but I don't mind being overleveled. I feel more like the MC that way. All the old school JRPG's taught me to grind for hours on end before moving forward. It's a habit that stuck.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Kame Come Delivered 2
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Y'know that you can google ""kcd2"" and get your answer instantly, right?"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,"Personally, I like being over leveled. Makes it feel like the MC is an actual badass to me."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Let's just say I've played quite a few games in my time. 👍👍👍
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,No internet connection required afaik
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,It's well worth playing before the sequel. On PC.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"The intro goes over most of what happened in the first game, and there's a 10min recap of all the major events on Warhorse Studios' Youtube channel.

It certainly helps to have played the first though, a lot of the characters and their bonds grow over the course of it and that connection isn't quite the same if you didn't get to see it form."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17," No, they have an intro that explains everything. Though playing 1 will definitely enhance your experience of 2. I'd suggest watching one of those summary vids on YT."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,They say no but I disagree. The game literally starts right where the first game stopped. It's like watching The Two Towers without watching Fellowship of the Ring
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"No, not really. But it helps. There is a recap on YouTube if you just want to see what happened in the first game"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,[deleted]
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"I get that they wanted to make it more realistic, but it really spoils it for me. I love the world and the whole vibe of the game but the fighting just ruins it"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Depends on what you didn't like about it.

They made it a little easier (with lore justification that Henry's now an experienced fighter after the first game) and worked in a bunch of tweaks that the community had made from the first game's modding scene, but it's still the same system at its core."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. Direct sequel to that drawn out title part 1 from a few years ago. It’s a medieval action rpg/sim played from first person.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"It's not quite up there imo, but it is a good game. If you like sandbox games like Skyrim, you'll most likely like this as well."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Whats with being a negative nancy?
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,It's only a reference in terms of quality. The game itself plays nothing like Death Stranding except in the sense that it's open world.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,"It's a more refined version, but still similar."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"It's been refined from the first one, but if you didn't like KCD1, probably best to pass on KCD2. 

Though I've read some comments of people who didn't like 1, but like 2. Maybe wait for a sale."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Loved the first game which I got for just a dollar with all dlcs. Can't play the 2nd as I don't have a PC anymore.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,It's not. They cleaned up the jank.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"You don't need 60 hours to learn the mechanics. KCD2's tutorial is about an hour long and they show you how to do pretty much everything in that time except for using handgonnes, past that you're free to go wherever you want and do whatever you want in the first region of the game. After the first act (\~5-10 hours depending on your speed and if you ignore the side objectives, much longer if you do all the side objectives) you get the bigger map region."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"While I disagree with your take on KCD2, I cannot wait for Avowed. I absolutely loved PoE I & II. Especially as a big fan of BG I, BG II & Throne of Bhaal."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Is that the first mission? I haven’t played any of the Kingdom Come games yet but do want to. My gameplay style hasn’t changed at all over the decades, so I’m totally ready to “load up a new character in Skyrim and ignore the main plot” if that’s what it is lol"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,I feel like doing that is more rewarding though since you run into so many of your potential new friends/acquaintances from around the region when you finally move on with the main quest.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Which is for the best as it opens up mountains of extra dialogue and events at the wedding itself.

For instance a hunter, who if you do his mission first (which is hilarious anyway) will task you with trying to keep him sober at the wedding. If you do you then get a plot offshoot where he tells you why he's an alcoholic, which is really fucking sad.

And there's like a dozen of these extra *things* that apply to various extents."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Same. Wake up, gather a few herbs, make a few potions, sell them. Use the money to buy some food for me and mutt, have lunch. Buy a book or two from the scribe, read it at the tavern. Drink some booze and parlay with the locals. Play some dice until the sun goes down. Rinse and repeat."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"There have been/are games that do that. Most people (myself included) hate having a limited amount of time to explore an area. Iirc pathfinder kingmaker had a good handful of quests like that, and they ended up toning it down in wrath of the righteous because they saw that people wanted to take their time exploring."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"There are quests in game that do exactly that. Talked to some guy and he told me to meet him at sunrise. Met him the day after at sunrise and he basically went “wtf happened to you asshole I told you to meet me at sunrise, we did it all by ourselves”."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"This sort of thing sounds fun to some, sounds like a nightmare to most, and in practice is generally not very fun. 

Time limits in open-world games almost never enhance the experience."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"There were time limited quests in KCD, like Pestilence, where not doing it leads to an entire village dying of the plague."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"The Persona games are like that and really something special, I'd love to see aspects of that schedule system in an RPG like this. The immersion would be incredible."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Try Dragons Dogma 2.  It’ll scratch that itch exactly.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Posts like this have always boggled my mind. Like *how*? What exactly are you doing that takes 10+ times as long as it took me when I felt like I did everything there was to do?

I haven't played KCD2 but people post shit like this all the time. I mostly believe it just bait *oh look how good this game is because I spent XX hours doing basic stuff*.

Either that or they're just RP walking everywhere and are just really, really, really slow at doing literally anything."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"I don't get it either, I did everything there was to do on the first map in about the same as you"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"I mean, I kinda suck at the game, and I am trying to figure shit out on my own instead of using the internet. The amount of times I have died by some stupid means, is laughable. But I’m having fun figuring it out and learning organically. Probably about 30 hours in and just discovered the Miller, spent about 5 hours looking for him in Semene, before I realized the lower Semene mill wasn’t actually in Semene…. There is a lot going on in the game, and some of it is easy to miss."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"The game can be a medieval life sim tbh so it's quiet easy to spend hours just immersing yourself in the world while doing 0 progression in terms of quests. I spent 5 hours of just blacksmithing, hunting or killing bandits, selling my loot then playing dice at the tavern. Went to bed in game and repeat.

I'd also listen to npc random convos. Heard a guard getting told off by his mistress for not attending church, I think they plan to have an affair in heaven? Idk it was a weird but funny convo."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Just living in the game day to day is its own gameplay loop. Gathering herbs and brewing potions for money, or hunting, or any other of the more day to day activities is fun to do for a while.

If you're doing stuff like that between quests and just soaking it all in, it can take you as long as you want. I'm around 30 hours in and I've only just properly started going down the main quest line, with plenty of side stuff I haven't even gone near"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Slow paced meandering and inefficient exploration. It took me 15 hours in Prey before I even met another human being, and 30+ to beat the game"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Same, did everything in the first map and even rode around everywhere for the most part. I think some people just want to take their time with the mini games and just wander aimlessly. Nothing wrong with that, of course. I still once in awhile boot up RDR2 just to ride around"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Well I went to the 2nd map after \~50hrs but I did almost everything on map 1. Thieving, Stealth, Alchemy, Crafting and a couple others are lvl 30, got the explorer perk from Scholarship to uncover the whole map + all poi's and went to 90% of them. I did a lot of archery contests and the dice game as well. Never fast traveled too. So yeah, this is how to get 50hrs, a least for me."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Same.. but then I realized that a lot of my skills are only 18+ out of 30.  A lot of these folks are probably spending an extra 20 hours maxing out.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,I must pluck the poppy...
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Well, I lost a lot of progress because of a bug where pebbles disappeared, and it took me hours to find and reload the correct file before the bug happened.

And maybe others, like me, pause the game on the map, which I think goes into the played hours, and I do that a lot"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,Same. I’m exactly 30 hours in and nothing left in trosky
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,">Truly have no clue how people have like 60+ hours in the first half of the game unless your gameplay consists of slow walking and looking at foliage for 10 hours - which, no judgement! I just don’t understand how it’s possible lol

Because a lot of players focus on crafting and/or playing the game as a medieval life sim. 

The game's crafting is very well designed and fun, and it's also intentionally time consuming. It takes about 1 minute to brew a batch of potions, and players who enjoy Alchemy can go through that process hundreds of times. Blacksmithing takes <5 minutes to forge something, and again players who enjoy it can make hundreds of items. All that time adds up.

As for the medieval life sim, there are players who roleplay the life of a hardworking commoner instead of a questing knight.

People are taking a long time to get past the first area because they're in no hurry to complete the story and they're just enjoying the game."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"The difference between 30 hours and 60 could easily be down to two things:

1. Not using fast travel.
2. Not saving very often and dying occasionally, losing hours of progress. 

I just did the wedding quest and am at 45 hours played, but I know at least 3 of those hours were lost due to various deaths from me doing stupid shit without saving first. I also know I spent many hours just walking between towns to sell my inventory full of bandit gear to the 3 or 4 vendors who would buy it, but needing to wait multiple days for their cash to replenish. I mean I don't *need* ~7,500 groshen, but damned if I am not going to sell every bit of gear and horse I find. 

It's also very easy to think you've completed a whole area, without actually doing so, since a lot of side quests have no map markers at all. Random quests you get from talking to random people at taverns or along the road for example won't get a marker until you've spoken to them. So unless you systemically talk to every person, every time you see them, you likely missed more than you realized. Even random descriptions of past events in books can lead to some item buried somewhere in the woods that the game gives you no marker for. 

I can easily see myself having spent 60 hours before doing the wedding quest. I haven't even really gotten into archery, hunting, dice, or potion making at all."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Im 40 hours in and still doing side quests in the first area and still have some to do. I think you missed something. Not all side quests are shown through marker on the map but by talking to the people.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Yeah I'm with you. 45 hrs, doing all side content and even taking time to explore. I'm (probably) almost done with all of the Kuttenburg side quests. Still have a few left on the map, but I've done most of them I think"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"See, for me, it’s the opposite.

Take Balders Gate for instance, people say that it has a 60 hour playtime or whatever and I had 200 hours logged on it by the time I finished.  A chunk of that is AFK.  But it’s not 100 fucking hours of being AFK.  Maybe 30 all combined. I just have no idea how people can actually storm through these kind of games so quickly lol

Are you skipping cut scenes? Are you reading subtitles and jamming past the spoken lines?  Are you skipping all side quests? Do you have it on the easiest difficulty? 

Like genuinely, I have no idea how people can complete these games so quickly and still enjoy them."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"12/32 main quests, 17/39 side quests"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Basically, people are jokingly calling the first map the tutorial, as on the second map you become a small fish in a big pond after you had just reached BIG fish status on the previous one."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"...

No."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,A lot happens in the story quests
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"12/32 main quests, 17/39 side quests

Do the math"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,I tried playing the first but had huge technical difficulties.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"So the first is were you absolutely must learn everything and it's ment to be hard because you are a true idiot! 

But given time you become better by just doing things!

The second game people are stating it's easier than the first but seem to forget that the main character has already learned some of these things such as combat and alchemy and reading! So the game play should be a bit easier based on his experience from the first game!"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"I tried the first for maybe a couple hours and just couldn't get on with the controls, I don't think I got passed the tutorial"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,That's what she said
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,😏
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"It’s worth downloading a mod that lets you save whenever. Some “purists” will bitch that you’re ruining the immersion but honestly it’s a single player game, you shouldn’t have to ruin your own enjoyment just to be immersive."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"I feel like I can't swing a single time without the opponent countering me with a parry, let alone landing a 3-5 hit combo with them just blocking. How do you complete the master strikes without the opponent parrying?"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,All I’ll say is you’ve not seen anything yet. The 2nd area is even bigger
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Mmm chicken
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Agreed this shit is annoying. Not all gamers are permanently online.

1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"they also completely ignore the rain and carry on with whatever activities they were doing as if it's not raining, which is pretty weird considering in the first game they would take cover and seek shelter from rain"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"The steam effects when you are blacksmithing seem so horribly low quality, but it hasn't ruined any of the fun for me. Just reminds me that I am playing a game."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,The rain effect literally reminds me of GTA Definitive edition. But as you said the sound is great. Walking in a forest when it rains & thunder in this game is straight up eargasm
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Rain looks great during the day and terrible during the night, for some reason."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,"When your drunk townsfolk will comment and I don't want my rep to go down. So I drink and drive my horse around.

1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"You rock, sir. I guess I'm heading north next time I play. Thanks!"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,">It's hilarious I haven't cracked up so much from a game for a long time.

Right? They nailed the humor while still remaining serious. Like a mix between Monty Python & Kingdom of Heaven. The opening cinematic shots are excellent."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Omg

I have laughed out loud to just about everything Hans has to say."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,I felt so stupid when I went back and actually opened the chest in the room the Blacksmith gives you
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Would add on that crafting the bearded axe (you can buy the recipe at the blacksmith) is another way to make easy money. Also playing dice aint so bad once you get the hang of it or have enough loaded dices for easier wins.

The fastest way to make money once you're comfortable with fighting is repairing looted armor with the kit and reselling them. Doing this also levels up your crafting skill as well. However, I wouldnt recommend this method if you dont want to break the economy and make money meaningless in the long run"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,I don't know why but my Henry can be sustained on stolen honeycombs and those are all over.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Accidentally fixes the ""no bed"" problem too. There's a skill that gets energy and stops hunger from rising while doing alchemy. Combine with ""dark arts"" and every night turns into a money printer."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Personally i don't think it's bad per se, but it feels disjointed and the combat style i think would be amazing if we lived in a world where motion controls caught off, but with a mouse and keyboard isn't intuitive enough to get a smooth experience imo."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-20,"lol I told myself I was going to go to sleep at a decent time, ended up riding my horse everywhere and enjoying the scenery and get drunk with the nomads"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,I think that’s what made it click for me. Where I looked at less like a traditional rpg and played it as a medieval sim and it made sense
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,I never seen to realize if I hate or like a game within a two hour window though. It always comes after that opportunity has passed lol.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Fair enough thanks friend
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Thanks buddy! I didn’t finish those before a certain series of events (don’t want to spoil if you’re not there) precluded me doing so but I bet he’s still out in the world with that shield somewhere and I can find him and take it
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Oh so things are pretty realistic (i.e. no monsters or wild shit)?

I actually was always interested in a medieval type game that didn't have goblins and weird monsters flying at your ass.

Just read in a review that while hunting a rabbit, somebody cut their finger and bled to death...damn this game might be TOO real."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Well 65 hours in, he should at least have a slight opinion"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,That's my strategy for most games and all rpgs. Rattle off most if not all the side quests before moving on.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Yeh ill wishlist for now. Thank you for the info.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,I have the game free on EGS so figured I'd ask. Looks like the new one has a lot of upgrades and generally overall a better game I just have so limited time to play that I have to be choosey. Thanks.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-25,Oof it's a wild ride. Ups and downs. Highs and lows. Rewards and frustrations. Liking it so far.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,That’s very exciting news. Thanks for the reply
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Perfect, was debating pc or PS5 but it might be the perfect game for on the couch!"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Amazing cheers! Can't wait to give it a go
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Amazing thanks! I can deal with a teeny bit of jank/bugs in any game but when it's badly optimised it throws me off so that's great to hear!

1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,RPG's used to be 70-80 hours minimum if you powered through it without side quests and such.  Games have gotten a lot shorter these days (or am I just pulling a 'in my day' card).
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"A lot of it was time spent traveling - I don't use fast travel much. Plus all side quests, leveling up alchemy, smithing, taking out bandits, experimenting with NPC AI, taking screenshots and just plain wandering. When I find a game that really clicks with me I like to take my time."

1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"I'm aware the genre isn't really for me, I just wish it wasn't. Feels like I'm missing out"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"A peer to Witcher 3? That's a really bold claim. That game is about as close to a perfect 10/10 as you can get.

KCD2 is amazing, but I think the jury is still out on whether it is on that pedestal with games like Witcher 3 as one of the all-time greats."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Imo it's not as great as W3 when it comes to writing, characters, or quests, but still very good."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Really eh?  I thought this game was big sword skirmishes / battles, didn't know there was an actual story lmao"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Thank you
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,"oh cool! I must have gotten this game confused with a different one I saw people complaining about. I've heard SO many great things about this, but that was kind of a deal killer for where I live. Maybe I'll have to just get it to join in on the fun."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Then its a hard pass. Which is a shame, I loved everything except the fighting."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Actually not really realistic. For dueling its fine, but when you are assaulted by 4 enemies at once you do NOT execute form perfect strikes found in a manuscript on DUELING."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,i say KCD has way more RPG than CP2077. even Witchers are action adventures sliced with RPG elements.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,“Wait for a sale” is usually the best advice for people who reply to Reddit threads on games (and generally great advice if youre not a solid fan of the product); I’ve been on both sides. The recent Dragon Quest III remake was amazing and  even at full price probably my favorite buy of the year. Easily got my moneys worth personally but for most people would still recommend to wait for a sale.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"GeForce now if you got it, can play on a tv, I haven't done it but it showed up on mine. So I believe mobile can too. Just need a controller to connect."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"I'm playing it on GeForceNow. Worth checking out, imo. Being able to play on Experimental settings is fantastic."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Eh, they cleaned up SOME of the jank. 

The combat system is still pretty whack. There was literally a post on the kingdom come sub the other day of a guy smacking someone sitting down with their sword repeatedly, without doing a single shred of damage. 

I love KCD, and now KCD2, but let's not pretend that it is better than it is."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"yeah you get out of the intro section which is 2-3 hours long in itself, if you dont rush through it and get to roam the map freely and do whatever you want, your first quest is to get a wedding invitation of a local noble and attend the wedding which can be done in another like 4 hours if you really go for it, i personally went there at around 45 hours, theres so much shit to do and explore on the first map its crazy and the second gets even wilder from all ive seen so far"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Basically yeah, once the prologue is done and you get access to the open world your first main quest is finding a way to go to the wedding

Its literally like when you exit the cave in skyrim and are told to go to Balgruuf"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"It's exactly what it is, the first game has it too but it's just one town. This time it was a whole map of basically tutorial and side missions that were all pretty good before unlocking a second bigger region"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"After completing the prologue, the game opens up the first region completely and gives you two branching main quest paths with the end goal of getting to a wedding. Eventually you'll need to do the main quest in order to access the second region, but the main quest is actually quite good unlike Skyrim"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,+ there's some side quests that become inaccessible when you do certain main quests
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Totally. The side quests and tasks are all great. Very meaty and in depth.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,“Capon? Who tf is that?”

1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"I think for me specifically I tend to be a completionist, so I tend to stay away from big open games that I end up taking tons of time to complete. Being limited by time with an encouragement on multiple playthroughs could help people like me experience things in a more emergent way I think."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,The executioner's sabotage quest was timegated as well. If you couldn't get things done in a week you failed the quest
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Oh man, maybe I need to…"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Some people just don’t want things to end. I know I way overstayed my stay on cyberpunk and Witcher because I loved the worlds so much so I just delayed out the process. That’s how I felt at least. Did it too with baldurs gate 3. Get near the end of a play through? Time to explore more lol
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Can't speak for most but my slow crawl has been the deliberate walk between locations while overweight to build strength stat. Very slow but there's a ton to appreciate.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"For real lol. And it’s always the same replies from the OPs in the chat being like “I just like to take my time” “immersion” 

Take my time = like forced slow walking back and forth around the entire map lol. I just don’t get it and sometimes I legit have a hard time believing it tbh lol"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"You can play stealthily which easily makes the game 2x as long compared as when you go sword swinging + the game is heavily gameplay system based as are for example immersive sim gamers, so for example you can play a dice minigame but there are opponents that have cheating dice pieces and that way pretty much always win against you, so you can follow them to their homes, wait till they go sleep, then sneak inside their home and take all their dice pieces or atleast those used for cheating and some money and the next day when they will play again the same minigame, you can now use their own cheating dice pieces against them and win their remaining money

And there are a ton of situations like this in the game and you can play with them how ever you want.. so you can easily have dozens and dozens hours played in the first area without doing basically any quests"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,I saw someone say they had 510 hours in AC Valhalla and hadn't beaten it yet. Like how? I'm a solid chunk into the main game at just 18 hours and I cannot imagine doing the side stuff I'm skipping taking anymore than another dozen hours or so.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"It’s always weird to me how people try to flex spending so many hours on one game. 

Especially new releases. Like bro, just because you put in 200 hours in the first month of the newest cod does not mean you’re even any good it."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"I didn't know about fast travel, and I couldn't afford no horse :("
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Personally I try to avoid fast travel wherever possible and enjoy the day to day 'jobs' of the game very much.

I sunk a lot of time into the first KCD game and I am keen to make my first playthrough of the sequel the best and most immersive I can.

So that means spending days working, blacksmithing, drinking in the inns, playing Farkle, bedding down at night and so on. 

I've not long done the Wedding and am in the next stage at around 45-50 hours and I haven't even done the Miller's plotline yet. 

This is a game that allows you to meander and take your time and often rewards you for it!"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"> oh look how good this game is because I spent XX hours doing basic stuff.

Honestly, posts like this turn me off to those kinds of games. It's very imitating and I don't have that kind of time to devote to this one game. If I'm 60 hours into a game, I should be close to finishing it, not still at the start."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,The average person is just awful at video games.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Poisoning every food pot without getting caught.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Some people, such as myself, are terrible at video games and die alot."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,"I dont fast travel. I like walking instead of horse back as I understand the roads and lay of the land better. You take your time with all dialogue. You RP appropriate times to eat, change clothes, clean, and sleep. You dont rush to quest markers on the map but instead encounter them naturally. You play with photo mode, explore, or loot camps. You slowly work your way through side quests and only engage with main quest when it fits into your story. You spend time blacksmithing, alchemy, playing dice, theiving, or practicing combat. Lots of stuff can easily put you over the 40 hour mark before the wedding"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-20,"Maybe they just die a lot, with the save system it's easy to lose hours of progress. I lost two hours of progress yesterday"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,I honestly think this subset of people have something akin to the opposite of ADD. Like dude progress the damn game. The cyberpunk sub is full of some really crazy people who dress their V in sweats the moment they get into Vs apartment and will RP just lounging before going to bed for the day or quitting the game
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,">Posts like this have always boggled my mind

they really shouldn't, especially not when they are about a game that lets you craft and hunt and all sorts of other stuff while you have to plan your activities and trips because you only have so much energy before t you need to rest your character. Yesterday I've spend 4hrs hunting for better  bow and agility skills and everything else that makes you have to rest because you are tired and/or travel back to town to sell meat before it spoils. Some activities just take time and it is up to you how much you're gonna spend with it. I love the game for it."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,You did every quest there is to do before the wedding in 6 hours?
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Yeah like no disrespect to OP or anyone else taking their time. I just honestly wish I had the time and ability to enjoy shit like that lol, but I just don’t. 

It was the same thing I remember hearing about BG3 when it came out. People claiming on Reddit to have spent 100 hours in act 1 which is just insane to think about lol."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Are you playing without using your hud/map? Because yeah if you’re going off of NPCs instructions it would be torture lol
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Makes sense honestly, as I said - no judgement either way. Really just happy for the devs seeing how many people are loving their time with it."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Fair point! Well written and answered my question. Award well deserved
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Yeah I checked the wiki and it seems like I got all but one, which is the stupid glitched quest that fails without warning. But must be missing something! Ah well"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-20,Right there with ya. My first BG3 run was around 200 hours.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,I guess I did put a lot of time into it.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,?
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"I had 115hrs into the first and encountered a game breaking bug with the main story. Just started it again on a new save and it's been wonderful despite the game showing its age. May be worth a go again for you.

Edit: my first playthrough was at launch, so fingers crossed most bugs like that have been dealt with by now."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Never liked the combat in the first one and also the inability to save-spam. I'm a grown ass adult and not a 13 year old with 12 hours per day of free time.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Yea it swayed me off playing on xbox was brutal to me it didnt help I played the first one like the first week but im absolutely loving the 2nd one
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Yeah, exactly. The sequel is a little more accessible for those lore reasons. But it’s also interesting to see the evolution of Warhorse and their ambition. It’s truly a rags to riches story of an unlikely studio persevering with their vision."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"I hated it until I realized it's intentionally difficult to show Henry is kinda dumb and inexperienced.  The combination of you learning how the game works,  and upgrading skills makes him smarter and in many ways the game easier. The fighting, for example,  you learn the moves and get better at using them,  and as Henry learns more,  more moves become available,  expanding the combat and making it more interesting and fun to play."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Keep trying. Unlike most every new game out there this one teaches you by punishing you when you're wrong. If you persevere you'll get it down and get whipped by the next level and so on. It's a tough but extremely rewarding game. It also has an amazing story to boot.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"On one hand, a couple of perks in alchemy trivialize the saving issue, on the other hand, if it's capable of being trivialized, what's the point in the first place?

I get what they were going for, and I've accepted that's just the way the game is, but it's ultimately just silly. The game does need to auto save more often than just at every quest update though. The game takes away your items enough times that I'm forced to rely on the autosaves, which can mean losing 30+ minutes of progress because I made a mistake or didn't understand a mechanic correctly."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Mods for herb pickup and quick saving is well worth it
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"First thing I did was get quick save mod

Bro playing stalker 2 and then going to Kingdom come that shit is must


Give gamers their checkpoints ffs


Especially when choices matter"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"If I was playing the game a year after release, I may have kept the default save system. But I played the day of release, and I've been burnt too much by buggy new releases not to save the game every 10 seconds so I immediately installed a mod to save for free. Impressively, I've not had any crashes or soft locks 40 hours in, but I was not taking chances with a new release"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Hmm. I might have to do that.  I've been doing 'save and quit' to be able to save when I want since that still works when you don't have any snahps.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Master Strike isn't a combo (well it might be I don't remember all the combo names) but it's a mechanic where basically if you perfect block at the very beginning of the window for a perfect block, you'll also counter attack and the counter is unlockable by the opponent. Basically you gotta do a PerfectER  Block. 

In the second game it's much easier to pull off as all you have to do is attack at any time during the perfect block window instead of block, but it's more dangerous because if you mistime it you'll be stuck in an attack animation with your opponent's weapon coming at you

Edit: see link

1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,So the first map is just the first area? Then there’s another bigger map and area? Holy smokes.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Can you go back to the first area? Or are you locked out?
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Why should I have to google something that should be contained in the OP.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"No prob and good luck! 

Piece of advice - find Mutt sooner than later and when you find >!Pebbles!< try to use as little fast travel as possible with her..."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Its a learning curve for sure, but it plays into the theme of both games, Henrys kind of an idiot. Theres also some mechanics you learn that improve it a lot and make it work quite well KBM"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Aha, well, as someone who HATED the combat in the first game, i got right into this iteration of the combat system and it feels great!"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,No problem 👍👍
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,No prob and good luck!
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"On the other hand, one could say that if he's got 65 hours in, the answer to whether the game is worth it or not would be yes."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"In Trosky, before the wedding?"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"The entire game is a 70-100 hour experience, we're talking about the intro area."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"I finished Skyrim in like 9 hours my first playthrough, some people took like 100+. RPGs. Meanwhile in BG3 I've got like 100 hours between different characters and never actually made it more than halfway thru act 3. 

Variability has always been around depending on how you play."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"KCD2 and the first game feel very much like games that were made to be taken their time with. I want to explore everything, ask around in villages, see where it all takes me. Just finished a good old knees with up with Vakos. Think I'm still in-game hungover. I don't plan on going to the wedding any time soon."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Yes exactly, you were enjoying at your own pace. The tutorial is no where near 65hours of actual play. But when you enjoy a game ,you can always find hours to sink into.

My friend really enjoyed LOTR mines of moria and spent over 300hrs just gathering materials, building bases, moving bases and enjoying the land/scenery etc. I spent like 40hrs in the game was done with it."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,how is it buggy and unresponsive? I've had no issues with it but theyre very vague complaints
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Have you tried some games that are kind of adjacent? I personally loved Star Wars Fallen Order as an in between RPG/action. At higher difficulties its a Soulslike, at normal or easy its a fun 3D platformer with fun combat. The Arkham (Batman) games also come to mind, so does Deus Ex. Not too large of an open world and easy to get a grip on in terms of gameplay systems, all while having a good story"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,"I will admit, I have only played around 30 hours on KVD2 so far, so you’re right. But so far, I would say it’s up there with Witcher. 

But KCD2 is slower, and that’s something I really enjoy. I also think some of the side quests are longer and more interesting than in the Witcher (so far). 

It’s only a few weeks since release so I’m sure it will be better with a few patches. I do believe this is a game I’m going to replay a few times. 

But main point is that one should be careful rating a game after 30 hours. But still, I have had a blast for 30 hours :)"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,The battling is like... 10% of the experience. It's mostly story and side content. The battles are mostly small skirmishes at most.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"This has movie quality story, acting, directing. It's top tier."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,"If you're a fan at all of RPGs, it's a must play imo. I'm almost 80 hrs in at this point and still haven't left the first, smaller map."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,if you're assaulted by 4 enemies in real life you are dead
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"I was talking more about the games in general and not specifically about the RPG aspect, but I see where you're coming from. I really like the varied gameplay approaches of Cyberpunk, KCD2 is rather limited due to it's realism there, but it offers a lot of other sandbox elements to make up for it. Hard to say."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"It is better though, not perfect, but much much improved. It'd be disingenuous to say it's as bad as the first by any metric."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,I think you may have personally sold me on the game. Contact the devs to make sure you get your cut of money linked to my purchase.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,'first' map? What? There is more?
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"23 hours in and had a feeling the wedding invite would open it up even more, glad to know so I can keep on enjoying all the side activities"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Excuse me but what do you mean FIRST FUCKING MAP?? 


This game just gets better every second"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,First map? FIRST MAP? THERE IS MORE THAN ONE?
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,What do you mean.. 2nd map?
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Are time-gated quests not a thing in this game? I remember in the first game you could miss or fail certain quests if you weren’t in the right place at the right time and that used to stress me out so much
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,There is more than one map?
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,">second gets even wilder from all ive seen so far

I literally had to stop taking quest requests after the 9th one. This game is wild. Not a single fucking fetch quest either. I am in *heaven*"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"There is a lot less connection with villages and groups in the second map, with most of the real meat being in Kuttenberg. The first map is much more charming IMHO."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,I raged died a million times until I learned certain enemies requires better gear/stats. Was damn near uninstalling untill I realized I was just going too far lol
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Basically, the next part is to LET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOOR"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Can you still go back to the first region and do all the side quests that you missed after unlocking the second one?
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,Sounds like The Witcher 3
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Getting absolutely hammered with some new friends and falling off a cliff in the dark trying to bring stolen hooch back to them after I lost my torch and designated walking buddy.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"I think Cyberpunk was the only RPG I ever played at a slower pace than normal, because I would drive everywhere. I never used the fast travel. I actively went back to my home to sleep to try and play as much as I could at night. Because night city, at night, looks incredible. Even then I saw people posting gametime to complete that was 5x it more mine and I had cleared every gig, side quest and story mission. I really don't know what people do."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"You're *really* missing out if you go from A to B to C in every video game, I did that for about 15 years. I really enjoy slow sessions now at times; You don't rush through and miss things and you aren't slightly anxious from rushing. It's a completely different mental state to actually take in the surroundings and look for secrets, loot, story bits told through scenery, or whatever there is in the game.

Bonus, taking it slow generally prevents me from 100% tunnel visioning and playing too long, forgetting to eat, not noticing stuff happening at home, etc."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"The whole reason I play video games is so I don’t have to do mundane, meaningless shit like traversing over empty plains."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"i mean, fair enough, being really bad at the game can also take a lot of your time"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"So, uh... if you read my post...

>I haven't played KCD2"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"People are just different speeds. Pretty sure i did 60 hours in bg3 act 1. I did almost everything but didn't dawdle or anything. Generally the times on howlongtobeat are WAY lower than i took to beat the game, I'm not even sure why."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"I’m using them, but it’s definitely a learning curve from other games… It took me this long to figure out BG3 as well. I’m a more casual gamer, and certain things obvious to some just goes over my head since I don’t play too many rpgs. So to answer the question of how it can take so long, being bad at the game or dumb definitely adds some hours to the early game."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-20,Thank youuuuuuu lol
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"You literally haven't played any of the story quests, ofc it feels like nothing happened. That's where everything that matters happens"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,NGL this comment is hilarious with how non-chalantly you recommend spending 165 hours to replay the game
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"People downvoted you, and that's such a shame. I don't like to tell people ""keep trying"" when a game doesn't click, but I DID persevere to engage with this game and with Outer Wilds, and both times I'm so glad I did it."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Yea a lot of the decisions felt line inconveniences for the sake of having inconveniences, all under the pretext of being “immersive”. 


And don’t get me started on the janky ass combat system"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Oh man how could I forget! The quick herb pickup was a godsend. I could not stand the animation every damn time. That was probably one of my biggest reasons for not touching alchemy at first, I just couldn’t be bothered dealing with that damn animation every single time."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Seriously man. Like, respect the player’s time."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"KCD 2 has a lot of autosaves, but you'll want the Saviour Schnapps for periods where you aren't doing quests.

But you'll get autosaves for each update in a side mission or main story quest. 

Personally, I only really wanted more saviour schnapps in my first 5 hours of playtime. Mostly because I ran into a badass knight after 5 minutes and he beat me into pieces and I felt too hurried to lay down and rest. And I couldn't afford any healing items, which meant that every combat encounter was a 1 hit run for quite a while."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Quick flower picking, archery crosshair, and save without savior shnaps were so helpful for the first game.

After two play throughs I'm much better trained for the sequel without mods."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,That’s how I managed to get through Hardcore mode in KCD1 lol
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,I just use the console to cheat in saviour schnapps
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Oh. That's the only way I do damage currently. I was thinking the master strikes were the combos you unlock by leveling up your sword stat. The counter strikes or master strikes seem like they're so easy to pull off but do not do very much damage. I'm just sitting there waiting for the opponent to strike, and then I poke them a bit with the master strike."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,And a huge ass city
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Yes. You can travel back and forth between them as well, tho it costs 200 groschen to pay a wagon to take you"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Yes, you can go back. Altho it costs 200 groschen to pay a wagoner to take you."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"""I'm too lazy to take 1 second and google the 3 letter acronym.""

1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Who says it should be? I googled it and found out what it meant in 7 seconds.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"I don't even want another horse, >!Good Old Pebbles!< is my ride or die!"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Yeah, I get that, which is also why I didn't say the gameplay is bad because it's deliberate and it works into that context. 
It's just REALLY hard for me to get into it which is a shame because I love the ""rural/countryside"" setting."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Interesting cause I see many threads saying the opposite.

1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"You are completely right. Dragon Quest XI was my longest “linear” RPG and I 100%ed it in 92. Witcher 3 took 100. No way the intro takes 65 in this

Quick edit: But as my fellow commenter rightfully pointed out, its epic whenever you find a game you can sink endless hours into. Enjoy the experience :) its not always about rushing to the end."

1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Which I didn't. I said it wasn't without jank. YOU made the statement that it wasn't, a verifiably false statement."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"just make sure you know when to quit when playing farkle and dont haggle with the bathhouse wenches, thats just disrespectful considering the services they provide and other than that have fun

btw the first game can be had for 10> euros with all dlcs if you want a more economical entry into the series"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,You mean all the groschen
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Make sure to play the first one, though. There's basically no reason not to. And even though the second one is awesome, I think some things are still better in the first one. The country bumpkin to the valiant knight progression of the first game is hard to match. They kinda failed to replicate it in the second game, you can get to a stage when you're undefeatable 5-10 hours in, and for the rest of the 120 hours you get some upgrades, yeah, but they don't feel meaningful because you're a killing machine already. That's one of the very few things I would criticize in the second game, because in the first game that rags to riches power progression was the biggest part  of the fun and it's just not there.

Also, storywise it makes no sense to skip the first one because everything that happens  in the second game is a direct continuation of the events of the first. It literally continues from the ending scene of the first game."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"oh yeah trosky is only the first third of the game, kuttenberg the other two thirds"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"You should visit /r/kingdomcome. There are bazillion memes about ""It's been XXX hours and I'm ready to go to the wedding."""
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"The map you Play on after the intro Sequence (trosky) is one of two maps the Game has and represents roughly one third of the content of the game, the second map kuttenberg will be unlocked after you finish all main quests in trosky and Gives you a significantly larger map with two thirds of the games main and sidequest content"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,There still Are time gated quests but very few and far between and the ones i had as of now were almost impossible to fuck up because of time
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Yes. There are like 1-2 quests that you might miss but most aee doable aftee
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Haha I just did that quest a few days ago and fell off a cliff as well!!  I moved very slowly afte that and used my torch to see as best I could. Sorry you lost yours!
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Tbh with rpgs i never fast travel or do so very rarely. With CB77 i never did, same with TW3, same with RDR2 (how could you???). Good maps are just nice to be in.

No fast travel added a lot of time in to RDR2 tbf. Made it so i was doing like actual hour long journeys once you faftor in random encounters and looking around."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"most of the additional time is ""can i do this thing?"", in KCD 2 specifically i basically reloaded bunch of time just so i can try whats gonna happen if i do the quest in different way, what if i kill an NPC, what if i pick different dialogue option etc.

when i was learning the combat system i picked two bandits random encounter and keep reloading the fight untill i was comfortable with it

also i spent a lot of time stealing clothes from housemaids and other female servants and replacing them with noblewomen clothes - except for Katherine (who is hardcoded into her blue dress) you can basically change the clothes of NPC, i gave Bara new gold dress from Kuttenberg that i stole from Vavaks wife lmao

anyway there are a lot of shenanigans you can do in the game and watch how the world reacts, and it will get even better with future mods

dont reduce your playthrough to just playing the game"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"oh for sure. And the older I get, the more I realize how infrequent a game of this quality comes along. You only get to play a game like Skyrim, Baldur's Gate 3, or KCD2 for the first time once. Slow down and enjoy the ride."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"That’s how I feel too personally, but I get that some people like the immersion and what not - more power to them I suppose!"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,So I'll have played 40% of the game but none of the story quests. Okay.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Hah, yeah, it does read like that. Not suggesting anyone else do that, but I'm about 25hrs in the new game and caught up to where I was in the last one, just didn't run around exploring and messing with everything like the first time. 

Also could have picked up at my previous save but it's been 7 years and I forgot most of the story so I wanted to refresh myself."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"You start picking up like ten square feet of herbs after a few level ups, like everything in the game it gets easier the more you do it."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"It was just so much worse due to the jankiness of the game.  I would be walking through a forest, fall 6 ft to my death because a rock was covered and lose an hour and a half of game. 

Really enjoyed what I played but I just don’t have the free time to be redoing that much"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,I don’t mind the saving but cross hair and faster picking sound very nice
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Is the sequel similar in terms of saving? I heard the pacing was better.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"It's so easy to get belladonna and Nettles though. Between the herbs / alchemy and what the shops sell, I haven't had a problem."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,On console I literally just quit to the main menu and reload. Takes 5 seconds and saves the game automatically lol
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"If your Warfare and chosen weapon skills are high enough the master strike should be enough to ""stagger"" your opponent for follow up strikes. Not like physically stagger, but if you get past an opponent's guard in either game it takes them a second to get it back up. Sort of like in the early game when you fuck up a perfect block and just get wailed on for three or four strikes; opponents experience something similar"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Sorry that I expect posts on reddit to at least contain the actual name of the game they are in regards to.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Ok il make you a deal, il buy and gift it to you on Steam and if you do end up enjoying it you can pay me pack with a gifted game of similar price. 

And if you end up not liking the game then you owe me nothing. 

What do you say?"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Pretty normal playtime then. We were talking about the madlads that have spent a lot of time exclusively before the wedding.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,It doesn’t but that doesn’t mean it can’t.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"It depends on your playstyle. You can move through KCD2 quick or, alternatively, spend a lot of time on side content. One commenter in another thread stated they saw a streamer brew potions for 5 hours straight."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,womp womp
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Oh no, definitely not. It's a full blown story RPG."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"And all I said initially was that they cleaned up the jank- not that it's perfect, it's a very playable experience- especially compared to the first game. I don't think I made any strange claim there that needed argument.

I'm not trying to be combative here."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"I quit when my score total is what is needed to win.

That's how to play Farkle when you roll 6 3s every time."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,They have Farkle in the game???? I’ve owned the real life version for over a decade and like it more than Yahtzee.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"The only appropriate way to haggle with the bath wenches is by giving them more money. 

Its only a few more groschen and I consider it a tip."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Fuuuuuuck.

I'm still in the first area then. Not been to the wedding and just doing the Smithy's quest. Which lead to another and another and another. I'm like 70 hrs in now."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Goddamn. I just attended the wedding. 45h in. Just got my horse LMAO
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Can you go between them later? I have so much stuff to do here...
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"?? What?

Dude, I wasn't even talking about that. I was just surprised that that massive ass map wasn't the only one in this game."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Wait what?! You mean it gets bigger 😆 no way
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Fantastic news
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,"You're so right. I fantasize about technology like what is in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, being able to delete games from my memory so I can play them for the first time again. 


I've been turning mini maps off, and sometimes HUD elements or the whole thing, and it really adds to that feeling. It's almost like playing games in the '90s again. I really think it's all the extra info and handouts that ruin current games. 


Like you're going through the motions instead of exploring and experimenting. So many games will show you a floating in-game icon at your destinations for the entire game, what's the point?"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,It sounds like you've been intentionally dodging the story quests
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Well no, the story quests are part of the 40%"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"The game had two maps, (you CAN go back) with the second map gated by Story. A lot of people seem to naturally gravitate doing all the side content in map 1 before any of the plot, in effect you have done 40% of the side content and 10% of the main. Once you hit 40% of main the rest will unlock."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"I’m aware, but that doesn’t really do anything to deter from the fact that it’s a massive pain to start off with. That’s like telling someone “I know the game sucks but it gets really enjoyable after the first 8-10 hours.”  It’s not a good selling point 😂"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"The sequel has a lot of autosaves for each update in main story and sidemission quests. If you end up roaming around the countryside and doing nothing in regards to the quests, you will either need to sleep in a bed you own or the schnapps. 

Personally, I haven't needed the saviour schnapps after the 6 first hours. Though I do keep a small stack on hand, with the alchemy skills the stronger versions do give you a solid buff.

As for pacing and stuff, the sequel is a lot faster and more streamlined in nearly every aspect of the game. All for the better, in my opinion. I really liked KCD1, but there was a lot of unnecessary jank that has been removed or iterated upon."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"I ranked Alchemy to 30 before I discovered where I could start blacksmithing.

Soooo many perfumes."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"I can usually get a hit in if they're not too far away after a master strike, but after landing one strike, the opponent usually blocks the next, or even parrys or master strikes me back. I wanna say I can get a combo in 5% of the time. I feel like I'm not positioning correctly or something.

I'm using exclusively shortsword and shield using the short sword combos from the level up perks. In KCD 1 i should specify."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"It's literally in the title: ""KCD2"".... If you find spending 5 seconds Googling something you don't know too difficult or frustrating then maybe the internet isn't for you?"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,I would take you up on that offer. You put a lot of trust into a random Redditor though! You have more faith in the human race than I do apparently haha.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,You’re completely right. I’ll edit my comment to reflect the tone I was going for better. Only amazing if you get to enjoy a cool game for a long time!
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"I think it's a rather insane amount of time for me personally that people are spending in niche parts of the game, but it's awesome people are enjoying the experience this much. It's really quite something in general, lots of ""Modern"" influence but in the ethos of ""Old"" game design that really draws you into it in depth.

It's definitely my favorite thing I've played since Disco Elysium."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Ah yes the ""unfortunately for you I own all the best loaded dice in the region"" approach"
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Lol then you may love this game just for that haha Markle is the main gambling mini game to get more money and there are plenty of different difficulty levels to add on and tournaments
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"I always haggle upwards in new towns, or if the merchant doesn't quite have enough money to buy everything I'm trying to sell, I let them off a few groschen. 

It boosts your rep both with the individual merchants and the town as a whole really quickly. Probably faster than anything else you can do outside of directly completing quests for them."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,Right on!
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Me too, lmao. 45h in."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,yea you can travel back and forth
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,There is a caravan on the edge of the map that let's you go back of forth between the two maps.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"My point is that the story quests are all a bit nicey nice, errant knight goes questing-type vibe right now. The stakes felt huge for KCD 1. Maybe I've spent too much time faffing about doing anything I can find and should move on."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,That's literally the first few hours of everything in the first game lol it may not be a good selling point but boy howdy did it sell!
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,I also used SNS in KCD1 and frankly speaking my success rate in combos was probably only 15-20% but I'm also just bad. I'd look up an old guide or something because you definitely shouldn't be having that much trouble.
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,"Cool, I'm going to go play some AC2, SH2 and then PoE.

If you read this as Assassin's Creed 2, Silent Hill 2 and Path of Exile then you were wrong since those weren't the acronyms of the games I was thinking about.

It literally take 2 seconds to just type the names of things an not make people play silly guessing games or open up another tab to try and decipher messages."

1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Really I think it shows that while the intro area won’t last that long for most people, I also don’t think OP is intentionally not going further. Basically, there is so much you can do that you could spend a very good amount of time in that zone without doing nothing."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-18,Sent. You try the new monster hunter yet? What game did you have in mind for reciprocation?
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,"Yeah, I understand. I was too quick to react - now that I dwell on it longer I can recall loads of moments where I played inefficiently or just straight up dwelled around in games. Whole different story if theres actual content."
1irtahn,2025-02-17,2025-02-19,When i get home il share a mod with you that lets you skip the herb picking animation ;)
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"That R&C game was 2021? Christ man, where does the time go."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Is it a coincidence that theyre all single player games? 

Edit: Perhaps not obvious but the question is rhetorical"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Hard to believe UC4 came out 8 years ago. It still feels like a current gen game, at least on PC."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Give me Bloodborne!
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Got curious about this and did a little counting. Of the publishers that have gotten more than one nomination for ""Game of the Year"" at TGA, the list looks like this:

\- Sony: 13

\- Nintendo: 10

\- Bethesda: 4

\- Capcom: 4

\- FromSoftware: 4

\- EA: 3

\- Atlus: 2

\- Blizzard: 2

\- Square Enix: 2

Fromsoft self-publishes in Japan so I went ahead and counted their Namco and Activision international releases as their own games. If we went by developer instead of publisher, Bloodborne would also be theirs but the whole list would look very different.

Also split the companies that publish under multiple labels. Xbox, Activision, Blizzard and Bethesda were counted separately and the same goes for Rockstar, 2K and Private Division."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,How many of them won? There are definitely some all time greats on this list.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Pretty great track record in the previous years too!

2014:

2013: The Last of Us

2012: Journey

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Real talk: does anyone here actually think that Sony doesn't ""deliver"" or something?

They've been doing just fine since the PS1 days.

As a Nintendo fan, I'm actually proud of Sony for releasing great games to this point, because this makes for a great rivalry and competition in the gaming industry. For me, I have way more respect for Sony and Microsoft than any 3rd-party dev.

For goodness sake, they've humanized Kratos, they've surprised Japanese historians with Ghost, gave us TWO stellar Spider-Man games when the series had dropped stinkers up to that point, Aloy became a very likeable character in Sony's portfolio and now they're competing for GOTY with a child-friendly robot whose purpose is to make players experience all of the Playstation's features.

No joke, good on them :D"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"And while they didn't have any noms in 2014 for the first The Game Awards show, they had nominations in 2010 - 2013 for the SpikeTV Video Game Awards show which was the precursor to the current Game Awards. Those game were God of War 3, Uncharted 3, Journey, and The Last of Us.

Nothing in 2009 from them, but 2008 had LittleBigPlanet and Metal Gear Solid 4 which isn't owned by Sony, but was a Playstation exclusive and was directed by Kojima who also did Death Stranding of course. Sony has done well at the VGAs for a long time now."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Not to be a party pooper but everyone knows that GOTY is a huge circlejerk for the marketing department. They ARE great games, and I'll celebrate the development studio, not the publisher."

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Glad to see the Horizon games. Currently playing Forbidden West, for the first time. Still waiting for The Last of Us 2 to go on sale."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Nintendo only missed 2016 and 2018 without a GOTY nominee. Xbox has had Deathloop and Phsyconauts 2, but Deathloop was exclusive to PS5 for that year and Phsyconauts 2 was a crowdfunded multiplatform game, if we are talking console exclusive (Xbox + PC) they havent had any since before 2013"

Edit: Seems to be according to The Game Awards. I haven’t been following video games nearly as much over the last decade, so I wasn’t very familiar with it, but apparently at some point I guess it became *the* awards show. "

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"All of those games are really good, so they deserve the game nomination"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I’m an old guy I don’t really like cutesy cartoon games, but after seeing Astro Bot as game of the year, I decided to check it out. Wow! So fun and creative, and no one has come close to leveraging the Dual Sense like this game has. It really is a love letter to the PlayStation."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,That 2015 game looks interesting. I wonder if there’s a remaster of it
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"And if there was a worst game of the year, SONY will probably have a nominee for those every year as well."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,They pay for it
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,They havent made any of those games. They pay studios to make games which they then sell.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"ive never played any of these games, am i missing out or not"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I suspect bribes. ""Death Stranding"" was a lot of things. GoTY candidate it was not."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Should Death Stranding really qualify?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Does Death Stranding still count now that Kojima bought the rights back so he could release it on Xbox?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Was death stranding worth it? Never played it. Genuine question, I'm looking for good solo games"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Astro BOT is so boring! A ""cheap"" game that's not worth it."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Is this not like all other industries where you just fill out a form and pay a fee to get nominated for industry awards?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,How the heck did Death Stranding sneak in? That game was a turd.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Cool but Forbidden West does not qualify as a GOTY nominee on the grounds that it's a sequel which is inferior to the first.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,This would be like saying I won a popularity contest every year when my mom is the judge. Those fake awards are Sony bias.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,I wouldn't count studios that they don't own as PlayStation
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"13 games listed, and if I'm being generous, maybe about four of them are actually worth playing."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,And only one of those games actually deserved the nomination lol
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,but wins nothing
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,Idgaf about those snobs at Gaming Awards
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,"you see that 2015 game, do that again please."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Red Dead Redemption 2 not winning GOTY still pisses me off so much
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Shouldn’t rebirth be listed here too? I know it’s square enix but it’s still a ps5 exclusive the same way bloodborne is a ps4 exclusive despite being made by fromsoft.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,AstroBot's gonna win this year. For sure.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Honestly some of these being up there feels in support of the idea that nominations are rigged and that Geoff just wants a designated “Sony” spot to ensure they keep supporting and show up to the event. Ratchet and clank was not a top tier game and uncharted and death stranding were so niche in their audiences that they feel forced. One of my biggest problems with the game awards rn is how token a lot of the category nominations feel. There’s always the token Indy, token Sony, token PC game and then the 2-3 games that actually got the most attention buzz surrounding them that actually will likely win. Then they have 16 categories so every triple A game can get something despite the title really grasping at straws."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Hot take: All of these are mid
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"A. The ""nominees"" are chosen by industry shills.

B. That doesn't make them good games.

C. GOTY isn't a real thing. It's a popularity contest decided by industry shills.

D. Sony didn't make Death Stranding or Bloodborne.

I own every single one of these games. I've played all of them, more than once. The second time was only because of PC releases so I could get the achievements. They aren't experiences I'm desperate to have again, though I will definitely buy Ghost of Yotei, Venom and whatever Naughty Dogs next game is (assuming they don't somehow fail to deliver a very well produced game.)"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"They deliver but I still don’t like PS exclusives games, im glad final fantasy will no longer be a PS exclusive."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Looking at the nominations for GOTY this year Astro Bot is the clear winner for me. Team Asobi taking an already great game in Astros Playroom and somehow improving just about every part of the gameplay is a rare achievement in game development these days
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Well considering there are probably 100s of publications giving out GOTY awards that’s pretty meaningless.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Because the whole thing is pay to win advertising.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Yes, PlayStation pays to have a goty nominee every year."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,wow this is some serious glazing
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,DEATH STRANDING is Playstation?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Literally every game is a GOTY Nominee/winner somewhere.. this isn't an achievement (got nothing against those games just that this ""stat"" is worthless)"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Same goes for PC, not sure what the big deal is."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Astro Bot is good, but it's hard to believe there wasn't any other game this year that would take that spot."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It's pretty wild when it's listed like this. What an absolute banger list of games they've put out over the years.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Shows how good Sony’s first party games are.

I’ve bought most of Sony’s Steam releases."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Well it is the Sony awards.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Ghost of Tsushima is such a good game
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Uncharted 4 should have won that year
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"From 2020 onward, only sequels.."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,The Last Of Us 2 ♥️
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Breaking News: major game company makes games.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Yet only two were actually exclusive to Playstation, so what's your point?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Okay, what even is Astro Bot? I know every other game but I've not even heard of Astro Bot until it came out and every game journalism gave it 9s and 10s. 

Does it play like Little Big Planet?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Okay how many of them won?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Meanwhile Xbox hasn't had a single GOTY nominee in the past decade.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I'm not surprised since a lot of sony's games are the Oscar bait of gaming. I'm not hating though, they're generally good games."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"It's honestly insane that God of War actually beat Red Dead Redemption 2 for GOTY in 2018. God of War really hasn't aged well with its level design and Ragnarok was a huge step down. Meanwhile, people are still discovering amazing NPC and world interactions in Red Dead Redemption 2 over 6 years later."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Helldivers 2 should have been there as well
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"They make good games

Too bad they also force me to join PSN on my PC to play any of them"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I was about to say ""where the hell is Returnal ?"" but I realised it wasn't nominated as Game of The Year. Damn, the public was rude with this one."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"With my new PC I plan to build in Spring next year, I can't wait to tackle all the PlayStation games I missed:

God of War (2018)  
Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection  
Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart  
Horizon Forbidden West  
Ghost of Tsushima  
God of War Ragnarök  
Spider-Man 2

I really hope Astro comes to PC as well next year since I love 3D platformers."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Almost like Sony makes good games
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Bloodborne is still the best game on that list as far as I'm concerned. And not even ""for it's time"". I mean it's STILL the best game.


Edit: downvoted for having an opinion? Fucks sake "
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Longer than a decade
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Feel old now.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"In 2025, let’s bring it full-circle with ‘Bloodborne II’."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Tbf all of those are bangers. The 2 that maaaaybe wouldn't deserve to be nominated are ratchet and clanck and astrobot.and even they as far as i know they are really good games, i just haven't heard that much about them"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,What about ff7 rebirth? Isn't that PlayStation?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"You can't be telling me that God of War, Spiderman, and Horizon Zero Dawn are from 2018 and 2017 💀"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I’d hope so. They’re the second biggest gaming company in the world lol 
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Anyone else get floored by the PS1 startup sound? I don't want it to go away, best console startup sound ever."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Lack of a nom for returnal in 2021 is criminal
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Games were nominated and won game of the year selected by people
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,9 years and i'm still hoping for a Bloodborne PC release :-/
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Isn't that a given that the platform has a nominee for goty? Why would they not have a nominee? That's like a political party not having a nominee during an election.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"And that is why the PS5 Pro is $700. You want quality games, get ready for a quality monopoly. - Sony Executive probably."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"They make a certain type of games that attract you or not. 
Noy sure if I would spend money on any of these games. 


But I'm also not such a hardcore single player story fan."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"What is that game at the bottom? It looks funny, like it doesn’t exist anymore."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I mean, obviously? They're one of the largest video game manufacturers in the world lol"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Rift Apart still feels like the only next gen game on that list.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I hope Astro Bot also releases on PC
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,GOW:R changed my perception on single player games. I was almost exclusively a multiplayer / competitive gaming person but this game was insane
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"And here are the first-party/independent developers of these games:

###Astro Bot
Team Asobi

###Spider-man 1 and 2, Ratchet and Clank
Insomniac

###Horizon games
Guerrilla

###God of War games
Santa Monica

###Death Stranding
Kojima

###Uncharted 4 and The Last of Us II
Naughty Dog


###Bloodborne
FromSoftware"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Yeah but how many actually won? Not being condescending just genuinely curious
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Bloodborne is due for a remake.

Seriously. 

If Sony can get Bluepoint to remake Demon's Souls (and quite excellently at that) then surely we can get the same treatment for Bloodborne? 

It's probably some sort of licensing quagmire but if there's a will, there's a way, as the old saying goes so hopefully it happens.

At some point.

Yeah. 😒"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Man im behind. I have played none of these except bloodborne.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,2015 was almost a decade avo excuse me while i enjoy cobains last meal ye ole 12ga
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Uncharted 4 should have won!
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"""we have no IPs""

\-Sony"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"2024 should have FFVII Rebirth as well. It may be a temporary exclusive game, but so are some other games here like Horizon or God of War."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Xbox could have won it all if they stopped being cowards and made a Third Viva Piñata
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Couldn't even vote for most of these games cause I don't own a playstation. It's been getting better over the years but seriously give me bloodborn!
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Most of them are available on PC.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I feel this is like congratulating a movie theater for showing Oscar-nominated movies.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Is Astro Bot really that good?  I have read such high praise for this game, but the only console exclusives I have played in ages are those that trickle their way onto PC."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,goty from one random outlet that is meaningless
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"GOTY for who, though? There are about a thousand GOTYs every year from every publication and website known to man. [It’s literally the most useless accolade. lol.](https://youtu.be/hqMblpSqhgM?si=TJ5_mhOZLf4D16Td)"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Why isn’t FF7 in 2024?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,2025 Bloodborne again! 10y anniversary!
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,How many companies are left?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Wow what was Sony doing wrong in 2014
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I have yet to play a single one of these games.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Which GOTY? Arent there about 30 gazillion of them now?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"God Of The Year 2018 and 2022.

Not a sony pony myself but God of War is peak gaming."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Playstation I sleep.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Your title says Playstation but you mean ""Sony"".  Playstation having a nominee every year is not remarkable as there are only 3 consoles and PC and like 5 nominations.  But Sony as a publisher is different."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I mean, I would hope so. Seems like a bare minimum requirement if you’re going to ask people to invest in your system."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I mean, there are only 3 sources for GOTY contenders and PlayStation is one of them lol not the biggest flex"

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I wonder what this stat looks like for other platforms though.  It doesn't seem that crazy, like you would think each year there would be at least 1 nominee from other platforms like Switch, Xbox, and PC.  Am I totally off here?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Astro Bot and Bloodborne are the only two not on PC yet. Death Stranding is the only one that (just recently) came to Xbox, but that's because of ownership change. Would it even be considered a PS title anymore, technically?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,So...Sony Studios make good games? That's new
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Every single year apart from 2024 companies were doing stuff, now Sony does not want to cash out to the devs so please enjoy Astro World, a game no one really cares about.


Now Sony works on something way bigger than games, I don’t think the next year and a year after will have any worthy titles."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Horizon, God of War, Spiderman.  Horizon, God of War, Spiderman... I'm sensing a pattern"

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Duh
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Great games. But is it really surprising for one of the big 3 companies in gaming to be putting out at least one excellent game per year?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Bloodborne is from 2015?! Mf I’m getting old
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"GOTY nominations are made by big companies like Sony.

It really is not that weird they have a nomination every year once you understand that."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I’ll preface this comment by saying I don’t know if ALL of these games are PS exclusives but I’m pretty sure most of them are if not all of them.

So to the people who were whining about Microsoft buying up big developers like Bethesda and Activision/Blizzard and freaking out over the titles from those companies becoming Xbox exclusives. This is what Xbox users have been dealing with for well over a decade"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Sly 2 re-release should be a GOTY nominee
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Where is RDR2?!
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Wait you’re telling me bloodborne, the game that everybody bitches and moans about getting a remake, is only 10 years old"

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"That's why I'm still keeping ps4 and haven't even considered ps5, doubt I ever will.

Just so many cool games year after year and some still haven't played."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"As someone who has not had a Playstation since the PS3 days, is there a way to play Playstation games without one? Ratchet and Clank is probably the first game series i fell in love with, and I'd love to replay the old ones and/or play the newest one. I have both Xbox One and PC."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Only one of these is a standalone with no prequel or sequel. Sony we need to change that
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Sooo  one of the most dominant gaming consoles in the last two decades paid had games of the year published on their platform?   What a nothing burger.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"PS4 games and their sequels more or less, Sony needs to get some new ips in the mix, or maybe revive some more ps3 era ips."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"not to rain on the parade, but Sony is one of the biggest distributors/developers/whatever, where one of the 4 console (including pc) choices are made by them. 

idk how many nominees there are in total, but if they werent getting 1/4 of them every year i'd be surprised"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Mmmmmmmm…
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,yeah I probably should have bought a play station back in 2015
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Astro Bot is just Mario Galaxy.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Why did they stop at 2015? Seems like they had some in 2014 too ...
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"That's because Sony is a whole ass platform that farms out a bunch of games, and the rest are typically made by individual publishers who make a game every few years (outside of the yearly garbage like CoD, FIFA, etc)."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"That Forbidden West banner is a little baffling.  You can't make the protagonist look like that no matter what camera angle or post-processing you use, so I guess they just reused an asset from the first game."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Fun fact, every single game on this list other than the newest, and bloodborne, have either come to PC or are scheduled to come to PC soon"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I think playstation has perfected the third person action game
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,And yet no Bloodborne 2 😔
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,The existence of bloodborne in any list should be a shameful reminder to Sony of how they let the franchise die
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,All the single player games just goes to show ppl would rather just be left alone sometimes
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Death Stranding isn't part of Sony

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I have never played Bloodborne and probably never will, but WTF? It was released in 2015? I really thought that it is only 4 or 5 years old game. Time flies way too fast nowadays."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I'm not following. 1 game nominated each year for game of the year? Seems like it should be more. How many has Nintendo had in the past decade?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Did any of them win?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Never heard of astro bot
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Ratchet and Clank for 2024
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Damn, like what is even the point of xbox anymore? Gamepass? Why would i buy that, when i have a console with so many great games on it. Xbox need to step up with their exclusives."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,How's astro bot?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Horizon got smacked both years. Releasing beside a Zelda and elden ring. Amazing games and incredible story telling.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,That happens when you pay a lot of money for your games to be nominated.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Jesus Christ, Bloodborne was 9 years ago 💀"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Bloodborne man! What a game
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Bloodborne 2 and they'll actually win it as well
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Why was Spiderman 2 nominated? It was aggressively mid
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Bloodborne is the best game on the list by far
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I have played 0 of these games lol. I'm 34 and I own several of these on Steam. Where is Days Gone? That game was really good.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Wouldn't really call Death Stranding Sony's game. They don't own the developer and wasn't sole publisher for the game.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,2015-2019 are GOAT and winners in my eyes. The rest up until now not so much…. Except Astro bot that was a unexpected surprise
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Call of Duty BO6 could be up there this year
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Good god 8 years since Nathan Drake
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,The only game I've played and didn't enjoy from the list was Bloodborne. Does anyone else share the experience?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Oof Xbox.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I gotta play that ratchet and clank game appearently.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"What a surprise with them having the largest market share in gaming, truly baffling."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I've only ever played Uncharted out of these.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,THIS IS THE SIGN. BRING BACK SINGLEPLAYER ONLY GAMES THEY WERE PEAK 
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I have never heard of Astro bot
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Three of those games have already gotten a remaster…
:("
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,2018 was crazy
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,I picked up Spiderman remastered over the weekend and it's sooooo boring. How did that get nominated for goty?!? I LOVE spiderman but even that couldn't keep me playing. After 7 hours I gave up
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"2018 might be the best year ever. God of War, Spider-Man, and Red Dead Redemption 2. What a year."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"My favourite of these is Bloodborne.

I think I'm officially old, media's not being made for me anymore"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,I liked death stranding but game of the year nom is a stretch.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"You're telling me that one of the biggest video game corporations in the world, nay one of the big 3 (Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo), has games that are constantly seen in the mainstream public eye and are nominated in awards shows that target mainstream games?

What's next, you're gonna tell me Nintendo owns Pokemon?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Bloodborne should have won GOTY.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Hopefully we get another Ratchet and Clank game by the start of the PS6
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,The power of money.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Probably because PlayStation is all modern gamers know about gaming
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"It's a shame that as a company, Sony and subsequently PlayStation are fucking terrible. 

Why does every company that makes legitimately good blockbuster titles also have to be complete scumbags who treat their communities like shit?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,2020 was a helluva year.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"weakest year ‘20, ‘22 or ‘24"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Hmmm, I've got some Platinums to catch up on. Couldn't do that all these years later if there are multiplayer trophies (looking at you AC Black Flag 🤬)"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I think I’ll play Bloodborne again, thanks!"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,4 years later last of us 2 still not on ps premium smh
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,That’s crazy to think about
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Only one nominee? Or are there others?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Astrobot definitely deserves it. Amazing game.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Bloodborne 🥺
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,How the fuck is Bloodborne nearly 10 years old...
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,you know it's a slow year for gaming when astro bot makes Goty. not saying i dont have love for platformers but i felt like there were better more mature nominations imo.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Only game I like out of those is Bloodborne, the rest I don’t care for."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Maybe Sony should just dedicate to games & forget consoles. Same with Xbox, go PC software streaming"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,TLOF is really good
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Not surprising. Nintendo was on life support for the first couple years, third party publishers have mostly been chasing rushed live service nonsense, and Xbox has been an also-ran since the end of the 360."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Have they won?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Ghost of Tsushima is 4 years old but I still can’t buy it for cheap
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"That reminds me, I still have to play Death Stranding and Ghost of Tsushima from my physical backlog."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"That reminds me, I still have to play Death Stranding and Ghost of Tsushima from my physical backlog."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,That is so crazy
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,With how big Helldivers 2 was i'm surprised it's not beside Astro bot. They really shot themselves in the foot with that one.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Spiderman2 on the ps5 is hot garbage. Hopefully fixed on pc release.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Horizon twice GOTY??? How?? It is a boring-ass game with good graphics
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"It's the entire point of this. They aren't just Sony games, they are Sony exclusive games, heavily subsidized to attract attention to the platform. Yes, the studios are extremely talented, but they Sony was only able to pull this off because they had a big market advantage with the PS4, and they saw this as an investment in their ecosystem. Most studios, even AAA, cannot afford to pull this off."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"A lot of comments like 'it's come to PC or other platform, then it's not sony game', lol."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I question the legitimacy of this. As majority of console players I know only ever have a sports game such as NBA2K, NHL/FiFa/Madden, GTA and Every years CoD."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,And an Ubisoft infection by the looks of it.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,2022 i was eating good
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,At least 80% of these Games are mediocre at best. But these Awards are all PAID.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Spiderman and Horizon are so overrated.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,That 2015-2018 Playstation run was legendary
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"2018 was such a good year, God of War, MH World, Red Dead and Spiderman Celeste. Im blessed to say I’ve played each one"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,If astro bot is all we can muster for goty then it was a sad year for gamers
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Meanwhile, Xbox with all its fantastic IP’s sitting in a closet like “what gives?”"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Nothing to do with marketing.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,2022 and 2023 is a joke (although I liked the Ragnarok).
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Man, 8 years without an Uncharted? And we got that shit movie instead? Sad."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"In fairness 8/10 of those years Nintendo was nominated too. Of course 8 is less than 10 but the variety on offer is broader than Sony’s.

I can’t get behind Sony’s current business plan, we have a Pro console, the Portal and a bunch of Bluetooth peripherals but barely any PS5 exclusive games. Most users are still using the PS4 platform."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I thought astro's playroom and astro bot are just little funny games and was even a bit angry when I saw astro bot is selling for full price. Then I got to play both. Amazing games, totally deserved GOTY nomination, amount of content per level is just... I have no words for this, amazing"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Sony SUS
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"You have to remember : 

Award shows are highly sponsored and often skewed to make those sponsors happy. Nominations are the easiest to do, even if an award isnt won. Sony has a huge budget for PR, and they love to use it. 

Not really a marker of pure quality (not saying they dont make quality games - but there are many others out there similar or better), but a marker of how much marketing money they have to toss around. Or are willing to use."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"They could do something really nice and given us Bloodborne sequel and port the game to Sony's Steam lineup...


Surely with 10 years of GOTY nominations they could spare us this?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Last of 7s, Spiderman, GOS, and GOW only deserving spots."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,"Is uncharted 4 actually any good? I played an uncharted a long time ago, I think if was PS3/4 and it was just a very bland and uninteresting gameplay"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,"Bloodborne and astroboy are the only ones worthy of the title tho.

The rest are just generic triple a blockbuster games. The fastfood of gaming. 

It would be like calling mcdonalds the best restaurant of the year..."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,Crazy part is from that list the only games I kind of care about is God of War and possibly Death Stranding with maybe Spider Man 1 coming in third.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,Atrobot saved this year... next year will be hard to partecipate
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,"Nominating Horizon for GOTY shows what's wrong with the industry these days. An absolute average game, with all sort of mechanics that has been already invented before just put in one game with (apart of hunting which is the best part of the game, but still only hunting). Brand new universe with new characters, story and few twists is way too little to be considered a GOTY pretender."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,I am sorry but horizon game are not GOTY contenders.......
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-13,"I have a Playstion 4, yet as a Xbox player. I don’t even think any of those games are fun. It’s definitely rigged."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,We throw the word GOTY around too loosely
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Completely deserved, as a person who plays a lot of single players, almost every one that releases per year playstation have some of the most quality games I've ever played "
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Would be interesting to see all Games of the Year since 1994 and first Playstation.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,What is an action adventure game for 500 please
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Astro Bot 🥰
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,And next year its ghost of yotei. Mark my words. It will win
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Which GOTY award? It seems 6-10 games release a game of the year edition these days.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,[deleted]
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"And not a single game in there I give a f*** about. Well, except maybe Astro Bot. The Playroom was decent.

Shows how much different personal tastes can be. None of these games would be even in consideration for GOTY for me."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,They all deserve it honestly
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Do you think this could be related to selling more consoles than Xbox possibly
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,with all due respect i see absolutely no reason Astro Bot has a goty nomination let alone half of the nominations it does
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Final Fantasy VII Rebirth? That also got a nomination
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Jesus, I did not realise Uncharted 4 was that old now...Still replay it once a year at this point!"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I just want Bloodborne on PC
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Tried to like Bloodborne. I have the game on disc. Couldn't get into it. The witcher is better. Looks more beautiful too.

Bloodborne tries to hide graphic quality with darker environments. Too me doesn't look as good graphically. But most importantly there is just more to do in the Witcher.

Horizon games was awesome too. The ones i have played on PS4 that has frozen wilds expansion. I paid for the expansions for it separately."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"PlayStation really does know how to make amazing games, especially single player story games"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,At least half are mediocre
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,They make the best single player games out there.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"just release bloodborne on PC Sony, omfg You absolute clowns"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Of these I have only playing Death Stranding and can 100% recommend it for game of the decade and/or game of the century.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"WOW ITS ALMOST LIKE SONY RELEASES GOOD GAMES EVERY YEAR AND IT HAS THAT SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT!

OP : ""No, this is clearly Sony paying money to have their games listed on nominee. There is no other way. It MUST be this"""
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Astrobot

Military_Clown.png"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Why is this notable to anyone? Sony is a mega-corporation that is also a game publisher. They aren’t the ones actually making the games. Stop praising the suits and higher-ups and give credit to the game studios who actually worked on these wonderful projects.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Lots of those shouldn’t have been nominated honestly
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,We all kno some of them don't deserve the spot but it's sony
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,And i wouldn't have voted for a single game on this list. Shame.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"It's simple, a certain type of game tends to win these types of awards. (same goes for the Oscars, a certain *type* of film always gets best picture) 

Sony is publishing a lot of these types of games."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Every single one of those games I don't give two shits about, reminds me why PlayStation since the PS4 era is dead to me. And I grew up adoring the PS1, PS2 & PS3. 

I'm just expressing a personal opinion. I don't mean to shit on all the millions of people who like these games. it just got to a point where Sony stopped making games that interested me."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Xbox sucks
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Most of these games aren't very good frfr nocap.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,What worthless content. Goty means nothing but marketing
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,And they're all on PC expect AstroBot and Bloodborne....
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,They make good games
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Death Stranding = walking simulator.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I hate exclusives. No reason to have them. You are literally taking money away from yourself. Consoles are sold at a loss.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Well when you have money and own a massive portion of the industry you're going to get benefits even if they're undeserved. I say this as someone who enjoys my playstation, but god damn do the stinkers they pump out get absurdly high reviews."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Major publisher has had a GOTY Nominee Every Single Year in the Last Decade
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,All sequels lmao
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Never played any of them
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Which is sad since many of them dosnt deserve it...
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,So what? Only one really good game - Bloodborne
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,There’s like maybe 3 games here at most that deserve it lol
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"HZD is mediocre at best, how is that Goty worthy is beyond me"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"and yet they still want to triple down on live service bullshit.

They were banking so hard on Concord. how did so many people see that garbage and go ""yeah, a ton of people are gonna love this"". All it took was one trailer for everyone to know it was a dud, but none of the people making it knew? or did they all know but didn't say anything because they'd get fired?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Astro bot is nice but i don’t think its worthy
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,And they only won 2
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,They absolutely didn’t deserve one in 2023.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"games that are platform exclusive should not be nominated for game of the year. They def shouldn't win, at least."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"They didn't make these games, they published them. At least the few that I know of. Fromsoft made Bloodborne, for example."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,BG3 best gave ever
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"As a self-proclaimed sonypony since PS2, a bit worrying I’ve only played 2 of those games, being Bloodborne and Ghost of Tsushima, although all of those games interest me."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Helldivers 2 should be nominated.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Spider Man 2, HFW and GOT don't deserve it, Ratchet was a great game, idk if it is a GOTY candidate, the others are worthy."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Honestly hell divers should be on there too. 
Butttt let’s just go with the single player narrative."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Like give them a category where they can shine, but None of the games are truly addicting, which was what games use to be.

I like these games too."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,2018 should've gone to Red Dead 2. Absolutely ridiculous.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I really want to play astrobot but I'm 100% certain it will be a PS monthly or ps extra game at some point and don't want to buy it. I really wish sony would do more day one releases on big names like xbox does. PSN is a decent value so I'll keep it, but waiting for shit to be added is annoying."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"My only objections are TLOU II & Astro Bot. Because, why?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Nice to see the walking simulator got nominated (death stranding)
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Love all these games but you can also just see a downward trend in overall game originality and quality each year as well for their best game..
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,crazy how Oc players play the HZD or Ratchet and clank and it’s all “ okay games”
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Returnal was not even nominated?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Just so everyone is aware, every single one of these games are also on PC."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Greatness is what that is.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,They don't deserve to claim Bloodborne
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Wtf is astro bot? Playstation people are so weird man. Tou can get an xbox with literally double the amount of games and the controller isnt designed for sangheili. Like wake upppppp
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Seeing Bloodborne pissed me off because it reminds me Sony is about to own Fromsoft
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Streak probably should have been broken in 2019 lol
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Bloodborne and Death Stranding are not PlayStation games, otherwise impressive."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,What the hell is Astro Bot?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Sony owns and pays the judges thousands of f****** dollars I don't give a s*** what their game wins. I love all those games though. But f*** they're b*******! Like they're the only goddamn gaming console on the planet! Why don't you go remaster another 5-year-old game you f****** moops!
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"How many won again? Not being salty, just busy at work."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Not to mention RDR2
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,No Returnal is insanity
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,The crack someone was smoking in 2016 to nominate Uncharted A Thief’s End for GOTY must’ve been some good shit
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,2018 was such a good year for gaming
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I have almost all of them and never played them...
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I liked the game, but Spider-man 2 didn’t deserve to be nominated"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Ghosts should have beat LoU2. A story of a Jin throwing away all honor and samurai tradition as they have showed to be a weakness Kahn knew. To start fighting using stealth and less honorable means to defend there homeland over a story of basic revenge that doesn't solve anything 
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Surely this isn't that notable? It's hardly surprising that a major games console has a nominee for Game of the Year every year.

All that means is that the console is popular enough to have games developed for it which are good enough to be nominated for Game of the Year. I'm pretty certain the same is true for PC."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,To bad they are a shit company that scammed me out of 180€ after their paper thin security got breached for the 10.000 thousands time.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I think this kinda shows that in some of these years, either the releases were not that impressive, or a sony game must always be nominated.

Like, you might have liked it, but it's ratchet and clankle that memorable in comparison with other titles in this list?

I don't think so in all honesty."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,How many did win GOTY? I only remember God of War being a winner? Not sure to be honest.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Bloodborne and Spider-Man are fantastic games but everything else seems pretty mediocre. Astro Bot looks like a nice little game but I wouldn't expect it to be groundbreaking.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Tbh no console exclusive title ever deserves to be goty
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"and for half the years, they deserved to have one"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Crazy how bloodborne is still the best on that list
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,How many of them won it ?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Ratchet being nominated in 2021 over Returnal is so wrong...(I'm happy Astro is nominated this year, I just think Rift Apart was a forgettable platformer that overpromised and underdelivered)"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Most of them are the same game with a different skin.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"And I'll never get to even try most of them since I won't go for a low effort, cash grab PC port.  Something getting GOTY or even being nominated for it used to mean being worth buying a console for, but that value has gone down and the games aren't getting better by enough to make up for it."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Weak
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,honestly only a few of those I'd ever touch. but it's cool people get into these awards and think it means something
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"If they can pay for exclusives, they can pay for nominations.

Sony buys a head start to every race it enters, and still manages to lose most of them."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Who’s game of the year? Culture Crave? Gaming awards? Aunt Beth?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Helldivers 2 is better than Astro Bot. But thats my 2 cents.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Great list, but Spider-Man 2 was riding on the coat tails of the first one"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Gonna be an unpopular opinion but Horizon is one of Sony's most overhyped just ok games of all time with no real reason being nominated. 2017 was really only between 3 games and they had PUBG on the nominees to fill slots, 2022 was when Elden Ring released and you could argue they put half of the nominees that year also to just fill slots cause it was definitely between Elden Ring and God of War."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Isn't the GOTY just an industry price, where everyone is petting there own shoulders and say how great they are?
Also isn't the GOTY a pay to get nominated price?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Nominations don't mean much when you are one of the big 3 consoles and spend hundreds of millions per year pumping out AAA exclusives. If they weren't gonna get any nominations, they wouldn't be paying for those games to be made since if they aren't good enough to be nominated, they aren't good enough to sell to make up for the dev cost."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"""Game of the Year"" according to whom?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"To be real, even though they're all good games, some of them were nominated only because PlayStation®."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,So you're saying Sony's list for games of the year is all Sony games.... Interesting.....
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Death stranding, nah. Definitely not a goty"

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Funny that the ones that won didnt deserve it at all lol (TLOU 2 is debatable)
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"How are these even PlayStation games? Most of these are on Pc as well, and death stranding’s on Xbox."

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"The only good game on this list is Bloodbourne. The rest is the equivalent of ""Oscar Bait"". Pretty games with shit gameplay."

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Astro bot was great!
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,What in the world is Atro Bot..?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Spider-man 2 doesn't deserve the nomination, game just automatically gets nomination if it Sony at this point"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Lobbyists
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Astro Bot making this list is a sign of things to come. GOTY quality games have just shifted to platformers designed to only be played for 30 minutes. Gaming is officially dead; as we know it.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"You would hope so right? I mean, they're a massive share of the market."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,":l These games look pretty...but they're boring. 95% of these games nowadays are boring to me. If a game can't hold my attention for YEARS, it ain't my type of game. Not for the prices they charge nowadays. I have a PS5 and still play the same games I bought on my PS4. I don't think I have a single PS5 exclusive game that I play/enjoy more than the games I've been playing for 6+ years"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,The fuck is astrobot?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Reminder.... they think astro bot on the same level as wu kong or elden ring... goty really means nothing
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,What about Sekiro?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Dont let the xbox fanboys see this.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Playstation just doesn't miss. The worst game on this list is probably TLOU 2 which is a damn great game, just has some questionable plot choices."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,How did uncharted 4 get nominated that game sucked. Nevermind it's just the game awards.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Feels odd that I have not played any of them and none of them appeal to me, in the least, to warrant me playing them."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Pussies allowing for dual winners in a year
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03, Can’t get into Horizon
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Horizon, GoW/Spider-man… Horizon/GoW, Spider-man. 

What an eventful decade!"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Looks like a downhill
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"This is a shame, because all these games are mid."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"If this is the list of their best games from each year, it's no wonder they're losing"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Couple of those didn’t deserve to be nominated to be fair lol
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Just to five an honest opinion as an xbox player.

None of these games would ever make me want a Playstation. 

I've bought 2 play stations in my entire life, one to play grand theft auto 3 and one to play little big planet when it first came out. 

The games on this list aren't enough to make me purchase another."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,A Thief’s End was sony’s end.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Shame that 4 of the 9 years had the same IPs.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"All this shows is that the nominee list is far too wide for things like Horizon 2, Rift Apart was shockingly mediocre, death stranding, last of us part 2, and spider-man 2 to get the nods as goty. 

Im not sure if there is a more disappointingly generic open world series than horizon. It's so close to being great, giant mech dinosaurs are cool, but holy hell that story and gameplay."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,How the hell did Horizon get nominated?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Sony should make more multiplayer games
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I get people (fanboys) will celebrate this, but does anyone else feel like when they look at this list, Astrobot (while good) just doesn't really stand up compared to the rest?  

Like Blood Borne, God of War, Spider-man, Uncharted...  Such a feast.   It's just strange to put Astro Bot next to Ghost of Tsushima, or Death Stranding, you know?  

It also feels this year's GotY are a bit light.  Like no game is really bad, but it also feels like none of them would be in the list in any other year."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It's almost as if industry awards are supporting the industry...
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Really? Death Stranding? I felt like a UPS delivery guy the whole game
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Western gaming media has a strong bias to the type of games Sony make, so not surprising."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Really? Astro Bot?  I feel like goty should be somthing much bigger than that
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Hell yeah, two good games."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,i would argue that a few of those were undeserved tbh
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Hd2 is so much better than Astro bot.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,And none of them deserved GOTY. GoW stole RDR2s win and TLOU2 was a joke.

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Every console does :D What bullshit marketing is this?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,And its still has no game.

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Meh conveyor belt games with marvel writing.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"PlayStation didn't have those nominations just because the games in question are exclusives. Sony didn't make most of those games, third party developers did. Credit where credit is due."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,You can really see the decline

 I think thats the way!"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Horizon is a cookie-cutter Ubisoft open world clone that holds itself back by trying to be everything it shouldn't be.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"You do realise that they have a fix spot on the list? They could release a total shitshow and they'd get nominated. That's how those awards work.

I'm not saying that they don't deliver, but having a spot alone isn't that special."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,And they had to *reaaaaaallyyy* stretch to get Astro Bot to fit
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,these awards are such a joke what even is astro bot and why would it be getting game of the year over something as epic as the other games on that list.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Wow..one of the big three consoles had a GOTY nominee? 

Insanity"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,How is astrobot on there?  Is it actually a good game?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"The only games on thatt list that i consider worthy of GotY aare Bloodborne, God of War, Death Stranding, Ghost of Tsushima and Astro Bot."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Really good games on that list, but I have an unpopular opinion about game of the year. If the game isn’t available on multiple platforms, then it shouldn’t be considered for GotY. If the majority of gamers can’t play it, then the game is really just a “best of <insert system here>” to me."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,And more than half of them are mediocre at best. Conclusion ? GOTY awards are fucking trash
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Well yeah they're on the committee that chooses which games get nominated lol.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Its a fucking 2hrs commercial. Sony buys adds there and therefore gets awards and nominations.

Uncharted 4 (really??), Last of Us Part 2 Remake Remastered and remade again, and Death Stranding the walking simulator should never have been contenders lol"

The big 3s major IPs are all single player focused, even Halo and Gears are usually touted for their single player campaigns over their multiplayer."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Why is this a noteworthy question? The PS barely even gets multiplayer games that aren't cross-platform to start with
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Sony publicly announced that single-player is their focus since the PS4 era. Makes sense they are recognised for what they focus on.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Funny enough, I think of multiplayer and single player games as completely different media, and I often immediately associate something like game of the year or greatest of all time with single player games.  I love multiplayer, but to me it’s like comparing a sport to a book: not really compatible"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I mean, this is also a brand new reddit account go for easy karma farming posts so I wouldn't give it too much attention."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Nope, it is not a coincidence. Single player exclusives move consoles. I was thinking about getting an Xbox but I can just wait till Spring to play Indiana Jones so no more Xbox console for me."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Not that Sony makes many multiplayer games in the first place, aside for their yearly MLB title and occasionally some others (they do also publish MP games every now and then, such as Helldivers 2 this year)."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Sony Pictures understands movies, and their PlayStation division understands games. 



Together they help make some Banger stories and adventures. 



I'm a PC gamer, and I will gladly admit PS is probably one of the best gaming studios and will probably buy a ps5 just for GTA6.(GTA games hit PC 2-3 years later)


Sony has an exclusive marketing deal with Rockstar Games, and also looking to acquire the FromSoft studios."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,No. Single player games are just better
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I still wish for a 5, but I understand that they can't just keep coming up with these massive lost cities that somehow were never found in the modern world"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,UC2 still unparalleled imo
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"What really sucks is it has a fun multiplayer mode.... That you can't play on pc -_-

It's a great game with a fun MP mode locked to ""ps4"" only (ps5 has to run the ps4 version to play) so you are also stuck on 30fps."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Grant us eyes!
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"it seems like the more we ask for it, the more Sony/From Software wanna starve us"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Between how much fans are clamboring for it and how reticent the higher ups are to even acknowledge that it exists, I honestly think that there's something actually *wrong* with Bloodborne. Like, they lost the source code, or the ghost of Kentaro Miura is threatening to sue Miyazaki for copyright infringement or something, and they only recently started making headway on solving the problem."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,The fact that FromSoft has the same number as Bethesda and Capcom is pretty remarkable.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,That simple list took a lot of work.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"This requirement would’ve been limited to only the largest publishers.  Who else can fund the production of many high quality games in a year?  Also, who publishes the title would have less to do with quality than who created the game. 

Is this criteria resulting in a list that is more about size or quality?

Are they the best of the big publishers or the best publishers?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,If Supergiant gets another nom with Hades 2 (I would guess they will based off the EA) it would be kind of wild to see them tied with the likes of Blizzard and Square.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"If I remember, God of War won 2018 and TLOU2 in 2020. That is it from this list I think."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Quick rundown of the GOTY category of the game awards in this time frame. 

2015 - Witcher 3 over Bloodborne, Fallout 4, MGS V, and Super Mario Maker

2016 - Overwatch over Inside, Doom, Titanfall 2, and Uncharted 4

2017 - LoZ:BotW over Horizon, PUBG, Mario Odyssey, and Persona 5

2018 - GoW over Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Celeste, Spiderman, Monster Hunter World, and RDR2

2019 - Sekiro over Control, Death Stranding, The Outer Worlds, RE2 Remake, and Smash Ultimate

2020 - TLOU 2 over Animal Crossing, Deem Eternal, FF7 Remake, Ghosts of Tsushima, and Hades

2021 - It takes Two over Metroid Dread, Deathloop, Psychonaughts 2, Ratchet and Clank, and RE Village

2022 - Elden Ring over A Plague Tale Requiem, GoW Ragnarok, Horizon FW, Stray, and Xenoblade Chronicles 3

2023 - Baldurs Gate 3 over Alan Wake 2, LoZ: TotK, Spiderman 2, RE4 Remake, Mario Wonder"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,just did a quick search: god of war 2018 and TLOU2 are both winners
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"at TGA? Only a few. But overall gotys they win more often. Like uncharted 4 had the most gotys tracked in 2016, but overwatch won at TGA. Death stranding had the most in 2019 but lost at TGA.

I'm still shocked that horizon 1 finished 2nd in 2017 (behind botw obviously) in overall gotys. It finished ahead of mario odyssey even."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Horizon had the misfortune of going up against Breath of The Wild.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Oh man, SOCOM was so good."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Some of those old ones are so funny. Like wow didn’t get a single nomination in any category in 2004 or 2008.

Madden 04 beat Kotor. 

COD 4 didn’t even get a nomination for goty. As stacked as 2007 was and there was only 3 nominations to begin with."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Well this post seems to be about GOTY from TGA. I don't think there were TGA goty awards before 2015.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"UC2 being the one that won it is kind of wild imo, and maybe i’m looking at it through 2009 lenses but for as much as i love UC2 i think Arkham Asylum was a far better game"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Idk about that, Spider-Man 2 felt like a step down from the first one. I liked it alright, but I was a little disappointed as a follow-up to SM1."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Not when some are taking up space where much better games could be included. The Outer Worlds being there in a year that gave us Outer Wilds and Disco Elysium is crazy.

Another example. Nominating Deathloop when you had games like Hitman 3 and Inscryption.

Then you've got cookie cutter open world games like Odyssey, Horizon, Tsushima etc. Games that have great elements in them but the lack of creativity in their open world design is very apparent. So not games that really stand out enough to be one of the best of that year"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,">and now they're competing for GOTY with a child-friendly robot whose purpose is to make players experience all of the Playstation's features.

No kidding. And (from what I've played of it so far) Astros Bot is *fantastic*. It reminds me of the old Mario Galaxy games."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I've only owned a PS4 and PS5 but I have zero regrets. I've had some of the best gaming experiences I've ever had on those two consoles. I have limited time to game so I'll take one good single player experience a year over endless multiplayer.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I just miss the ps3 days when they were more wild and experimental
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Bloodborne on pc.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Now if Xbox could manage to step up their game. Because at this point they are looking more like late 90s Sega. Which isn’t a good sign. We need at least 3 big consoles. Especially since 2 of them are dominated by 1 country.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Naughty Dog hasn't released a new game in 5 years.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,To me it's now that I'd rather play their big games on PC and knowing i'll get them eventually means I won't get a ps5. They have blockbuster exclusives but the thing is this list basically is all their notable exclusives for the last 10 years. I can't justify buying a 500-700 dollar system for that few big exclusives. Also this spans 2 generations of consoles.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I agree. The first console I ever bought with my own money was a PlayStation 2 with Gran Turismo 3 and I’ve never looked back. 

Nintendo (NES) was my first actual console - bought by my parents, of course. I cannot say the same for them. They have declined so much."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-06,In 2009 they had Uncharted 2. It was the winner that year too.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Everyone knows GOTY is a circlejerk until it validates your opinion, then it's a flawless and objective judgement of quality"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Not only that but they're just not interesting games for the most part. Or they're sequels, or cousins of other games."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,How many GOTY editions does it take for people to notice?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Matpat has a good video about GOTY bias. Basically it's all old dudes deciding the games so the picks are all cinematic dad games, which is exactly the type of game sony makes."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,They celebrate the developers too lmao. They LITTERALLY bring them up on stage and are personally handed the award every year
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Shout-out to Microsoft's Hi-Fi Rush for being nominated in other categories ;)
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Per the Psychonauts 2 docu though, MS buying Double Fine absolutely expanded the resources available for the game. It was only as good as it was because MS helped out, they definitely deserve the credit on that one."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Nintendo doesn't have one this year either, do they?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Xbox had Forza Horizon 5 and Flight Simulator in 2020 which were two of the highest rated games released that year and neither got a GotY nomination because they're from niche genres.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I mean from this list nowadays the only exclusives are bloodborne and astrobot arent they?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Forza Horizon 5 was the single highest rated game of 2021.

Ori Will of the Wisps wasn't nominated with no explanation given but presumed because it was ""too small"" with a 90 metacritic, same for Ori and the Blind Forest with an 88, but Stray was nominated with an 83.

Gears 5 (84) and Halo Infinite (87) were not nominated, but Death Stranding (82) and Ghost of Tsushima (83) were nominated.

There was no chance an Xbox exclusive was ever going to get nominated at a show where the dorito pope chooses selection panel."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Whose game of the year is this? Don’t a ton of places release their versions? Is there one that is “definitive?”
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"> Deathloop was exclusive to PS5 for that year

It wasn't. Deathloop was a multiplatform release (PC + PS5) in September 2021."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I still think we need to take a step back and appreciate Microsoft once had a GotY That was exclusive to Playstation 5.

This timeline is weird, man."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Probably the Geoff Keighley Show featuring Geoff Keighley and Geoff Keighley.

But he DID do a great job at making his awards show the definitive one (also thanks to the name)."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"The Game Awards, the by far biggest Award type thing we have had going for the last 5+ years?

At least that's what I assumed because its the obvious one"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Agreed, seems like this is to just fill the vacuum left by no E3.  These are just to drum up hype for whatever is next."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"It sort of replaced E3, so yeah, their awards seem to matter more to people now for some reason. I don't see any value in it, though it is nice when good developers like Larian get their spotlight."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"An industry controlled by two companies might not technically be a monopoly, but it's certainly not healthy.

The concerns about industry consolidation are a lot deeper than just the fanboy console wars."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It was until recently.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It's from *the* specific and prestigious GOTY award known as The Game Awards (AKA The Geoff Keighley Show featuring Geoff Keighley)
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,God of War and The Last of Us Part II
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Not really because Bloodborne isn't just made on PS4, it's a Sony intellectual property

It's not just a game that FromSoft made on PlayStation, it's a Sony game that FromSoft made *for* PlayStation

Same deal as Demon's Souls, FromSoft doesn't own either of those games' trademarks"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,They are listing Sony published games. Rebirth is from Square Enix as usual for the franchise.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Bloodborne like Demon's Souls are Sony IPs...

Sony didn't even want to release Demon's Souls in the West which is why it was published by Atlus in the Americas and Namco in the Europe.

They did similar shit with earlier PS IPs like Devil Dice/Bombastic \[XI / XI go\] for the PS1/2.

Sometimes they fund and co-create great things and lock them in the closet until another publisher recognizes its worth and brings it out for the people to enjoy.

Sonys play with Final Fantasy and a lot of other 3rd party IPs is the opposite, they throw some cash at the publisher in terms of marketing or lower license fees for the privilege of not releasing the content on other platforms. They have no ownership there just a fuck you contract to owners of other platforms."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"This is just first party stuff or else youd be seeing FF7, Black Myth, and alot of other exclusives here."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"In that same vein, should Death Stranding even be on that list as a “Sony” nominee? Kojima Productions is an independent studio and DS is now on xbox."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Calling Uncharted niche is wild. It sold 15 million copies.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Did you play Rift Apart? It was an excellent game. I'm not sure how you could call Uncharted niche in any way, it's a third person shooter with puzzles. Crystal Dynamics made an entire trilogy of Lara Croft games, which the first two were great, almost based entirely around the same gameplay aspects. Metaphor: Refantazio is nominated for GOTY and is about as niche a game as you could get. A lot of the categories are for specific genres too, do you want it to just be 16 awards for indie games? What are you even complaining about?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,And Spider-Man 2 was completely mediocre.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Dude you bought and played most of these twice, and liked them enough to state you will be buying unreleased and unannounced future games, but they're not good? lol"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Sony’s Japan Studio approached FromSoftware for a new game, it was a cooperative development."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Seems like they're just stating facts.
Like the fact that Xbox hasn't dropped a game that's been nominated for like a decade"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,that’s what she said
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,They owned the IP until just this year when Kojima bought out his contract. I do agree it's kind of a grey area where more 3rd party though.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It was funded by Sony.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"It was a PlayStation exclusive at launch, but was made by an independent team and has since come to PC and Xbox."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"It's only referring to The Game Awards, which is generally the award show people mean when they don't reference a specific one."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Astrobot and Metaphor ReFantazio are the best reviewed games this year and share the highest metacritic score of 94. No other game this year scored above 93
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Guess they weren’t good enough?  


I don’t get the point of down casting games cause my favorite didn’t make it. Hell I didn’t play Balatro but with the way ppl spoke about it all year I ain’t gonna say it doesn’t deserve it."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Making consistent bangers for a whole decade and winning multiple GOTY awards isn’t some mundane accomplishment, it’s the epitome of consistency"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It's a platformer like Super Mario Galaxy
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Same. Not heard anything about it until I saw it was a nominee. Thought it was one of those free demo things you get with sony and really didn't know what it was doing there
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,1st 3d platformer outside of Nintendo to really hit the quality of Mario imo
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Meh, not really"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Nah, both those games are fantastic, and that's coming from someone who never played a previous ratchet game or astrobot game until these ones. They're both so well polished and pure fun to play."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I didn't enjoy God of War. I skipped out on Astro Bot
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,They definitely putting money in someone’s pocket
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,God of war won that year. And I believe tlos2 as well
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,The Game Awards hasn't been going since 1994 though.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Out of about 14k games released each year, a list of 10 games is pretty short."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,This list is just Sony owned IP nominees.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,You’re not alone.  Couldn’t care less about a single one of these titles
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"IP wasn't owned by PlayStation at the time of release(it's why Death Stranding is on this list) 

FF7R is a Square Enix game."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Which one?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I quite enjoyed Bloodborne, TLOUS2, and Uncharted 4.  Rift Apart was quite fun, tho the game was a bit light."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Bloodborne maybe, but you are right about the others."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"There have been many winners and nominees that aren't cinematic and graphics heavy tho.  But yes, Sony does make a lot of cinematic heavy games.  From that list tho, Bloodborne and Astrobot are very different from the rest."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,What games do u like?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Hey if you want to play on PC that’s perfectly fine!
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Who cares
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"With thier new timed exclusivity policy, it's probably a matter of time before Astro Bot comes to PC.

No comment on the other one though."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"There are several very valid and legitimate reasons to dislike the game or find it boring, but calling it Walking Simulator = ''I didn't play the game and I'm not basing my opinion on what the game actually offers''.

It's more of a logistics planning game like Eurotruck Simulator but in the apocalypse, with horror touches, tons of unlockable futuristic devices to tame the terrain and optimize your deliveries, an innovative asynchronous multiplayer system, and fights against bandits, terrorists, antimatter ghosts, lovecraftian tar monsters and sometimes skeleton soldiers revived from the world wars."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Exclusives are the reason that Sony is dominating the console market. Seems like a pretty good reason to me.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"There is a business reason to have them. Say I wanted Spider-Man, I’d have to buy a PlayStation when it released. And now that I have a PlayStation, what am I also going to buy? The other exclusives. Sony continues to get a cut from software because you now are in their ecosystem. You don’t have an incentive to buy all of their games if you’re not invested into the hardware to play them."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Exclusives allow for games to be developed faster and better.  Having to optimize for a particular set of hardware is a huge advantage in that process.  It should allow for better games.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I think as a publisher, Sony is the best in terms of the quality of games that come from them and their owned studios. 

If they released their games to all platforms, they would sell so many games, it wouldn't matter about Playstation or not. People who like playing on consoles will still buy them."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,">Well when you have money and own a massive portion of the industry

This reminds more of Microsoft Xbox, do you know the 75 billion dollar Activision acquisition is the biggest gaming acquisition of all time and the only comparable acquisition in the entire entertainment industry was Disney buying Fox in 2019. Xbox has more dev studios than Playstation and Nintendo combined."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,MS is proof owning the market and having all the money don't mean shit if you have 0 talent.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I would love to hear what you find good games then with ur incredible and divine taste.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"You say that like it should be expected, but no other publisher has achieved that not even Nintendo"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Platform exclusive? Most of these are on PC now, just still owned by Sony."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Sony owns the vast majority of the studios that made the games though.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Bloodborne was made in collaboration between Sony Japan Studio and Fromsoft. Sony also owns the IP.

Guerrilla Games(Sony studio) helped with Death Stranding, it was also developed using their engine. Sony owned the IP, but they transferred the rights to Kojima this year.

All the other games came from their own studios"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Santa Monica Studios (God of War), Naughty dog (Uncharted, The Last of Us), Team Asobi (Astro Bot), Insomniac Games (Ratchet and Clank, Spider-Man), Guerilla Games (Horizon, Killzone) all fall under PlayStation Studios.

So yeah, Sony made most of these games."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,bloodborne and death stranding are the only 2 where sony had no say. All other games are made by children studios of ps.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Literally every game listed here expect for bloodborne is from a PlayStation studio
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"""Largest console in the world paid to have good exclusives that mostly didn't win GOTY"" isn't as good a headline, I suppose."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Death Stranding is more like Eurotruck Simulator but in the apocalypse, with horror touches, realistic traversal and management mechanics that no other game has, tons of unlockable features, tools, weapons, exoskeletons, vehicles, accesories and infrastructure types to optimize your deliveries, fights against bandits, terrorists, antimatter ghosts, lovecraftian tar monsters and skeleton soldiers revived from the world wars, and an asynchronous multiplayer system in which players collaborate with each other by leaving ladders or climbing anchors, building bridges, roads, safehouses, watchtowers, recharging points, ziplines, donating gear and materials, signaling dangers and points of interest, returning lost cargo, even during boss fights another player's character can emerge from the ground to give you weapons and healing items."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,If that was the case why is Balatro nominated this year lol
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Journs and shills
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Not Sony’s list. The Game Awards.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Have you played it? It has 92% positive user reviews on Steam, the majority of people who actually played it enjoyed it, that's why it's getting a sequel. Obviously there are seas of people who don't like it, some for very legitimate and valid reasons but many others just for prejudices and absurdly reductionist memes that don't even correctly portray what the game has to offer."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,One of the highest ranked games of all time.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Agreed
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"You would think so but no other publisher has achieved this, even Nintendo missed 2016,2018, and 2024"

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Not a Sony product. An Activision product.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Not even PS exclusive

I'm happy for playstation owners they got to enjoy these great games. I'm still waiting for the new fable.."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,The logistics planning game is bad when it's actually a logistics planning game.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,And what’s this imaginary “narrative”?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Yes
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,So having a platform for indies and well some games like Baldurs gate is trash gotsha let them rot
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Calling Death Stranding a Walking Simulator = ''I didn't play the game and I'm not basing my opinion on what the game actually has to offer''.

Although it's valid and respectable if a post-apocalyptic logistics planning game with shooting action, horror touches and many unconventional gimmicks is not your cup of tea at all."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Like give them a category where they can shine, but None of the games are truly addicting, which was what games use to be."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I’d bet you cash money that it’s going to win quite a few game of the year awards when all is said and done.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Playstation exclusive franchise. I didn't realise there had been many Astrobot games until recently. It's weird this one is being nominated because it is actually the same game they've made many times, this one just has references to a lot of different Sony franchises."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It’s a start to finish Mario rip off
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"They give their dev studios the creative freedom to risk a new IP every generation instead of relying on a IP just because its successful.

Guerilla Games : Killzone(PS3)>Horizon(PS4)"

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I think they are referring to nominations
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Nintendo had both BotW and Mario Odyssey nominated for GOTY in 2017.

If the company delivered, they should be rewarded ;)

Beside, every year Sony had 2 games nominated, both were great games."

Of the games listed above Only God of War (2018) & The Last of Us, Part II have actually won the award (with Astro Bot as a pending given the awards this year are next week)."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"this lists nominees not winners, God of War did win that year tho"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I actually played all of my old games during the lockdown
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I saw a post earlier that said it was 5 years today they found the first case of Rona. Crazy to think half a decade passed
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Those 2 years blur together for me
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"There will be but from that leak awhile back, it’s looking like R&C will have a new game every start of a new generation 

Like a launch title

Which as a big R&C fan, sucks"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"There damm well better be. 

Or at least make the old games playable natively. My internet sucks and I can’t effectively stream them. And the less said about trying to emulate them on pc. The better."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,the devs put out Spiderman 2 after but i think the leak showed that the devs are basically gonna be a marvel studio for the next decade
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Well from what I heard the closest date seems to be 2029... It's a shame Insomniac turned it's back to the game that made them be what they are, but well I guess Marvel games have that much pull."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I played both so my timeline is all sorts of confused. The PS version feels more recent and the PC version feels like it's been longer.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Amen
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,But then how will I know who my mom is sleeping with? There's apparently a LOT of people...
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Also, multiplayer games only have a shelf life of a few years until the player base moves on to the next Call of Duty. 

The Game of the Year award typically goes to something more timeless that can be played again in a few years. So you can actually play the GOTY 2014."

Im pretty sure people playing Multiplayer games just dont give a fuck about these awards. I mean I havent seen anything from most of the games on this list."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,People like competition and playing with friends. Idk that's how I feel these days
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"As an extrovert working from home, gaming is one of my social times. So single player games really aren't something I'm interested and they really just seem lonely.

I'm glad others find enjoyment in it though. I'm guessing it's a good recharge moment for many."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Some people find facing another human opponent mentally engaging
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"100%

I just recently started playing WoW again after almost 10 years (I know...) only because they've finally introduced actual single-player end game content. You can run regular dungeons with a team of NPC's or do ""delves"" by yourself or with a single friend. 

It's so much more enjoyable when you don't have to play with a group full of try-hards that exist purely to shit on people that don't spend every waking moment min-maxing their characters and playstyles."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Man but that is part of the fun of playing online games listening to hateful morans talk utter nonsense is always a good laugh. Don't let some 13-year-old call of duty shitter ruin games for you. That means the troll has won, well in their eyes."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,And even Overwatch winning came with lots of criticism as Overwatch didn't have the most nominations that year but won anyway.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It takes two ?!
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Baldur's Gate 3 has a very robust multi-player (including splitscreen) but it's not competitive multi-player if that's what you mean.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"There was also it takes two, that wasn’t single player"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It Takes Two and Baldurs Gate 3
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,True
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Also most reviewers can only spend relatively little time per game, leading to easier story driven games getting higher scores."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Yeah, I mean, wtf would Playstation have on there? They don't make multiplayer games often. The only ones in recent time I can think of is Concord and Helldivers."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Because some random exec once said that it's better to focus on multi-player than single-player and Reddit gamers felt so insulted they can't let it go years later
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Concord 🤓
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"In 2023 they publicly announced their focus would be live service multiplayer games:

>https://www.polygon.com/22914172/sony-playstation-bungie-acquisition-new-live-service-games

They planned to launch 12 live service in like 3 years.

>Ryan adds: ""The way people play games has changed a lot over the last few years. We have created some wonderful properties over the course of the last 25 years, with characters that people love and resonate the world over. Offering the opportunity to enjoy those experiences in a completely different way is something that we are very excited about.

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"> Single player exclusives move consoles.

Probably true, but consoles are usually sold at cost or even cheaper, so moving more of them isn't worth much. There's a reason Playstation titles are going cross-platform and Xbox is abandoning the idea of a distinct console."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I mean honestly Xbox’s first upcoming first party output looks really good imo.

I know the general consensus is that their finished and all their games are going multiplatform, but until it actually starts happening en masse; I still think it’s pretty worth it to support what they got.

I mean, other then Gears E-Day and State of Decay 3 (and even then both start out as single player games), a lot of their first party exclusives are single player.

With at least Avowed, South of Midnight, and Fable confirmed for this year, with other stuff like Perfect Dark, Clockwork Revolution, Outer Worlds 2, OD etc.

Maybe I’m just being a dumb fanboy, idk but I personally think there’s plenty to be excited for."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Agree. Look how many units Nintendo moves because of the new Zelda, Mario, Pokemon, or other mainline series release. On the other hand, Xbox has always wanted to compete in the multiplayer arena. I personally stick with PlayStation because I prefer single player, story-driven games."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,">Sony Pictures understands movies,

Do they? Madam Web is a flop and just 7 years ago Sony was very close to selling off their studio division after like 8 flops in a row. 

Let's not act like theyre a blue chip studio pushing out hit after hit."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I'm on my 2nd, very long, play-through of *Red Dead Redemption 2*.

The first play-through was on the PS4. I've never been able to really get into the GTA games, though I did try and totally get why people like it.

If Rockstar can make even 1 game every ~2 years on the same level as RDR2 or GTA - I feel comforted in knowing that there will be something really immersive waiting when i'm ready.

RDR2 on the PS5 looks incredible, too. As far as i'm aware there's no PS5 specific patches for it either."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It's the other way around. Kadokawa (fromsoft parent) is facing a hostile takeover from a chinese company and went to Sony to get ahead of it.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,You say that but people play multiplayer games way more. People that have friends at least.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"but Nate's Story is over, I prefer a game with Chloe and Sully or a young Sully game"

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"While I love the series and would love another go at it, I don’t want a 5. Nate’s story is done and they wrapped it up in such a fantastic way I hope they leave it be. They can still do more Uncharted games, but not with Nate and the rest of the crew."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,4 is close because the story and gameplay are better. BUT that Uncharted 2 pacing is just unmatched
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Yeah the spectacle might have gotten a little too grand imo. But 2 was the perfect upgrade to 1, which was fine but nothing special. The set pieces, solid gameplay (and awesome mp), AND extras (like playing with 0 gravity or fat drake lol) was so fun.

Plus, the graphics looked so insane back in the ps3 days."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I’m pretty sure multiplayer is 60fps on the PS4 version, only single player is 30fps."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Classic Naughty Dog. They did the same thing with the Last of Us.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Just Sony. They're big fans of buying IPs and then sitting on them.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Nothing to do with FromSoft. Sone owns the IP
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"It's the silksong curse. Every time someone on the internet asks for bloodborne on pc, it gets delayed another day. I think we're looking at a few decades out for both at this point..."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"You have to be right. The amount of people that want it is staggering. PS doesn’t hate making money. Somebody, somewhere, messed up."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Not really. Bethesda don't actually release a game as often. And Fromsoft has only been a contender since Dark Souls era started. Like think about it. Since 2011 Bethesda itself has only released Skyrim, Fallout 4, Fallout 76 and Starfield. That's only 4 games in 13 years. And 76 wasn't even really all them. "

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I’m sorry to be a little bitch here…but God of War winning over RDR2 still boggles my mind man.  Like, GoW is objectively a great ass game sure…but winning over Red Dead?!  Just…wild."

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Surprised GOW beat RDR2. But from what I recall Sony and Nintendo just time their releases to not get in each other's way. Like the year before this Breath of the Wild and Mario Odyssey released, and the year after was Smash Bros Ultimate."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Bro I’m sorry…Deem Eternal is hilarious. I spent way too many minutes trying to figure out what that game was, then I realized and had a good laugh over it!🤣🤣"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Wow I forgot how bad of a year 2021 was.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,2015 was such a good year.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"2017 was an insane year and they didn't even nominate Xenoblade Chronicles 2 which could've easily been in the list. 


2023, also an insane year. So many great games  that didn't make the list but could've."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Yeah, the Horizon series has a track record of releasing extremely close to the biggest and most hyped game of the year. 

I love the Horizon series and feel fully confident that Horizon 3 will be released the same day as a surprise collaboration between FromSoftware and Nintendo for their game: Zelda: Link to the Erd Tree, written by a resurrected Tolkien."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It happening once is tragedy. It happening twice is comedy.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I was like top 150 in the world at that game but it was before the era of esports and I was never quite that good at another game again lol :(
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Spike Video Game Awards was the predecessor to TGA. Also hosted and produced by the same guy, Geoff Keighley  :)"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"The story? Yes. Gameplay, i found it better and more smooth."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Even if it was a step down I would still list it as one of the best games of the year.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I quit playing it and I really wanted to get all the costumes and 100% it. It was so bad is so many different ways.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I don't think Spiderman 1 even deserves to be nominated, other than the web swinging (which isn't even new) everything about the gameplay was pretty generic."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Also a great intro to video games overall. It’s my 5year old’s first game and she loves it. Been coming home every day asking to play the “robot game”.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,">  It reminds me of the old Mario Galaxy games.

I wonder why?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"PS2 was the actual innovation era. 

PS3 was the beginning of the modern Triple A market. 

Further, PS3 actively inhibited developers because of its much more arcane and closed requirements. 

Hence why we have never had a port of Metal Gear Solid 4 (unlike the first three PS2 games), because it was designed to work with PS3 hardware and that made porting it a massive headache. 

Compare the ease of transition for example from PS4 to PS5 (generally smooth front-ports), compared to PS3 to PS4 (needed its own emulation service)."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I really miss MAG. Id like to see it done again in some form.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"As much as I’d like to see Microsoft step it back up to their glory days of the 360 era, I just don’t see it. They’ve had multiple chances to catch back up and reclaim a foothold by acquiring multiple studios, only to close them afterwards, and every time they try to bring a classic franchise back to prominence (Halo Infinite), or introduce a new one (Starfield), it seems like they take one confident step forward, and (if they’re lucky only one) step back."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Meh, I own all the consoles and still spend a **lot** of time on my SX. Gamepass is the best gaming deal available today.

Nintendo and Sony digital prices are ridiculous and whilst PS+ is better than it was it still lacks a lot of exclusives sadly which is all I want from it.

Plus a few decent gems over the last few years from MS backed studios too imo. Just because they aren't console exclusives people dismiss them.

People always apply the wrong metric which is sales, without realising that Microsoft still move a ton of units given they have always predominantly struggled in the East and Sony/Nintendo have heritage"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Rather have game developers instead of more consoles.

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Generally Microsoft has a ton of games getting nominations in other categories other than GOTY.

And I personally think they were robbed many times, with Hi-Fi Rush potentially being the most obvious one."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Nintendos a half a year to a year out from launching a new console by all the rumors. It's understandable for them to have a lighter year. 
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Yeah it's kinda ridiculous Echoes of Wisdom didn't get a nomination. That game is so much fun and really creative.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"The Game Awards and yes its considered by most to be the ""definitive"" one"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Wait a second, is that the one with Geoff Keighley? Or am I thinking of a different one?"

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"For its development and release, it was published under Sony. That seems the most reasonable way to do this."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,90 metacritic 8.8 user score. 10 million units sold in 3 months. If these were the stats for any other game you wouldn't be saying this but for some reason it's popular on here to shit talk SM2.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,This dude definitely leaves negative reviews on Steam after 1000 hours of playtime.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I mean FH5 was also well scored, yet only won in sports category"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I know. That's why I said it would be interesting to see them if they existed.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,All except Bloodborne
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,bloodborne is of the half the games i haven't played
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I mean it's a general rule, not a law of nature. Fromsoft games usually get a nomination even though they aren't cinematic."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Oh non, don't get me wrong, it was not about bragging about PC being better of whatever

Just that they really ported of those game, except Bloodborne, I don't care about it but I know a lot of people would kill to have it, so it's just sad

I waited Ghost of Tsushima for 4 years, I know, so poor Bloodborne enjoyers =/"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,You played baldurs gate 3 right?
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"See I want games to be available on all platforms so I can play with whom ever I want. They make good games except concord. Higher quality is not really true as we have seen much better titles come out from smaller studios like baulders gate 3 from laurian studios. Sony has good games yes. 

Corporations like sony destroy the quality of games over time. The profits always need to go up. This is why we are seeing studios shut down. 

Studios need to be smaller and create good games without messing them up with corporate over sight."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Yeah they would give them more sales and help finance bigger games

But it is what it is w Sony being wierd"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Ok? But Sony does have talent, 9/10 Sony games are great, I was just saying the bad ones get treated the same as the good. Spiderman 2 was to put it nicely, bad but it still got shoehorned into awards when other games very obviously did better."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"And Sony killed off Japan studio, so there goes the neighborhood."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Actually Sony had 100% say on both of those games and IP and still do for Bloodborne. They just this year sold the Death Stranding IP back to Kojima, and they can do whatever they want with Bloodborne with or without Fromsofts permission or input. It would be pointless and stupid but they could give any dev studio and have them release Bloodborne 2 if they wanted to"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,And those are the best two on the list.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Bloodborne was actually codeveloped with a Playstation Studio and they own the IP, it isnt a stretch to call the game itself a first party game"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Death Stranding was from Kojima Studios which is independent from Sony. They had a contract for DS and Kojima fully owns the rights again as of this year.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Don't be sad that no Xbox exclusives made it to the list
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Neither is “failing game division swings their companies Monopoly money to purchase largest casual gaming market”
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,That's a fair take. I haven't played it but I've watched a playthrough online for a while. It's not my type of game. But I'm glad it's being more well recieved than it once was. I like Hideo Kojima and Norman Reedus.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Seems to me it was marketed as a post apocalyptic exploration game

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Ive played like 40 hrs of it and it literally requires you to hold and release the damn shoulder buttons in order to walk into cutscenes. You're essentially a deliveryman who walks. If you don't press buttons to walk you trip over yourself. It's hours of just walking at times. It was talked up to be a whole new genre of videogame entertainment called a ""strand game"" by Kojima. The first question I ask when playing a game is ""is this fun?"" If it isn't, it does not matter how interesting the plot is. In my opinion this would've been better as a short series on HBO or something rather than a game.

""I don't like his opinion so I'll just say he didn't play it""

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I think the last of us ""fans"" are mad at me.

- Uncharted is like a 7. It's not bad but it's not GotY worthy of any year.
- Walking Simulator is a 5 if you didn't want to watch a movie. If you like watching your games play themselves than I can see this being a 10.

It can't be those that did it 

People must be mad I scorned Last Of Us part 2. I didn't even rip into it."

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Well they owned it like i said. Past tense, so the picture and title above isn't true anymore. Just because it was doesn't mean it still counts"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I just saw Death Stranding as 2019 and panicking. I just started playing it….

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Damn thats a shame... while i really like the spiderman games there is something different about the R&C games, i grew up with them"

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"That's not always the case, there are plenty of old multiplayer games that still have a healthy enough playerbase to keep the game alive."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"> Also, multiplayer games only have a shelf life of a few years until the player base moves on to the next Call of Duty. 

Meanwhile, Battlefield 4 came out in 2013 and is *still* populated with [thousands of players every day](https://steamcharts.com/app/1238860).

It's not that MP games die off quickly, it's that shallow, power-fantasy driven MP games in series with annual releases die off quickly because those IPs are intentionally designed to have a shelf-life of only 1 year."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"It's kinda the opposite, the best multiplayer games last so long and they can only win once."

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I just responded to the main comment, but wow just introduced a lot of single-player end game content. You can run regular dungeons now with a team of NPC players (that are actually quite capable) or you can do mini-dungeons called ""delves"" by yourself or with a single friend. 

I've been playing it again for about a month and it's actually fun again."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,There's nothing about GOTY that implies it has to go to whatever game got the most nominations.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I think it was deserved. It's kind of like Elden Ring vs GoW Ragnarok. Both are fantastic games, but one of them absolutely dominated all conversation for that year. It was the same with OW back then."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Nominations aren’t a vote

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I really wouldn't say that's mp. It's basically a tradtional single player games designed around co-op. Most mp games aren't considered because they lack story elements.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Maybe non-PvP is more accurate
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Definitely not making multiplayer games anytime soon after the last one
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Bless you for finally figuring out the real question I was asking.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,The strategy shift that brought us Concord
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Nowhere did they say they would FOCUS on live service. The majority of their ongoing projects are single player games. Of those 12 included GT and MLB.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Which is fucking stupid and I think might be start of the decline of Sony. Sony’s brand is built upon high quality single player games. A lot of the people that buy Sony consoles are single player gamers that like their single player games. To completely ditch that to go to live service is basically alienating the type of people that buy your console.

I’m guessing they recognized this was an overall bad decision and that’s why factions and the Spider-Man live service was cancelled. Yes they need some live service games so they have a secure moneymaker that allows them to pump out high quality single player games, since costs of games keep rising. However to turn all their brands into live service shit was dumb from the beginning. 

Last 4 Sony games, only 1 was the usual sony good quality. Concord was the biggest flop in triple a gaming history. The until Dawn remake got questionable reviews, and same with the lego horizon game. Astro bot was the only one of the games that you would expect from Sony.

They might be fucked and there is no right answer. They clearly want to shift away from single player games because dev costs keep going up which makes them to risky to make. However out of any dev or publisher on the planet, Sony is known for its single player titles. They are literally built around that market."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"PlayStation is going cross platform because they recognize they can profit from PC players who continually ask for their games to be made available to them. They have been successful in their ecosystem and recognize that they can profit even more from PC players who quite literally demand their products. 

Yes you are right, consoles are typically sold at a loss, that’s what makes exclusives so important. They are the incentive to invest in a specific console. Similar to what I said about exclusives move consoles. Xbox is abandoning distinct consoles because theirs have been underselling by comparison and need to offer up their products across the market to remain profitable after purchasing the largest casual gaming market for close to $70 billion. 

The difference is Sony has done well in their contained ecosystem and now they are pandering to PC players while Microsoft needs to offer their products everywhere to help them turn over a profit after spending way too much of the company’s Monopoly money to make overpriced purchases."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Avowed and clockwork revolution might move the needle for me. Those look good from what I saw. But will they stay exclusive? Microsoft’s strategy now is taking the “moral high road” and make their games multi platform. Nvm you that they are double dipping in profit margins because they recognize that in order for gamepass to continually release quality day one exclusives they need to sell games as well as take in subscription money. I’m worried Xbox is going to be more about profits than quality experiences like Ubisoft or EA became. The examples you provide do help dissolve those worries a bit.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"One thing I've appreciated about the games Microsoft has put out over the past generation is the fact that they seem to be taking risks with the games they put out. Yeah, they've released a lot of stinkers and haven't really managed to achieve Sony's level of quality when it comes to their games, but just look at the kind of games they put out this gen. We've gotten multiple flight simulators, multiple RTS titles, a wonderful survival crafting game (grounded), A multiplayer pirate FPS (Sea of Thieves), several smaller scale RPGs from Obsidian, as well as a game like Psychonauts 2, which in all likelihood wouldn't exist if Microsoft didn't purchase Double Fine. Meanwhile when I look over at Sony's first party titles while I see nothing but great games, I also see almost nothing but single player third person action games. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, and those titles would absolutely make me pick up a playstation over an xbox. I just appreciate that Xbox seems to be letting developers take risks rather than be stuck in the back half of the 360 era where everything was just Gears of War, Halo, and Forza."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Right? Sony has a couple exceptional movies surrounded by an ocean of garbage. The gaming division is probably the only thing keeping them afloat. Even then I'd argue it's not even thanks to a superior platform. They simply own the right devs and have THE recognizable brand
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Sony can afford to gamble on bad movies, it's part of their strategy.

But acting like they haven't delivered absolute bangers like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, Venom, Bullet Train, Elysium, or even the delightful chaos of Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs? That's willful ignorance.

Here’s the thing, Sharknado 7 isn’t a masterpiece that demanded sequels. It exists because studios can milk tax write-offs from movies that bomb just hard enough. It’s not about the audience, it's about the balance sheet.

When you're as rich as Sony, bad movies aren’t failures. They’re calculated losses, paving the way for even bigger wins on the projects they actually care about. It's the cinematic equivalent of throwing a pawn to protect the queen."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I mean... if you're a game Studio and you run to Sony to save you, than Sony it's probably the preferable game Studio you would want to work for."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"> People that have friends at least.

You say this as if the modern multiplayer games *weren't* designed around matchmaking complete strangers with each other. I'm not sure there's any correlation between having friends and playing popular multiplayer games, and I'm certainly not confident which direction that correlation would point."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Playing a game more doesn’t necessarily mean you enjoy the game itself more. Personally my enjoyment in multiplayer games come largely from the social aspect, whereas I only play single player games if I really want to play that game itself. I can only speak for myself, but I’ve hopped on a game countless times for countless hours that I didn’t necessarily feel like playing at that moment, but did anyway because some buddies hopped on."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"yeah, cant have Nates daughter go around killing a foreign private army too"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Yes, or a Sully and Sam spinoff since they seemed to team up at the end of 4 if I’m remembering right"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I don't think they bought Bloodborne. Sony approached From to make a game for them, so they own the IP"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Nah that’s literally the Microsoft playbook. 

Sony at least releases games, even if they stay console exclusive forever. I can’t remember the last time I was excited for a Microsoft game release. Maybe Gears of War 3 was the last time"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Others addressed that Sony didn't ""buy the IP and sit on it"" but also sometimes things don't need 27 sequels."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"yeah but I really wonder what they're getting from that. From a financial perspective, there's absurd amonuts of money to be made. Instead, they remaster demon's souls..."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"You are thinking of Bethesda the studio, the stat refers to Bethesda the publisher which has way more games than Fromsoft"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"This is about Bethesda as a publisher which would include the games from Id Software, Machine Games, Arkane etc. In fact, of the 4 games counted here, only one was developed by Bethesda Game Studios."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"We may be confusing Bethesda the publisher (which has many more games than 4 in the past 13 years) and Bethesda the studio.  

Based on the OP’s description, I had assumed their list refers to Bethesda the publisher, but I could be mistaken."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Yet, the scale of that achievement really depends on the competition too. This is especially true for this years nominees in my opinion, not that these nominees aren’t all fantastic games, but lets be honest here, most of these wouldn’t have stood a chance against games like Breath of the Wild, Elden Ring (proper), God of War"

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I love both, but saying RD2 is better than God of War? Madness. RD2's story went on a little too long, the world was somewhat empty in places. Compare that to God of War 2018?! not even close."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Agreed. I like both, but I have 655 hours in RDR2 and like 104 in GoW. Many of the below comments that think RDR2 is boring just need to admit it's not a game for you if that's what you truly feel. "

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I thought the story was miles (no pun intended) better. They actually did some pretty interesting things with the villains and the theme of reform was really mature for a superhero story, let alone one told as a video game."

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"The term ''Strand Game'' refers to the game's Social Strand System, the asynchronous multiplayer feature in which players collaborate with each other by leaving ladders or climbing anchors, building bridges, roads, safehouses, watchtowers, recharging points, ziplines, donating gear and materials, signaling dangers and points of interest, returning lost cargo, even during boss fights another player's character can emerge from the ground to give you weapons and healing items, a multiplayer element about connecting players instead of having them fight each other."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Seriously? and the vehicles? the tons of new features and devices of all kinds that you unlock throughout the entire game? building infrastructure to facilitate and optimize your deliveries? the BTs? the Mules? the terrorist faction? the travels to the world wars? planning your route? planning the gear and tools you will take with you to overcome the dangers and environmental obstacles along the way? the collaborative multiplayer features?

It's also valid not self-impose you to walk everywhere and ignore the interesting game content just because the first opinion you heard about the game was from someone lying that that walking was the only thing it had to offer. That or you only played for 1 hour and assumed you'd seen everything"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"No, only you are mad because you tried to shove your SUBJECTIVE opinion to everyones face

However, revenue alone doesn’t determine profitability. Operating profit, which accounts for expenses, provides a clearer picture. In 2021, Sony’s gaming division had an operating profit of $2.63 billion. Microsoft doesn’t publicly disclose operating profit for its Xbox division, making direct comparisons challenging. - chatgpt"

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Ragnarok had incredible pacing and acting and writing as well. It flowed like an incredible epic action story. Elden ring is amazing in it's own ways but is best experienced in your own path carving your own way. And essentially has no writing or acting performances besides one off characters and boss intros. And deep lore for the writing.

Lol, No. 

Sony makes great phones, cameras, TVs, audio and musical engineering equipment, ect. Video games aren't even their specialty and they still do it better than most.


Because they are a dominant force in the Tech industry is exactly why they have a dominant console in the first place."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"> The gaming division is probably the only thing keeping them afloat.

That's not true, the music record label makes them [more profit than the gaming division](https://www.statista.com/statistics/912798/sony-operating-income-by-segment/). The gaming division is second and the camera and entertainment hardware businesses are third and fourth in terms of profit, respectively.


> They simply own the right devs and have THE recognizable brand

They have the recognizable brand because they built it from the ground up and know how to nurture new developers and build them into powerhouses. Look at Naughty Dog and Insomniac, which were both making lower budget platformers during the PS2 era and are now releasing critically-acclaimed blockbusters.

Invalidating this and acting like they got there by chance is weird considering Microsoft has significantly more resources than Sony and still can't compete with them in gaming."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"This is what I have been telling people as well. Kakodawa is going to be bought no matter what, and Sony is the best way for them to go (Tencent is the next big buyer, for example)."

It's kinda dated and I'm tired of the way the characters control, where you touch a rock or a slight incline and your character flops immediately like they are a wet noodle. There's some cool ragdolling, but it ends up hurting gameplay a lot (like in another game that tries this, dragon's dogma 2.)"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Red Dead's problems is that it's too bloated.

the campaign is way too long for it's own good."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"And some of the flaws are HUGE, unignorable, and completely pervasive. Down to the very basics like ""controlling your character is clunky and unfun."" And ""there needs to be a better gameplay loop than 'go to place, shoot 30 people, leave place to go to another place.'"""
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I think it's because RDR2 was a much more popular game than GoW with nearly 3x the sales. So I don't think it's so crazy for people to assume that would reflect in awards.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"The length of RDR2 is one of my favorite parts tbh. It added a lot to the world and characters and made the emotional moments hit a lot harder. I would disagree with it feeling empty, maybe if you compare it to a linear game like god of war but for an open world game, the world felt very alive and there were always unique moments wherever you went. It’s not for everyone but for the right audience (me) RDR2 is basically perfect, I’ve spent hundreds of hours doing nothing but hunting, fishing, gambling, taking care of my horses, robbing, and just riding around looking at the world."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Rdr2 had better story and character writing, better world design, and more attention to detail across the board. GOW had more engaging active gameplay on average though. Still red dead was the better game by a long shot."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"GOW 2018 is a good story-based action game. 

RDR2 is a creative masterpiece."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I thought Deathloop was pretty good as well. Resident Evil Village while not the best RE game is definitely a solid addition to the series
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Yep.  I'd have picked TotK myself but I can definitely see why BG3 won, it's been a gaming sensation."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Hard disagree. It would have definitely been a close contender in 2021.
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"True, and the thing that made them both stand out was the characters, writing, and story. Peter and Otto, Jin and Shimura had such great chemistry, the family to adversary shift was so well done and the tragedy of both was just so well executed in spite of the relatively cookie-cutter framework they were build upon. "
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"FH5 and Flight Sim 2020 were two of the highest rated games that launched that year, but these awards always never nominate niche genres for the GotY position."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Highest rated game that year I think. Racing games never get nominated, or even looked at. TGA has a style they like, and I would be very surprised if any heavy multiplayer, live service (launch), or gameplay heavy game will get a win from it. 

Let us be real, CoD has more or less perfected the 'fps' genre, but itll never get a nod because we are used to that sort of perfection for a fps from CoD. Heck the tech from Flight Sim was incredible, but it didnt have a story so it doesnt get looked at."

I own the game


I have played it

I didn't like it

You like it

That's ok

It's too dry and too long of a start of just hours upon hours of walking. I tried to like it but can't. It's a walking sim. There's QoL stuff later on but most of the crap your thinking about is the directors cut shit to make the game more tolerable"

If you liked it before but didn't want to worry about having to play with people to experience the end game content (minus raids), then yeah, I'd recommend it. 

Thats just my personal opinion though. Your mileage may vary."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,As a longtime player I'd say it's fine you want a multi-player experience that also has a lot of single player stuff to do. If you're playing exclusively single player don't waste your time here and play a real RPG.

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Seriously I swore off multiplayer games after Overwatch because I saw the direction it was going and doubted I’d get another experience like OW launch and the first year or 2. 

So if it came out 2016, I stopped playing in 2018ish which means I’ve been playing single player for 6 years and I can honestly say I’m happier because of that choice."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"It's still Elden Ring, even looking back on it. I've played through both multiple times, but GOWR doesn't hold a candle to the worldwide capture that ER had on the masses. It literally got casual players into the Souls series. It's still being talked about. It's still innovating with the DLC this past summer."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"True. It was one of those years where I wouldn't have begrudged a win for either game. I might prefer Ragnarok a bit more personally, but both are great."

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Honestly that's my current favorite live service game. The only reason I don't think Sony has gone all in on it is because they don't own Arrowhead. They own the helldiver's IP, but the studio that made it isn't owned by Sony.

Sony struck gold with helldiver's, and I think if they owned Arrowhead they would be doing a lot more support for it and advertising it, as well as having support studios helping out with content. Iirc Arrowhead doesn't want to be bought, but I can see them being worried if Arrowhead changes their mind down the line and Microsoft offers them a fat buyout. That would completely fuck them over."

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I hope it's not Demon's Souls level. The atmosphere of blood born is probably not very flexible, and the Demon Soul remake made enough changes to affect Bloodborn's atmosphere."

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I don’t disagree per se, but I’d argue it’s much more apparent in GTAV then RDR2."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I think you have it the wrong way round. God of War was a cinematic masterpiece, Red Dead 2 was a great story driven open world game."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"None of the games that were nominated that year were bad. Dread was amazing, Village and Psychonaughts were both very good, and Deathloop was a great premise but I found got a touch stale after 30 hours. The only game I found to not be worth a nomination is ironically the winner It Takes Two.

The problem with that year is that, imo, any nominee from any other year would have likely won the award that year. Ff7 or Ghost of Tsushima gets delayed or Horizon or XC3 release earlier? Sure win."

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I just wrote that definition 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️

As I said in my first comment, it's okay for people to dislike it for legitimate reasons, but if you say that the game is exclusively about walk everywhere you clearly didn't played it for 40 hours, that's the length of the main story alone, you would have seen bosses, enemies, vehicles and everything I mentioned and more."
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"If after the first few hours you are walking everywhere instead of using vehicles, raiding enemy camps to farm resources and building infrastructure to facilitate your deliveries, you are doing something deeply wrong, did you stay in the tutorial area for dozens of hours or something?"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"No, but you only said that Uncharted is a 7 game that shouldnt be GOTY nominated, and DS is a dumb movie walking sim. That to me is shoving your opinion as a fact and not an opinion"
1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"That is interesting. Sony generates the most revenue but has the least profit between the big 3. Could this imply that they invest more into their gaming hardware/software and its users benefit from that?

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,i think some people just expect every main story quest in a single player game to be mission impossible the entire way. imho those are just adhd teenagers used to high octane cod campaigns or some shit. sometimes single play RPG's and action RPGs need slower pacing at times to have dialogue with new characters and build relationships. such as atreus and angrboda going around the realm on her little quest. and so forth. i am okay with all of this. its developing a well written story with fully fleshed out characters etc.

Infinite had a really rough launch and while it’s not the best Halo game the current multiplayer experience is fun and active enough to be a good time.

It's only recently picked up again where we're seeing good games and a lot of them. Uncharted is a popcorn game. It's not a 9 or a 10 imo. I didn't say it was bad... A 7 is good... 

A 9/10 is like Zelda level. Is this anywhere near that? Hell no.

Why don't you talk to me about the game you're mad about.


Last of Us people tend to be unhinged and have fringe opinions. It's like what's going on with that Wicked movie. You have movie watchers (last of us fans) who want to just watch a movie in a property they enjoy and a bunch of theatre kids are singing and being rude in the theatre (last of us two fans), gatekeep it, and start crying at a child's movie. If someone asks them to be quiet or stop crying about it they go on a long winded explanation on how a trope-filled story is the best thing ever written and you ""must not get it"" even though it's the most simple story concept ever.


I'm only expanding on my opinion btw because you had to ironically say I'm wrong on my opinion. I'm not shoving shit in your face that you didn't ask for."

1h5mnet,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"If your complaint is that the game supposedly exclusively offers walking bored for hours, you probably didn't play it, played 1 hour and gave up, went in circles in the tutorial area, played it blindfolded or something like that."

What a day"

18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,"Am I the only one considering that this might not be a straight adaptation, but a new untold story in the universe that the game established? I'd love to see what happened at the beginning of the Death Stranding, rather than a straight up retelling of what the game already covered"
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,That seems redundant.
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,"Knowing adaptations, they’ll probably recast everyone just for shits and giggles"
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,I loved Death Stranding as a game experience but idk if I want to watch it as a movie

18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,But who are they going to cast to look like these unique looking characters?
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,This is going to be like a 3 and a half hour movie.
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,SNNAAAAAAKKKKKKEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,I don't know what to think of this...
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,Trying to shorten a game with 7 hours of cutscenes into a 2 hour movie sounds fun.
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,I’m hoping it’s set in the world of death stranding and not just the same plot.
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,"I already watched Death Stranding movie. On YouTube. Shit was crazy, but really long."
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,A perfect match. I'm expecting it to be underwhelming and incoherent. DS gameplay was great but the more I played the less I liked. EEAAO was great scifi for people that don't watch scifi.
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,"Oh yay. Weird, pompous bullshit in movie format this time."
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,Hopefully his games don’t go south because he focuses to much on the movie.
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,Perfect partnership
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,I actually think this might make a better movie than the game. There’s a lot of cool shit in death stranding. But traversing being the core mechanic of the gameplay loop is never going to grab me. But from a cinematic perspective. This could be pretty fucking dope.
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,Got the game yesterday! Good timing. Heard it's very unusual and might be boring. I like weird stuff so hoping to enjoy ...
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14, In the hands of most studios I wouldn't trust that this would be any good but A24 are pretty solid when it comes to quality. Even if I don't like all of their movies I wouldn't call any of them terrible.
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,But death standing is the movie
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,Guessing that connect with Jordan Peele is paying off
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,Always thought it would’ve made a way better movie than a game. Too many cool ideas and visuals
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,3 hour cutscenes are upon us
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,Kojimbo has an infinite stock of smoke grenades.
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,Now we just need Quentin Tarantino to start making games.
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,So they think Kojima can tell a concise story in 90 minutes? Or is this movie going to serve as the opening cutscene for a twelve-season TV show?
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,i want dis
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,A movie about a post apocalyptic mailman fighting goo monsters with piss and blood.
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,"If its done right, it'll influence another Kojima film game to be adapted and launch his career as a writer/director on new IPs"
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,What was the point of all the story cutscenes in the game then
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,"It's always entertaining to me to see how polarizing Death Stranding is. It truly is a ""love it or hate it"" thing with this game.  
That said, any Death Stranding *movie* is gonna be a fuckin' mess. Calling it now."
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-15,Can’t wait to be bored watching Norman Reeds walk and deliver packages.
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-15,As long as Mads is in it we all good.
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-15,What font is on that webpage?
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-15,"As much as I hate to say it, I think Kojima's ego is going to get in the way of this being a good movie."
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-15,Should be very fun watching Norman Reedus trying to balance himself as he walks!
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-15,Oh great a movie of Reedus carrying a Fetus while walking 2 hours around the mountains.
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-15,"Let's hope they can make the plot way more coherent and for the love of god, do not use the ""princess beach"" line."
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-15,"I know that Kojima puts a lot of cinema inside his games but I don't know if Death Stranding is the best to put on film. I think the actual gameplay does the heavy lifting to put you in the right mood to enjoy the story presented in the cutscenes, I fear it might turn into a snooze fest if not handled right."
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-15,But did Monster Energy agree to appear?
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-15,How is the gameplay for this game?
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-15,Oh good now I’ll get to watch Norman Reedus deliver packages instead of doing it myself.
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,"Why? The story telling is the worst part of his games. I tried playing Death Stranding. Soon as I found out the cut-scenes were un-skippable, I quit and uninstalled."
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,That will be one boring terribly write story if it stays true to the source
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,Zzz Kojima needs to lay off the celeb worship.
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,So you pick his worst game.
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,Fuck offfff Kojima
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,"A24 got the backrooms, hazbin hotel, and death stranding? How?"
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,"I really don’t understand the hate some people have for the game. Everyone’s allowed to have their opinions but I just don’t get why people absolutely despise the game.

Is it just that you would’ve rather had another Metal Gear or what? Not trying to rage-bait, just genuinely curious. 

The story definitely took a couple play throughs for me to understand but I don’t think that’s a completely valid reason to absolutely despise a game. And I don’t get how you could love and praise Metal Gear but hate this when they seem equally as confusing."
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,Will the story be as bad as it was in the game?
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,Great an awful game being made into a shitty movie can't wait
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,Postman Pat is already a movie isn’t it?
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,Did anyone else hate this game? A walking sim with in-game ads. Yay.
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,Please not that studio. A24 is ass
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,Let this IP go. Jesus
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,I like the idea of Kojima making a movie…just not Death Stranding.
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-15,"I don't have any hopes of this. The joy of the Kojima games is the subtle first few hours where everything seems realistic/normal with a great mystery. Right before it just dials it up to 11 with weird sci-fi, allegorical named characters, and titillating women being put into questionable situations.

I'm going to watch it, but probably in a method that gives whomever makes it the least amount of money. :("
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,"if the movie isn't just 2 hours of Norman Reedus hiking, I'm gonna be pissed"
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,Yeah isn’t the last cut scene after the big boss like at least an hour?
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,Good thing that's not what they're doing then. It's going to be a different story based in the universe.
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,"Well. They manage to shorten 1200 page books into single movies, so im guessing they’ll manage. How good it will be, we wont know."
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,They’ll probably go the route of splitting the first game into two movies
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-15,That's actually feasible. I remember hearing movies can be shot with well over 5 hours of film. That's why editors make the big unsung bucks. They along with the director have to make something cohesive into a shorter form.
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-15,"7 Hours? That doesn't sound like nearly enough time to explain every mechanic three times, three different ways."
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,I hope his studio sticks around tho
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,"That or people will be like wtf is this guy smoking and he will come back to his true art form. 

But honestly hes an artist and a storyteller, give him a fucking tuba and he'll get you something out of it."
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,"You’re assuming his film career (if he is directing) is going to be a success.

Spoiler alert: It probably won’t be."
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,Call it a reverse George RR Martin.
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,"Well, that's unfair. You can't lose that. At some point he will die."
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-15,"Finally he gets his wish, then. It seemed more and more obvious the dude wished he were making movies rather than games; see the Snake voice actor controversy.

By all means, o temporarily embarrassed filmmaker, embrace your Hollywood fetish, and don't feel like you have to stick to what you seem to consider a less prestigious art form."
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-15,He's always wanted to do movies. He's a writer by profession before a game designer.
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-15,Kinda doubt it. You can do way more with Videogames nowadays compared to movies
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-15,He's a very good movie critic based on his tweets in every movie he watched.
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,"He's gonna make so it so that his games are required playing to understand his movies.

And promptly never given money to make a movie again :("

I'm so happy for her"
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,"This is Kojima. I don’t see him simply transitioning from games to movies, I see him revolutionizing the Director role into one that combines Entertainment + Interactive Media. He may craft a new role and a new medium."
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-15,"Please, Lord of the Rings came out 2 decades ago."

18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,I don't think this is based directly on the story in the game. I've heard it's supposed to be a separate thing in the same universe.
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,Chris Pratt
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,Even better if you read the blog post it literally says it's not a direct adaptation
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,The game practically IS a movie lol
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-17,Yeah the gameplay was a lot better than the story
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,More like 13 hours
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-15,Good thing it won't adapt the story of the game then.
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,"EEAAO definitely benefits from having a relatable story with the character relationships (or at least being very good at showing those relationships) while being surrounded by bizarre plot and visuals.  But in the same vein, I agree that there is not another movie studio and creative mind combo who could pull this setting off. 


This is one project where I think I would be ok with them taking their own liberties to craft a story that suits a live movie than having to take every scene to a literal 1-to-1 remake. The game Death Stranding already exists for the fans who want that extended storytelling; I am intrigued to see what these two can bring in short form film."
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,">EEAAO was great sci-fi.

FTFY"
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,"Sci-fi aside, do you also think A24 has a bad track record producing and distributing horror movies?"
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,I would agree with you except that it sounds like you're implying the gameplay is anything special
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,Metal Gear would require involving Konami (they own the property). I don't think Kojima has any desire to ever work with them again.
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,Probably not. Kojima's used to having complete creative control. I can't imagine they'll allow him that same amount of absolute freedom. That can only make the story better IMO.
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,New stranding type movie
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,"Won’t matter, people will still praise it"
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,Awful game???? DS is awesome
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,"Say what you will about the gameplay of DS but the story was definitely unique and interesting, I’d love to see a live action version"

18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,I think there's just a straight up 2 hour movie at the end.
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,"I might be wrong, but I think it might be closer to two hours, although I think it aufosaves occasionally so you can leave and come back."

18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-15,"I’m not sure if traditional cutscene is that long, but the credits section felt like it took forever"
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-16,"A prequel to the game could make a truly great movie, especially with a studio like A24. Nuclear like explosions happening all around the world with no explanation, invisible ghosts that only a small number of people can even sense. Timefall turning people to bones in minutes. The US quickly devolving into a collapsing dystopia. Could make a good horror flick"
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-15,"Nah, where would the ending of the first month in even be? I think they could tell that story in 2 hours and it might even help the story a bit."
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-16,I mean they also make movies out of novels that are pretty long.
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,"Fr. If Kojima shifted to movie development I wouldn't even be upset, but I hope he still has some creative guidance for his game studio if that happens."

Took me forever to realize he was saying Commonwealth.  And lastly, when Damon tells DiCaprio that he's gonna try another computer ""cause this one's getting all fucking bluuey"", he's actually trying to say the screen is becoming blurry."

18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-15,"I'd probably say a series. It did wonders for The Last of Us, which I could not see working nearly as impactful as a movie."
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-15,It's always been his dream to make movies so this does worry me about his future making games.
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-15,"The way his fans talk, you'd think death stranding was an incredible commercial success but he has admitted it took a couple years to just break even."
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,What person from EEAAO is involved?
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,[deleted]
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,Did you read my post thoroughly?
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-15,Because I’ve seen his other attempts at writing and directing in his video games.
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-15,"Well for one its not going to be a direct adaptation. I think it’s a story in the world of DS. Which tells me they like his world, not his stories. I’d be very surprised if his involvement is anything more than executive producer and special credits"
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,"None, and I would argue there's a good reason for that."

18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-15,Educate me. I've yet to play Kojima games but they've been on my radar. I thought they had legendary status?
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-15,[deleted]
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,"Well I'd argue that's a big reason why it's ""special"""
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-15,"He’s a great game designer, but a terrible writer and scene director. He makes B-movie plots in his games but because the bar is so low for writing and plot in video games, he gets lauded as an auteur.

Watch some of the cutscenes he’s created for his games and you will see what I mean. “Princess beach”, “Die hardman”, and the all-over-the-place plot of the Metal Gear games.

He’s obviously obsessed with films, makes friends with directors like GDT and NWR, but the dude can’t direct for shit. Being a film fan doesn’t automatically make you good at creating them."
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-15,Nothing wrong with enjoying B-movies
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,"In the context of what I was replying to, though, ""special"" meant not just *unique*, but also *good*."
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-15,Are any of the stories actually good in your opinion? Or is it that they're all good but executed badly?
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-15,[deleted]
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,"Sure, and if that's your opinion that's valid.

Personally, I think the gameplay is great. And I'm really happy that there can be such a unique game made with this kind of budget nowadays, especially in a sea of games that can blend together in many ways.

I definitely understand DS isn't for everyone — it's an inherently niche game published by one of the gaming giants. But there's a lot to love in it for those who *do* appreciate it. 

I think the movie has a lot of potential as well. The world of DS is just so intriguing imo, and the tone, visuals, and music are fantastic."
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-16,"Good thing that it sold 6 million copies (+4 million who played it on PC Game Pass and Playstation Plus) and got 94% positive reviews on Steam, has a sequel in development and was nominated for the GOTY and won 3 categories in the TGA of 2019."
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-15,"Well they’re B-movie plots, they are fun and there are hints of good ideas, the worlds are generally kind of interesting, but a lot of surface level philosophy and pretentious references.

As I say, great gameplay, but the dude is no writer/director."
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-15,He absolutely does lol
18ifokk,2023-12-14,2023-12-16,Justin Bieber was one of the most successful musicians of our lifetime. Success means nothing.

ip2gw8,2020-09-08,2020-09-08,"I'm currently playing death stranding on my PC and came up with the idea of recreating the „Odradek“ scanner as a desk light so I designed and printed this lamp.


Geeks may catch that the top right and top left lights are flipped, fixed that after taking the pic.


All lights are fully movable.

Functional and not obvious, you would have to know the game to get it. (It doesn't have ""Death Stranding™"" all over it)"

ip2gw8,2020-09-08,2020-09-09,Is that an MK3s? Whats that on the left side of the heatbed?
ip2gw8,2020-09-08,2020-09-09,Would consider buying one or two of these off you in unassembled kits. Would make a great gift for some people I know. If you aren’t against the thought PM me and we can figure out details!

ip2gw8,2020-09-08,2020-09-09,I always find the animations of this in game so pleasing to watch and so immersive. All the tiny details in this game made it feel.. tangible.
ip2gw8,2020-09-08,2020-09-09,could this work on the mini?
ip2gw8,2020-09-08,2020-09-09,I'd buy this

ip2gw8,2020-09-08,2020-09-09,Prusas are a no brainer (mini/mk3s). With a cheaper price tag i would check an ender maybe

ip2gw8,2020-09-08,2020-09-09,"Sure, maybe just some rearranging on the build plate for the parts"
ip2gw8,2020-09-08,2020-09-09,That‘s gonna be included in the next version haha
ip2gw8,2020-09-08,2020-09-09,It's obviously a reference ingame to Kafka. Because Kojima is deep and subtle in his references.
ip2gw8,2020-09-08,2020-09-09,"I might take this into consideration, will report back if I will do so."
ip2gw8,2020-09-08,2020-09-09,"That would probably depend on how I would sell this, like only the printed parts without any of the extra hardware needed (leds, wires, screws, switch), a preassembled kit with all hardware included, or a fully assembled lamp.

The best option would probably a preassembled kit (all soldering and wiring done and most of the assembly) that will only need a tiny bit of assembly. 

With use of materials and the time for preassembly I would probably end up at around 50-60 bucks at least."

ip2gw8,2020-09-08,2020-09-16,"Thank you so much, and I love the build I’m really excited to start putting it together, I have all the parts and electrical I’ve just been waiting to find out what filament that was!"
ip2gw8,2020-09-08,2020-09-09,"If I were to hazard a guess, I believe labor includes filament used, personal time putting it together, making it look nice, wiring for lights, probably painting it too. I would say a solid $50-$100. Seems like a steal to me, looks great OP!"
ip2gw8,2020-09-08,2020-09-09,"yeah i'd be very careful talking about selling it. 

companies are often forced to enforce their copyright at the risk of losing it if they don't. which is why stuff like this tends to get shut down faster than people expect."
ip2gw8,2020-09-08,2020-09-09,They have a cheaper mini one. Its under $500 even with all the add-ons

e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-29,"In general the story is about you connecting all the cities left in America to a network that will allow them to work as a Country again instead of separate entities and you are doing it to save your sister in the process.  And it is very good imo but its not for everyone  (10/10 for me personally).  The gameplay is mostly walking (vehicles do exist but they cant always be used) but they take the idea of just walking to the extreme.  You have to manage your weight and try to keep your balance and take the best routes possible from point to point to make your trip and easy and as safe as you can.  Which involves avoiding enemies who want to steal your cargo but also timefall which damages your cargo and bring BTs.  Hope this helps, I highly recommend the game but watch some gameplay first to see if its the kinda thing you think youd enjoy.  I kinda compare it to something like Euro Truck Simulator.  It seems boring but it becomes pretty relaxing and fun in a way."

because its nonsense. all the guns use the similar visual style but they're not the same gun. Those are still all different guns in the image.

* Anti-BT gun

* Bola gun

* Handgun

* Riot shotgun

* Shotgun

* Non-lethal assault rifle(3 different kinds of ammo: hermatic, rubber, chrysalis)

* Lethal assault rifle

* Sticky gun

* Grenade

* Hermatic grenade

* Stun grenade

* Stun bomb

* Grenade launcher

* Rocket Launcher

* Quadruple rocket launcher

Plus, different levels for most of these with new functions. More than enough for a game that literally tells the player better not to kill anybody and has a big emphasis on not doing so(because its a real hassle as well) if you ask me."
e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-28,there's 3 levels of any 1 of the guns and yeah each one looks different. also there's lethal AND nonlethal guns which look pretty identical except for the colors.

e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-28,"The dev's dont seem to know where the fun is and, as you progress, actively try to take it away.

>hiking mechanics are 11/10

Tons of upgrades to make it not fun and just leveling makes balancing easier so you have to do less even if you ignore the things that makes it easier. The big map is made for vehicles in most places

>traveling with vehicles

It's fun to zoom around but it ignore so much stuff so easily besides weather.

>building stuff collaboratively online

It's nice but the selection is shallow and it ends entirely handled online in most situations by a small handful of players. Plus, once the roads are built and you set up a zipline network it's as if you conquered the land. You took away the joy of travel and the world feels empty. You're hurt for playing specifically the way Kojima wanted. 

>the story

All over the place. Doesnt tell a cohesive or compelling story, it instead relies on exposition dumps constantly and even then fails basic stuff like giving the audience enough information to understand what is going on at the given time while attempting to make the audience sympathetic to the scene or involving characters not even introduced in any respect until later. Its clearly just a bunch of knitted together cool ideas that barely function together. Regardless, there are a lot of extremely unique ideas and good storylines in this and it wraps up in a very satisfying way.

>soundtrack

You can only listen to in locations that require you to basically sit there to explicitly enjoy it rather than set gameplay to it. The music in gameplay only occurs in missions that unlock it. Postgame you are stuck without music altogether besides structures. It's great music though.

It's a clear example of Kojima's inability to do good game design and writing without aid but there are so many great ideas I cant dismiss the game at all and would recommend to someone looking for a different experience, even if flawed."
e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-29,I haven't loved a Kojima game since MGS1 but this is easily my favourite game of the year. Plenty of reviewers have articulated why they loved the game and also commented on flaws. It's utterly childish to think there's a conspiracy just cos you have a different opinion.
e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-29,That's an abysmal description.
e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-29,"The first time you explore a new area there won't be any structures. Once you link it up, you'll see a lot of player structures, but not all of it. I actually think it's impossible to see most roads segments fully built without your contribution. A few dozen players is enough to sustain the sense of community. Also structures last for roughly two weeks."

e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-28,Oh I just meant the chapter where you go to those cause I forgot if it was Chapter 2 or 3 that you take the trip to the main region.
e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-29,Wait. Wait wait wait. That's a thing you can do ? I've been playing passively    ...   for nothing ? HMMMM.
e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-29,"It will create a ghost called a BT which can cause an explosion called a voidout if it eats a living human body. If this happens you are forced to load save to give yourself time to find the body (and hope that you can do so without erasing too much progress you made in that time). 

After 3 hours of trying to find the damn thing I found it just above the camp. The body had turned into a BT and was haunting the area where it was killed. I had to kill the BT in order to keep it from attacking the camp. Another thing to note is that I tried fast traveling to where the corpse was, but Sam sleeps before he fast travels so that speeds up the time for the body to turn into a BT."

e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-28,They all use the use the same model is the point. Which you seem to be intentionally missing so you can defend the game. There might be different guns in the game but in this picture which is what the comment is based off of theres one model reskinned multiple times to look different. That's all the comment said. That doesnt mean they're not functionally different.
e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-28,No one said they're the same gun they're just the same models reskinned. Learn to read.
e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-28,The same as the ratio of unicorns to leprechauns.
e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-28,About 5 Stanley nickels. But it varies depending on the conversion of leprechauns to unicorns so there is some variation month to month.
e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-29,"Ah yeah that's right, my bad"
e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-28,"I agree with most of this. I don't really know what else I could add. The next time I play through this game I'll be doing it in offline mode, as I feel like a lot of the gameplay issues you mention are caused by the fact that online basically completes all the infrastructure for you.

As you say, the vehicles and ziplines and stability upgrades makes the game too easy so I think playing offline will help alleviate this. 

For example, without other players' ziplines you won't be able to create a zipline network spanning the entire game world as you'll run out of bandwidth long before you've gotten anywhere. Now you'll be forced to choose between taking a vehicle or going by foot. 

If you go by foot you'll want to place ziplines strategically in key locations in order to skip the most difficult sections.

I don't know how materials at outposts work in offline mode, but ideally if you choose to use a vehicle, you'd have to weigh the pros and cons of potentially wasting resources that you've painstakingly gathered yourself. I know that in online mode the outposts have tons of materials stocked, but I don't know if this is because online players have stocked the outpost for you, or if they come with a set amount of resources and get restocked over time."
e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-29,"I really enjoy the game but wholeheartedly agree with your points. Inf act I have taken to playing offline mode, because there are just vehicles EVERYWHERE and it makes the game a cakewalk.

Being able to listen to the music in the same way as MGSV would also improve the game tenfold."
e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-28,"Kinda disagree with most of this.

How do the upgrades make it not fun? I loved the skeletons and PCC upgrades since they helped me out but I never felt like they took the fun or difficulty away. I still had to think about cargo placement and terrain managment. I still got nervous around BTs and MULES. I just now had more tools to deal with everything. Isn't that every game ever?

The community aspect never made the game too easy for me. Even if I saw a zipline I still needed materials to complete a line which takes time and effort. So most of the time I just kept walking. If you want to make the game easier that's an option but I preferred going by foot so that was never really a flaw for me. Even then ziplines only go 300m, so if you want to continue you need to build another zipline which takes even more time.

In fact the community aspect was my favorite part because people always helped when I needed it the most. There were times where someone who built a private room or timefall shelter came in at a very clutch time and it made me appreciate the community so much more. I still had to locate those things too so it just added to my journey in the middle of deliveries. 

How is the terrain made for vehicles? I definitely disagree. A lot of the terrain is very rocky and steep making it tough to navigate a lot of the times. Vehicles came in handy when I needed to carry too much, but most of the time delivering on foot was my preferred way if I wanted to avoid crashing into rocks every 5 seconds.

I can't really understand your complaint about the usage of music as I thought it was brilliant. It's a mostly quiet game which I love and every now and then you get a gorgeous track that compliments the gameplay perfectly. It feels like a reward. I love how it's used scarcely. Made the soundtrack way more impactful.

Only point I can see here is the story. I enjoyed the mysterious vibe a lot but acknowledge how people can find the dialogue terrible even though I found it amusing. I enjoyed the story for what it was but don't think it was amazing or anything. I agree the info dumps are a little lame. The performances were good for the most part though and I really enjoyed the relationship development between Sam and BB. Ending was good too."

That's the point. Going between settlements is hard at first, but you build up the world and the links between places get stronger. That's what makes it so satisfying to progress."

You’re allowed to have your own opinion but many reviews didn’t really treat the game like any other game. People sugar coated the parts the game was lacking in. 

Gameranx “before you buy” reviewer legit said he has a bias towards kojima. He tried to give it a fair review but all those biases showed in the review. Dunkey called the game out for its flaws. I didn’t say in my comment that no one could possibly enjoy the game I simply said people weren’t being honest. It’s like the people that gave BOTW endless praise but wouldn’t mention how bad the “temples” were. BOTW is an incredible game but it absolutely has its flaws. 

Chill out a bit my dude. Kojima isn’t going to visit you just cause you defend his game to the death. It’s okay to call a game out on its flaws and praise the game on its pros. There’s no conspiracy but there was too many reviews giving it too much praise. I was tempted to buy but after dunkeys review I got to see why “I” wouldn’t enjoy the game. It’s not my type of game and he actually showed me why. 

If you’re going to reply remember I’m not coming out you. Be calm dude.

e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-29,From my understanding if you are the cause of the void out it just blocks off a section of the map for a bit of time. If you kill someone and they turn into a BT and then that BT kills another npc that causes a void out the results in a game over.

e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-29,"Hideo did say that he wanted discourage violence and killing in game.

I like the mechanic. If you shoot to kill, you risk it all. There is enough killing in games already.   
Also what comes to killing npc's in game, why would you? There are no ""badguys"" but BT's and you don't really kill them, just release them to the other side. MULE's might look bad but they are just suffering from mental disorder and can't help themselfs. They are not interested in hurting you, they just want you cargo. 

Anyone who just want's to kill kill kill evertyhing should look in a mirror and think what is wrong with them.  

More important, the multiplayer meta in Death Stranding is pretty awesome. Game engourages people to help each other even they never meet or see each other. Complete opposite what we do in real life. 

Death Stranding is different from games we usually play and full of metaphoras. 

And that is why I personally love this game. And no, it's not walking simulator, far from it."
e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-29,Not really even if you do kill the mules they will respawn just they will be gone for a while where as if you use non lethal rounds they will be knocked out and the area safe but for a shorter time. I only found out about it cause I killed someone by mistake which is kinda hard to do I had been playing for around 30+ hours when it happened.
e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-29,First time you kill someone you should get a little voice com from diehard telling you not to leave the body. There is also a little orange ghost icon on the map where the body is. If that didn't happen I guess you are safe.

Offline is totally possible and cost for roads is really not that high. Pretty much build all the roads with little to no help in about 40 hours while still doing everything else, a long range truck level 3 is a must for that tho.

Doing deliveries restocks the outposts and it's a personal thing has nothing to do with the online part, sometimes people will leave materials in the shared locker tho."

Well let's pick out one: in the story it does not provide the information to know what is going on in the scenario while at the same time trying to get you to be sympathetic to it. How is this  not a flaw to you?"
e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-29,">There’s no conspiracy but there was too many reviews giving it too much praise.

Right, just look at that sentence, *that's* why I'm replying to you. You say reviewers are giving it too much praise... according to who? You? You haven't played it, so how can possibly comment on that?

You're saying reviewers are biased and not being honest, based on... what? 1 Gameranx reviewer mentioning his bias? Can you point me to a single review that mentions zero flaws with the game? That should be easy if it's the majority? Just point me to one? 

I really really cannot fathom why you are so assured that people aren't being honest.

>Kojima isn’t going to visit you just cause you defend his game to the death

You say you're ""not coming at me"", but look at how condescending that statement is. I specifically stated in my last comment that I'm not a big fan of Kojima, and I have no clue whatsoever why you think I'm ""defending the game to death"", I have *many* criticisms of the game. I'm just pointing out the childishness of thinking people aren't being honest because you disagree with the reviews. Of a game you *haven't even played*.

I just want to repeat because I'm concerned you'll miss this again: I am *not* saying the game doesn't have flaws, I'm not trying to defend it at all, I am criticising the childishness of saying reviewers aren't being honest.

>Dunkey called the game out for its flaws.

It's funny you mention that review, I haven't watched/read it but I've heard it roundly criticised (even by Dunkley fans) for being more for entertainment than actually trying to judge the game for its merits. Something about complaining you can't drive vehicles up 90 degree hills or something."
e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-29,That's what I thought when I heard about it. Is it cool? Yes. Was it done well? Not really cause if there's the possibility of losing hours of progress then no thanks.
e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-29,"I found it to be a fun challenge that was kind of forced on me by my careless action, but I guess I'm masochistic that way. Though I'd be lying if I said it wasn't poorly implemented. Corpses have a special icon on the map to note where they are, but there is no legend for the icons on the map. Most are self explanatory and it makes sense to just find them as you are planning routes, but when given something that you need to find right this minute or else the world is fucked it makes the task way too difficult. Furthermore when it turns into a BT the icon disappears meaning if you, like me, waste time making a delivery then you risk possibly not being able to find the corpse without retracing your steps. Thankfully it doesn't Dark Souls the pause menu (where pause doesn't actually pause)"
e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-29,"It's great at putting you under stress if you kill by an accident, or, if you want to go murderous, at encouraging planning ahead. If you expect to produce corpses, you better make sure you have a way to dispose them.

Both carefully planning ahead and getting fucked by circumstances and your own carelessness and having to salvage the resulting mess are major parts of the game, so it works out well."
e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-29,"Wait, really?!"
e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-29,I mean I get where you're coming from and I understand that but if the mechanic for non lethality might actually make me lose hours of progress then that affects my enjoyment. Plus I heard there's a lot of bugs and stuff in the game. But if you're enjoying it then that's great. I might wait till a sale to try it out though.
e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-28,Lol are you high
e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-28,"Yea either that, or I dunno, look it up, or wait for someone to clarify. Its not like you're forced to say the first thing that came to your head."
e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-29,you appear to not be however.
e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-28,Dude what are are you even saying that makes no sense. Who said I hate the game? I have zero feelings towards it. Simply pointing out those guns are all the exact same model and you're busy deliberately trying not to understand I guess. Why are you so upset over someone pointing out the models are the same ?
e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-30,"I disagree, that isn't at all true for me personally. The journey *is* the progression from a difficult trip to an easy one. What I enjoy about the game is building up a route, and once the journey between two destinations is simple I'll either move onto building up the next area, or complete timed or difficult deliveries in a satisfyingly short time. I suppose if you do basic deliveries back and forth using roads over and over it'll become boring, but I don't know why you'd do that if you weren't enjoying it? 

For me the progression is incredibly satisfying and the most engaged I've been by any triple A game in years. I think I've already put more hours into the game than any other this generation. I've accidentally played until dawn twice, and I haven't *accidentally* done that since I was a teenager. I honestly didn't think it was possible for me to do that anymore, it's been that long.

>poor game design

It sucks if it doesn't work for you, but it certainly isn't poor game design, it's achieving exactly what it sets out to achieve."
e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-28,I don't see how you think the game doesnt provide enough info.  Yeah you don't completely understand how the Beaches and BTs work at the beginning but the game is constantly piecing that together throughout the game.  Not knowing how that stuff works is like a major story point as well.  You piecing the net work back together gives Deadman access to a lot of records that were previously lost due to the Death Stranding.  Such as records about the original BB experiments.  The game isnt completely about the Death Stranding itself anyways.  It far more focused on the characters and their connections to one another which is why almost all the chapters are named after a character and it focuses in on that person for a bit and lets you learn about them and become invested and attached to them.  Not to mention how unpredictable and original the story is in the first place.  There is truly nothing like it and it kept me guessing and theorizing the entire time.  Easily one of my favorites stories and just games in general.  I can pick out flaws in gameplay if I wanted to (most of the flaws are minor imo anyways) but the overall experience is so overwhelmingly incredible that I just forget about the flaws.

I actively avoid infrastructure most of the time so to actively enjoy my experience but traveling roads and my zip network between Mountaineer and the First Prepper makes the journey over dramatically less enjoyable and thus makes me wonder why I'd do something with no reward in the journey or destination. I tend to avoid them and stick to floating carriers to resolve everything for that reason. The simple back and forth with infrastructure or even sometimes with vehicles makes the journey a bore. 

Ride a truck from capital city's waystation and tell me if you had an engaging time. The road is generally flat and and BTs can be sped through. Now do the same with a zip. Even less work. Was that engaging? Now walk with carriers."
e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-29,"They actually provide basic info of what the Beaches and BTs are early on and even earlier in the interviews section. You're absolutely right that the setting details and things like Amelie's background. However you forget basic things like showing a death scene that with all characters (including your own) involved sympathetic to the scene without giving any information that the character is actually dying until after the death occurs despite trying to get you sympathetic to the death and no hint of injury beforehand. Or how your character and others speak of Heartman and speak to Heartman as if he is a known person without introducing him to the story. Or how some very important things aren't actually explained at all unless you go to the interview section, such as DOOMS, or aren't explained in the story until after they are used a couple times to explain to the audience something they wouldn't understand otherwise such as Ha and Ka. This is not some interesting writing but failing to do the basic aspects of writings. This is inexcusable, objective failures in writing. That multiple people seem to have the same obscure knowledge of a sudden topic just now being discovered such as the ancient Egyptian view of the body and soul and trace it specifically to their terminology is also a glaring failure in establishing characters in writing."

What engages me more than anything *is* the progression, not just going back and forth with cargo.

>that by focusing on building up infrastructure you took away the fun of the experience as the land seems conquered now.

No like I've stated in prior comments, that *is* the fun of the experience. It's the satisfaction of completing the task of conquering the land.

>Ride a truck from capital city's waystation and tell me if you had an engaging time.

I would only be doing that once I've ""conquered the land"", meaning I will feel accomplished as I have completed that section of the game, and if I DO do deliveries, I'll be challenging myself with timed/premium runs that can be satisfyingly completed in incredibly short times due to the ease of travel (and build up my ""Legend of Legend"" tags).

I really don't know how else to explain this? The journey being easier once the area is built up *is* the satisfaction of playing. The overall progression is *precisely what engages me*, far *far* more than the moment to moment action of carrying cargo."

Dunkey showed me why it’s not a game for me. Cool. We good? You gotta calm down dude. You’re taking this waaaaaaay too seriously. My original comment was my own opinion not yours.

 Go enjoy the game instead of thinking you have to attack people that found a review that showed why *THAT* person wouldn’t like the game. Dunkey gave the review that showed me why it’s a game I’ll never play. There’s tons of others I can go play. I’ll be okay not playing your favorite game."

e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-28,it became funny when that guy threw a temper tantrum because not everyone knows that those 2 different gun models represent 22 completely different guns ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

None of that is in any way relevant to my point. THIS is my point:

I am criticising your belief that reviewers aren't being honest."

e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-28,"ah this is getting ever more funny. why would i want to go forth with an informed opinion based on this picture? there is 2 different gun models and a rocket launcher in that picture. thats it. it's nice there is like 20 guns that spring from those 2 gun models, but it's also completely irrelevant to my life."
e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-28,"You sure spent a lot of time talking about it. Someone that actually didn't care would have said ""Oh, I was mislead by the picture, oh well."" Instead of what you did. I would also suggest that not caring about having an informed opinion and then trying to have a conversation about a topic make you look either ignorant or apathetic and pedantic."
e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-29,"Holy shit then do something else with your life.  ""Ahhh this isn't important to me, I'm talking about it so much, why does nobody understand that I dont care??"" -you."
e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-28,"it's evening, i'm sitting here on reddit and scratching my balls. why wouldn't i engage in a discussion with people who disagree with my objectively correct statement that all those guns in the picture use a very, very limited model variety? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"
e30bvj,2019-11-28,2019-11-29,i am doing something with my life. i'm looking at yours being relieved that it's not yours.

The story was substantially worse than people said. But holy cow was the gameplay fun and interesting to me! Especially once you get to the endgame and have all the spell books unlocked and really get the hang of its flow, it is just fantastically designed action combat. 

It's kind of like the Infamous games, but with a bit more variety, and some light RPG mechanics. If anyone reading this gets curious and spots it for real cheap (the studio is dead so supporting it is a non-option) just skip the story entirely. It does get slightly better than it starts, but never good enough to be worth sitting through. Just skip the cutscenes and speed through the main story to unlock the full suite of abilities and have a good time. 

Also in the settings you can set the chatter to minimal, which is very important. In fact, just go in to the audio settings and turn voices off entirely."

Funnily enough, the hardest achievement to get for me was the Have a Nice Fall one, because it requires you to kill an enemy with fall damage by knocking them off a ledge; the easiest way to do that is the Typhoon Kick upgrade.

But it's a hidden achievement, so by the time I realized it existed, I'd already done all the camps (and NG+ hadn't been added yet), so I didn't have any easily accessible locations to get it; ended up googling it and finding that there's a patrol in the northern region next to a *very* steep hill that will work if you weaken an enemy first.

100%'d it, then played it through with my partner (not 100%, but typical multi-vessel playthrough), then got sad that I couldn't keep playing it because there was nothing new for me to see. Then they announced an extended version coming out later in the year with about 33% new content! Wahoo!"

Just an absolute masterpiece of a first person shooter campaign. It's relatively short, and never gets stale. Every level has new mechanics, new enemies, new designs and things to try. It's fresh and innovative and has a surprisingly effective emotional thread carrying us through in the form of the growing bond between a stranded pilot and titan on an alien world. Fantastic story, gripping gameplay, some of the best movement mechanics in any shooter I've played. It was a pleasure to 100% this game."

The Platinum Trophy hardly constitutes as an achievement just because it felt so natural to get. 100% completing that game doesn't feel like a chore. And when you play like me and tend to grab collectables and clear districts as you happen upon them, the extra power you get at the end of the game is more than enough to keep you playing until 'oop, that's everything, then'.

But! Honourable mention to Assassin's Creed 3. I didn't want to kill myself even once when Platinuming that one. Even my beloved AC 2 had me questioning my own existance at points."

Now? Every once in a while I get the urge to 100% some game but then there's something that comes up and I tell myself ""no way in hell am I doing that when I have so many different other games I could be playing"". Breath of the Wild? Incredible game, 100+ hours in but who the hell is gonna go find every Korok? Ubisoft/Ubisoft-style open world games? I have a lot of fun with them but no way am I gonna hit every question mark when a lot of content is either half-assed or very repetitive. Celeste/Hades? Once is enough, don't need to be playing side content or higher difficulty. Currently about to finish Link's Awakening and I adore the game but it's way too much effort to find every single seashell.

And then games like Stardew Valley that I do genuinely like enough to 100% but I play them a lot, leave them for months, and then come back to them and immediately start a new save, so that's out the window xD"

Furi. One of the most challenging games I have played at max difficulty. The combat may be the best I have played. The soundtrack is super hype. 

Super meat boy. I loved the challenge and music. Probably harder than furi because of its length.

Super Mario Bros for the DS.

Celeste. I liked the platforming better than meat boy. I'd say it's on par in terms of difficulty. The more complex platforming mechanics were tough to be consistent with. Loved the challenge 

Subnautica. Might be the best adventure/exploration game I have ever played. Base making was satisfying. Going deeper and deeper and discovering more and more was exhilarating.

1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"***Tunic.*** That game has the best combination of exploration, combat and OMG, the puzzles!!

Hidden or difficult to see areas. Ever-present, but never too-taxing enemies. And the most brilliantly delivered mystery system I've ever encountered (and I've been a gamer since Pac-Man). I found this gameplay loop endlessly compelling. I HAD to finish it. Can't recommend this game enough.

STOP READING HERE. I never got the hang of short-form posting, so I'm giving skimmers a clear jumping off point.

-------------------------------------------------------------------- 

If you need more info for a proper recommendation, read on. Otherwise, go play it as blindly as you can. Don't read anything else until you get hopelessly stuck. And I mean HOPELESSLY, because there are only a couple of sticking points that the average person can't puzzle out on their own. Doing it yourself is well worth it.

There is no human-understandable dialogue. Everything that's not written in **The Manual** is conveyed as symbols and pantomime. (So even interacting with your journey is a bit of a puzzle.) You start by finding a page of the manual of the game you're playing RIGHT NOW. It's dressed up like a classic game manual, written in both ~~English~~ <your native language> and a made-up language you're not supposed to understand right away. (Or at all, really. Only supernerds will care enough to decipher those glyphs.) Eventually, by piecing together the manual, you will piece together how the game works, why you're here, what you're supposed to be doing, and what happened to this world. Every revelation feels like a triumph, and not just another box ticked on a neverending slog to the finish line. For a dyed in the wool puzzle solver like me, that's an amazing feeling.

Oh, and the aesthetic is very reminiscent of another famous tunic-wearing adventurer... (If you like that sort of thing.)

All that said, if you want to 100% a game, it needs to be the right one. Find one that compels you to see it through to the end and you won't feel like it's a chore to get done just because you told yourself you would do it. *Lego Batman, Lego Star Wars, The Witness, Call of Duty 4* (campaign mode completed in a single 8-hour session unintentionally)*, Batman: Arkham Asylum/City (Knight* has a difficulty spike I don't care for), the *Tomb Raider* reboots, the original *Resident Evil 2, Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy 7,8*, and probably more that I will kick myself for not naming\*. Each of these games grabbed me, pulled me in and didn't let go until I had seen and done everything. I'd say ""choose wisely"", but it's more than likely that the right game will choose you.



  


\* I could also post a list of games I have on my ""Quarantine List"" that have no true endings that I would spend every second of free time pursuing if I didn't have a handle on my addiction. (Marvel Puzzle Quest, Magic Arena, Slay the Spire, and every Street Fighter, Tekken, Mortal Kombat and Injustice game to name just a few.)"

I've also achieved True Perfection on stardew valley, but I will never 100% it because I will never join Joja. To me, it's better not to have the platinum with that being the only achievement remaining. Like getting all achievements in Dark Spuls 2 except the one you get for dying."

1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Same. This game has such an awesome atmosphere. The music and exploration driven story was really what made it for me.

1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,It's currently on Steam for $9.89. Thanks for making me buy this.

1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,I loved doing side missions and fighting all the side bosses but took a 4 year break after beating the main campaign to clean up the riddler trophies.

Totally forgot about the game so I went in without seeing the complaints about the vehicle fights, and I didn't mind them.

Stopped playing after I beat it, should I re-download it? Wasn't sure about other side quests possibly available"

1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"On the way to 100% Lego Harry Potter years 1-4 with my Niece, and ever since we unlocked Tom Riddle, we've spent most of the time Avada Kardarva-ing Everyone and each other!"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"I agree! That’s why it’s so frustrating that Lego The Hobbit didn’t include Battle of the Five Armies. The game just sort of ends and you can 100% it, but it still feels strange lol"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"I’ve completed all the Marvel Superheroes games, all the Star Wars besides Force Awakens and Skywalker Saga, all 3 Batman games, Hobbit/LOTR, both Indiana Jones, both LEGO Movies, Pirates of the Caribbean, and both Harry Potter’s on 100% fully agree."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,I always rush through the story missions so I can unlock things and then go back and really enjoy and take my time on free play
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Yep, always 100%d them as a kid, always a bonus when it rains studs when you do it"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,The Lego games are just some of the most pure fun of any video games out there. While not necessarily technically complex they are an enjoyment from start to finish especially playing with friends/family.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,not the skywalker saga tho😔 way too tedious
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Lego Marvel Superheroes was the one for me!
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Some of the newer ones seem better and more packed with content and stuff. But I’m a big fan of the Indiana jones one. Feels like the perfect series for Lego, especially the original silent picture style Lego. Indiana jones has a type of humor and action that’s derivative of that style already so I feel like it just translates perfectly. Never got around to the one that includes crystal skull but I’ve been tempted"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"I just 100% LC Under Cover last night, it was so much fun.  
The only drawback when completing everything is that the city feels a bit empty and devoid of mini-missions. You can't even ride any of the pigs anymore. :("
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"The secret to 100%ing the lego games is to not buy anything except the multipliers first (actually better to buy the 4x multiplier first, then the 2x, then the rest)

Then once all the multipliers are bought, you just mass buy everything else"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Not only see the real ending, but also experience arguably the most difficult boss fight in the entire game."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"I have never played a game back to back before, let alone THREE times in a row. 10/10 game. I never cared for mechs before but I think they’re fucking cool now."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"I'm so bad at that game I can't beat the first boss, lol. The restricted arena and invisible walls get me every time, or the missiles that seem to hit me no matter where I try to hide. I'd be an awful mech pilot.

Edit: Took a bunch of people's advice here and booted it up again to give it another shot. Success on my first go! Better aggressive air dodging and using the sword a lot more. Maybe I'll give the game a proper chance now, because I do have fond memories of past AC games. Thanks for the tips!"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Yep, don't even know if I've 100% another game before"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"AC6 is the only game I've ever played NG+, let alone NG+2. I was so surprised it was still fun even on the third time around."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"I just beat the ice worm! I don't know how far in I am, but I'm enjoying it. It's a lot easier than I thought it would be (expected souls level difficulty) but it's still a nice challenge

My preferred load out right now is two of the massive vertical middle racks, the default sword, and an SMG. I'm enjoying the lightweight builds a ton -- and I think arena has been my favorite part

Also I fucking hate snail"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,“I won’t miss”
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"A long time ago I got Armored Core 2 for the PS2. Didn't know enough english at the time so I couldn't figure it out and I returned it to the store. It was a shame, because I thought the game was cool to play.

Through the years I've always fondly remembered that game yet I couldn't remember its name and haven't being able in years.

Well, now, you've helped me remember and after a quick google search Armored Core is, indeed, the lost saga I couldn't play as a child. Thank you for posting!"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"It's one of the most desperate, gritty, horrific stories ever told in video games, and I love it."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,S-ranking everything was so satisfying.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"To date, AC6 is the only game I've gone out of my way to 100% because it was just that much fun"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Astros was way too good for a tech demo. It really felt like the classic ps games while being visually amazing. I'm actually excited for the new Astro game coming out.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,If they made this into a astros play room 2 with the same mechanics I’m sure Sony would sell this game like hotcakes. It’s a simple winning combination
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,I loved pretty much every aspect of the game. It never felt like a chore to get that platinum.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,The first open world game I ever got the platinum for. It was truly bittersweet to be finally done. 
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,I really don’t like open world games. Huge fan of Zelda and fromsoft. I don’t like breath of the wild or Elden ring. I love ghost of Tsushima. Everything you do and see feels important
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"I think the best part of the game is that you can't truly 100% it in any single run due to mutually exclusive questlines as well as different options available to different races, classes, and backgrounds. It's such a tremendously massive game but it's so much fun trying to complete as much as possible in each run and to see new things."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Must. Check. Every. Barrel.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Is this the one that recently came out? 
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,I love that you can replay the major bosses anytime you want. The boss fights are hard but it’s actually easier from a time investment standpoint because it’s way easier to master with no boss runs.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"I got deep into Sekiro a few months ago. I made it to the final boss but I couldn't make it past phase 2.

I might try another run soon. I feel like this game has ruined other action games for me. No combat has been as satisfying as Sekiro.

I do hear good things about Lies of P though"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Absolutely Sekiro.  Took me awhile for the game to click, but when I finally fell into it and eventually beat Sword Saint Isshin I was hooked and had to go again.

And what I love about 100% Sekiro is that if you can beat the game, it's really not all that hard to do all the achievements.  You can pretty easily do it in 3 playthroughs, and all you need is one playthrough to know how the bosses work."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Came here to say this. Honestly life-changing in my opinion.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Basically every Ratchet and Clank game falls into this category.

I actually rank Rift Apart quite low in terms of R&C. Certainly better than 1, Into the Nexus, or 1 remake. But nowhere near the heights that are Future: Tools of Destruction, Future: A Crack in Time, or the all time classic Going Commando.

That's not to say it's bad - the series is just that good.   Rift Apart is a solid 9/10, but I mean, Going Commando is almost a perfect game."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"I want that game badly since getting a PS5 - still full price everywhere, I never see it on sale"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,It's sooo good. Played on my 4090 @4k and it was such a beautiful game.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Only 100%? Damn bro, you missed a lot."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Doom Eternal is so badass.  I always mention it to people but have never met anyone that’s played it.  It’s like the fastest my brain has ever went.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Halo 3 100% especially for that Recon when it became available
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,And it was actually worth finding all the Codex entries. They each unveiled something more about the world. So many collectibles in games are just a chore.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"This 100%, literally. I did the grind to Unseen One 3x across 3 devices and additionally played to epilogue ending on another 2. Hades is a masterclass in replayability and driving the player to get 100%"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,I told myself I would just beat the 'main ending' of this game and then just kept doing runs to see the epilogue.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Hades was my first  and only Perfect Achievements game for a long time. It was totally worth it and a natural curve to unlock everything. Maxing all keepsakes was a drag tho
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Hades gang baby! My one and only 100% completion to this day
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Before I played it I thought people were overrating Chrono Trigger. Then I played it and it's my favorite game. Absolute masterpiece.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"That's the only game I've ever even finished. It was an amazing game.

(I've hit the finish point on Factorio as well, but that feels more like finishing the tutorial)"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,One of the first snes rpg games I beat as a kid. Fond memories
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Chrono Trigger is the GOAT
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Yup. Spiderman 2 was one of those rare platinum/100%'s that was actually achievable without being borderline torturous.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,All the Spider-Man games are easy 100% games because they are so damn fun to play the whole time. Web slinging and combat never gets old.  One thing that really helped me was to find a good playlist to play through Spotify and turn the in game.music off.  You can explain it as Peter having the ability to play his favorite jams through the suit.  So it's not world breaking or anything.... Infact might be more immersive.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,By the time I finished the main storyline I had basically already completed like 85% of the game because stuff was just fun to do. Doing the rest only seemed right
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,I got the platinum on Miles Morales and also Spider-Man 2 on PS5.  Fun games.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,One of the only games I've played through (including the DLC) on like 3 separate occasions. Still didnt get 100% completion on any of em. Freaking gwent lol.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"I become an obsessive completionist every time I play Witcher 3, but I can never get myself to collect all of the crap in the ocean in Skellige."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Currently on my second run NG+ on Deathmarch. First time player in 2024, have not put it down since starting back in April. It is that good."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,I scrolled specifically to find this reply. Witcher 3 is a fuggin masterpiece. And I don't even like medieval fantasy type games fr
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Dude I love this game I'm sad it never got greenest for the 3rd game
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,One of the most aesthetically beautiful games out there
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"This game is getting a lot of mentions recently. 

No idea why, but I'm glad. Such a cool series and so much potential that was crushed by corporate greed. Nice to see so many people enjoyed the journey while it lasted."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,They somehow took a game with one of the best gameplay loops and improved on it. Absolutely phenomenal remake.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Wonder and SM64 are the two I've done. I don't know that I've 100% any others. 
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,And Donkey Kong Country 2. 102% baby!
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,The secret levels blew my 5 year old mind
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Highly underrated and so fun co-op!
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Fuck the Ndesu fight on hardest difficulty. How does a 6 barrel Minigun overheat that fast? Also fuck the infinite spawning dudes in the back with arrows.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Best coop game I've ever played in my life. I hear there's a rumor that >!RE9 is expected to be coop like RE5 with Leon and Jill as the main characters!<. I would pre-order that game so fast if that were true.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"The story narration was so unique in this game, loved it."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Those achievements were so fun and unique to find. I loved gathering all the cats
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"One of very few games I bothered to 100% both in collectibles/exploration and achievements, including the DLCs. If there was one game I could play for the first time again, this would be it."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Yesssss. I have two platinum trophies and I’m sure it’s only a matter of time before I hear the Gungeon’s call again.

Every part of it is so jam-packed with love for video games. Wonderful."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Ah yes, here it is, the best game.  The only thing that came close for me was hades.  And disco Elysium, but that’s entirely another story."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,100% on 3 consoles. My favorite time waster game
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Scrolled to find this... Jak and Daxters, Sly Coopers, Ratchet and Clanks.  All worthy of 100%'ing.  :)"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"I only ever missed one damn precursor orb in the Spider Cave; even on replays, I never found it. Every other level is 100% completed, though."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Yup same. There was nothing like it when came out.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Just couldn’t stop until I had done it all. 
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"How did you 100% it when the narrator never shuts up?

""Skills for kills agent, skills for kills."""
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"1st game I got for the 360 and loved it, holy nostalgia lol"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"I probably have more hours in this game than any other open world, but it crossed the threshold between “good/fun” and “frustrating/tedious” at some point. I’m up over 90% but I’ll never 100% it."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"But did you actually 100% it, including all pelts and the random missable items you can get from the gang?

I spent way too much time with this game during covid."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Such a good game.  It's pretty insane I have like 300 hours into a game that is not a online game.  And a lot of the hours are just emersion and roleplaying.  I don't fast travel and make sure my character eats and drinks and sleeps and stuff.  I got big into it.  Amazing DLC as well holy shit.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Dude come on! I have too many other games to play right now, don't get me doing another Cyberpunk play through."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"I'm going to need a xanax or something just to do the Tower ending for the Platinum.

The idea of >!selling So Mi back to the feds to save my own skin!< makes me sick."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,You 100% Skyrim?! Does that include DLC??
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Bigger man than any of us
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"I never did it myself but two of my friends managed to 100% base MHW. One of them it literally took months of on and off grinding to get the gold crown large Nergigante, which happened to be the last achievement needed.

I ended up joining in to help ease the grind but it never helped. I must have killed about 40 of them with him. No dice.

Then he got it randomly one night first try while hanging out on a discord call and he literally ran out the room yelling with excitement. It was a fun moment to be there for. 

Neither of them can muster the spirit to try and 100% iceborne after that ordeal though."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"I kinda loved the endemic life grind, really helped me appreciate just how much stuff was added to make the world feel alive even more than I already did"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,I reset nearly 300 kushala in the forest using the log measure to try and get gold crown large after hunting 100 in investigations and not getting it.  My PS4 file will forever be one crown away from platinum.  It's the closest I've ever come to completing a guild card in probably 3-4 thousand hours in the franchise
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Second Son was my first platinum. It was just so much fun!
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,That and unlocking armor based on achievements was a great idea that more games need to implement
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,I remember beating Halo 1 and Halo Reach on Legendary when I was in college and then I went back to Reach recently and tried to play the first level on legendary and just got absolutely destroyed. How TF did I do that??
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,The radio stations in that game have made me disappointed in all other radios.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Loved Saints Row 4!
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Strictly better Superman game than Superman 64.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"About 5 or 6 years ago now my partner went on a South America and Antarctica cruise, leaving me alone in the house for 5 weeks. For the first 2 weeks, playing Horizon Zero Dawn, loved it, 100%'d it. I though ""damn, that'll be a hard act to follow"".

Then I played Witcher 3. It absolutely was an excellent following act. Don't get me wrong, HZD is still an amazing game (IMO), but Witcher 3 is just ridiculously good. Plus Gwent as a minigame is one of the best minigames in a game ever."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"I have it for PS5.

That's a major undertaking.

Edit: I was thinking of Skywalker Saga, my bad"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,All characters on ascension 20? Heart kills? Ive been playing hundreds of hours and I think I’m ascension 10 on all chars with a few at 13 or 14 but damn I am just not that good
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"For me it was Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon. Can't think of another game that I've got 100%, but that game was so damn funny (and short) that I wanted to look under every rock for another joke. And the combat was good enough to make it fun."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"I don't know how to play SM64, Sunshine, or Odyssey without 100%ing them. Those games are made to be 100% cleared."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Came here to say Super Mario 64.  At the time it was the greatest game ever made.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Frostpunk 2 out in a few weeks lets GOOOOOOO finally
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Insanely addicting game every time i pick it up. I'll play for like 5 hourse straight every time. But whenever I finish a scenario I don't play it again for like a year.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"I thought I got too old to ever get into video games like I did when I was a child. Then Frostpunk happened. I’ll never be able to 100% the game, it’s BRUTAL on highest difficulty, but I continue to try …"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,7 Day Survivor in Infinity Mode stopped me from doing this.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Had to scroll way too far down for this answer. Thats my only 100% game. The entire trilogy though. The story and gameplay was so captivating.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Black flag might be my only 100.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Black flag was the pirate game we wanted. They just had some trouble mixing in the assassins on that game. I loved it. Hundreds of hours sails and shanties. Collected every shanty, every outfit. Every ship upgrade. Etc. If I still have it somewhere I will always go back. And the underwater diving parts? So damn fun."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,I'm so sad I had to scroll this far down to find black flag
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Black Flag was my first 100% after AC2. Definitely gotta say black flag is the peak of Assassin’s Creed. I have more nostalgia regarding AC2, but black flag is in my top 10 games of all time."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Best Doom IMO
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Controversial, but I think it's better than Doom Eternal. I even thought the music was better, then years later, it came out that Mick Gordon got didn't finish it because of Bethesda."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,This is a really frugal way to game but I would be so screwed. I often don't even finish games let alone 100% them.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Odyssey for me too. I didn’t 100% but it was just such a good looking game and it felt so smooth and satisfying to take out full camps if NPCs
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"I'm not one to stick with a game for too long, but man Odyssey hooked me. Such an absolute banger. And with enough DLC to keep you busy for weeks."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Origins and Black Flag are also fucking dope to 100%.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Same. The rewards for exploration were some of my favorite in any game.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Same. 30+ years of gaming consistently and elden ring is my only 100% ever. 

Usually once I beat a game I move on to the next or I play multiplayer games. For some reason ER had me captivated from day 1 and I just kept beating it over and over. 

Btw, the dlc is really good and encapsulates the same exploration feeling that the base game harnessed so well."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"guess i know what i'm playing next, VC and SA are the only games i've 100%"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Vice City for me too.

It was just fun to be in that world.

I spent sooooo much time flying around in a tank with the low-gravity cheat turned on and the gun pointed backwards and giving you an insane amount of thrust."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"I agree, fuck the races. First Lego game I played since The Complete Saga. Cosmic brick challenges turned me off completing it. 

Also didn’t like that purchased dlc characters are just unceremoniously added to your roster without any additional levels or having to work for them."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Sleeping Dogs is so good. About time for another replay now that you mention it...
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Same here. I would just sit back and vibe to the soundtrack
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Isn't it awesome when you pick up a divisive game for cheap and love it?

No, really. I got *Hitman: Absolution* in a bundle with *Blood Money* for only $12, so I wasn't going to feel ripped off even if I hated *Absolution*. Surprise surprise. It's the best third-person shooter I've ever played."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,I picked it up on sale and really enjoyed the variety in combat. Not enough games have parkour and I'd happily play another game with that kind of movement and fighting
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"100% the reason I purchased it was because the demo gave me Infamous vibes, and I just miss Infamous so much! When I start it, I'll definitely consider skipping the story entirely :P How long would you say the story was?"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,I... Actually might try this game because of your comment!
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,The last game I completed 100% was Super Mario Sunshine when it was first released. I don’t have that kind of time or focus anymore.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,I only go for it if I'm already close by the end of the game. All the Spiderman games just needed a bit of grinding at the end. Ghost of Tsushima added another few hours. I just went back and did an all collectibles run of Last of Us 2 to get the Plat. I don't bother if I have to go out of my way to do things I don't want to do
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"This was the move as a broke gamer, gotta get my monies worth"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Best part about doing all the side quests are that they’re canon
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Not enough love for HZD here. I loved both of them and have played them to death.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Loop hero mentioned!!
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Was looking for hollow knight on this list! Absolutely hands down the hardest 100% I've ever gotten. Pantheon 5 was a nightmare--I screamed SO loud when I finally beat absolute radiance. Surprisingly, the steel soul runs were not as hard as I thought with careful planning. Currently getting through elden ring now, congrats on your 100%'s!"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"100% agree. Beat several souls(like) games. This was the only one I bothered to NG+. Honestly, I didn't even know what the game was until it showed up on GamePass."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Please don't abbreviate Cyberpunk 2077 to ""CP,"" it sends the wrong message."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Mario Galaxy is THE GOAT. It was always my childhood dream 100%ing it but never had the patience
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Same here. How fast you come back after death did it for me. Felt like you could get so many attempts in a short amount of time
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-10,Same!! Can’t wait for DR:DR.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Just Cause 2 and 3, avoiding 4. My maaaaan! ❤"

NOPE"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"You should try Alien: Isolation. Even without VR it's absolutely terrifying – but you need to play it in hard mode to have all the enemy's AI capabilities available and for the alien to be one of the best video game enemies until now, even ten years after release (dark room and headphones highly recommended.)
It even has a functional VR mode that you can activate with a mod, but afaik it's not executed very well, since it was never officially released."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Infamous blood festival. It was so fun, even without a platinum"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,This game was absolutely terrifying for me. I'm thallassophobic and megalophobic. The game is so good I pushed through my fears to finish it.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Yeah the first time I encountered one of those big ass monstrosities I shit myself and wasn’t even playing in VR 😂
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Exact same for me!
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Same, I have to put it down after awhile because the endless expanse freaks me out. Especially when night comes, I'm just hold up in my pod being scared"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"When I first played it, I was able to power through and finish the game. I think I had to close my eyes on some of the approaches and just trust my bearing was correct. Nowadays, when I think of going back, I'm scared shitless of the idea of going back into that deep darkness. 

I always call it, the best game I'll never play again."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Does this game has like big map of ocean and many creatuers in it and whats the game in general?
Because i love sea and ocean and games like that were you can explore teritory"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Get it.  There is a reason why every time a Reddit post asks about someone’s favorite game, subnautica gets mentioned.  It is good."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Noticed this too let's do it
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"It's absolutely worth it. The most engaging crafting/survival game I've ever played.

That said, what other people are saying about having a fear of the ocean.. if you have that, get ready for a lot of fucking anxiety. 

Again, even despite that, it is absolutely worth it."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"get it, it's insane"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"I have, and it was fun. A continuation of the world and story was cool, but it didn't quite have the same pull as the original. Regardless, I've still played through it a couple of times and enjoyed my time with it."

1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"As much as I wanna break teeth when I see/hear this, it makes me so happy to know this game holds a special place in others' memories. I grew up playing this every Thanksgiving with my cousins. To this day, we still fire it up when we're lucky enough to spend time together.

Fuck that trolley tho."

1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,I recently played the remastered Spyro 3 this last week after 3 years not touching it and I’m in your same position. I’m in a level called Lost Fleet and I have 3 gems that I can’t figure out their location even with Sparx guiding me!
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,We don’t talk about 100%ing 4 lol
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,I did 100% on all ratchet and clank games

There are the riddle tracker things in game that show you where they are and what type of riddle it is."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,That's the easy part. The challenges are a fucking nightmare. I did it a few years ago on Knight and it made me despise the game

1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"The side quests in the game are all a lot of fun imo, most of them at least.  The DLCs are also pretty great.  Short 1-2 hour campaign missions iirc

I wouldn’t recommend bothering with the riddler trophies though unless you simply can’t put the game down.  They are the Zelda BotW/TotK Koroks"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"The consensus seems to be yes, but for me its no. 

Knight has it so you can beat up riddler informants that reveal the locations of riddles, so finding them isn't too difficult. And there's still usually a hint that plays when you enter the vicinity. And you can set a waypoint to some of them, so its not like Asylum where the ? dances around the map. The icon will even change depending on the type of riddle activity you're doing. There are a few annoying ones, and there are quite a few more but overall I had fun finding them all and enjoyed the extra variety that some puzzles had thanks to the batmobile. Ive actually done it more than once."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Yes.

Yes it is"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"It really isn’t. There are a LOT of challenges that are pretty different than the ones in the other games, particularly many that involve the Batmobile. 

But if you’re a vet of the series, it’s same old same old. A pleasant, sometimes frustrating grind."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Nice pfp
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Some are notoriously annoying or somewhat glitchy.


I hate falling and losing all my coins! *(I know, studs)."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Yep, there's two parts to 100% Lego games; feeding your OCD and getting all the achievements, and wreaking pure havoc on everything with all the cool new characters, powers and vehicles you acquire."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,That's adorable in a dark kinda way 😅
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,I will always be annoyed at Lego Harry Potter because it’s the only one I couldn’t 100% due to a bug.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,I didn't 100% it because of that. I was so disappointed by the cliffhanger ending I gave up.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,You need to play through Jurassic park. Holy shit that one is fun!
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,this is the way
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Heres a tip, charge him when he launches the missles. I know it sounds dumb but works so fucking well. The missiles don’t “trigger” until the initial start up animation finishes. And when you are right in the middle of the missiles, most try to turn around and slam into the ground. The only ones to worry about are the ones on top and they are easy to dodge since they are moving straight down and you can boost out of the way."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Unironically, that first boss is one of the hardest since you have that garbage mech"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Yo, SAME. And I played the shit out of the AC games like 10+ years ago, placing top 1k in ranked pvp in AC3 or 4.. the 1st boss wrecked me.. Balteus wrecked me.. the demolition guy wrecked me.. I just stopped after hitting a brick wall over and over. :( Games hard af (but these other people killin it, so props to them)"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,It's hard if you play 2 dimensionally. If you fly up and smack him with your energy blade the fight gets much easier. Also it's easier to dodge the missiles in the air.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Arguably it's meant to be played 3 times over because that's the only way you can see the whole story
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,The tech demo that puts most so-called AAA titles to shame. 😂
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,I am still impressed that they somehow managed to translate the feel of ice skating into a rumbling controller.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Not only that, but it's so much more rewarding than most other games by capitalizing on nostalgia from older PlayStation systems, games, and peripherals. 

I thought it was cool as hell, but then realized you can interact with your little nostalgia collection like turning in the systems and hearing their startup music in the playroom was next level."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Yeah, Sony’s announcement of Astro Bot at their recent State of Play was by far the best thing they showed so I hope it’s good."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,On contrast trying to 100% that game is actually what eventually ruined my enjoyment. By the time I realized I was just moving from one fox den to another haiku area to whatever else was there and most of the rewards were pretty pointless I just got fed up eventually and wanted to rush the story to get it over with. It's way too bloated for it's own good imo.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Yes, all 30 headbands are necessary "
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Cursed to put my hands on everything
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"It is! Couldn’t recommend it more, especially as the steam sale is about to run out and it’s currently $22 off."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Yes! My wife and I our easily 150 hours in and not even close to finishing act 3. So much bang for your buck. Also won GOTY in 23’
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Regularly go back and kick Genichiro’s ass just to remind him that I got his number now.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,They need to bring that boss rush to Elden Ring
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,wish they had a mini boss replay system too!
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"I really enjoyed LOP, but don't expect the combat to be as tight as Sekiro. It's more of a Bloodborne or Dark Souls play style. "
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,The feeling of finally overcoming something that at first felt literally impossible. That is what Sekiro is. An allegory to life itself and how dedication and study pays off in the end.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"As a kid, it kinda became a tradition to do a new game plus  run with the upgraded RY3NO every weekend.

The same goes for Jak 3 and his upgraded weapons."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"The newest one that came out is pretty damn good too. Before that came out ""a crack in time"" was my favorite one. But as you mentioned every game is pretty solid"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,It's on ps+ extra if you have that
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,It's on sale on steam right now I just got it the other day.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"That's map percentage, not game percentage"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Man by the time the final boss stage rolled around, I felt so locked in. Extremely satisfying gameplay loop"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Love how the upgrades just keep stacking.  Only game where every unlock felt like my unstoppable badass kept becoming an even more unstoppable god-tier badass
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"I just downloaded it on the summer Steam sale but haven't played yet. Loved 2016 so I'm sure I will.

However I also picked up Overload, which is basically a remake of Descent with modern graphics and control. And I loved Descent back in the day so I had to try that first.

Imagine Doom 2016 but in full 6-axis flight... Fast, chaotic, the ship comes around in a fraction of a second but I still keep increasing my turn rates because it's not enough.

Apparently I can still fly because it doesn't make me queasy at all. But interestingly watching someone else play on YT does it to me right away."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Kids these days don't know how dope it was to have H3 Recon
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,The epilogue is what really sold the game to me. One of the few roguelike games that gives you story reasons to keep coming back. Second to none in that regard.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,I bought Hades 2 because I couldn't wait. It's still in early access... have 150+ hours already. Hmm....
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Good Gods I never did Unseen One even once, that is impressive dedication!

I have done the otherwise full clear on normal and hell mode probably five times now.  Full clear meaning all story, all weapons fully upgraded, all house upgrades, and I think my highest rank is Sigma Dusk.  Just kinda lose interest in the grind and find at that point I enjoy starting a new run more.

Hades is in my top 5 favorite games of all time, I absolutely understand and keep coming back to it time and time again."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Hashtag 90s kids be OG
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"yeah, it is insane how to this day, if you hear Lavos theme song, then you knew right away, shit is about to go down."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"I knocked the game/platinum out in under 30 hours, perfect length"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,The fact that they made a fast travel system in that game and nobody every uses it just shows you how immersive they are.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,I loved gwent and I normally hate the mini games. It was satisfying beating that bitch in the tourney who just spams you with spies
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"I WANT to like Gwent so badly, but I just don’t get it lol.  "
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Same, that was honestly a step too far. Swimming and circling around steep hills looking for a way up is just not fun"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,The boat mechanics weren't good enough to keep sailing around and the thalassophobic chests all over the place in the water were just such a pain. Skellige was where I gave up on hitting all the POIs
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"it's a master piece, but the creator couldn't get the rights from EA, yep EA killed the game."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,The game kinda mind fucked me with its darker story. Not to many games captivate me the way this game did
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Oh yeah Superman 64 was amazing
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,I got this game like two weeks ago and they’re blowing my 30 year old mind.

1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"I always forget about Crackdown, then the rush of nostalgia comes in. I so wish for a remake/remaster for PC. I'd play the shit out of that."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"The final few percentage points for me were maddening, but on the whole it was a great experience getting 100%"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"just put it down for a while but don't uninstall it.

i took a lot of breaks from it but i eventually come back just because i miss riding around in that world."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Yes i did, did it in about 760 hours, started the game in 2019, only did the main story + some side missions, ending my first playthrough at 76%. Second time was in 2023 where i gave everything i had (pun intended lol). Really messed with my head at some point tho, the exotics were not that fun for me"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Dude I also did a second playthrough during COVID and went for the real secret 100%. 

I made sure to see every event, get every item, etc. I even got pretty deep into the YouTube videos where people explained how to make weird things happen. For example, you can create a never ending lightning storm by just following a few simple steps and exploiting the dynamic weather system (no mods or anything). My favorite things were the creepy encounters like the vampire and the ghost train. 

That game was fucking perfect. The only thing I would change would be to add more in-depth combat mechanics maybe. Eventually it just gets way too easy to shoot everyone and never take a bullet in return."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Lol for a sec I thought you said you make sure your character eats, sleeps, and shits and I was like damn this dude is keeping kayfabe alive brother"

1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Assuming they mean 100% achievements/trophies and not clearing all dungeons or completing all side quests, Skyrim is a pretty easy one.  The only tricky one is collecting all the daedric artifacts, because some are missable depending on your quest choices.  But other than that, the rest are basically just completing the main faction questlines and leveling up."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Yep that includes the DLC. Lol is it really that bad? I ended up downloading quest mods from nexusmods too.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"I could never have done it without the multi-monster event quests they added in Iceborne with the increased chances for crowns. Even then, some of them like Yian Garuga and Blackveil Vaal Hazak took a loooonngg time, lol"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Really wish it'd get remastered for PS5, so I could plat it again."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,not gonna happen when they can just monetize it instead
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Repping the look meant you earned that shit
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Fuck yes, that was so satisfying. I genuinely felt pride and accomplishment"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"That’s where I found Kendrick , fully getting into him and A$AP Rocky 

Still some of my favorite artist today and I thank that game"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"I have both, and plan to play through them when Elden Ring releases its vice grip from my balls."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Plan on 100%ing the Skywalker Saga too
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Watching Baalorlord doing a 20ish streak on A20 makes me feel so inadequate at the game.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Hate to burst your bubble friend, but they pushed it back to a september release now :("
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,i have been saying this since eternal released but i feel like anything other than jerking that game off is frowned upon lol. 2016 is just so much more my taste.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Eternal just has too much going on, it feels like right out of the gate you're fighting waves and waves of enemies and it just feels like a slog fest. I guess it makes sense, world overrun by hell and all, but 2016 had a much more natural progression."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Yeah I usually don't like open world games, but you blast so efficiently from location to location that i really enjoyed exploring."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Yeah, mine has to be Super Mario 64"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"What you said makes sense, but not to the comment you replyed to."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,did the prison% speedrun
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Just cause 2 was so fun to just run and pulling people out of cars and blowing stuff up.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,I still haven't finished the story... Maybe one day lol
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Are you sure whatever you are doing is worth it?
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"The VR mod is actually amazing for it, you have to use the regular xbox controller but it was way more immersive than I thought it would be."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,What’s a blood festival?
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Same.  Until I >!built the sea moth and !<felt like a speedy little tank.  >!Then I get jaw-locked by a behemoth for the first time… and shat myself stupid.  Until I built the cyclops and actually felt like a beast with plenty of upgrades.  Then I found the edge of the map…. And it happened all over again when I discovered that freakin ghost leviathans exist !<😱
  
I had the pleasure of discovering this game blind and knowing absolutely nothing on my first play through.  To all new players: If you can, avoid all spoilers and just go for it without checking the wiki.  Easily the most enchanting game I’ve played since Zelda: BotW"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Do you guys get a stomach ache when people post those pictures with a person in the ocean and there’s a dark empty expanse below? I do. The ocean is scary. Scarier than outerspace.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"its awesome. you'd love it! it just gets scary when you start exploring deep in the sea where the sunlight can't reach. even then it's really just a select few ... uh, megafauna that are scary. you'll love it. I loved it and i'm a proper thalassaphobe!"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,I know the feeling. Nothing will ever beat the first plunge into the water of OG subnautica <3

Got em"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Oh wow I can hear this comment
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Yep.  Not even a should about it.  Sparx can do it at any stage of the game in the remaster.  It's a specific button combo.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,I bet you killed something and they didn’t drop the gems right or the gems they dropped clipped through a wall or something. I’d just try the level over again

1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,My problem was delaying most riddles while playing the game and then having to do all of them in one go. Think it was around 6 straight hours of riddle solving just to one shot the riddler. Still regret it.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"Arkham City had like 440 riddler trophies, compared to Knight’s 243, so no.


Fuck the Riddler."

I finished Marvel Superheroes 100% with all multipliers stacked to the point of 13 billion studs.

Yes. Billion with a B."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"100%’ing that one did get pretty repetitive. Especially just how many mithril bricks are on the overworld, compared to LEGO LOTR which felt like a perfect length. I felt like that The Hobbit has a lot of padding which ironically given it’s missing a whole movie lol."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,And some pilots are so good they've beaten the entire game with that AC.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Yeah I raged the fuck out on that boss.  Rest of the game is much easier.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"I keep wanting to buy it, but with it still usually being 35+ dollars and exactly being afraid of what you described, it makes me wonder if I should play one of the older titles first to see if I can still keep up with them before I drop the money on this big new one."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"I played it 5 times over because it was just that fun!

On the 4th and 5th times I did self imposed challenges, 4th time was no shotguns and no needle cannons, 5th time was no ultralight mech builds + 4th time restrictions as well.

On my last play through I ended up using quad mini guns on a tank frame because I was too used to playing the glass cannon builds 😂😭"
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"It's really interesting how almost none of the games I have played since getting my PS5 still comes close to the visual clarity in Astro's Playroom. It just looks super sharp and clean.

Then again I don't think that would necessarily mean a better game anyway."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"I 100%'d it after beating the main story, definitely the way to go about it.  I just wanted to continue being in that space."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"GoT is a great game but my biggest gripe is this - the design philosophy of the open world lends itself too much to being treated like a checklist where you mindlessly follow the map to get to the next thing.

It needs a little more tweaking to reward genuine curiosity and not 'follow the thing' - BOTW and RDR2 did this really well."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Yeah it feels a bit like an Ubisoft game in disguise
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Don’t forget seeing Jin’s bare ass 18 times.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,I use Genichiro to warm up every time I open the game. Love fighting him.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,I'd love it if they even just did it for the DLC but Sekiro is the best title for them to include a boss rush if they had to pick only one.
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,Robertoooooo
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"No wonder I can’t handle souls games, I can barely deal with life. That’s just doubly unfair lol."
1dynvm8,2024-07-08,2024-07-09,"The first Genichiro fight was perfection. I remember struggling with regular mobs in the first parts of the game and I was slowly getting better but slightly discouraged. 

Then you face Genichiro and I remember the moment of finally getting a rhythm down and not just spamming block. “Oh… OH… OH FUCK LETS GO BITCH COME AT ME”"

People here, maybe not this subreddit but a different gaming one don't remember, we're trying to get the dev to add a bunch of stuff they didn't want to add like hunting and defending yourself from attackers and whatnot but they weren't having it. They wanted to create a nice peaceful horseback delivery sim in the countryside. Id look into that one"
1hcemxk,2024-12-12,2024-12-14,now i understand why people kept saying death stranding is a cozy game 😭

1hcemxk,2024-12-12,2024-12-12,"Not sure how this comment is going to go over, but if you're a PC gamer, then Star Citizen could maybe be up your alley. One of the professions you can participate in is delivery, whether legal parcel delivery or illegal contraband. And that can progress into shipping, potentially, but that's not really Death Stranding.

1hcemxk,2024-12-12,2024-12-12,Dont know but if you want crack try factorio. I never tried it as it seems like a gateway to playing to much
1hcemxk,2024-12-12,2024-12-12,"Okay this is off the specific gameplay loop of ""delivery"" but hear me out:

Dave the Diver

You play as Dave, the eponymous Diver, and you have a core gameplay loop of diving twice per day to catch a variety of different fish that you then use at your sushi restaurant at night. 

There's a very cute story that goes a long with this core loop and the game always throws new and interesting things at you along the way. 

It's essentially a rogue lite so as you progress you upgrade your kit to catch more and bigger fish and make better recipes.

There are also cooking battles...no I cannot explain this game fully in a reddit post. It's amazing, contemplative, addictive, and just all around one of my favorite sleeper games of the last 5 years. The only reason I stopped playing was because I ""beat"" the main story, and realized that it was so addicting I was getting lost in the game for hours 🤣"
1hcemxk,2024-12-12,2024-12-12,Maybe snowrunner. Delivery and logistics.

1hcemxk,2024-12-12,2024-12-12,is this some sort of guy running around to deliver or is it similar to euro truck as other users have recommended ?
1hcemxk,2024-12-12,2024-12-12,Came here to post this. I also like the way it doesn't get easier - death stranding does once you unlock certain tools. Snowrunner will wreck your best truck the second you do something stupid.
1hcemxk,2024-12-12,2024-12-12,"But how many DLCs do you have to buy now?

1hcemxk,2024-12-12,2024-12-12,"This is probably the best description of Elite Dangerous.   You are going to watch that warp screen a LOT.  And then you're going to wait.    A long long time.   All with the game promising you ""trust me trust me, it's going to get fun soon, I promise.. there's Pirates!   And Aliens!

1hcemxk,2024-12-12,2024-12-12,Power wash simulator gets daunting very quickly. You go from washing a car or dirt bike to an entire playground in 3 missions. I love it but I just don’t have time like that. Gimme some more small missions
1hcemxk,2024-12-12,2024-12-12,"I finally tried hardspace the other day from all these recommendation threads but the tutorial is so bad I had to stop playing. 

 I ""finished"" the tutorial I guess, or part of it, and day 2 lets me pick a ship to deconstruct, but tells me to figure it out from there and I couldn't figure out wtf to do. Struggled for a bit and eventually turned it off and haven't found the desire to try again yet. 

Most of the places I try to cut, it says my laser cant cut. Find a place I can cut, cut off a chunk, and get told somethin like piece/product/part destroyed penalty applied when it just looked like any other external part of the ship. 

Found a way inside (which involved getting penalized), and in the walls there are like yellow points that seem obvious to laser and they go all along the walls on both sides and top and bottom so I destroy em all but still cant find a way to get the walls to budge or anything. Cutting those points seemed to do nothing. 

Theres some machinery I can free from the walls, but no way to get it out of the ship. Only 2 holes I can cut into it are way too small to fit any parts out without destroying them. Cant widen the holes because it says my tool cant cut it. 

I spent a lil while trying to determine what I could or couldn't cut and such but it was just getting frustrating and annoying when all I wanted was a chill and relaxing game."
1hcemxk,2024-12-12,2024-12-12,"Ugh, I've wanted to play this for so long, but it runs like dirt on the Steam Deck. I bought it to test, but even with lowering everything to rock-bottom I was getting like 15fps"
1hcemxk,2024-12-12,2024-12-12,And the soundtrack is MINT. I drive for my work and sometimes just have that going in my car too.
1hcemxk,2024-12-12,2024-12-12,"Agreeing with this. It scratched the itch that DS previously scratched for me.

The basic loop so far for me is: prepare your vehicle for a little excursion into a dangerous area, travel through said dangerous area as you scavenge stuff along the way and try not to damage your vehicle too much, 'Objective: Escape' when you're ready to leave the area, prepare for the next excursion by repairing things and crafting new things, repeat while advancing the story at your own pace.

It being focussed around the car and having a nice way of controlling and managing it all means it's quite immersive and doesn't feel like you're getting bogged down in menus or anything."
1hcemxk,2024-12-12,2024-12-12,I loved that game!!
1hcemxk,2024-12-12,2024-12-12,"This is the one! Has similar feel to Death Stranding as well, with great (altho short) soundtrack.

Its impossibly buggy, but a novel concept."
1hcemxk,2024-12-12,2024-12-12,I’ve tried both of those games and immediately get stuck in/on some shit in the first few minutes of gameplay before finally giving up and quitting.
1hcemxk,2024-12-12,2024-12-12,"An underrated feature I really liked was that instead of having generic simulator elevator music, you can tune in real radio stations from around the world very easily. So I would tune into a rock station in Germany or something and between songs there would be live news or traffic updates and it felt very immersive."

1hcemxk,2024-12-12,2024-12-12,It’s such a relaxing game. It’s also super fun in VR after you get it dialed in.

1hcemxk,2024-12-12,2024-12-13,"The problem I got with ubisoft games is they are marketed as combat focused games. I want the combat loop to be focused,fun and exciting to any encounter. I get bored with them all the time"
1hcemxk,2024-12-12,2024-12-12,Dave the Diver is a fantastic game. It really isn't what OP is asking but you can't go wrong having it in your library of games.
1hcemxk,2024-12-12,2024-12-12,"I think for space trucking you're currently still better off getting Elite Dangerous. Star Citizen is way too unfinished in that regard and doesn't feel that good to play.

1hcemxk,2024-12-12,2024-12-12,Think more about making paths through snow pack and mud ridden trails causing you to use recovery vehicles and such to get your original vehicle from the muck to get to your destination aka goal.
1hcemxk,2024-12-12,2024-12-12,The game is fully playable and 100% enjoyable without a single DLC. I think I might have purchased a single one because I thought the truck looked funny.
1hcemxk,2024-12-12,2024-12-12,You don't have to buy any. The 3 base maps are like 200-300 hours.
1hcemxk,2024-12-12,2024-12-12,"Ive played for around 40 hours so far. Im only on the second map. Theres 3 included in the basegame.

Even the dlcs themselves I hear take dozens of hours each. Id say the game has plenty of value behind the dlcs, its not like paradox"
1hcemxk,2024-12-12,2024-12-12,Haven't bought any.

1hcemxk,2024-12-12,2024-12-12,"There are lots of ways to make money.

If you have a specific goal in mind, then using an efficient path to get there matters.

If your goal is only to enjoy the path, then the reward is only acting as a minor contraint rather than as instrumental to a goal, so ""buying whatever you sell here and selling it wherever buys it"" just gives you an easy-to-follow set of instructions.

Like taking your car out for a drive to a store in a neighbouring town. You didn't really need to go there, but you felt like a drive. That store gave you an easy excuse to do something in the car other than drive around aimlessly.

Sitting in your cockpit listening to some music (or just the ambient sound of your Frame Shift Drive) sometimes is its own reward.

Plus, they have a neat mug for sale!"

Also, man, you could build hilariously fast and long-jumping ships when you ditch all the weapons, their mass, and power demand. Pirates would be like “gimme your stuff” and I’d just fly away."
1hcemxk,2024-12-12,2024-12-12,"Try it again. The timing isn't bad. Just have to understand it.

I love space, and flying, so I thought Elite Dangerous looked like the best version of that. I struggled a lot before learning it. I didn't learn everything, far from it, and I haven't played it in a while but I still got a few hundred hours on it and I love it. One of my all time favourites, even with Horizons/Odyssey lol. 

Such a good sim."

And immediately put the nanocarbon in the furnace =/"
1hcemxk,2024-12-12,2024-12-13,"I'm still in the early hours so can't say for sure, but honestly I haven't found it to be. It's a game that designed to stress you out a little bit in various ways, but in terms of materials I've never really had many issues. It feels fairly generous (atleast on my difficulty). Even when you as a player forget to prepare appropriately for an excursion, you might be able to scavenge enough and make the basic tools you need on site or just adapt and see what other things you can do. The challenge comes in not damaging your vehicle too much as you drive around and maintaining it efficiently in between. Do that poorly, multiple times in a row, and you'll maybe need to pay much closer attention to materials. But so far it's been a good balance between having enough materials to get by, but not enough for me to just waste materials thoughtlessly.

There are lots of difficulty options though, so you can tailor it a bit. But I'm playing on the default setting and kinda vibing hard with it. There is also a dumpster out back in the garage area that always gives you the things you need when you're running a little low on stuff or need a replacemeny part or something (and there's also a car you can scrap that's usually sitting there in that area too) so even in the prep area before you go on an trip, you can get enough resources that let you build some basic tools or make some basic repairs to set you up and get you quickly back into the basic gameplay loop."
1hcemxk,2024-12-12,2024-12-13,"I've played through it, you don't have to grind much  The gameloop kind of pushes you towards planning a route around gather orbs that progress research which also lead to the level ending faster so you have to be efficient around your pathing 

There is lots of loot but once you get an idea of what gives a lot you can get the essentials quickly and focus on what you need for upgrades somewhat sporadically.

I think the game does a poor job of telling you this in the first few zones so people spend too long grinding in those just bc they last longer than the later areas before ""collapse"""

The one behind looks like the Dirac equation, it describes certain particles. [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_equation)


I'm not sure at all why these have been used in particular or how they influence the game.

Edit: The Schwarzschild radius also arises naturally within general relativity when obtaining descriptions of space-time. Perhaps this hints at some sort of unification between general relativity and particle physics.

4o2aog,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,kind of wondering why the hand prints are all over him in what looks more like ash then dirt.
4o2aog,2016-06-14,2016-06-14,"Clearly this indicates a multiple worlds style setting with a probable ""afterlife"" layer tossed in. The baby vanishing along with the hand prints are probably indications of multiple outcomes or a meditation on choice.

Hand prints on him are probably an indication of manipulative forces on his life most likely manifested as the floating figures in the sky at the end.

4o2aog,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,I don't think they are flash drives as in the picture you can see under them and there is no opening. But maybe they are some type of talismans for physics laws. Maybe the reality is augmented without them and part of the game is obtaining them.
4o2aog,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"Wow, that level of detail...he's got little hairs on his nipples"
4o2aog,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,Strands will relate to string theory. This game will involve reedus traveling through several different string worlds to try and save his son.

4o2aog,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,Those don't look like flash drives. But there is 5 of them and 5 of the floaty spaceship things. Maybe they are spare keys to the floaty spaceships?

those are not flash drives, are just something on which most important equations for something game-related are written.

Something like ""the world's ended, here is the science to rebuild civilization"""
4o2aog,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"Kojima always has symbolic images in his games and trailers, besides the equations he so far is the only man on the planet being looked down on by  5 shadowy figures in the sky (maybe being judged?). He also has a cross on his stomach and everything on earth is connected to this ""Man"" but it has also been devastated by what looks like man's exploits. Also in the beginning of the trailer he has handcuffs on but just on one hand maybe symbolizing Man being freed from control and seeing what Man does with free will."

4o2aog,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"Just spitballing here but what if the whole premise of the game is what happens to someone after they are sucked into a black hole. Even though scientifically they would be ripped apart but let's say that part doesn't happen and it's more like a wormhole situation and Norman Reedus was the lucky fellow to do so. We experience the journey through his eyes. Possibly very far into the future that's also is allowing men to be surrogates for children in the early stages of pregnancy (baby seemed to be a premature). Also, a recent scientific [story about 5-Dimensional Black Holes ](http://www.space.com/32008-five-dimensional-black-holes-theory.html) that references a [journal](http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.071102) released on February 18th could be why there are 5 figures in the sky and also 5 ""dog tags or memory drives"" around Reedus' neck. Maybe each one has information pertaining to each specific mini Black Hole and the figures are potential ""greater beings"" that play a large role in the understanding of the universe and maybe give opportunity to travel between the mini Black Holes. Thoughts?"

The second equation looks far more complex and seems to be a differential equation. They are using psi of x. Last time i used psi of x it was in a solution to a second order differential.

The Schwartzchild radius is the size something needs to be compressed to in order to create a black hole. That is, for any given mass, how small it would be when you make it dense enough to collapse into a black hole. The Earth's Schwartzchild radius is about the size of a 9mm bullet. The entirety of humans on Earth is a pinhead."

r^s = (2GM)/( c^2 )

r^s is the radius of the spherical object

G is a constant for gravitational force

M is the mass of the spherical object

c is the speed of light / escape velocity

You could substitute any velocity in c's place, but in order for it to be a black hole the escape velocity (or how fast you need to go to escape the gravity of the spherical object) must be the speed of light.

>Once a particle is inside the horizon, moving into the hole is as inevitable as moving forward in time, and can actually be thought of as equivalent to doing so, depending on the spacetime coordinate system used.

So if you cross the horizon of a black hole the center is literally the only place you can go. Also you are thinking of Hawking radiation and it can only cause black holes to evaporate if they are no longer absorbing matter."

4o2aog,2016-06-14,2016-06-15,"Yes and no.  Kojima is all about symbolism and references.  The tech singularity is named that because it's a possible point in time where technology accelerates so fast that we have no way of predicting what it will look like, similar to the fact that we can't look beyond the event horizon of a black hole.  

There are other clues that this game's story is centered around technology.  Maybe the rapid, uncontrolled expanse of humans/machines has killed all marine life.  Or maybe this is some trippy delusion Reedus is experiencing while accelerating towards a black hole.  Either way it's fun to speculate."

Remember, a black hole is caused by a high amount of mass in a small amount of space."

(I wish I didn't delete my post due to the down votes, so I could reference it) Secondly I never said pass the event horizon. I said that once an individual or what not were to be sucked into a black hole they would stay at the even horizon, (the following I did not mention but should of) as the time relative to it will make it seem as though you are stuck at the outer edge of the hole so you'd never experience being at the center.

dzmdyt,2019-11-21,2019-11-21,That was the dude who got his Dead Cells review copied by IGN earlier this year.
dzmdyt,2019-11-21,2019-11-22,"Vgdunkey loved *mgsv* when it came to gameplay. Did three videos on it and I believe his dunkview was 5/5?

While not literally the fox engine, here comes *Death Stranding* with a ton of MGSV DNA. The way combat works, the use of slow motion, arguably how Snake and Sam move (sans cargo) is identical, the structure of missions and use of loadouts, it's all fundamentally the same and yet..he hated it. 

MGSV was nothing but ""fetch quests"",  And when you boil it down, the only major difference between those two games is how much of an emphasis is put on the core mechanic of exploration over combat/stealth. 

Here's this video showing the type of ingenuinity in the game is more than possible if you bother to look, even when its clearly not meant/intended for such feats to be the main focus or goal.

It's another game where I actively hear people **turned off from even giving it a shot** because  they want to be the echo chamber for an e-celeb. Same thing happened a week prior when IGNS review dropped and I'm having God damn *God Hand* flashbacks."
dzmdyt,2019-11-21,2019-11-21,Reviews are necessary so that people who are indifferent on games have input to make a decision whether to purchase the game or not. Especially if it’s for gameplay reasons.
dzmdyt,2019-11-21,2019-11-22,I dislike the game so everyone else should too though!! /s *although I actually don't like it that much*

dzmdyt,2019-11-21,2019-11-22,Lol yes! Some parts are WORD FOR WORD plagiarism! Stay classy ign
dzmdyt,2019-11-21,2019-11-22,"I found it so weird how much Dunkaroo hated DS too. Make the core game play more stealth focused and add a cargo delivery element to MGSV and you've got Death Stranding. And MGSV is probably my second or third favorite game of all time.

And with the shooter games in America comment from Kojima, I'm pretty sure he meant ""this isn't a run and gun action game and that's what is currently popular in that region so maybe that's why it's doing amazing everywhere but there."""
dzmdyt,2019-11-21,2019-11-22,"yeah, i don't think that's what the person is getting at. they're pointing out that there is an active group of people who are just popping into subs to hate on the game without really having given it a chance. no one is shitting on legit reviews. something that has thought put into it is fine, but if you're listening to some edgelord complain in a forum that its a ""fedex simulator"" then neither of you were willing to give it a chance in the first place and the game was never going to be for you."
dzmdyt,2019-11-21,2019-11-22,"No. It's more that people go out of their way to hate on a game that doesn't pander to their tastes when they should just be indifferent. Like I said, it's like if I were to go into threads about a game I give zero shits about, say a golf game, and bash it. Thinking about it now though, if there's one thing people love to do on the internet, it's rage about unimportant things."
dzmdyt,2019-11-21,2019-11-21,"The story actually makes a ton of sense, I'm not sure why people are having problems with it

Now, if it's GOOD is a whole other discussion, but everything gets explained super well.

dzmdyt,2019-11-21,2019-11-21,"Steep caught me off-guard.  It's fun but somewhat repetitive if you're just trying to eke out those last couple hundred points or shave a couple seconds from a challenge.  It's great as a decompression game if you're just looking to ski/board/soar through a cool environment.  It's a chill, atmospheric sports game."
dzmdyt,2019-11-21,2019-11-21,"Steep was less SSX and more of an actual riding experience. Boarding in Steep was atmospheric, chill and beautiful. Doing tricks was not easy and felt more like actual snowboarding. It didn't just work out, you need to work for it to nail tricks."
dzmdyt,2019-11-21,2019-11-21,"It's a fun, beautiful game, definitely worth the £11 I paid for it in a sale, but does get repetitive. Great to relax. Definitely not worth anymore than that."

dzmdyt,2019-11-21,2019-11-22,"Yup, kind of like you are raging about stupid comments other people leave. You've dedicated three paragraphs across two comments now. Hopefully you at least amused yourself while writing them out. :) That's pretty much the only reason I write long ranty comments."
dzmdyt,2019-11-21,2019-11-21,"Personally the game as a whole, only made sense in the last 3 hours, but all the individual character stories kept me hooked until then. I still love the story now that it makes sense."
dzmdyt,2019-11-21,2019-11-22,"The relationship of BBs, BTs, Dooms, Repatriations, and Voidouts doesn't seem consistent with what's in the gameplay against what's in the cutscenes.

Seems like Kojima just wants things to happen the way they happen because stuff he doesn't want to explain, and if you don't understand it then you're just stupid.

I have similar complaints with MGS2 and MGS4, or at least their endings.

Sorry, myself (and most of the rest of the world) are not stupid. Kojima is just a bad story teller."

10/10 for some of the shit that happens in the later chapters of the game. I yelled ""EXCUSE ME"" a few times at my TV."

Today I went back to first area and delivered everything - including stuff left by other players in public locker. Took several hours. And I'm gathering stars from everyone.

And I never been so hooked. I don't know what is happening."

I fucking lost it. Classic Kojima dialog and I love it."
dzmdyt,2019-11-21,2019-11-22,"""Embracing the bad dialogue"" 

Everyone should know by now Kojima's stories and characters are batshit, I mean, did you guys play MGS2?  Even though it's old everyone needs to play MGS2, it was both batshit and incredibly thought provoking about issues that we are really just starting to have trouble with today."
dzmdyt,2019-11-21,2019-11-21,As grown up people running super important shit in a postapocalyptic America would say: you said it SpicyBigDad 🤣🤣🤣👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👌👌👌
dzmdyt,2019-11-21,2019-11-21,"I would disagree. I dont think it's a case of not playing enough, more one of preference.  Plenty of people just dont like the game from a design standpoint.  It's perfectly okay to like spicy food, or hate spicy food.  That doesnt make spicy food worse or better it's just not for you."
dzmdyt,2019-11-21,2019-11-22,"Great explanation, Kojima would be proud."
dzmdyt,2019-11-21,2019-11-22,"My girlfriend thought that Metal Gear was a military simulation series.

That changed when The Pain exploded into bees."
dzmdyt,2019-11-21,2019-11-21,So you did play it? My apologies if it's not for you that's okay.  Just don't shit on spicy food if you can't handle it would be the takeaway then.  Most of us are tired of people acting like the only people that love it are fanboys... most of us genuinely appreciate the deviation from the norm.
dzmdyt,2019-11-21,2019-11-21,"I never shit on it I just said not everyone finds it fun.  That's not exactly a scathing review.

That's like saying not everyone likes spicy food... which I think everyone would agree is super fair."

Maybe some will find it boring, in that case it's not for you. But isn't that what is good about gaming, that everything has its own niche and people can enjoy different things.

Death Stranding is a great game to play if you want to sit back and enjoy the atmosphere. 
Otherwise, we end up with the same AAA title following the same fomula every 12 months."

Change my mind.

Also, the best item in the ""game"" is literally an item that shoots you to the destination. It's literally the same as the original Mario Bros where you can warp to further levels and thought to themselves ""wow I must really hate this game to willingly skip everything like that""."

e8vnip,2019-12-10,2019-12-10,"I think the people who've labeled it a flop didn't bother to play the game as intended or are just review bombing it.

- The story of it is basically an episode of Black Mirror...it's super odd and really interesting. The very first mission of the game has you carrying the body of your dead mother up a ghost infested hill to burn her before she explodes and blows a hole in the earth. If that's not enough to intrigue you about the world, then I don't know what is.

- The cast is amazing and they act the heck out of it. Amazing performances all around.

- The graphics and Art Direction are awesome.

- The gameplay is great and can become addicting once you get out of the tutorial section.

- This game is a slow burn, just like RDR2. The first two chapters are slow and are there to basically introduce the gameplay and crazy story concepts. I think people get stuck here and immediately pass judgement...all the ""walking simulator"" comments are kind of garbage...I did way more walking in games like Assassin's Creed Odyssey than this.

Once you hit the third episode of the game it completely opens up...and if you like games that have that sort of methodical, grindy kind of gameplay, you'll probably like this too. I would say if you like games like MGSV or No Mans Sky you'd probably like this.

It's not a game for everyone...but it's a pretty unique game both from a narrative and gameplay perspective."
e8vnip,2019-12-10,2019-12-10,"I wouldn't treat Reddit as the end-all of general opinion. I believe it had the most successful launch of any PS4 title. It's also my personal choice for GOTY.

Actually I just had a look at IGN who recently unveiled their 2019 awards. IGN had a rather infamous negative review of Death Stranding and it wasn't included in their GOTY nominations. It still won best PS4 exclusive (as voted by readers) with 70% of the vote. 70 fucking percent. I get this wasn't a big year for PS4 exclusives compared to 2018, but if DS was so universally hated it surely wouldn't have achieved a landslide."

e8vnip,2019-12-10,2019-12-11,"I really hope so... Hopefully since it just won the people's choice GOTY on IGN, that will help."
e8vnip,2019-12-10,2019-12-11,"The first part of the game really heavily banks on you getting invested in the story to push through those first two episodes.

I remember specifically telling my coworker midway through Episode 2: ""I'm going to just burn through the story because I think the gameplay will get old.""

I came back to work on Monday and told him: ""I spent 15 hours just doing side missions and delivering packages all weekend. I haven't progressed past Episode 3 yet."" The gameplay itself is just casual enough to be cathartic but strategic enough to keep you engaged. I find it memorizing. 

Even the parts that I thought I would hate...trudging through Mountain Knot City I was sitting there thinking ""Okay, this is where I'm gonna give up and burn through the story."" ...again, 15 hours later and I'm sitting there thinking: ""If I can just get a zipline to the top of THAT mountain I'll be able to create a SHIPPING EMPIRE!""

Add to that the need to answer all the mysteries the story poses...I really don't understand the hate for it, I think it's awesome."
e8vnip,2019-12-10,2019-12-11,"They most likely didn't, or didn't get out of the tutorial area."
e8vnip,2019-12-10,2019-12-11,To each his own. I felt it was over hyped and was a chore not worth the story it was telling.
e8vnip,2019-12-10,2019-12-11,3 hours and full refund afterward. A walking simulator is not a game.
e8vnip,2019-12-10,2019-12-10,"More or less.

About 10 hours, maybe, I'd say. Most of that time is spent trying to figure out what the heck to do.

Originally I wanted a black background with oil hands and arms stretching all around it to sort of form the negative shape of the baby. 

I spent a bunch of time on that but just wasn't feeling it because I also needed the baby darkly shaded to support the internal character imagery...so the dark and dark didn't work. I probably blew 2-3 hours just trying to do that..."

e8vnip,2019-12-10,2019-12-11,"Holy fuck if that isn't exactly me. I spent so much of Episodes 3 - 5 completing roads and delivery optional packages. I have stars from most of the people around the area of the game those episodes are centered. I then thought ""okay, if I don't just target the story deliveries I'll burn out"". Several days later I'm only on episode 6 or 7 **but** I can zip-line all over that damn mountain. This game doesn't just entice you to complete tasks by giving you XP, it encourages completing optional tasks by actually enhancing/optimizing/stream-lining future deliveries. That's something I now look back at other games and think ""why would I bother collecting these chickens for you when the worlds ending?"". 

There must be so many of us, but the ""walking simulator"" meme train has kept us all quiet. This game is awesome and I need to say that more confidently."

Most roguelike games. Monster Train, Risk of Rain, Risk of Rain 2, and Slay the Spire all have 150+ hours. Dead Cells is getting there. Faster than Light ended up at 75h, but I probably could have sunk 25h more into it if I did get so into Into the Breach, which had potential to get that high, but I ended up getting really into Hades (which is a roguelike with 230h, but definitely has an RPG feel).

Terrarria has 860h and is a survival crafting game. Survival crafting in general gets these numbers."

RimWorld, if you like colony management or if you like to fill in stories the game prepares for you

Eco - if you want some multiplayer grinds experience, being part of a team

Ark: survival ascended - if you can run it, and if you like survival games and dinosaurs (I recommend solo or coop with a friend, I didn't like playing on servers)

Terraria - Maybe too much of an RPG for you, but not quite, so maybe have a look.

Cities: skylines 1 and 2 - both good city builder games, if you can grab the first one with DLCs in a sale, I recommend that, otherwise try the 2nd one

Total war Warhammer 3 - turn based strategy/RTS , plenty of playtime, combined on the 3 games I have over 800 hours, but if you are gonna get one, get the latest.

XCOM: enemy unknown, within, and XCOM 2 - all of them are great games, I personally prefer the older ones (enemy unknown and the DLC Within)

Dyson sphere program - similar to Factorio, but scratches the automation itch a little differently.

Sid Meier's Civilization 5 or 6 - both great turn based  strategy games, each is different, IMO 6 is better, but some prefer 5

Plateup! - preferably if you have a buddy to play with, hard to explain, but super fun, can also be played solo, but is better with friends, in solo I don't think you'll get 100 hours

Prison Architect - if you like the idea of managing a prison.

Crusader Kings 3 - seems hard to get into, but you can hover over anything in the game to get it's wiki entry and eventually you understand what's going on.

Oxygen not included - colony management, with added management of temperature, oxygen, electricity, CO2.

Project zomboid, may feel like an RPG in some ways, but I'm it's core it's a hardcore zombie survival, most detailed survival game I've seen.

I don't have 100 hours on this one yet - Workers and Resources: Soviet Republic - if you are from Europe, especially ex-soviet block, this is a great history themed game about building a Soviet city, you need to manage workers, their needs and the industry.

Finding games that can offer over 100 hours of gameplay outside of the RPG and multiplayer genres can be a bit of a challenge, as RPGs typically dominate discussions about lengthy single-player experiences. However, there are several titles across various genres that provide deep, engaging experiences which can easily consume over 100 hours of your time. Here are some excellent suggestions:

1. **Cities: Skylines** - This is a city-building simulator that goes beyond the basics of managing a city. Players can get lost in the minutiae of urban planning, from laying down roads to zoning districts and managing public services. The game's expansive mod support on PC adds even more depth, with user-generated content that can significantly extend playtime.

2. **Factorio** - A game about building and managing factories on an alien planet. The goal is to automate production and efficiently manage resources to build up a complex industrial base. It's incredibly absorbing and can become quite complex, offering potentially hundreds of hours of gameplay as you refine and expand your factory.

3. **Kerbal Space Program** - A space flight simulation game that requires players to design and fly spacecraft to complete various missions, exploring a realistically simulated solar system. The steep learning curve and the complexity of successfully designing, launching, and landing spacecraft can lead to countless hours of gameplay.

4. **Euro Truck Simulator 2** or **American Truck Simulator** - Both games offer a relaxing yet engaging simulation experience, where players drive trucks across Europe or the US, respectively. The open-world exploration, combined with the business management aspects, can absorb many hours as you build your trucking empire.

5. **Stardew Valley** - Although it borrows elements from RPGs, Stardew Valley is primarily a farming simulation game. Players manage a farm, interact with townsfolk, explore caves, and can even get married. The game's open-ended nature allows for hundreds of hours of peaceful, engaging gameplay as you work to create the perfect farm.

6. **Minecraft** (in Creative or Survival Mode) - Minecraft might seem like an obvious choice, but it's a game with nearly limitless potential. Whether you're building elaborate structures in Creative mode or trying to survive and explore in Survival mode, the game's open world and sandbox elements can keep players engaged for hundreds of hours.

7. **The Sims 4** - This life simulation game allows players to create and control people in a virtual world. From building their homes to managing their careers and relationships, the level of detail and control can lead to countless hours of gameplay. Expansion packs and mods add even more depth and longevity.

8. **Civilization VI** - While it's a strategy game, the ""one more turn"" effect of Civilization VI can easily result in play sessions stretching over 100 hours. Each game is unique, and the pursuit of victory through different paths (military conquest, scientific advancement, cultural dominance, etc.) offers immense replay value.

Each of these games, in their own way, offers a deep, engaging experience that can capture your imagination and time. They're perfect examples of how diverse the gaming landscape is, even outside the realms of RPGs and multiplayer titles."

That’s probably more suggestions than you need, but they’re all very good games with their own unique aspects and genres. These are shooters, action platformers, isometric actions, bullet hells, deck builders, and Peglin is just peggle but with a little guy. Hope one of these catches the eye"

1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"Book of Hours. It requires manual notetaking and indexing, but your first playthrough will likely take at least 60 hours, and the game is built to be replayable.

Library of Ruina. Phenomenal world building and atmosphere. Weird in the best kind of way. Impossible to explain without paying it. 

Void Stranger. Do you like Sokoban games?  Play this and look *nothing* up. How long this game takes you will depend on how much you struggle to figure out the secrets, and it's all knowledge based."

1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,Absolutely get the zelda games. I am not a very skilled gamer so I probably take longer than most but I probably spent 6 months on each game.

1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"FTL is a good one. I’ve put a couple hundred hours into it between various ships, achievements, and failed runs over the last 8 years. It’s a simple game that manages to be difficult and has an incredible soundtrack. 

If you like crunchy, challenging action platformer roguelike, both Rogue Legacy and Dead Cells have provided me hundreds of hours of fun between them for me. Of the two, I would say that Dead Cells is more challenging but also more engaging overall. 

These won’t eat up 2000 plus hours of your life, but they’re solid games. "
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"TOTK esp if you’re into going for 100% — definitely 100+ hours, I’ve got 400+ in on it"

1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"   The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (with DLC)   - It's an RPG. It offers a massive open world with tons of content beyond the main storyline, including side quests, exploration, and DLC expansions like ""Blood and Wine"" and ""Hearts of Stone.""


   The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild   - This open-world action-adventure game offers a vast and immersive world to explore, with countless shrines, puzzles, and hidden secrets to discover. It's not an RPG in the traditional sense, but it provides a rich and engaging single-player experience.


   Red Dead Redemption 2   - As you mentioned, this is another excellent choice. It offers a sprawling open-world Western adventure with a compelling story, diverse activities, and immersive gameplay mechanics.


   Death Stranding   - Created by Hideo Kojima, this game offers a unique and thought-provoking experience set in a post-apocalyptic world. It features a vast open-world landscape to traverse and a deep narrative to unravel.


   Assassin's Creed Odyssey    - It has RPG elements. It's more of an action-adventure game set in ancient Greece. It offers a massive open world to explore, with a plethora of side quests, activities, and historical landmarks to discover.


   The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD   - If you haven't played it yet, this HD remaster of the classic Zelda game offers a lengthy and immersive single-player experience with a darker tone and engaging gameplay."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,Monster Hunter.  Simple story.  No where near done 200 hours in.  Huge online community.  Free DLC.  Satisfying gameplay.  New damage types and builds to try all the time.  Always popular on YouTube.  Genuine sense of wonder and awe for certain monsters appearing for the first time.  Not too easy or hard.  Just get it.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"If you like roguelikes, risk of rain 2 has tons of replayability, probably best roguelike on the market IMO. Also I’ve really been enjoying Remnant 2 and have about 150 hours in that at the moment. It’s sort of a third person shooter souls like, but the game is procedurally generated so you can replay it lots of times to get new gear and level up different classes and such.

Edit: these games are technically multiplayer in that you can play coop with friends but I’ve played both 90% solo and it’s a wonderful experience."

1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"While monster hunter is technically an rpg, it’s not in the same vein as those other games. You don’t beat the campaign to beat the campaign, you do the hunts to get better stuff to do the hunts faster and happen to complete whatever storyline there is along the way.

 The real game comes after you’ve beaten the game and are just minmaxing your build harder.


Other recommendations from me that are replayable without multiplayer would be Hades, spiritfall, risk of rain 2, slay the spire, factorio, satisfactory, stellaris, Minecraft, etc. if it’s a roguelike, automation game, or 4x game then that fits the bill pretty well"

1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,Project zomboid is a great complex but not overwhelming zombie game with it's own graphic twist. I also highly recommend dying light and agree on rdr2. Rdr2 is truly an experience.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"Anything Paradox. They are all strategy/city builder games, but the hours rack up quickly. Hoi4, for example, usually takes north of 10 hours per run, and there are dozens of potential runs, each with its own flavor beyond the basics. Not to me tion the overhauls.

You build a transport network, very Zen, it's not particularly hard to earn money, the challenge is to build a efficient system.

Another old title I really like spending time on are Europa Universalis II, you start in 1419 and can play as any nation that existed at that time so you could do a play through as Bohemian or Azteks, I like the Ottomans but you could try surviving as the Byzantine empire, the game always progresses differently, once I conquered north America as Sweden early 1500s"
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"My first thought was Kerbal Space Program. It's a relatively accurate physics simulation of building and flying rockets around a solar system, with many many explosions. It is forgiving in some ways, your Kerbals don't need air or food, brutally difficult in others because orbital mechanics is pretty hard, and building a rocket that can accomplish exactly the things you need it to can be harder. You can brute force a lot of it, and there are mods that will calculate things for you that really help, and then it's still a lot of work. And then you might want to move up in difficulty from rockets to SSTOs.... Currently on sale for $9.

My second thought was the game I probably have the most time in, Star Wars: Empire At War. It's a strategy game with a bit of Total War influence from the Lucasarts era, and in addition to a pretty good base game it has a *massive* modding community that's produced some excellent stuff. That means it's also the best Stargate game and a good Star Trek game and a Starship Troopers game, and you can play in the Clone Wars era, the Galactic Civil War era, the New Jedi Order era, or the Legacy era. My personal favorite has always been the Absolute Corruption Mod, it greatly expands on the game in a way that can certainly make you spectacularly powerful but also heavily rewards skill and effective use of combined arms. But the Age of Legends mod has really been growing on me, especially as I've read the New Jedi Order books and it's been so similar to them. And the EAW version of the Stargate mod is pretty fun, although buggy, the FOC version is a lot newer and I haven't given it a proper shot yet. And it's currently on sale for $4 from the excellent Gamesplanet retailer.

Finally, since people suggested Total War, Total War: Medieval 2 is definitely my favorite of the games I've played in that series. It's older, but they put a lot more into getting it right than they have in some of the new ones (looking at you Warhammer 3). Combine that with generally strong gameplay and an enormous amount of faction variety, and a map that stretches from Egypt to the British Isles (and eventually to America), and then a bunch of extra campaigns as well, and you can get a ton of playtime out of it. Currently on sale for $7 with all DLCs included."

Yes, it is an action-rpg, but hear me out. No real rpg elements, really good monetization model and you can put in thousands of hours into it and still feel like you're barely scratching the surface.

Its a Sandbox game, based off Valve's Half Life 2 engine and assets, so in the base game you can just mess around with that. However you have access to the addons in the Steam Workshop, which can completely change how the game works and feels.
From Horror Survival to Action FPS, from complex wiring and engineering to simple sled racing.


It is just simply a game where you can have fun for any amount of time, because there is no objective, no end goal at all. It is a true Sandbox game as it gives you the tools and the entire Sandbox and says: ""Do"" It doesn't specify what to do, because it doesn't have anything it wants you to do, except doing anything you want.


TLDR; Garry's Mod, Sandbox game. Go screw around in it, you can download Lopunny models off the Workshop (or an external 3 parties site for an NSFW version) If you are into that thing."

Do you mean no RPGs, as in you don’t want to play a game like the Tales series or Persona with tons of hours of dialogue and cutscenes, turn based combat, level ups and such?

1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"Stellaris (space 4x), Rimworld (colony sim), Factorio (Factory building / tower defense). 

All 3 have near infinite replayability and in my opinion are cornerstones of their respective genres. Plus when that runs dry, you realize they are absurdly mod-able and that mod community is incredibly strong. You can easily drop 100+ hours on a single playthrough in each of those games, let alone replaying. 

Most of my Stellaris games take 20ish hours, but if you dial up settings for larger/slow you can hit the 100+ mark. Rimworld, I usually get distracted and start over after 40+ hours, but I'd say it takes me 50ish hours for a fun run. I could speed run faster but that's not the point of a colony sim. Factorio is just... infinite. Your goal is to reach a tech level and launch a rocket into space while being attacked by alien bugs. Your first playthrough will probably be 20-40 hours. But that's not a true game, and the community as a whole will generally agree that the rocket is basically your spring off point towards trying to increase your factory, expand the base, optimize your outputs, etc. the factory grows to support the growing factory. You either start again and try to do it more efficiently or keep your current base growing. In either case 100+ hours is easy. 

Technically Stellaris and Factorio have multiplayer support but that's just what it is, support. Multiplayer is not the core focus of either game, its single player."

Ghost of Tsushima, if you haven't played it. It's got some RPG elements, but more along the lines of how Far Cry could be considered RPG like. Also I'd suggest playing on lethal difficulty if you choose that.

Which is why the RPG is usually the game that has that length. What does it matter if it's an RPG anyway? 100+ hours are 100+ hours regardless of what game it is?

Unless you don't particularly like them......"

Yes I'm serious, but good luck finding versions that don't lock you into the mobile version style that severely hampers the games. 

If your into racing, I highly recommend the open world racing games from Criterion. 

Burnout Paradise
Need for Speed Most Wanted (2012)
Need for Speed Hot Pursuit 

Ghost Recon Wildlands
Ghost Recon Breakpoint (although it requires a constant Internet connection 🤬)

They all offer multiplayer but can be played completely solo"

1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"The single best looter shooter I’ve ever played is Borderlands 2. In nails the loot system in a way no other game Ive ever tried does. I have 5k hours in the game maybe more. The game has depth to the combat in a way that other games in the series fail to. The most rewarding loot system that makes items feel rare to come by but not impossible to obtain if your set on it. 

It features 6 characters that all feel quite unique and encourages replayability. The story has one of the best villains in any game I’ve ever played in Handsome Jack. 

The hard mode of the game challenges the player to use the game mechanics to the fullest rewarding the player for getting good at the game. 

It also features incredibly fun rocket jumping. An unintended movement system that requires lots of practice to perfect but yields incredibly fun results. It also allows for a ton of out of bounds exploration and shortcuts that can save time and make farming quicker. This also can make the game extraordinarily fun to speedrun even on a casual level. The rocket jumping is so good I often time make jokes that Borderlands 2 is just a movement game disguised as a looter shooter."

I like to do a lot of sim racing and wanted something to relax with when I’m not racing. Both of these games are great to just sit back and get lost in.

I have 500+ hours in No Mans Sky and I still log on and can play for hours. Nearly endless planets/systems that you can explore, build bases or collect ships. Not a huge in depth storyline so a bit of a sandbox playstyle, but tons to do. It has multiplayer, but other than exploring someone else’s base, there’s not much person to person interaction and multiplayer can be turned off and the game is pretty much exactly the same.

Recently started RDR2 and I think it might be the best game I’ve ever played. It’s so in depth and there’s soooo much you can do. The character stories and quests are really good. I don’t think I’m even half way through the story and have 50+ hours played."

Also, if you have the backlog, why not go to the backlog first? Not snark, just a thought. Anyway, if you're looking for adventure games based off of what you said, Metro Exodus blends FPS with RPG elements, Ghost Recon Wildlands sucked at launch but received a lot of support, the map is huge and you can do everything as a lone wolf or with co-op. Choose Breakpoint if you'ee looking for updated graphics and don't mind alwasy-on connection required. Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is gorgeous and huge, the story is typical but exploring the world was a blast. If you're looking for a fun co-op shooter, a buddy of mine got me into Deep Rock Galactic which is a ridiculous blast with a friend or two, plus the community is pretty great. Armored Core 6 is challenging and has multiple endings so the reply value is there if you enjoy the gameplay and mech combat. These are just some ideas.

I don't know if they're still active. There were even YouTube channels just entirely dedicated to people following the monsters around in their ecosystems, like a nature documentary. The monster designs are really fun and unique and each monster brings its own set of challenges. I know people with 2,000 hours in the game who are still learning things.

Plus you get a really cool cat companion that you can put in armor and have it help you and fights.

There's also a really great community around the game for helping players and If you do decide that you want to play with other people, fights are limited to four people, unless it's a crazy event.

1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"Alternatively frost punk if your into city builders. Beware, that game tickled all my ocd and I played it longer in one session than anyone rightly should. "
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"Total War Warhammer, took my life. Thousands of hours over the trilogy, and still playing. Though TWWH3 has been a shit show since release, 2 was awesome and can be got cheap."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"Ah yes, the 100 hour tutorial. I swear im still learning new EU4 mechanics despite 500 hours of playtime."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"The joke usually goes that after 1000 hours in a Paradox game, you're finally done with the tutorial..."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"Medieval Total war and Crusader Kings 2 for me, with mods"
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,Woah woah woah 100 hours not 1000 hours
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"Man asked for weed and you straight up recommend crack. Slow down there mate, he’ll get there in time."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"So, I bought Factorio in 2017 for £15. I'm playing it right now, in fact.

I have 1331 hours, which brings my total cost per hour to £0.0112688.

I'd say I've got my money's worth."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"Ah, Factorio. Start fresh and play for a whole weekend, grind for 20+ hours, then come back 3 weeks later with no clue what you are looking at, and reset fresh once more. 

Beautiful."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,Factorio is also my most played game. And with a big update on the way it will be even more for years to come.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,Satisfactory is also good.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,This answer is super legit.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"When I got a steam deck this was the first game I downloaded for it, and now I almost exclusively play it from my bed. It's glorious"
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,I feel like I’m pretty good at the last four versions of stellaris but this new one has me starting from square one again.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,The description is spot on
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"I just finished the first 1,000 hour tutorial for crusader kings 2 the same day that they made the crusader kings 3 announcement. 

After that I got another 1,000 hours in ck2 before the release date."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,What are map painting games?
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,Yeah in another comment I broke it down but I've got like 3000 hours in 3 of those games combined. CK2/3 and EU4
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"For xcom, we used to create soldiers with the names of people we cared about; squad deaths hit harder and it added another layer of urgency."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"I actually just picked up  x-com enemy unknown/2/chimera squad for like 6 bucks last week.

It'll take me some time to get to 100+ hours because im playing like 4 different games at the moment, but the first 2 hours I did play it got me hooked.

Would you happen to know of any xcom style game that has a post-apocalyptic vibe(Fallout/Metro) rather than futuristic/alien like xcom is?"
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"I agree, although I will say that xcom is great on normal difficulty, but I really did not like it on higher difficulties. Fucking thin men with their GD accuracy. Long War is fantastic though. Base xcom is basically a 40 hour tutorial for Long War."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,The time I spend playing XCOM is about 90% soldier customization and 10% actual missions 😂
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"Xcom didn’t take me near 100 hours to beat, but the long war mod certainly would lol"
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,I tried it. I couldnt even get past the first encounter with the aliens. I got wiped. Stopped playing immediately.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"Terraria is unique in that not only does it have my top playtime, I can say I was probably happy to be playing it for every minute of it."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"Terraria, as wonderful as it is, is an RPG."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,What. A. Game.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,Satisfactory!
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"Yup, Minecraft definitely!"
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"I love rimworld. If you get bored, you can download some mods and basically turn it into a different game

At some point I was bored of the usual gameplay so I found a mod that adds Ratkin people and cottagecore building materials and furniture. I made a lovely little rat village and inn, made money by selling flowers, and generally playing it as ""cute"" as possible

Then I got bored again and made another drug fuelled cave dwelling vampire cult lol"
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"Roguelikes fit under here (sometimes). Whichever one grabs you, OP. Hades, Slay the Spire, Dead Cells are my favorites."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,I could pull consecutive life sentences without a sweat if I had access to Rimworld I think
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"And then to really torture yourself, you jump to Dwarf Fortress."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"Once you start modding, the sky is the limit, but you definitely have to understand the basics first. The tutorial helps but it’s like a single step before the pool deep end."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,Cries in rimworld console edition :( you guys get all the cool stuffs.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"Having watched my husband play quite a lot of Rimworld, I know the first mod to install is something to do with item storage. He might do a ""vanilla"" run after a big update, but that mod is the exception."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"I was going to say this and Factorio.

Something about Geneva Suggestion Simulators just does it for folk."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,Came here to say Rimworld. I've got 450 hours in it - which I know are rookie numbers - but it's still my most played game.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,Great reference to Mr. Samuel Streamer. Love his content
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,Ahh yes Rimworld. Constant raids and low food a constant concern? Start a cannibal religion and eat the raiders. Then it doesn’t matter that they taint their clothes when they die because you can just make clothes out of their skin. Seriously the stuff you can do in this game…
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,I've been playing games for nearly 25 years. And yet I still believe RCT2 is the greatest game ever created.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,With the OpenRCT2 mod! It's been in development for ages and it's incredibly good. RCT is a eternal classic but even so OpenRCT2 breathes a whole new life into it.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,This is my “if you had to pick only one game to play” choice.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,My dad probably has years in roller coaster tycoon
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,Planet Coaster! (I don't really like the new takes of RCTycoon).
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,That's it! I'm installing it Friday. It'll make a good weekend blast to the past! Thanks for the idea
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"I’d highly recommend Balatro, I got it Saturday and already have 18 hours (it’s also finals week) and I don’t see myself stopping playing any time soon, great game and is definitely worth the $15"
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,The Binding of Isaac seriously needs to go on that list
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,No one has mentioned Risk of Rain 2! Great game.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"Add Enter the Gungeon!

Also vampire survivors is so stupid. It looks lame and the control feels wonky but goddamit i have dozens of hours on it lol"
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,The newest rogue lite I’ve been dumping hours into is Balatro. I like it as much or more than StS (and I LOVE StS)
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"I was going to mention Returnal, but you are going to 100% that game well before 100hrs. I know you can sit there and master it, and do like no hit runs and various other challenges, but the person who is going to want to do that is pretty rare.

TLDR: The people who are going to go over 100hrs are going to be very rare."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,The advertising for returnal was so ass that I didn't even know it was a roguelike... now I'm actually interested in it
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"Also gonna add One Step from Eden, Enter the Gungeon, and Quantum Protocol and Inscryption for something more niche.

Both Quantum Protocol and Inscryption are cool deck builder Roguelites that you can sink time into, but both require to do story modes first before you unlock the full open Roguelite part. Quantum's can get done in a few hours and it doesn't really have an interesting story at all, and Inscryption's can easily take over 10."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,I beat hades story last night after playing on and off for months. One of the best games I’ve played in years for sure.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"Hades and slay the spire are in my top 10, such good games, and I really enjoy Hades' story"
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,Rogue Legacy is good as well. Specially Rogue legacy 2
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,And Noita
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,I'm a massive Slay the Spire fan and now Balatro has conquered my attention
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,Darkest dungeon 2 is another solid rogue lite. A lot of people who were big fans of the original are upset about it because it plays so different but as a rogue lite fan I have enjoyed it way more then the original
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,I don't know if I just had a lucky experience but returnal ended up being a pretty short game for me. I struggled on the first boss a few times but the same run I finally beat the first boss I actually went all the way and beat the game.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,Vampire Survivors is the best $5 I’ve spent on gaming in a long time.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,Monster Train as well.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,Add FTL to that.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"One of, if not *the* best game in the entire series."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,Been struggling to get into this one. I loved 2070 though.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"The fan mod Horn of the Abyss is such a great addition to an already amazing game, too!"
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,My favorite part of when I put in the original disk for that game the game freaks out because it doesn’t believe a computer can possess the amount of memory a modern one has
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"I've probably put over 1000 hours into that game over the last 25 years.  I'll play it for weeks, put it down for a while, then come back to it.  It's one of my comfort games at this point."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"My dad still plays it religiously

Edit: he is 64"
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,Yes.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,Yessss
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"And the Stardew Valley 1.6 patch is coming out soon. Great time to start a new farm.  

And lose another 200 hours."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,Stardew Valley is an RPG tho
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"Subnautica is incredible and sooooooo worth playing!  
I've also sunk hundreds of hours into Ark. It's so unoptimized and kind of a mess, but it's well worth it if that's your type of game. I loved it and always find myself going back to it!"
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"100% Subnautica. It's either a 50 hour game, or a 500 hour game. Depends where you are on the spectrum."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"Shout-out to Frostpunk, that game is wild! Can't wait for part 2"
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,I love The Forest but lowkey that game has traumatized me
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"Seconding the simulator games.  Fuck I have 60 hours into Supermarket Simulator already.  I must miss retail. Power wash simulator is a surprisingly good time,  and House Flipper I have damn near 100 hours in. (Can't go wrong with either house flipper 1 or 2)"
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,Came to say this. Been playing this game going on 10 years now.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,That's a game I've not come across in years. 
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"I’m pushing like 2100 hours combined across 3 systems of this beautifully addictive game. 

I JUST now finished every trophy except Dead God and Mega Mush. So close. This game is so fun and difficult and a right dose of RNG that it keeps me interested long after other rogue likes have failed to hold my attention"
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,This game gives me both intense anger and intense joy. I love it.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,Closing in on 400 hours after several years of owning it. Can confirm
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"Almost at my second Dead God. I've played for about 1400 hours since Rebirth released. Before that, I put about 250 hours into the OG Isaac."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"I Love to watch this game be played, but can only play for an hour or so before i get irrationally angry with it. So i just limit myself to watching streamers play it now."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"Kerbal Space Program (1) is a good answer here, mostly because of how different it is from other games."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,TLD is a damn near perfect game!
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"200h in, I've finally reached mid game... I think"
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"Game is so flawlessly both that I started playing it with buddies and then went solo and haven't gotten any punishments for it. Hell, missions and expeditions can be done solo. You can even turn PVP off but, in the 100 hrs I've played, haven't had one single grief interaction."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"And with Light No Fire in development, it's a great time to dive into Hello Games!"
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,My approaching 400 hours on my main save and haven’t earned all Nexus rewards yet although I did start on that late (around 200 hours maybe).
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,I have almost 4k hours in 7d2d and only about half of it is multi-player
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,This is the first mention of ONI I’ve seen on this thread and it honestly needs more attention. Such a good game!
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,Subnautica is obviously fantastic but you can 100% it easy in 20-30 hours and other than a bit of base building I haven’t had the urge to replay it
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,Battle Brothers is amazing.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,Did they ever “fix” the second one?  I know it launched in a pretty rough state
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"I’m bad at strategy games, I never last more than 30 minutes until the bots kill me."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,Yeah I spent well over 100 hours on rdr2. Best game ever made imo.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,Tbh the GTA campaigns aren't that long and especially in GTA 5 there's not much to do once you've completed them.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"I had to go deep into the comments to find this, but I knew for sure it would be here. I’ve been playing this game for nearly 15 years now. I have no idea how many thousands of hours I’ve put into it. It’s not everyone’s cup of tea, but hands down one of the best games ever made. Losing is FUN."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"Came here to recommend this. I have 1800 hours in ONI. It's the best colony management sim, in my opinion."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"This game is so fun, hundreds of hours haven't even gotten close to beating it."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"I love-hate ONI so much. I just want to dig my asteroid completely barren without my dupes falling into a pit of massive despair and constantly peeing on themselves. 

I thought I had a pretty good grasp on the game after a few dozen hours, then I watched a ""beginner's guide to automation"" and found out have I no fking clue."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"same here, my main problem is i probably could’ve beaten it, but then i realized a major flaw in my base so i restart and i just keep restarting and continuing the cycle slowly progressing more and more"
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"Woah it’s a huge sale, should I get the bundle with spaced out?"
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,Yeah I wish I could get into Paradox games but it's not so much a learning curve as it is a learning cliff. Those games are HARD.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"Absolutely - Yakuza 0 can be had for maybe £5 during sales, and it's ridiculous value and quality even at full price. It's worth buying just for the playable arcade games like Outrun and Super Hang-On, let alone the excellent story, zany sidequests and unique minigames that will top you out at 100+ hours"
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,They're RPGs though. *Heavy* RPGs. I love seeing Yakuza love (favorite game series) but honestly they don't fit the criteria for the question.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"I want the game. But It requires and active internet connection.

 Let me repeat that. A single player game....requires an active internet connection...

I want to play on my SteamDeck and play on the go which usually means I'm in offline mode."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"I just bought this yesterday, played until 5am. Thank fuck I work from home."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"Balatro is my GOTY, even considering how much I love other great contenders like Helldivers 2."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,Should replace Solitaire on every device
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"I'd love to see a mobile version someday, but I also know that it'll make my addiction even worse."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,I’ve been wanting to pick this up. Glad to hear you’re liking it this much.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"Definitely has some strong rpg elements, but it's absolutely a great game."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"OpenRCT2 is peak. If you have the clients for RCT1/2 on steam, definitely consider going for OpenRCT. It adds RCT1 rides and scenarios into RCT2, adds other features never before in the game and adds multiplayer."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"At a hernia-inducing stretch, it's an RPG, but it's a metroidvania at heart"
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,needs more upvotes. i scrolled down way too long until I saw your hollow knight response.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,Yea then when you are finished you can endlessly shitpost about Silksong never getting released.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,He said 100 hour not _100 days straight_
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,*laughs in my 400 hours of Stardew*
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,All these titles and not a single mention of Noita... my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"This is the way. That game is a masterpiece. If all the other games listed were on the level of cocaine, DSP is the heroin."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"Eh, while I do love both games I do not think into the breach has a much replay value as FTL."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"Ok, that's actually a good recommendation. I haven't played Monster Hunter since the PSP days. Maybe I should dive back into this franchise."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,Isn't that both an RPG and a multi-player series?
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,MGS V has some great mechanics. Such a FUN game.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,Got a good 700+ hours of fun and joy out of New Horizons.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,I completed it in a little under 20 hours. Very good game
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,Elden ring is very much an RPG.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"Elden Ring is pretty much a RPG, though.  A damned good one, to be sure, but a RPG nonetheless."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"Elden Ring is the definition of an RPG. You spec your character and play a specific role, with almost endless possibilities."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"I'm going to have to disagree with some of you.

Elden Ring is nothing like Baldur's Gate, Final Fantasy, Phantasy Star, Eye of the Beholder, and their ilk. Yes, you can make a character and put as much or as little time into it as you want (you can literally just pick a class, name it and go without tweaking one setting), but then you go about in real-time, combating enemies and exploring the world to achieve a goal and beat the bad(?) guys. You can level up stats, but hell, you can do that in some First Person Shooters and Shmups too. The RPG elements in Elden Ring do not make it an RPG with how it plays. And I think it's safe to say that Elden Ring does not play like the RPGs I mentioned. And while you might be playing as a character, you do that in damn near every game, from Turrican, to Doom, to even racing games.

So yeah, it has RPG elements, but there's no way anyone's confusing Elden Ring with the likes of Might & Magic or Ultima.

And yes, you can disable multiplayer."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,Guess we’re done here
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"Just one more turn, oh I’ll wait until x unit/building is finished, ok now choose a new unit to build, wait now x unit is close to being finished. 

Just one more turn…"
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"I got in a huge fight with one of my girlfriends because I was supposed to hang out with her, but had accidentally played Civ III for like 30 hours straight and fell asleep instead of going to her house."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"Damn, and I thought I was bad when I started at 6pm and Friday and then the sun came up like 4 ‘one last turns’ later."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,You saw your numbers were low and started getting your priorities straight
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"I did this back on Sim City in the late 90’s, except it was a Wednesday after work & I got interrupted because I had to go back to work."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"Sorry to correct you, but you misspelled Factorio."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"That's low, you need to get your priorities straightened out."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,It really hits its stride at hour 8000
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"I was like this with Civilization 4 during grad school. 

 I tried civ 5 and at  2 in the morning on my first evening playing it - I just shut it off and never played a civilization game again.  I can't stop with just one more turn."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"I was like this at 19 with civ 2. I pretty much did the same  thing, except there was definitely a lot of weed and booze in tandem. I am the least responsible nerd I’ve ever known."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"I did the same with MMOs after quitting WoW.
The game singlehandedly engulfed my life from age 26-30"
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,I just uninstalled civ 6 and installed civ 5 again and then ended up playing endless space 2 for 10 hours straight.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"It’s the districts for me. I like the idea of them but the adjacency bonus structure makes it so it’s harder to just make cool empires and role play, to me at least."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,6 is the mobile version of 5.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"Oh give them a break, maybe they didn’t start playing until 4 years ago."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"That kind of time on a game is crazy to me. Not being a hater, people can use their time however they like, but if you spent that much time on guitar (or anything really) then you’d be able to shred like a mofo and have that skill for life."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"Yeah I'm at 1900 hours in EU4, 1100 in CK2 and 300 in CK3. "
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"Ah, let me just grab one more province. Just one more battle! Oh shucks, I can’t auto resolve it…. It’s okay, I will just fight this battle, save after it and go to sleep.

Why is the sun out?"
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"As much as I love these games, that's one of the reasons I don't tend to play them as much nowadays. It's so easy to lose an entire weekend, or time travel to 5am, and it scares me lmao"
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,I almost missed an exam because of total war
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"i would highly recommend medieval 2 total war,  its a ten year old game so pretty cheap, and the modding community is absolutely insane.  Divide and conquer is the greatest lord of the rings game i’ve ever played, but its pretty hard so i would start with the base game first :)"
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,You're right about there being a fuck load of dlcs that take add up there's still so much fun to be had just in the base game. I loved twwh1 and looking back.... Wow that game didn't have shit compared to now. Still got 500 hours of fun though
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,Probably tough to get 100 h out of frostpunk. Replayability is low once you beat each scenario
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"And yet I find it really hard to go back to 2. 3 just made so many nice little changes, despite generally being a mess"
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,warhammer 3 Immortal Engines puts it as one of the best games ever made.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,100 hours not the rest of his life
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,1000 hours? You only sit on demo or what?
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"RPG gamers, “I’ve completed the main game multiple times and have finished every side quest and achievement”

Factorio gamers, “I’ve got a spaghetti starter base and I’m about to try that ‘main bus’ idea I keep hearing about. I still have no idea how trains work. Maybe some day I will be able to launch a rocket.”"
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,1000+ is still 100+

1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,I love how all the factory game players tell you about the cost per hour or day because we're converting all the resources to per min/hour anyway. Haven't tried factorio but did really like DSP
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,Stardew Valley $16 and 8000hours. 0.2 cents per hour. Makes up for all the games I've bought and never really tried
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,Just 1300? I'm on 2700  and counting :)
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,Sound exactly like the career of every CS major
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"I have a mega factory doing 8k science that can no longer run on my current computer. Every month or so I load it up and see 15ips then shut down.  
I keep looking at new computers, but I can't see myself buying an upgrade just to play Factorio.  But it may happen."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"Not my flavor, but i respect the fact they're still making content when they 100% could rest on laurels at this point. "
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"IDK how much the expansion is gonna cost, but it's silly to think that I've spent WAY more than that on a different colored shirt in other games."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,Dyson Sphere Program is very good too.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,Bruh every time I start a new stellaris game it’s completely different than what I remember. Like I remember when they did away with the original building system and I STILL hsvnt recovere
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"I want to play Stellaris again but I’m kind of tired of learning how to play the game again every time I boot it up. Feels like a different game every time I boot it up.

Great game though!"
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,Stellaris is good value because if you bought it since launch you would have played about 4-5 different space 4x games already.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,I feel this shit man. I went hard like 3 versions ago. Picked it up again recently and I had to have my friend walk me through everything like I was a blind old man.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,Literally started a new one the other day with the new DLC subscription thing which is cool. Literally have no clue what half the funny little symbols mean anymore
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"A term for Paradox's brand of ""grand strategy"" games. There's a big giant map, and you are trying to ""paint"" it with your color by expanding and conquering.

They differ from Civ and most 4X games by eventually zooming out to a *very* large scale - the most zoomed-out views are often just swaths of color on a giant map."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"Painting the map in your colour is a natural thing for lots of players when doing grand strategy games like Crusader Kings. For example, you start off in charge of a Scottish highland clan, and decide to unite Scotland. Then you fight against the English and conquer them. Then you have all this territory bordering Wales, so you take that too. Then you decide that you may as well take Ireland to take all the British Isles. 

Then next thing you know you've got Scottish Highlanders occupying Cairo and converting the local population to Scottish culture."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"Combined?! Those are rookie numbers! 😂

But seriously, so many hours of my life lost."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"Worse than losing a squaddie with a name of someone you care about is naming a squaddie for someone you hate - like say, a horrible boss - and sending them on suicide missions and see them survive and become your best sniper."

1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"Bit of a stretch as far as ""xcom style"", but if you haven't checked out the Wasteland series, they're super in-depth and quite lengthy



Edit:more concise"
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"Try Wasteland, Shadowrun or Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden"
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,Not sure it is up your sleeve but Phoenix Point to me is one of the coolest games in the “xcom-genre”. It is post apocalyptic with an interesting twist and both the music and the ambiance are spooky imo. I got fully emerged and replayed it many times!
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,My buddies have a running joke where we call bad rolls in games (missing on a 90%) an X-Com roll
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"I know this is a tired thing to say about XCOM but I just could not get past how randomly and easily my beloved squadmates would die. Ruined the fun for me, and I was unable to embrace that aspect no matter how hard I try."

1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"The Steam version is fairly accessible compared to the original. It's still a lot, but it's a little less daunting"
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"Ya, when i first played it i actually didn't enjoy it. But that was back in like Alpha stage. Came back to it after watching someone play (and got a little understanding in the mechanics) it and i've been hooked ever since."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,Ive been out of the loop for a while. I didn't even know there was a console edition. How is it? I'm imagining the control scheme is... Odd?
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,It really is a fantastic game. I just wish there was more to it with the management side. But for a game that came out so long ago I still pick it up once in awhile.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"Great game that I haven’t played since the early 2000s. 

I could never figure it out, but I always had an issue with a lack of security for some reason even if I has enough guards patrolling, how do you avoid that issue?"

1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"10 hours late but Balatro is a DAMN steal for $15. Super simple to learn and absurdly fun, especially if you like games like Slay the Spire"
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,Came here to say this one.  I'm addicted already and even though I've had it about five days I'm 40 hours in.  I'll easily get go over a hundred.

Still such a fun game though."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,So does FTL.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"Not only did they make of list of roguelikes and not include the best one, but it was also supposed to be a list of ones with high replayability, which is the biggest strength isaac has over every other roguelike."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"Risk of Rain 2 is great, but the original (and now Returns) holds a special place in my heart, and I've put way more hours into those than RoR2"

1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"The main game, sure, but the Tower is incredibly replayable."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,It’s extremely light on the rogue like elements. I would say that it’s more an intense combat game than a rogue like but it does have some of those elements. It also lacks meaningful persistent upgrades it’s more of a start from square one and see if the RNG blesses you and hope for easy bosses.

Inscryption is an amazing experience and it's worth every penny but I don't think it's very long and it's replay value is not as good as an actual deck builder roguelike like Slay the Spire or Balatro"

1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"Most games are ""Role playing games"", it's a terrible genre to narrow things down by. Like, in the Super Mario Bros, you play as Mario who's role is to save the Princess. Anyways I'd just assume he doesn't want a story heavy game, more gameplay focused."

1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"Isn’t BOTW and RDR2 both RPGs? They felt like it to me. NPCs that give you quests, levelling up skills and abilities, open worlds to explore, finding newer and better gear to fight stronger and stronger enemies, you’re literally roleplaying as a cowboy and a knight. Not trying to argue just confused on the definition if they don’t qualify."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,Agreed!!

Yea cool, I get my +1 from having two rainforests and researching castles while billy bob is researching nuclear fusion in the mountains."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"I too have a stupid amount of hours in civ,  but to be fair it's the kinda game where you can just leave it on. I often get up to do something and realize i left it running for a day"

Damn I got attacked in England by the French, might as well get my armies into French territory then I’ll save.

Fuckers tried to assassinate a general, time to die.  Then I’ll save.

Ok France has now been completely wiped out…. Wait how do they still have an army, where is their last city?  I’ll find it hen I’ll save.

Ok they’re now officially gone but it looks like The Moors are massing on our borders in Spain, fuckers."

1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,I've legitimately had a good time playing this game during fentanyl withdrawal. Factorio is powerful shit.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,Green circuits are only the start....
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,Better start working on the nuclear energy then
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,Your largest cost while gaming will generally always be the opportunity cost of not working.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"Factorio is good because the genre kind of shifts as you play and the power creep/feedback loop is really good.

At the start you move really slowly about the map which limits how big you can build depending on how much time you can be bothered to spend running from one end to the next, you'll be collecting a lot of materials yourself and crafting stuff in your inventory, and building parts of your factory by hand.

On my current save I've researched everything apart from the technologies that requires space science as I'd like to go big from here on. I've got super powerful powered armour that let's me run about at mach jesus, but even that's not enough so I've built taxi stations into my rail network so I can just summon a nuclear fuel powered train to wherever I am and have it take me to wherever I need to go.

Not that I actually need to be in any particular spot in the base to build anything, as I have somewhere in the region of 50,000 construction robots to build any blueprints I have, as all the buildings, inserters, belts etc are being produced in my starter factory and going into passive provider chests the robots can take from, and the other 40,000 logistic robots can move items from one chest to another or bring the items to me if I don't feel like physically grabbing the resource myself or want to build a quick and dirty production line without running trains to it.

Among the items being produced are walls, laser turrets, artillery shells and cannons, etc so I can sit miles inside my base far from harm and expand into biter territory using blueprints of walls, turrets, power poles and roboports so they stay connected to the network and beat the biters back with a war of attrition because as soon as they destroy a wall a robot is on its way to either repair or replace it."

1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,IMO factory games are like programming for those of us who don't code.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"Given inflation and the fact I paid £15 for factorio years ago, I’m betting the expansion could be double that.  Given the longevity of the base game, I’m not bothered by the cost."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,"I wish I could finish that game.  Everytime I start I get a couple hours in, realize how long its going to take and give up.  My first run i got about 35 hours in and then had to travel for work a bunch.  Came back to it and had no idea what I was looking at."

1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-06,Seriously. I’ve racked up around 700 hours after almost 3 years. That game has given me more value for my money than I ever could have dreamed of.
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"If rebirth was the last time you gave it a shot I would severely consider picking it up again in it's current state, since rebirth the game has essentially quadrupled in size from characters, bosses, secrets, items and quality of life."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"Yeah it really is something special. It was the first rougelike that I ever played, which is fine but now every other one I play just isn’t good enough. I didn’t play the original, but the most recent DLC for rebirth is so good. Repentance adds so much content and everything is balanced well and agh, I can’t get enough of it lol. Every once in a while I’ll play like 12 hours straight it’s awesome."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,Add it to the list looks a little confusing at first and then boom 4 hours go by and you’re still cursing at the game to just give me one heart to get this flush.

Amazing that there’s been that many entries though. I thought annual releases for some games was too much. But this is like, 84-85 releases a year over 25 years. 7 per month; or about two a week.

How do the players keep up let alone the developers!"

1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"Very nostalgic game. Actually written in assembly, which as a CS student sounds nuts to me. 

The isometric pixel look aged much better than later 3d installments in the series and it's probably still fun to play.

That said, games like Parkitect are worthy modern successors and if you don't have the nostalgia for RCT 1 or 2, you will most likely enjoy it more."
1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,"Far far far far too many to list. The game is functionally an entirely new one while holding the core gameplay and loop. You should just check out update notes.

It’s been so long I don’t even remember what QOL issues there used to be. The game is near perfect now."

1b8a5f4,2024-03-06,2024-03-07,The Sims business model has always been a monstrosity. You'd have to spend around $300 to own all content for the older Sims games. Now that seems a bargain compared to The Sims 4.

Like, he was playing for 12 hours a day and barely left his room. Skipped classes all the time, stopped going to parties with us, etc. I don't know how he even managed to graduate. Eventually our friend group staged an informal intervention for him, which was kind of ironic because the rest of us were borderline alcoholics & potheads. We wanted to cure our friend's WoW addiction because we missed getting drunk and high with him LOL."

1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-19,For AAA games I would say Death Stranding is fairly singular in the weirdness category.
1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-19,Ni no kuni 2 starts with the president surviving a nuke strike and then being isekaied into the world of ni no kuni 2 where he helps saves a catboy from a coup by shooting mice with his very real gun.

There’s weird. 

There’s Japanese weird. 

And then there’s Kojima weird."
1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,"I still think Metal Gear Solid V has a weirder beginning, at least death stranding is set in a Sci-Fi post apocalyptic world. MGSV is in a seemingly real world place and then very very strange things happen."
1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,Any Kojima game really
1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,"i think death stranding's beginning is pretty neat in the way that it builds intrigue. it is a weird world born from a pretty normal one similar to our own but with more advanced technology. that initial confusion had such a big payoff for me as things were slowly explained. like BBs for example. once you find out what the death stranding is exactly and what BBs really are, at least for me it was a moment of ""oh shit that's so cool!"" you're also about as aware of what's going on as Sam is, and i really appreciated the contrast between him playing the straight man vs the more eccentric characters like higgs/deadman/heartman. 

MGSV starts really weird too. whether it's the tonal shift from peace walker to ground zeroes or the entire hospital in cyprus sequence and ocelot cosplaying as a cowboy. i think that's probably the weirdest start to a game ever for me but DS is up there."
1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,I could say many games by Suda51.
1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,It's definitely weird for a Strand-type game.
1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,"I had bought the game about three or four years ago and never bothered starting it until two weeks ago. Weird didn't even begin to describe what I thought of it. Now that I'm all in on it, I love my zipline and road building simulator."
1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,It's Kojima. All he does is strange for the sake of being strange.
1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,"It has a clunky beggining, as well as the ending. So many explosition dumps that I actualy got annoyed. 

That being said, I enjoyed the shit out of Death Stranding. I felt emotions, I haven't felt in a log time while playing a video game."
1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,"Really anything Remedy-made is a similar kind of weird. Not same, mind you, but similar. Control is a fantastic game that I've bought twice and beaten thrice, and Alan Wake 2 is a fantastic mindfuck throughout as well!"

I’m doing the same thing. I tried playing it when it came out for PC, my computer PSU died, now I have a PS5 and decided to see if the adaptive triggers do anything (they do). 

Yes, it is so very weird.

1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,"For AAA games, I can't think of any that beat Death Stranding, but honorable mention for Nier Automata which had me confused and intrigued during the first few parts."

1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,"Nothing is on the same tier as Death Stranding, but the closest I’ve played is probably Deadly Premonition.  It’s a much more mundane weird, but it’s still a lot of what is happening right now in a relatively short amount of time."
1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,"Bizarrely, I think Death Stranding was a pretty digestible Kojima story. Once you get past the first map area, the game opens up dramatically with your creative freedom to get to where you want to go and I absolutely loved it"
1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,"Classic Kojima, sniffing his own farts."

None of it makes sense until the end."
1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,Nah. Whole game is weird start to finish. The world and graphics are so fkin good tho. Gameplay decent too. But the overall lore of the world is weird to say the least.
1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,"The Start of the game(I'm talking about the story), in my opinion is the best part, it really hooked me, with all these interesting concepts and world-building. It makes the player question  what is happening, and we want to keep playing to know the answers,

Sadly, after this, it's all downhill, and the narrative and the characters are really bad and boring."
1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,"It's just Kojima being Kojima, man. Go check the Death Stranding 2 trailer, that ups the weirdness stakes tenfold."

While everyone in the hospital is killed by soldiers. And then a flaming man with a floating child tries to get you. And then you get away but the flaming man rides a flaming Pegasus. And then a giant flaming whale smashes down from the sky. I think I got it all? It's been quite a while.

I remember just being in a very ""what the actual fuck"" state of mind after playing it. I'm used to Metal Gear games GETTING weird. But they don't usually start at their weirdest.

So, I guess the real answer is Hideo Kojima is just a weird motherfuker."

1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,"It’s tough to beat Death Stranding, so I won’t even try. But the Persona Series starts pretty weird. In Persona 5, it starts weird but is still grounded in the slice of life High School life and gets bonkers weird toward the end. [Don’t want to spoil the ending for those who haven’t played it yet.]"

Setting up a complex network of zip lines (specifically to deal with getting to the weather station or timefall farm) is so satisfying. And you know what? I fucking love the story. It so earnestly leans into the weird in a way that I found didn't always work with mgs. I found the emotional stuff like with mama and fragile to be quite moving despite all the weird writing, and the world is really beautiful. I do find it hilarious tho that this is supposed to be America despite looking mostly like Iceland, but whatever I'm here for it. And I actually get his point about this being a game about connections too! Despite not interacting with other players directly, seeing public works projects get completed with the help of others felt really nice."

MGS have always had weird stuff in them."

It seems like he uses his characters as a platform to show how smart he is. They often come across as exposition dumps, using complex words, making them uninteresting characters, in my opinion. I'm referencing Death Stranding here."

Weird as fuck — BTs are legit terrifying — but so much of the rest, the whole connection thing, the whole umbilical fetus theme, fuckin that junk dealer and his “girl” side quest, Fragile won’t break… ugh so low brow presented as high art"
1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,Came looking for this one. Weirdest I've played by a LARGE margin.
1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,"fun gameplay with stupid shenanigans, nothing like it. still laugh my ass off to this day occasionally pulling out mgsV to kidnap people, animals, tanks, etc with fucking Mach speed balloons lol. I'm sorry, ""Fulton extracting"""
1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,"I don't know many walking sims that I can grab a hover cargo machine, use it as a hover skateboard and ride my way to a bandit camp to beat the shit out of them, steal their shit, load it up onto a truck that I'm also stealing from them, and haul it to the spot I'm building a motherfucking highway at, maybe at some point sneak around some ghosts and throw pee grenades at them. But hey, what do I know about walking sims?"
1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,"Jesus, Death Stranding would be the *ultimate* charades topic"
1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,You mean Norman Reedus' Funky Fetus? Yeah that was weird. Almost as weird as Conan O'Brian giving me an otter hood

1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,Ahh yes the Castle Super Beast amazing title selection. They really know how to boil a topic down to an outrageous sentence.

1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,"MGSV was weird, but the gameplay was moderately normal. Death Stranding was one of the weirdest games I’ve ever played through and through. Loved it though"
1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,I haven't enjoyed a game being the president murdering things since Saints Row 4

1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,"I'm currently on my first playthrough. I just got to a place where it's about half way and things are getting even weirder. But if you keep up reading everything (and there's a lot to read, bring a snack), things start to make more sense and the universe starts to unfold a bit more. I think the constant timefall might explain the landscape looking like a tundra. I realized that if I back up and squint my eyes a bit I can see the dark humor and commentary on the human social condition. Plus that soundtrack has me humming ""don't be so serious"" and ""bones"" all damn day. I'm like yeah Kojima, I too enjoy Low Roar. Perfect pairing.🤌"
1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,He makes quirky but less popular titles. Deadly premonition is probably his weirdest game.
1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,Okay so there’s at least five levels.
1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,"Yeah, but they don't usually start weird. MGSV is pretty unique in that. The other Metal Gear games are another fun weird experience where you get a gritty grounded action game that suddenly takes a wrong turn into Anime land.

My favorite is MGS4. Cool detailed weapon models. Near future tech. Gritty PMC action. SUDDENLY robot man kills sexy leg robot cow tanks with a fucking sword. Only Hideo Kojima."

The spoilers are increasingly spoilery

You >!flee zombie super soldiers during the first mission!<, >!flee a giant robot being mind controlled by mister flaming guy and what I guess is psycho mantis!<, and I'm not forgetting the part where you >!have to save the world against a warchief who wants to ethnically cleanse everyone who doesn't talk English by infecting them with a parasite that activates with the vibration of vocal cords, but only for a certain language for each strain of the parasite!<

Did I mention that >!You have to fight the zombies, and will get a portable black hole to warp containers to your base?!<"
1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,"No that's a fair take. The beginning is an insane fantasy. Then you go into an intensely realistic stealth game. 


There is plot stuff to explain the difference but yeah it's kinda crazy to go from blasting fire demons with every bullet you have to sneaking up on one soldier at a time to knock them out"
1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,"Same. It was like 8 hours? Different stuff happening, different game mechanics, lots of cutscenes and credits... I got through it and then the actual game started, without any of the crazy shit... People said it was great so I stuck with it for like 10 more hours but it didn't click with me. I learned about the development later and the whole kojima/konami thing."

1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,"I know there's a heavy-ass bias on my part due to my own place in the spectrum, but I swear that dude's got *some* flavor of ASD running around upstairs.  

He's just figured out a way to take the topics that pique his interest, hyper-focuses on, and/or obsesses over; and whips up whole-ass storylines around it.   

From my perspective, for Death Stranding it's molecular chirality, and the fact that a vast majority of life-supporting molecules/amino acids we look at, they predominantly share the same ""handedness;"" then he started daydreaming about what the lifeforms that primarily use the ""opposite-handed molecules"" could be, and what would happen if we discovered it/it discovered us. Also those handprints left in caves by our ancestors eons ago; our lives are temporary and a mere flash in the pan on a cosmological scale; yet we manage to do and make things that leave our mark on this planet for centuries to come. The ""Chiral Network"" is his brainchild of what would be possible if we could access and interpret *every human's ""handprint"" in time.*  

I don't know wtf spurred ""Time fall,"" but something as mundane as rain that ""speeds up"" causality? Certainly one of the more original concepts I've heard in a decade or so.  

Though not exclusive; for MGS1 it was gene editing, MGS2 was the social echochambers we naturally gravitate towards and ""someone"" figuring out how to manipulate it for idealogical gain; MGS3 was wilderness survival techniques and CQC; all of which are shoehorned - effectively - into an obsession with America's military industrial complex and its politics.  

That's purely my take on what he does and how it comes to be; I can't say I'm not projecting my own perceptions into it, and I sure as shit can't speculate in regards to his intellectual or social prowesses; but *to me* his eccentric stories and concepts just scream ""surfin' the spectrum,"" and dude's been hanging ten and making a killing off it for well over a couple decades now. I'm beyond interested in what else his blew-out imagination can barf up; cheesy naming conventions and all."

1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,">But if you keep up reading everything (and there's a lot to read, bring a snack)

What I find funny is that Death Stranding has never been accused of being ""woke"", while the whole game is basically a criticism of Trump / US conservatism / US isolationism, and how Trump caused divisions in society, as a result of which when the Death Stranding happened, the society was too divided to deal with it, and that's why everything went to shit. But the game never uses any of those words (Trump, conservative, etc) directly, so I guess it simply went over the heads of the people who usually cry ""woke"".

Example of the game criticizing Trump:

>Let me tell you a story about the good ol’ days, back when the US of A was alive and well, and the world still hadn’t gone to hell in a handbasket. **We had us a president said he was fixing to build a border wall to protect the people.** And guess where I was born? On the other side of that goddamned wall, that’s where. If it went up, I’d be cut off from my family, my friends, everybody I left behind when I crossed over. Land of the Free my ass. Free for some, maybe.💀 And so I got to thinking, me being an immigrant and all, if something happened, would I be first on the list for help from them in charge? Would I even be on the list? Reckoned the answer was shit, no. So I figured I had to look out for number one. Built me a shelter and got everything ready for life in case of an event. And guess what happened next. Yup. The Stranding. Borders, countries, governments—it’s all bullshit."
1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,SWERY made Deadly Premonition. Suda had nothing to do with it.

1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,Dr. Schultz's big tooth carriage was there for non strangeness?
1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,may just not be remembering correctly but I think psycho mantis was the only super natural-esque entity in the whole game.
1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,"lol - you are technically correct

The best kind of correct"
1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,You're totally right. Looks like Suda did no more heroes and killer 7.
1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,Shit. We’re gonna need a whole sub-hierarchy just for unusual game designers.
1c8bfcb,2024-04-19,2024-04-20,"lol the game is both, though leans a bit more on the openess more than the on the rails movie sequences... at least compared to previous entries in the series. hideo kojima really likes his games to have gigantic sections where they just turn into a really convulted movie for half an hour or longer.

  
That said when you \*do\* get to play the game, god the games can be really fun lol"

We need more main characters with a new voice. Film is really bad about this."

1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"""My truest desire is that people don't see Troy Baker as Indiana Jones and they don't even see Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, but they just see Indiana Jones and they see themselves as Indiana Jones,"" said Baker of his upcoming role. ""That's when I know that we have done our job, when they feel like Indiana Jones more than me or Harrison.""

Harrison Ford is and will always be the one and only Indiana Jones. When I see Harrison, I see Indiana Jones. Even Harrison Ford said he’s Indiana jones and no one else could do it."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Debra Wilson, Nolan North, Laura Bailey, Tara Strong, Troy Baker. The Industry loves to keep casting these same 5 people over and over. They are all very talented individuals but damn give someone else a chance lol"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"This is true but... Todd Howard... of Bethesda... who uses like, the same 6 voices for every fucking character in every one of their games? Lmao"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I like Troy, and I love his work, but I've begun to sigh when I hear his voice in games now. There's so much talent out there, pick someone else and help them elevate the business!


That plus Troy doesn't seem to be changing his voice all that much anymore, that could just be my ears though."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,He did say to wait for him and Nolan North to die for any aspiring VOs wanting to make their big break.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"One of the coolest things about Baldurs gate three is that despite all of the well known actors in it almost all of the origin characters and most of the main characters are voiced by people who haven’t been in many large roles before unless I’m being really dumb. The only two that spring to mind is Oring being played by the same person as lady Dimetrescu and Kerberic being the same actor as Lucius Malloy, shadowheart’s va is also in Elden ring as latenna."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"While yes Baker is talented— along with the Critical Role crew, I am so exhausted of hearing them in every single game I play."

1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Why is Troy Baker in every game?

""He just works"""
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I definitely thought it was him when I first heard the trailer.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Dunno why people assumed it was Troy Baker (even if it kinda sounded like him). 

Jason said literally one word in the trailer and Rockstar have never went with a recognisable name for a lead character outside of Vice City."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Troy Baker and Nolan North talked about how they can do other voices (God of War 2018), but game directors keeping asking them to do their normal voices."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Well that’s not very nice to say, Todd"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Todd is right tho...
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"As far as voice actors go, the only thing I want in general is to see the whole main cast of BG3 more in whatever bigger games in the near future. They all absolutely crushed it and brought so much life and passion to their characters."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I’d say Yuri Lowenthal is popping up a lot now, a lot more than Troy."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Most of the time I cant tell if that is Troy Baker or Matt Mercer since they have very similar voices.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,We all don't want Troy Baker is GTA VI.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Surprised by everyone saying they’re tired of seeing Troy in everything. Looking at his IMDB, Since 2020, I can only find a handful of notable games in which he’s not reprising older roles:

The Medium, 
Guild Wars 2, 
God of War Ragnarok, 
Metal:Hellsinger, 
Fort Solis, 
Stray Gods

Only a few of those are big games, and he only has minor roles in those ones. 

I find him a bit of an odd guy, but there’s a reason he has been in a load of video games, he’s one of the best voice actors in the world, it’s not surprising people want to hire him."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I sort of agree with Todd Howard on this one.

Troy is fantastic, but the number of times he’s popped up in big games is immersion killing. I want more than one very distinct voice."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Pagan Min becomes the king of Leonida
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I can see where they are coming from, but IMO Troy Baker can never beat his performance in Batman: Arkham Knight as Jason todd"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"You know, I think I agree with Todd here. It’s always like the same five people in a lot of games. Troy Baker, Matt Mercer, Laura Bailey, etc."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"He’s a good voice actor, but it’s gotten to the point now where it feels like I’ve heard him too often and when he’s not even changing his voice much or at all, I’d rather someone else do the job.

His Harrison Ford/Indiana Jones for the upcoming game just sounds 90% like his normal voice."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I don't dislike Troy Baker. 

But I'm tired of hearing Troy Baker.

And Matt Mercer."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"We should give struggling up and coming VO artists a chance, like Chris Pratt. 
He knocked Mario out of the park, so he’s proved beyond a shadow of a doubt he can handle a video game character. His depth and range puts someone like Troy Baker to shame. 

If I was the manager at Nintendo, I’d make sure I’d hire Chris Pratt to voice all the newest games. He could be everyone from Zelda to Tetris








/s"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"It's understandable why Troy Baker might not be in GTA 6 if he's indeed been in numerous other games. Variety in voice acting talent can bring fresh perspectives to characters, enhancing the overall gaming experience.

On the other hand, it’s still disappointing to hear Troy Baker won't be in GTA 6! His talent has added depth to countless characters in the past. Honestly, I feel Baker's versatility could have enriched the game's narrative."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Based Todd.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I'm surprised Todd is even aware that games that aren't Skyrim exist anymore.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"The irony of ""Troy Baker is in every game"" and getting him for Indiana Jones because he can do the voice. The ability to change your voice depending on the character you're hired to play without people being able to tell that it is you? THAT's voice acting.

John DiMaggio is another person you can only tell if you're listening for him actively."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"While I agree with the sentiment, it sucks to hear a big name in the industry essentially call out blacklisting you for being too popular (not like Todd Howard has made anything good in a while so Baker is safe there).    

I would also say that VAs like Baker bring alot more to the table. As voice actors, they can voice several characters with their own distinct personalities which could save money on production. Would much rather have a game only voiced by Troy Baker than a game filled with Hollywood celebs phoning it in. "
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Agree with Todd. I appreciate that Troy is a legend but it's always so obvious when it's him and he seems like kind of a fuck boy as well. I want new voices.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I love Troy Baker, but I agree with Todd Howard. He’s just too prevalent, it’s distracting hearing his voice sometimes"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Troy Baker is overrepresented in voice acting, nothing wrong with his skill but he is not so ahead of the curb he deserves that many starring roles in these games"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I don't really mind Troy Baker in everything because he actually sounds very different in most of his performances. Nolan North sounds exactly the same which is why I think he isn't in quite as much stuff anymore, or at least not with such frequency."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Honestly I agree with him, I’m fucking tired of Troy baker . Besides Joel I really don’t like any of his acting"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Funny that Todd Howard says that when Laura Bailey is one of the most prolific voice actresses and plays Serana. Though I mostly see all her other characters as Serana not the other way around.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Rockstar has always been good about casting talent that are relatively unknown to us (apart from the celeb voice talent era) and end up delivering some all time performances. Nobody really knew Roger Clark or Michael Hollick but Arthur Morgan and Niko Bellic are legendary. I have faith in their casting without having to turn to industry mainstays. Troy Baker is quite talented though.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Suffering from success
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"One of TB best role has to be Pagan Min from Far Cry 4 and Booker DeWitt from BioShock Infinite.

I don't care that Joel is the one that made the impact, but those two...are dope AF!"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I am really worried about GTA 6. The hype levels are insane and if this crashes it will unleash havoc. Almost all the OGs are gone at the studio and of course GTA Online will be milked again.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I bet it's Matt Mercer... He usually replaces Troy
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I must be terrible at recognizing voices because I never hear a character and think “that’s Troy Baker” or “that’s Nolan North”.   My brain just doesn’t make that connection
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I honestly feel the same about Matt Mercer unfortunately.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Honestly, what's the last game he had a big part in?  TLOU 2 four years ago?  It's all been small parts or films/tv things for a few years now.  I get being tired of his standard deep voiced male lead acting; that was definitely overdone for a few years; but it's been a bunch of years since he's played any roles like that."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I did a genuine sigh of annoyance and eye roll when I saw he's voicing Indiana Jones. 


That and it being in first person made me lose any excitement I had for this game."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,todd “uses the same three (3) voice actors for EVERYONE in the game” howard? that todd howard?
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"The guys from critical roll are in everything, too. I wish companies would hire people who need the work a bit more."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Well, I’ll see you guys in 5 years when we get to the fatigue stage of Matt Mercer"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,134 video game credits alone is pretty ridiculous
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I have to agree with Todd.  How many thousands of actors are out there and the same guy gets every other lead role?  It getS old after a while.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Troy is a great actor but I really don't want him as the lead in this too. Honestly the VO world needs to get bigger. Every animated show and video game really do have the same voice actors. For example, Noshir Dalal is a great actor. He plays Kotallo in Horizon, Bode in Jedi Survivor and Charles Smith in Red Dead Redemption 2. These characters already sound identical. 

But even in minor roles he's everywhere. He played Admiral Rampart in the Bad Batch, but he also plays a bunch of random characters too that he probably didn't even get credited though from his IMDB. He plays Oda in Cyberpunk and alot of NPCs, in Spider-Man on Playstation he played a lot of the thugs in 1 and Miles Morales, then in 2 he plays thugs, the Fire Department Chief and Mysterio. 

Kinda like with Troy, once you've heard his voice it will stand out in everything. Troy, Laura Bailey, Roger Craig Smith, Matt Mercer, Debra Wilson, Nolan North, Ashley Burch. Jim Pirri is a newer one, dude is everywhere now. 

These people are all great at their jobs of course, but when you play the big games and they have the same actors playing similar roles it takes you out of it abit. I'll give credit to Troy and Laura Bailey in that they can pull off some VO that doesn't sound like them but most of them sound the same in everything."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Troy Baker is in a lot of games though, and it would be nice to see some new voice actors start breaking through and changing up the tone a bit."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Troy Baker has become the new Wilhelm scream.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Good. I’m also sick of him being in everything.

Besides, he’s got that Indiana jones game to keep him busy. And it’s not like he’ll be out of work for long considering Sony hire him for every game they do so he’ll probably be working on naughty dogs next game soon.

Same with Laura Bailey for woman’s roles too. Sick of her as well."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I feel like Todd Howard has bigger things to worry about than whether Troy Baker is in his game given the absolutely abysmal state of Starfield.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,That’s kinda funny ngl
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,The main actor looks like WorldWideWob to me lol
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Far cry 4 Pagan and Booker from Bioshock,  legend ain't he?"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,It's not me in GTA6 either guys
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Across the universe
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Literally unplayable/j
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I liked him as Red Hood
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Did he do any Halo stuff?
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Dope 😚🔫

1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,First time I ever heard Troy was in Catherine and man I fucking loved that perfomance
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"they'll use unknown talent for the VA

ever since GTA 4 they've been doing that , because well known actors tend to be troublespme"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,But they still hired Matt Mercer for Starfield...
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"That might’ve been the only time Todd Howard was telling the truth, huh."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Todd wasn't in the wrong in this one instance. 

Troy really does get around and he doesn't have the range to mask his natural voice all that well. 

It's the same for Yuri who plays spiderman, half the helldivers, and much more. He just uses his natural voice for everything. As spiderman it fit, in anything else... Not that well. 

We need more variety and for that to happen they need to start compensating voice actors even a fraction of what regular actors get paid, or arguably a more tough job. Only the very tippy top of VA's get paid above average for most jobs and it's still rarely enough to live on alone."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"He's very good at what he does, that is all.

Now ""troy baker fatigue"" frankly I think he's doing too many different things, sometimes small roles (Ragnarok), I don't really feel it, tbh I'm really looking forward for Indiana Jones and I think he'll do a great job at it"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,That's fair
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,And now he’s in a Bethesda game that Todd Howard is in charge in.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-10,Can we get some Simon Templeman in there?
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-10,"This thread has been great for me. I switched to original English voice overs instead of translated dubs some 7 years ago and the credits of the people mentioned here blow my mind!
I gotta replay some of these classics."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-10,Dang troy
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Understandable and almost applauded until you realize Bethesda only hired like 2 voice actors for every character in the game.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Todd's right.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Same thing with Matt Mercer and it extends to anime as well, but I get downvoted every time I say it"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"He got The Rock issue going on. It was a lot of him just using his normal voice-over work that it got old very fast. He nailed it as Joel and a few others,  but yeah. I'm good at not hearing him so often."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Meanwhile all gamers want is for Todd fucking Howard to not be at the head of any more game development or publishing.

Guy's a lying d-bag whose projects mainly kill franchises, overpromises and underdelivers."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,what an insufferable cunt.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Who cares 🤷‍♂️. We should have had gta6 years ago…….
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Tbf, it is very similar to Tom holland being in every modern animated movie or Chris Pratt being in every big budget animated movie

It’s fun the first couple of times, but then you get bored of hearing him everywhere"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"So if it’s not Troy Baker, is it Matt Mercer?

Their voices are close to each other & Mercer is in practically every video game & anime."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Bethesda and hiring good voice actors has never really been a thing from what I can remember
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Todd howard? The dude who’s games have like 12 voice actors?
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Meanwhile I have no idea who the fuck that is.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"The irony when Skyriim had like 2 VO actors doing multiple characters, Troy would have given skyrim a extra flair, The same voices was a drawback, Would be nice if they weren't stingy and got more than 2-3 voices"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Troy Baker really does put his whole bussy into roles tho
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Quickest way to kill narrative immersion for me? Hearing that man's fucking voice
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"An unacceptable number of bugs are in every Bethesda game, but Todd doesn't give a shit about that"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,[removed]
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Don't gatekeep Troy Baker.. leave some new and have potential a chance
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"It’s funny because someone like Troy Baker could probably up his price a bit. He’d get less work, but he’d leave work for others and still make the same."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Not gonna lie when I hear Baker’s voice in a game, my immersion kinda snaps. Some games he’s great in, but when he’s doing the usual Troy Baker schtick i’m checked out."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,that might be the first time in 2 decades that todd has a point
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,And he kicks ass in all of them!
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Good. He's like Nolan North but no one likes him.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Troy Baker is old news. Now it's Matthew Mercer who is in everything, and he began his popularity by sound-matching Baker."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I'm so tired of Troy Baker. If I never hear him again, that would be too soon."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"We need less American voice actors.

I'm sick of generic, white Yank as the protagonist."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,hot take: replace all male voice actors with wayne june and brian blessed
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Laughs in dubbed european version. Never heard of Troy Baker until I googled him.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,One thing people aren’t talking about is how you can find so many games because of these recognizable VA’s and I think that’s one reason why they don’t cast them correctly. Especially if the company worked with them before and have a recent release or new release in the works.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Valid
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Troy Baker is to gaming as to H Jon Benjamin is to adult cartoons.  You never really hate it
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I think the issue is that his voice is fine but not the most interesting. That and he voiced a lot of main characters with the same voice.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"ever since i started watching 'Play, Watch, Listen' and got much more familiar with his voice... its not just jokes anymore. he really is in every game. And sadly there is almost always a feeling of ""is this fuckin Troy again?!"" instead of any exitement. 

personal differences that you might have with the guy aside, he is really good at what he does.. but still. Its the voice acting equivalent of the rock."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Well Todd Howard enforces a hard cap on voice actor count. He refuses to use more than 3 voice actors per game. 
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,What the hell does Todd Howard know about videogames anyway?
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Todd making a big mistake. Troy Baker is an amazing voice actor. He did such a great job as Gul'dan in WoW, Theron Shan in SWTOR and the default player voice in Saints Row 3"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Troy Baker (and Matt Mercer, and Nolan North) wouldn't be so bad if he didn't just sound like an incredibly generic white guy."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Troy Baker is a great voice actor. Even though he kinda sounds the same in literally every role he's ever done, and he's a pretentious prick who compared a pedophile cannibal to Joel."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Todd Howard opinion on anything is trash just like his games
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,[deleted]
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Yeah but Todd ""Sweet Little Lies"" Howard wants Skyrim to be in every console lol."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I love this 🤣🤣
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Good, if I were to ever make games I’d do the same. Even if he’s not a main character, he’s still in too many games. Theirs thousands of VA’s, and he is definitely not the best. If he was, I wouldn’t be able to recognize his voice within a couple seconds of hearing him."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Not gonna lie, I kinda don't like Troy Baker's work because his range is pretty narrow, so for like 10 years it was like: ""Whelp, there's Baker again...""

Started killing my suspension of disbelief every time I heard his voice."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I was never impressed by him, so this is good to hear. His acting always annoyed me because his performances always felt the same to me. It got even worse when he split from his and Nolan North's collaborative YouTube channel, and one of his first videos explaining it was like two hours of him explaining how he got into voice acting and how he was better than everyone else he was up against. I was like ""dude, chill"""
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,But it would be very much like Rockstar to put him in the game.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,“I dont want troy baker in our game because he does his job too much”
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,never heard of troy baker
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,This is how I feel about that nasaly no-range little shit weasel yuri lowenthal. Baker and Nolan north can play different people and you wouldn’t know. Yuri has two voices: nasal and extra nasal.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Todd is a certified moron.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,2013 must have crazy for him. Main character for The Last of Us and Bioshock Infinite. The next year he was with Kevin Spacey in a COD game. He really blew up.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Death Stranding
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Since TLOU2 was already mentioned, Miles Morales?"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I'll always think of Troy when i think of Kanji Tatsumi from Persona 4; was really bummed he couldn't reprise the role in Golden.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"The Last of Us Part II remake was just this past January. /s

His next big video game role is Indiana Jones this summer. So he’s going to be the full star of that project. Looking at his filmography, it looks like he’s been doing some DC animated movies recently, including another stint as Joker in a Justice League movie last year. 

Then Death Stranding 2: Stranding Death comes out next year."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"It was either him, Nolan North, Yuri Lowenthal and Laura Bailey.

I don't know why my played games always end up with these 4 lol"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Feels weird everyone talking about it when I could count on 1 hand the amount of games I played that had him as an important character in that era.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I feel like Matthew Mercer inherited this trait, dude shows up in every other AAA game nowadays"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,the last of us 2?
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,They should go back to the classic and have 80% of all the characters be voiced by Liam O'Brian.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Laura Bailey is the female Troy Baker. Often they're the leads in the same games. Just like Baker, she's very talented, but just like Baker she's everywhere."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I had a coworker at a job a good while ago who was really serious about becoming a voice actor. He said it was a common saying when someone asks ""so how do you make it as a voice actor"" ""you wait for xxx or yyy to die"" and I guess the joke was that voice acting is capitalized by the famous ones and I guess the two big names have all the biggest roles. Though now that I'm thinking about it, I'm not sure if he was talking about anime dubbing or video game voice acting in particular"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Remembering the Uncharted Thrieves End Achievement Hunter footage

""Oh nice, it's Troy Baker and Nolan North""

""Well it's good to see those guys getting work"""
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Absolutely. Cyberpunk 2077 is a fine example of an AAA game going with lesser known main character voice actors, who ended up delivering absolutely incredible performances. I mean yeah, both Gavin Drea and Cherami Leigh already had well-established careers in the business, but they weren't mainstream by any means. Baldur's Gate 3 is another great example. 

I wish more big-budget games would allow relatively unknown, talented actors a chance in the spotlight."

1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Rockstar has also gone out of their way for a number of the GTA games to find non-famous actors to do the main characters.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,And don’t even get me started on Futurama! Billy West voices like half the cast! /s
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Oh they should get Chris Pratt!
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"they should just cast henry cavill in every role, since people are always fancasting him."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Why would the actor change if it's the same character and same series? unless there's a reboot shouldn't the actor stay the same?
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I’d love to see Troy try to transfer over to film maybe I actually liked his small role in Last of Us. Not sure he’d want to though seems like voice work is a whole lot easier haha
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I don't know how the industry exactly works but I wonder if the voice actors like him keep getting picked because they know he's reliable and has a proven track record working well? With movies I know they like to hire actors that will bring them audiences to theaters to see the movie and get recognition  vs someone that won't and have the movie bomb because of it 
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Using the same small batch of voice actors is really bad when it comes to English dubs of anime. Too many characters wear as soon as I hear their voice all I see is All Might
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"This is why we need Troy Baker on the big screen. Dude gives Gary Oldman a run for his money when it comes to being a character actor. 

I have to imagine its a tough nut to crack even for a VA of his caliber. The work schedule is certainly more demanding as well. He could do it though. And he could go far."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,You mean you don’t like every voice being Clancy Brown or Grey Griffin?

1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Yeah, he's got a great voice but it's very signature. I don't know if it's a lack of range on his part or just a matter of being type casted, but the second you hear is voice its like ""hey thats Troy Baker!!"""
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Shout-out to Minji Chang, basically unknown but she was great in Phantom Liberty"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"This is a problem with acting/actors in general, I think. Like you said, film is really bad for this. I can't tell you how many movies I've simply chosen not to watch because I'm tired of seeing the same 5 lead actors. You're telling me there are no other talented, unknown stars out there? We have to keep recycling the same 20 people among every movie? lol"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"He infamously has a quote saying that “aspiring actors” are going to have to wait for him and Nolan North to die before they get any acting roles. While it was played as a joke, it’s very much true."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I mean as far as videogames go he's been doing way less than he used to in the last few years. Like one or two per year tops.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I've been feeling this way about Steve Blum more recently. Just got into ESO running through the Dagger fall storyline, and the number of characters and NPCs with his voice felt like he was voicing someone every few characters I ran into to the point it seems he has a number of uncredited NPC voice roles. It's like Steve Blum went and impregnated a bunch of people in Tamriel so they'd have similar voices."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I love Matt Mercer and Grey Delisle but I’ve gotten to the point where I hate hearing them in new roles

1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I'm tired of games putting real people in.  You have the power to craft any face you want, and you put in a famous actor?"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,watch better movies
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Troy Baker has range when it comes to Voice acting though not like the people you named here
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Don’t forget Chris Pratt and Tom Holland
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,How about Chris Pratt? /s
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Every time I see Mark Wahlberg the first thing that comes to my mind is: Marica Weleberga.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,God I hate Mark.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I’m fine with John Cena out of that list. At least he can act
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,But how can you see John Cena?
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Maybe you should venture into lesser known realm of films... There are so many incredible **actual film** that came out every year but we hardly hear about it because Hollywood makes it seem like only their movies exist with their huge marketing budget
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"As someone who watches a lot of movies,  I can't even remember the last time I saw any of them in a movie. Watch better stuff"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Ok, but I’m not tired of Troy"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,They're in the same kind of movies though so I don't see them in movies I've watched a lot.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"If you really want to be mad, watch any corny video where someone cast a video game movie. It’s ALWAYS the most famous and generic actors they cast. They don’t even resemble the person. They’re just famous. That’s it. I quickly looked one up and for RDR2, Arthur is Oscar Isaac, John is Ryan Gosling, Dutch is Danial Day Lewis, Sadie is Margot Robbie, and and Uncle is John C Riley? Like wth it’s always that the biggest names possible with some very small physical similarities. I’ve seen worse casting videos for other games as well. It’s like no one, including Hollywood itself, will cast correctly. It’s just big names. That’s it"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I don’t get how some of those guys continue to get roles…
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Yeah because 3 of those celebrities can't act for shit. Baker can act so seeing him in roles is fine.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,You can see John Cena?
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Watch better movies bro
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Just a suggestion, but if that's the case and I don't mean to be a smartass, just stop watching their movies :) There's plenty of other movies with other actors. You can even rewatch some movies from 20-30 years ago. In my opinion some of them hold up really well even today."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Literally just listed off all four of my friends favorite actors, and I'm with you. They act like I'm crazy, but none of them are actors. Besides John Cena (who I love, but just don't find his acting to be great) all of them literally just act like themselves."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Replace Cena with Pratt and I think you’re right
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Then watch other movies.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,You do not watch a lot of movies lol
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"> The Rock, Kevin Hart, John Cena, and Mark Wahlberg in every single movie.

But they're not really though?"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"You know, I keep hearing that John Cena is in movies now, but for some reason I never see him in any"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Don't forget Pedro Pascal.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Watch better movies then? It’s not our fault you have shit taste and are watching movies with the Mt. Rushmore of poopoo cinema.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,16x the Troy Baker
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"But the weird thing is, he is voicing indiana jones, in a game that Todd Howard is the executive producer for"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,HA!
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"With the rise of Gamepass, PS Plus, and Steam sales, people are buying and playing 2014-2020 games for the first time today, and at a faster rate."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I’d swap Debra for Laura Bailey. Her femme fatale voice has become so grating to me
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,It’s more jarring because they use her actual face model in everything. She’s like the Johnny sins of gaming
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Maybe I’m just out of touch but I had to Google her because I’d never heard her name before. At least anecdotally speaking I’d hard disagree
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I have some real Debra Wilson fatigue myself. I played 3 games in a row that she was in and that's on me, but still"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I don't play games in my native language partly because reenactment of voice likes is always worse anyway, but the main reason is that it's the same \~20 people in all the games for like 20 or more years. It's tiring."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I recently played three random games in a row and Troy Baker voiced protagonists in all three. I can't escape the guy! (Tales of Vesperia, Call of Duty Advanced Warfare, and Tales From The Borderlands for those wondering)"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"And lately for me Matt Mercer. He's a talented voice actor, but I can always spot when he's voicing a character. It takes me out of whatever I'm playing to think 'huh, it's Matt Mercer.'

Which I know is dumb but I can't help it."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I used to think Nolan North was annoying but the 'latest' crop of overused voice actors are so much worse than he ever was. 'Latest' in quotes because that roster has been around for like a decade now without changing any.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,especially regarding NFTs
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,How I felt with Steve Blum. Same voice in dozens of shows.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Exactly if they didn't want people to think of Harrison Ford as Indiana in the game, then why the hell model it after his likeness"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Yeah that's just....not the appeal of Indiana Jones lol. It's not. Flat out. No wants to ""see themselves"" as Indiana Jones. But they are taking that bullshit ""want"" to the enth degree here because they were SO fucking committed to making one of the characters and story that is TAILOR MADE for third person action adventure ala Uncharted and Tomb Raider....and making it a fucking  FPS.   

Just a ridiculously bad fundamental design decision and one that will probably bury and doom the game before it even has a chance."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Right? I don’t blame them for taking the work. But fuck me if these same people pop up over and over and it’s so distracting.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"My most jarring voice actor experience in fallout 3 was running into a drug dealer in the aircraft carrier settlement that had the same voice actor as the “stop right there, criminal scum” guard in Oblivion. Was his voice or delivery any different? No."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,So with Troy Baker now there will be 7 voices?
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Yeah, it's very ironic for Todd to say something like this"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"On his voice not changing, that's not really his fault. A lot of roles he's gotten as of late don't want him to change his voice much. I don't remember the name of the game, but he voiced a monster type character not too long ago and you wouldn't have even recognized him."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I didn’t even recognise his voice in God of War (2018). Need him more in roles like that.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Yeah as a VA myself, I get it. You wanna protect your position and make your money and advance your career. But god damn is it infuriating to have those guys actively playing defense on keeping the industry out of others hands"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I’m surprised this comment isn’t higher. Baker is so arrogant. In the article he was shocked that he’d ever have a problem getting roles.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-10,I remember that joke from the game awards like 10 years ago
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"You’ve got you’re villains mixed up. 

Ketheric is voiced by JK Simmons. Jason Isaacs (Lucius Malfoy) voices Gortash."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Astarion’s VA Neil Newbon was also in RE8, as Heisenberg."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Thing about games like bg3 is that it’s probably intentional to not get well known VAs for the main roles since they know they’ll have like thousands of lines. Getting someone like Troy baker or Laura Bailey for that many lines is probably not cheap. That’s why you see a lot of open world rpgs casting lesser known VAs for roles.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I think the VA for Ketheric Thorm had been in some things idk
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Matt Mercer did Minsc and he is well known for Levi Ackerman.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Shit he's the only voice I want to hear in everything.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Troy Baker, Steve Blum, and Nolan North. I can also usually identify Fred Tatasciore if he voices a big in size character (because he’s voiced the Hulk a lot) and Christopher Sabat because of Vegeta and Piccolo lol"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Is Steve Blum the one that plays a henchman or guard in practically every game since the early 2000’s? If that’s the raspy voice I’ve grown so tired of I hope he gets a break or gets to do something different more often. Takes me out of the moment every time I hear him.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I'm upset he was replaced by fucking MCCREE for his Vincent Valentine role.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Yuri has one voice and depending on the character he either turns up the nasal or uses his normal voice.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Hey, Mercer needs that VA money for his campaigns!"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I doubt they’ll ever stop at any point tho.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,He left Rockstar because his sister developed terminal cancer so he wanted to spend time with her.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Seriously. There were like 5 total voice actors in that game
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Although he is a great voice actor, alot of projects he has done he just does his regular voice. Like he has such a big range yet some games just want him with the normal Troy Baker voice. I don't understand it."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,As Todd hires him for Indiana Jones
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,">However I do understand the comment from Todd, however lazy he is as a director.

he's not a lazy director? a *lot* of people who work with him love him. where are you getting this information?"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I don’t think Todd is lazy by any means, I just feel like the teams design philosophy hasn’t evolved."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"You don’t have to like Todd’s games but he certainly isn’t a lazy game director. Starfield was flawed, but far from lazy even if some tech was a bit outdated."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Sixteen times the Bakers
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Even Troy himself said he (Jason) only said one word in the trailer lol
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-10,Oh the cast in BG3 is amazing
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Yep. Sure it can work in for common VA’s to pop up in online games like Overwatch but single player games do lose that story immersion when you just think of every other job they’ve done.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Never played Arkham Knight, but I love him in Persona 4 as Kanji, It's my favorite role of his besides TLOU obvoiusly"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I didn't know John DiMaggio was Heidegger in FF7R; but going back there are one or two times where you can hear it, overall though, he did a great job."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"DiMaggio does have a certain type of voice that you start noticing in characters of a similar nature (namely, the one he has used for Bender or Jake the Dog, Sandman or Rath, all these characters fit a similar archetype), but the range he can pull off with his voice is amazing.

I would never be able to link Marcus Fenix from Gears of War as Drakken from Kim Possible, they are just so different from each other it's amazing."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Not really, Baker is incredibly expensive.  They don’t need celebrities, plenty of no name people can do voices."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"They can still use Baker, but not as main characters to avoid the fatigue. An example is Higgs in Death Stranding, you don’t see him a lot, but when you do see him Baker’s performance is immaculate. Baker should really start doing more villains"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I liked Troy more before I saw him in behind the scenes stuff and in interviews. He seems pretentious and gives off fuck boy vibes
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,A fuck boy?
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Nolan North does have an impressive range, but they just keep hiring him for his Uncharted voice. The character he plays in TLOU, David, shows that."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,What’s wrong with his other roles beside Joel? Because most of them are pretty good tho.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I think Mercer and Baker are great actors but I've definitely caught myself hearing their voices on multiple characters on the same show and it kinda ruins it. The Dragon Age anime has Mercer in it on at least 3 characters from what I recall
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Pagan and booker is really one of his most underrated roles.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Just like that?
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Which 3 actors Todd uses again? Because I forgot.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Yeah they’re pretty much in everything nowadays lol
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Wait until you find out some of the other VAs that has more video game credits than him.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Some others I would throw in are Erica Lindbeck, Cherami Leigh, Robbie Daymond, & most recently Suzie Yeung.

Suzie lent her voice to the 3 biggest JRPGs of this year: Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth, Persona 3 Reload, & Final Fantasy VII Rebirth & they all came out in the span of a month."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Oof that’s harsh.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Underrated film ngl
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,The last time they used famous actors in their games is 2004 with San Andreas.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I thought they also hired him in fallout 4?
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Um which one?
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Timothee Chalamet is next
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Yeah Tom holland is starting to get into that overexposure too.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Have you ever played video games between 2007 and now? Chances are that you have heard of baker’s voice.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Although that quote of his is really stupid, it’s not really that deep tho."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Yikes that was unprovoked lol
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,What you mean?
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,What does this have to do with him saying that Todd didn’t want him in one of his games?
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Baker isn’t old news tho as he’s still getting work like Mercer lol.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Or better yet, stop playing video games then."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Um he’s doing anything NFT related anymore so the nickname is not really necessary.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-10,"His acting always annoyed me because his performances always felt the same to me.

That’s an odd take since most of his performances ain’t even the same. That’s like saying pain is the same as Joel miller even though they’re different characters in different forms of media."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,How is his performances felt the same? They don’t really feel the same at all.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,How so?
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"It's for the same reason people are annoyed of Dwayne Johnson being in a shitton of movies. Actor fatigue is a real thing and can make something less interesting because they took the easy route.

Voice acting is the same way. You have a VA that is famous for their voice and they always do the same voice, and it just gets tired over time"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"He’s in every game, basically. You’ve definitely heard his voice."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1684869/
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,But there's a 90% chance you have heard his voice.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Joel from TLoU
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,And that’s alright. Google is your friend.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,you living under a rock or dont play any major AAA games
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Really? You haven’t been playing a game where you might’ve heard him before?
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,What’s your beef with Yuri?
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Yuri does have range but for some reason he only gets to use it in his anime roles never in his video game roles.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Yuri has range but they don’t let him use it often.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,And then pagan min in far cry 4 in 2014.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,The Ocelot in MGS V
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Joker in Arkham Origins was also very cool.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Main male character from FF13 as well.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,How the hell did I not realize he plays Booker. Now that I’m looking back it’s so obvious. I guess he just disappeared into the character and I couldn’t see it as anything other than Booker
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Don’t forget the shadow of Mordor games
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"2013 was a lucrative year for him. Scooby Doo Stage Fright, Skylanders SWAP Force, LEGO Marvel Super Heroes!"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,He nailed it. Higgs felt scary in a joker kinda way
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I beat this today and he stole the show, and everyone in the game did wonderfully."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,The exaggerated swagger of a Troy Baker
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Just finished that and honestly can't tell he was in it. Was he the CEO guy? TBF I didn't realise Lowenthal was Parker either, I guess their voices don't really stick out to me."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Miles Morales is such a awesome game. I wish it was talked about as much as 1 & 2.

It's definitely shorter, but the quality of life, the different story situations. It was chill af."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"He’s also been in Fortnite as Jonesy, but he hasn’t had any voiced dialogue in a while, 2 years ago at the earliest"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,The fallout method
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I’m working on it!
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Fuck I love him in Asura’s Wrath.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Dee Bradley Baker should be good for this method too. I mean, really, how much of Clone Wars was just him talking to himself?"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"That guy has such range with hsi voice. And when you see the guy you would not really imagine him being Illidan or Yasuo, Gollum, Asura, Warden, Dr.Strange and tons of NPC's"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Mercer, Baker, O’Brien, Bailey, North, and Hale the big 6

O shit I forgot Steve Blum and Yuri Lowenthal"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"In SWTOR, Jennifer Hale plays an important npc and one of the player classes, so in some scenes it’s possible to just have Hale talking to herself"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I know her as Kid Trunks in dbz
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,*harp music*
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Troy, Laura, and Nolan North as three leads of Marvel’s Avengers was one of the game’s many red flags, imo. The game was already criticized for bland art direction, and then the casting felt oddly rote on top.

Edit: not a commentary on their ability as actors."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"A lot of the ""bread and butter"" jobs of voiceover are things like advertisements and corporate instruction videos, which are unfortunately likely to be relegated to AI generated voiceovers, because clients are more concerned about being cheap than imparting a specific meaning in the voiceover. High-end commercials are less likely to use AI soon, because they are often very particular about what message they're sending in the voiceover (""make sure the name of the brand is the word with the most emphasis"" or ""when you say 'I know they're reliable' it should sound like you're greeting an old friend"") but a lot of ""entry-level"" voiceover jobs are already drying up"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I went to the Futurama panel last year in SF. 

That was one of the questions asked to the voice actors. Maurice LaMarche and John DiMaggio said straight up that voice actors are usually always actors first. 

They think of themselves as actors first. And have worked onstage or onscreen in live roles already."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Almost God, I completely forgot that. Underrated moment in a game."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Or during God of War 2018 when Magni (Baker) and Modi (North) show up.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Honorable mention to Minji Chang as Songbird in CP2077, I hadn't heard of her before playing the game but *oh my god* she's one of the best VA's out there"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,">Gavin Drea and Cherami Leigh already had well-established careers

Big difference is that this is the first time I've heard those names. If I hear a voice actor often enough to attach a name to the voice, that's the problem. If someone's prevalent but manages to fly under the radar it's not as bad."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Only after they started having trouble with Hollywood A listers
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,That little known Ray Liotta!
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"What a phony, made-up name!"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,He's so cool
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I saw someone fancast him as Carrot Ironfounderson from Discworld. 

Look, I'm as horny for Cavill as the next heterosexual male but smoldering 40 year old man who oozes charisma and confidence is not the clearest pick for a ~19 year old red haired naive kid who just moved to the big city.

He's got the build for it though."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,What you mean?
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Classic r/gaming downvote brigade on anything that's not the most popular take.

I didn't feel as strongly about it, but I would have preferred less top-heavy casting, and your opinion is not in any way invalid."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,You have a weird idea of what the screen actors’ guild does if you think they make sure the same actors get the main roles all the time.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,That’s a stupid thing to say.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,They picked _Kevin Hart_ for Roland? Wtf why?
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"The trailer used the wrong music. Which makes me think we're not going to get something with the same ""feel"" of the games. Compared to the Fallout trailer, that ""feels"" like Fallout."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Which is fucked because Terry Crews wouldve been the perfect Roland.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,biggest red flag to me was they have someone else voice CLAPTRAP. I love jack black but why have him voice a character that is iconic for the voice.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I have heard that Jamie Lee Curtis requested the chance to be in the film due to her child being a fan of the games. Which is pretty alright. She can act, so it'll be fine.

But I mean... Kevin Hart is an awful choice. Cate Blanchet, too, right? She's a solid actor, but I can't see her as funny."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I can see where you are coming from which I mostly agree, and the Kevin Hart pick was pretty off, but honestly, I liked the trailer, but I take video game/book movie adatpation differantly then others."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I like Kevin but he is WAY miscasted in the role as Roland like seriously not good casting.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I’m so glad the franchise got sold
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Based on the trailer it looks like its gonna be Kevin Hart/Roland spending most of it whining about Tiny Tina acting like a teenager. Cant wait /s
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"There was no possible way the movie could have been good. I'm much more interested in it being a train wreck. The only miscast is Tina, I'm not sure she'll be terrible enough."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Should’ve been claptrap
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Yooo I can’t believe I forgot that garbage lol.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,There's a Borderlands movie coming?! How am I just hearing about this?
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Wait. I've been living under a rock. They're making a Borderlands movie? Why? lol
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,They made some terrible casting decisions and also cut too many major characters. I dont have high hopes for that movie.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Even after the trailer I keep forgetting this is real lol.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Also it is a Sony Studios film, produced by the amazing team that brought you such classics as Morbius and Madame Webb. If this movie is anything better than a steaming pile of shit I will eat my shoe."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-10,Whoever was in charge of the casting on that movie should be fired.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"While I don't like Kevin as Roland. By far the worst cast choice was Blanchett and Jamie Lee Curtis. 

I actually felt embarrassed seeing them in this movie."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I just cannot stand him. As a person or comedian. I already know the exact character he’s gonna play which I get, play to your strengths and audience but I just didn’t want that shtick to be in Borderlands."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Oh God, they're making a movie about that?

Look, I played Borderlands 2 when it came out. I recently replayed it, and while I still found it funny, the comedy is super dated. Very much late 2000's, early 2010's

All I can see them doing is trying to recapture the magic of the humor Borderlands 2 had. Which worked in the time period it released in, but it's going to be in the mid 2020's by the time it releases

I can't see it going well"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Last ""cool"" movie he did was [The Rundown (2003) ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rundown) 20 years ago!"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,It's nice to read this comment as I watch him get Booed on Monday Night RAW
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Member that time he drunk-drove (or possibly under the influence of some other substance) into his fence and framed it as him ""ripping the fence out with his bare hands"" because the power went out? Pepperidge farm remembers."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Yeah it's weird to me that people take a former wrestler as genuine in any way.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I don't love the dude or anything, but it's really weird to dislike an actor for being fake no? Isn't that kind of the whole job? 

My problem with him is that he plays the same character in almost every movie. He's not fake enough if anything."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Straight up dude, I used to idolize the guy growing up."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Dave Bautista also seems pretty cool as an actor.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I can’t believe that John Cena is actually likeable in movies, tough motherfucker on the outside and soft goofball on the inside"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,[deleted]
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I'm loving John Cena right now. Peacemaker might legitimately be one of my favorite shows, can't wait for more"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I didn’t not say the movies aren’t great they are but I’m just overall tired of the same people over and over.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I like how much work Cena did for the Make-A-Wish foundation but I hate how much he panders to the Chinese government
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I would call John Cena a great comedy actor. Peacemaker….
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Yeah, when I usually watch anything that's supposed to have John Cena I can't even see him."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-12,I didn’t say I watched them dumb fuck! I said they are always in movies.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Obviously an exaggeration, but maybe you might be fuckin stupid"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,He was great in the Invisible Man. played to his strengths.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Who the fuck said i watched them? Did you even read and understand my comment? All I said was those actors are always in rotation within movies. How about you fuck off and suck my dick like your father ?
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,“You see that Nolan North in the distance? You can go there!”
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Indiana Jones is one of many games
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"*Indiana Jones and the Great Circle* is being made first and foremost by the Wolfenstein guys, not Bethesda the developer that does *Starfield* and The Elder Scrolls and the like."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I like Debra Wilson as a voice actor, but it’s weird to see, like, 5-6 games that all use her face."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Tales is fucking awesome, though. One of his best performances imo."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I usually play japanese games subtitled but I gotta say, he did a really damn good job as yuri in vesperia."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I just played Pillars of Eternity and it's literally all the CR people talking to each other. The two first companions you get are Matt asa a pompous wizard and Matt as a humble soldier!
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Whenever I hear Matt Mercer in something, I immediately channel Travis Wellingham in Critical Role.

“FUCKING MERCER!!!!”"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"He recently voiced Ganondorf in Tears of the Kingdom. He did a good job, but yeah it’s just Matt Mercer again."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Armored Core 6 moment
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Really threw me off to find out he's Yusuke in persona 5. 

Now that I know that I can strain my ears and yeah, I can tell it's him, but he did a really good job there."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Nolan can truly do some dope things with his voice. It’s a shame voice directors don’t utilize talent with ‘just’ his regular voice
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,He stopped doing the nft project a long time ago
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"What? That was a quote from Troy, not the developer"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I agree it should be 3rd person.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Or Sasuke Uchiha telling you off everytime you walk into the Gomorrah in NV.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Wes Johnson, the Troy Baker of Bethesda games."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Exactly this. The people that hire VAs like him or Nolan north for their games, they just tell them to use their own voice despite the fact they can do other voices in their range."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,The medium.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Like when the Super Mario actor voiced the dragon in Skyrim
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"In Darksiders (2010) he voiced Abaddon *and* Straga, two very different characters with *very* different voices, both distinct enough from his regular speaking voice. But that was rather early in his career"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I really liked his bitter squirrel from god of war though
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I didn't recognise him as Pagan Min from FC4 either
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Who was he in GoW?
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,And Detroit Become Human as the synth creator dude. Plus he's done TONS of stunt work and motion capture for all kinds of shit over the years. I'm happy for him that he's been getting larger roles that's making his name recognized. Super deserving.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Funny how he hated Vampire in that game and in BG3 he become vampire himself
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,And also that Russian guy in RE3 remake
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Which is hilarious to me. You have stupid good range if you can go from a grungy dude with anger issues who probably smokes a pack a day to the very definition of a snooty vampire with a flare for the dramatics. And what’s even funnier is that both these characters are heavily simped for in their respective fan bases lol
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I nearly spit out my drink there. Heisenberg is the same dude as Astarion?
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"In re3 as nikolai and nemesis as well 

He did the mocap for nemesis."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Just a few roles here and there, nothing too big."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Dude is McCree/Cole in Overwatch and the current VA for Ganondorf in English versions of Zelda- and both DMs Critical Role and makes appearances in Dimension 20.

He's probably one of the most famous voice actors currently in the industry at this point, not just some guy who did a character in AoT"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Then play Elder Scrolls Online. Man voices about 30 percent of all male characters lmao
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Steve Blum Wolf is by far the best character in Diablo 4.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I mean, he’s also Orochimaru in Naruto.

I didn’t even realize it was him at the beginning."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I literally CANNOT stand his voice. idk why his voice is nails on the chalkboard to me.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Where else is he going to get the money for those impressive battle maps?
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"That was the story at the time, but in the years since he started a new company with Houser and Unsworth"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Turns out this has a pretty poor effect when the game is fully voice acted unlike the previous entry.

Also, when they record lines in complete contextual vacuum, so you cant even pretend to be a different character."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"It's the same thing with Matt Mercer. I know he has range, his earlier roles prove that.

But now? You can instantly tell ""oh, that's Matt Mercer""."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,It’s pretty much because of the game studio or someone in charge of said game that tells him to use his regular voice.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"To be fair, that’s like the perfect Indy voice. I’m sick of hearing the same voice actors in most major productions, but hard to say no to that."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Different studio.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Yeah even if its not what people want it still takes a shit ton of effort to make a bethesda game
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Yeah but online points updoot to the right
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Is that what a Bakers dozen means? 😁
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"John DiMaggio doing Bender in Futurama, Marcus Fenix in Gears of War, The Joker from some Batman media and Dr. Drakken in Kim Possible are all examples of wildly different voices."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I must be weird because I heard him the moment he spoke lol.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"He was also the main villain in the Spiderman Miles Morales game as Kreiger. As the “mastermind”, he really doesnt have a huge role and not that many speaking parts but he did a great job as a amoral businessman looking for profit.   

I think the best VAs are those that you dont recognize by their voice unless you actively concentrate and follow their careers. They work on bringing life to a character so when they speak normally, they are an random joe but when they put on the voice, the character comes out (alot of anime VAs come to mind).   

And while overexposure is annoying, at least Baker is an actual VA. "
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,He can be pretentious sometimes but I don’t really get the fuck boy vibes at all.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Yea, which ones cause I literally have no idea what this guy is talking about."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I don't doubt that, but it could be a list of minor roles with very little dialogue. I bet he has the largest list of leading character roles."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Some incredible covers in that thing too, most of which I prefer to the originals."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-10,"yep

also there are some behind the scene issues so i bet they wanna save some trouble"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Probably. He has a pretty extensive record, looking at it. I’m just genuinely surprised, considering how many games I’ve played and own, that I’ve not heard of his name. Not even once."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I wouldn’t say it was unprovoked honestly.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"After his speech, no it isn't"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-10,">They don’t really feel the same at all.

Yeah but that's how perspectives and opinions work. They're bound to differ"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,For the comedy. They said they wouldn't so they do.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I do know who he is but I rarely play games with voice acting so I’m not really sure I’ve heard his voice before
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Try 100%
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,looked it up. yup i did hear his voice.... a lot o.o
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"2nd

why would i play any AAA title when stuff like Helldivers or Palworld exist"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Like I said he’s got no vocal range he’s either yuri or extra yuri.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,and he's crazy good too as Pagan Min.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Shadow of Mordor too
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-10,Same Drake in Uncharted 4 in 2016 too
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"It was HIM all along?!? 

We have been played like a dam fiddle!!!"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-10,[deleted]
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Loved him as Higgs, he did great as a calm, asshole nihilist.  Almost like he didn’t have to act too much."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Don't forget he voiced young Joker In Arkham Origins lol
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"He’s out of line

But he’s right"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Starring Troy Baker as Alan Tudyk as Simon Krieger!
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,How did you not notice Yuri? He has the same voice in everything he’s in.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Yeah, Simon Krieger"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,that's troy bakers thing imo. really talented at becoming the character
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Worst villain ever though. 
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-07-11,I love playing Miles Morales around Christmas time perfect Christmas game same with Mafia 2
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,This comment had me convinced you might actually be Liam O’Brien for a good 5 minutes
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Wait, is that actually you?

If so hell yeah Illidan!"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"The Bad Batch *is* just Dee Bradley Baker talking to himself. At the end of every episode, it's hilarious to see ""Starring Dee Bradley Baker as The Bad Batch"""
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I always call the all-clones episodes just ""Dee Bradley Bakers gets paid again""."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I bet he had a lot of fun voicing the clones because that’s quite an accomplishment.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"And in CritRole Season 2 he just whips out a german accent authentic enough to make me, a native speaker, question if he is a native too.

Without properly speaking it"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Wait... GOLLUM?!
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Yuri Lowenthal is so prevalent, I think there are 2 or 3 imitators that I keep thinking are him."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Ashley Burch aswell
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,You don’t count Tara Strong in there? Or is she more tv than games?
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Blum is hilarious though, I recall a scene in Star Wars Rebels where his character is watching a guy interview another guy on TV. 

All three were voiced by him. 

He also has many goon conversations with himself in the Arkham games."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,this i’ll be playing a game on game pass and all of a sudden i’m hearing sasuke? he’s everywhere
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,All part of the Critical Role click of voice actors (they dont all play DnD but they are all friends)
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I love Steve Blum so much though. Only ""celebrity"" I have an autograph from.

Whatever happens, happens."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"He's ruining Hitman 3 for me, literally everyone is him in that game."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Don't forget Tara Strong
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Jon Curry, too"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I hear a lot of Chris Sabat too. Honestly, I have a lot of fun guessing voice actors by their performance."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,You forgot Travis Willingham.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"tara strong, debra wilson.

theres a solid few that are in just a ton of stuff, and are almost annoyingly instantly recognizable."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I swear she literally does for some games. Just does a whole scene in one go like she's schizophrenic.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Same with Guild Wars 2
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Speaking of Jennifer Hale. In Mass Effect: Mark Meer plays both male Shep and every single Vorcha, the Hanar and everyone's favorite biotic god. So you will spend quite a bit of time talking to yourself as mShep."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"She's also Abby in The Last Of Us, Mary Jane in Spider-Man, Kaine in Nier, Nadine in Uncharted, Catwoman in Batman games, Black Widow in Avengers, Fiona in Borderlands..."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Was she always kid trunks?? Like even back in the 90s? If so, that’s crazy😮"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,That’s going to be here very soon 
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I have noticed that with people like Chris Pratt and Dave Bautista doing a bunch of voice work nowadays. They are proven, just like when movies try to get a big name on their cast"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Cherami Leigh is very recognizable as a leading VA in anime dubs though, just not as prevalent in games (although she does have pretty well known roles in Persona 5 and Genshin Impact)."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Her reading the No Coincidence  audiobook... fucking shivers...  even the  starting few minutes  wherr you hear her say  ""  ...click... click... click....   it didnt fit""  i already see  the gun with a faded of logo of lexington  or something like that ans the bullets  in  hand"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Pretty much after Vice City and San Andreas when the voice actors from those games got upset they weren't paid more.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,This like the 10th time I’ve encountered that joke on Reddit lol
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"If the acting is mediocre or worse and you don't find the characters believable I would understand completely. 

Like the actors who always look and play the same character. I just see the rock, not his character. But in Oppenheimer I didn't feel that way one bit.

I was definitely pointing out all the actors in my head but I do that in everything, doesn't really take away my immersion. It's always about if it's a well written and acted character or not."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,They already used AI in the Naruto Connections game. 
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"that, and they used some generic armored up SUV like an escalade or something instead of a cool armored up bus that looks like its going to fall apart.

or like, any of the other cool vehicles in the games. They appear in the trailer, but they are not using it as a crew.

fantastic game and world that should have been an animated film like Arcane, instead its going to be jamanji with robots."

kevin hart is 5'2"""
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Seems more of a Claptrap.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I know right?  Let’s use the loud short guy for our straight man.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Yep and the trailer was just him constantly berating Tiny Tina for acting up. Real fun
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,PSA for everyone who wants a live action Borderlands and is disappointed it'll suck: Tank Girl is a movie that exists.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Because, just like with Halo, Witcher, and too many other recent adaptations, the creators don’t really understand and respect the source material. Roland being a manlet is a clear sign of that."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Well, Fallout as massaged by Bethesda, if which are very knowing of the iconography the games represent since 2008."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Oh shit that would’ve been amazing casting for terry as Roland.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,“Terry LOVES fighting Crimson Lance! Terry brought all his corrosive weapons!”
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Anyone else besides Kevin Hart would have been perfect. AND THEY PICKED THE WORST ONE.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Michael b Jordan would have been great as Roland
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,jesus.. why would you say that?  I was blissfully ignorant of what could have been.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,They didn't even get the original back for the 3rd game. That was never gonna happen.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Kevin hart should have been claptrap. No clue why they wanted to cast someone who plays the whiny guy now as a leading strong guy.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,That's a terrible reason to cast someone.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"That's fine for Curtis's kid, but lilith's cannon age when the borderlands games began was 22. By bl3 she's 34. 

Jamie lee "" Yogurt lady"" Curtis is
#sixty five"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Same reason she's into One Piece and is slated to portray Doctor Kureha. But that casting fits better than this Borderlands role, imo because of the age difference."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"When he put in his clauses that he can't lose or get hit anymore (guessing around the F&F spinoff), then that's when I stopped caring about what movie he was in."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Nah, its Pain and Gain."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,The boos were intentional he’s the villain in the RAW lore atm
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Yeah... He's supposed to get booed. He's playing a heel. If the fans didn't like him, they wouldn't react at all."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Bautista is a genuinely good actor.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Either he is the best actor ever that hasn't broken character for 30 years, or he at least partially is actually like the character he plays. And I don't think anyone cares if he's ""genuine"", he's charismatic. You can say he's a bad actor if you want, I don't really care, but he's pretty undeniably charismatic."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Bautista is awesome in everything he’s in. 

He was the best part of Army of the Dead.

He was also probably the best part of Knock at the Cabin. 

Obviously he kills it as Drax. 

I’m sure I’m forgetting something else. The guy has drastically improved as an actor throughout the years."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,John Cena seems like a genuinely good dude.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"That's a talent issue, and yeah, he is very one dimensional in all his roles. When I say fake I mean his opinions are moldable to who ever is in the room with him. His interview with Joe Rogan was a perfect example of how he talks but doesn't say anything."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"> plays the same character in almost every movie

For what it's worth, this can be said about a lot of actors. It's difficult to say whether or not an actor is being typecast because directors want that exact same character in their movie, if the actor only plays those roles because they have an image that they want to maintain, or if they genuinely just can't act.

I feel like, whether they can act or not, a lot of action stars specifically choose movies that let them play the same character in order to not compromise their macho-man persona outside of the studio, because they've built their entire life around being that person."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,A good actor doesn’t seem fake when acting and a genuine person doesn’t seem fake when not acting.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Bautista put in a lot of earnest effort into acting once he actually started getting roles, he just seems to genuinely enjoy acting and it’s not entirely just fame and fat paychecks driving him."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,He runs circles around The Rock in terms of acting skills
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I'd say Bautista has the acting talent to be an actor first. Is in, if he wasn't a famous wrestler before, he'd definitely still be good in films.

The Rock and Cena seem to both be wrestling superstars who just happen to have a lot of acting gigs. I think their stardom carries most of their acting career whereas I feel like Bautista's carries his a lot less.

In my opinion, Bautista could have played any role that The Rock and Cena have played. Every one. But I just can't see the two do the same for some of Bautista's roles."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Where is he now a day? I haven't seen him at all since Infinity War.

EDIT: sorry all, it was a badly executed joke about Drax standing still 😂"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,There's a reason why we have not seen the rock and Bautista in the same film. Direct competition and Bautista is clearly the winner.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I wouldn't mind seeing Bautista in all the movies.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-10,They’re getting a second season like next year I think.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Yeah, it’s especially if they play the same character over and over like Jesse Eisenberg. I’m starting to have the same issue with Awkwafina as well."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I domt blame him for this its his job and if he insulted fhe CCP in any way no major corperation would touch him with a mile stick.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Not just comedy.  He portrays a full on mental breakdown in episode 4.  Had zero idea he had those acting chops.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Southpaw Regional Wrestling is gold for Cena as a straight man in comedy.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"And Blockers, and recently Ricky Stanicky"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-13,Which you would know that’s not true if you watched movies that aren’t just blockbusters.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,It's a dumb exaggeration to even suggest Cena and Mark Wahlberg are overexposed and in too many films. You're not good at this.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,A deserved response honestly after the number of commenters coming out of the woodwork to let you know how big their cinephile dicks are. Buncha shitters
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"They are both under Zenix Media, and it doesn’t change the fact that Todd Howard is the executive producer of the game."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I like how the guy named two entirely different games both called Tales and all you said was ""Tales is awesome."""
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I'm not denying his talent for a second. It's just that he's in every friggin game. And yes everyone should play it!
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I’m still disappointed they never brought him back for the remaster and even worse so is that they still had his original voice lines in the game but then they spliced it together mid sentence with his replacement voice actor’s lines. [https://x.com/lythero/status/1426344573991858180?s=46](https://x.com/lythero/status/1426344573991858180?s=46)

1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"He's crazy talented. There's a mission in Destiny 2 where the original script called for a character called the Drifter to be accompanying you, but when it came time to do the recording they couldn't schedule his actor, so they rewrote the script so it's Ghost (North's character) doing his best Drifter impression. Doing an impression of one character doing an impression of another character is one of the toughest things in voice acting, and he absolutely nails it."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,His most famous role is his regular voice
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I know, but why say it? People will always recognize Indiana Jones as Harrison Ford, not really anything he can do to change it. Just like Rocky will always be Stallone and Arnold will always be the Terminator. They are iconic characters made famous by those people and made their careers, and there's nothing wrong with that. He makes it sound like it will take away from the game."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Or how people who talk to you about Jarl Balgruff have the exact same voice and delivery as Jarl Balgruff himself.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Oh fuuuuuck that’s why that voice was weirdly familiar 😂
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"“What’s is better? To be born good? Or too overcome your nature through great effort?”

Charles Martinet went HARD on that line. And others. God I wish he did more roles like this :)"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Yeah, Chris Pratt is everywhere too!"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,And Nolan north is modi. When you first get to the mountain top they are talking to mimir and he says something along the lines of “you guys are everywhere”. Pretty funny.

1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Something something lemons something spiderman something
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I think it also has to do with Mercer and dare I say Critical Role passion for those stories and worlds and games in general. 

Some might treat games as just voice work while Mercer for example might be interested because of the world or the story. Like who would not want to be part of Baldur's Gate or Dragon Age or World of Warcraft.

Also Voice acting is not a job that turns you into a millionaire. So no wonder they keep showing up. They too must earn money somehow."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Those things aren't remotely mutually exclusive?  He could have left R* because of his sister's terminal cancer, and since it's been a few years she's probably fucking died and he's gone back to work?"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,That's how I feel about Nolan North. He just has one voice for the most part. Even his Penguin voice just sounds like his regular voice with a bad cockney accent.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Even when Matt tries doing sonething that isn't his own voice I don't think it always lands. Like Ganondorf and Minsc both felt like he was really pushing his voice somewhere it wasn't comfortably able to go.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Tbh, I found so many games because of these VA’s and I think that’s one reason why they make them recognizable. Especially if the company worked with them before and have a recent release or new release in the works."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"The reality is after a while people will ask for a Matt Mercer like voice for the role, as in that is what they advertise the role as.

Critical Role actually talk about it in one of their talk show streams. I think it was Marisha Ray and Ashley Johnson have gone in for auditions where they are asked to do a Laura Bailey like voice. It has happened too for the blokes though they joked about asking if the producers would like them to call up the other to get them to audition."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Laura Bailey is the same way. She just has 1 voice and it immediately takes me out of the game.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Sure but Todd came up with the story of the game and that different studio is under his purview. He is also an executive producer of the game with Machine games

1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,That’s really true I love the covers too.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Was it possible his speech was some dumb joke? Because sometimes he’ll say dumb shit for the hell out of it.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"You do know people can browse your profile, right?"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,He’s crazy good at pretty much everyone he plays.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"It was, I just started re-playing it again last night, heard Ocelot and was like ??? I know this voice. He actually puts on quite a different quality to his voice but it is him."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-10,"In every other Arkham game - yes, in Origins - Troy Baker."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I can't wait to see him again in DS2. Like I've never liked a villian as much as I liked Higgs. >!even though the pizza deliveries were the most fucked up thing he did in the game!<
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"And in quite a few Batman animated movies, including The Long Halloween."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I guess the face put me off. But honestly even now I can't make a mental sound of Baker's voice the way I can Steve Blum's or Liam O'Brien's. I just don't think it's distinct enough, which isn't really bad or good, makes it easier to blend him in but less iconic."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Miles is so likable, as are virtually all the secondary characters, but good *lord* the main plot was the single most predictable story I’ve ever experienced in my life. Every single beat is moonwalked through without a single deviation."

1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"And then appearing again in the proper cast credits for the *other* clones he voiced, as well as Batcher. "
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,it would have been fun if he voiced omega as well
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,He played him in Shadow of Mordor games I think
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,The fact I keep hearing Spider-Man yelling about spreading democracy in helldivers throws me off often.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Weirdly what gets me with Yuri is that I rarely see him voice a prominent character in games, besides Spiderman. I’ll just be casually strolling through the Metro stations when I hear Yuri putting on a very slight russian accent and it’s hilarious to me for some reason."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Remember when Ashley Burch was just part of a silly webseries with her brother? Crazy how far she went from that
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,oo ya she is a lot of places for sure. Basically anyone that's been on Critical Role.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I’d say more tv compared to games (though yes she definitely does both)

1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I think GTA V is the first game not to have a VO meltdown over pay. Niko and CJ's actors expressed their dissatisfaction with their compensation. The former more subtly than the latter. Rockstar famously has a pretty strict policy about this demonstrated by Ryder's character - VO goes off the rails and the character dies. We will never see Niko again most likely even though he is in the HD universe.

My problem with Hart as Roland is Roland is supposed to be the serious one for crying out loud. But the one bothering me the most is Tiny Tina. Tiny Tina is All about that attitude."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Moxxie is in her 50’s with grown children. Gina Gershon’s casting is easily the best casting choice out of any of the characters.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"On the plus side (no plus for the Borderlands movie), at least Jamie Lee Curtis as Doctor Kureha in the One Piece live action show is a way better casting choice. Especially since Jamie Lee Curtis likes One Piece, because of her son, but still."

1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I'm aware they're intentional. I was just commenting how the previous comment came right as it was happening
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,When I go see wrestling in person I definitely boo at the people I don't like...
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I note that you said the character he plays and it just hit me then that every role of his is exactly the same character.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,His small part in Blade Runner 2047 was also fantastic and iirc he was a mostly silent (and menacing) subantagonist in Spectre.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,He currently holds the record for most Make a Wish requests granted at 650.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Well sure, but why do you care about his opinion on that stuff? If you need to ask someone about that we all know Ja Rule is the one to turn to."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"After seeing him Blade Runner, I yearn to see him in deeper roles. It was an honor to see him in a serious role."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I think The Rock enjoys acting, he just has so much ego that it severely limits his range. He's not willing to risk not looking super tough."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Cena isn't as traditionally talented as Bautista is but he is a brilliant comedic actor, he does end up in some shit but he's also been very funny in some very decent stuff. 

The Rock however just seems like a big douche, not interested in anything he's attached to."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I'm all for the Rock's hate train here, but I think you're underselling them both a bit there. Cena doesn't seem to have shown much range, but he has good comedic chops. The Rock I think has shown that he *could* have range & actually be quite a good actor, but is happily type cast as he is. Bautista showing as the better actor I think has as much to do as his genuine talent as it does the fact that he's had the opportunity to take diverse roles & jumped at them & taken them seriously."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,He was Rabban Harkonnen in the Dune movies
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,His most recent big hit has been in is Dune.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"And before Dune, he was in that M. Night movie ""Knock At The Cabin"""
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Bro suck a dick already
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Mf acting like I hired them to play roles in movies like I work in Hollywood, Fuck outta Here and Suck my Dick !"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Even better, though, it applies to both Tales. Vesperia is the best 'Tales of' game (that I played, anyway) and Borderlands is probably the best Telltale game"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I loved the mission! *Oo-wee, sister!*

I genuinely think Nolan could be up there with Phil Lamar and Kari Wahlgren if directors would stop being cowards and let him get weird"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"From my understanding, probably because he doesn't wanted to be compared to Harrison Ford. I mean no one can replace the guy. Even as a hundred years old, he was good in the last movie, but some dimbos will compare Troy's acting with Ford's and bully him to death. So it seems he wants people to be focus on the character not the actor and enjoy the game."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Uhhh are you serious? Lol it's because we're talking about a first person game where you're playing from the POV of Indiana Jones. The whole idea is that the player is supposed to feel like they are the character...

Harrison Ford is a person. Indiana Jones is a character. 

When I play the game, I don't want to feel like I'm Harrison Ford dressed up in scuffed leather jacket and wide brim hat on a studio set - I am Indiana muthafuckin Jones on a grand adventure to save a sacred relic because it belongs in a damn museum!!! 

This is a common thread in most fictional media whether it's movies, TV, books, or games. I want to embody / connect with the character, not be reminded that it's Harrison or Troy or someone else putting on a pantomime..."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Yep, he was both Kamski (Android Creator) and Gavin (Asshole Cop)"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Man, I almost cried when I played the newer Yakuza games and heard him voicing Majima. Majima has a specific thing about his voice and accent, and Mercer just... talked like normal. Made me so mad I reloaded and played the sequence again in Japanese."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Haven't played the latest Zelda, but his BG3 performance was good because it wasn't immediately obvious that he was the one voicing Minsc.

I suppose the thing that really annoys me is that a lot of games seem to have lazy VA directors, so a lot of VAs (Mercer, North, Baker, Bailey) end up doing their normal voice or something very close to it. North is good in Destiny 2 and Baker in Death Stranding specifically because they're both allowed to get weird in their work, but the rest of the time it's just so... repetitive."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"She definitely has an impressive range, but they just don't hire her for that.

Just look at her characters in the three different campaigns of Critical Role. Those accents are all vastly different."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Casting is beyond his control.  He's not the director.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Big difference between random NPCs and main characters.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,exactly. but I feel like he particularly nailed Pagan Min.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Especially Kai Leng. Definitely the role he’s most famous for.

/s"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"The pizza between the Timefall Farm and the other side of the map…

1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Is Higgs coming back in 2??
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Honestly, those were fun during the launch period because you had all the highways if you skipped those until the end which made it pretty fast to do those within 30 mins or less. (heh)

&#x200B;

Then you get the final mission where you find out he's just fucking with you and you're like ""Goddamn it."""
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I misinterpreted this as Dark Souls 2 and started wondering who the fuck is voiced by Troy Baker in that lmao
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I find his normal voice to be pretty distinct, definitely recognizable in games like Farcry 4, Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor/War, Infamous Second Son, Batman: Arkham Knight (when not distorted by the helmet), and Death Stranding (although that also has his face, but the voice is recognizable before he takes the mask off).

Other times it’s not as obvious, although certain words will make it standout to me. Such as in The Last of Us, God of War (Magni) and Ragnarok (Bitter Squirrel), and Uncharted 4 (although that may be more a memory lapse since I haven’t seen or played that game in forever)."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I just keep hearing Ben 10 in all my games nowadays and it always catches me off guard

1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,That shit caught me so off guard the first time I played
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Hearing Solo Wing Pixy yelling about Liberty and Freedom kinda works though, just not the kind that Super Earth wants."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Not to mention he's Smoke in MK1
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"He did Sasuke, Haseo, and Suzaku Kururugi. Yuri did a decent amount of MC work before Troy Baker got really popular."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Hey, Ash! Watcha Playin'?"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"That's where I know her from! Was always wondering when I heard her in games or she showed up on critical role. I knew I knew her from somewhere, way back. It's been like a decade since I watched ""Hey, Ash! Watcha Playin'?"" Had completely slipped my mind."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Anthony Burch wrote Borderlands 2.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,It is weird to think about seeing the videos posted on Destructoid. I loved her HAWP Ocarina of Time video
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Taliesin and Marisha don’t really pop up too often compared to the rest of the cast.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Don't forget Rayne in Bloodrayne.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Perfect sultry voice
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Correct. Laura Bailey does Catwoman in Telltale’s Batman.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,You're telling me it wasn't the director's bold vision to include a modern earth vehicle with visible branding as part of their lived-in sci-fi world??? Have you seen a modern movie before? There's no bet required bucko
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I'm sorry what
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I mean,   i want goblin mode Tina  not a  cosplaying egirl

I wish they just hired a look alike and made Ashley  dub over her.  That voice is too iconic"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,">My problem with Hart as Roland is Roland is supposed to be the serious one for crying out loud

That, and Roland is supposed to be built like a stack of bricks, and they got the guy who's whole thing is being a short angry black guy to play him.

It's like they went out of their way to get the casting wrong. Only way it could have been more wrong is if they cast an Asian guy."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"The movie is definitely going to be a catastrophy. The question remains if it's going to an entertaining catastrophy (probably not), in which case, the super weird casting decisions would enhance it"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I mean, 5'11"" is 2 inches above the US average and 3.5 inches above the global average.

Also have one brother who is 6'1"" and two brothers who are 6'2"", and one sister who is 5'10"".  No one thinking I'm anything more than tall*ish* around those folks.

The rest of my friends and siblings are in the 4'11"" to 5'9"" range, so I still get to feel tall sometimes."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,They got one on the money then
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Don't remind Bethesda that Shady Sands exists.

The idea that Fallout has a fully fledged city with thousands of people that not only isn't built on the ruins of another city, but was built entirely from the ground up after the nuclear war using the most advanced tech on the planet, and where it isn't rare to see people driving cars, would probably send them into an existential crisis."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Bethesda kept the flame alive, but has trouble understanding what a post post apocalypse would look like, ie people aren't squatting in a diner with junk and skeletons strewn about."

1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,For sheet spectacle alone yes.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Yes. Dwayne Johnson has been playing The Rock for 30 years. Both in movies and the WWE.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,And second place is like 350 visits or something. And it's Justin Bieber.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,He did SUCH a good job.  I really want to see him in more serious roles.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Everything I’ve heard about the Rock in the last 10-15 years or so is that he’s a hard to work with, melodramatic control freak. He’s far more concerned with the power, the recognition and worth of his brand than he is with the artistic part of acting.

If you’re kind of actor who won’t be in a movie where his characters lose a fight for any reason then you’re not acting for the love of it, you’re doing it to make mainly to make money."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"> He's not willing to risk not looking super tough.

Which, ironically, makes him sound not so tough."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-10,"When I was watching Dune 2 and Batista gives a slobbery kiss to someone else's boot, I was like ""The Rock would never be able to bring himself to do that in a million years"""
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Cena's comedic turn has been oddly delightful to me.
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I think he's more morphed into that role as a douche over time. He took bumps and made fun of himself in The Rundown and Be Cool, respectively. Just after it was every year was a new film, it became more about his image and the money it seemed"

1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,Does that include Berseria? That's the only one I've played.

1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,I first knew him as Haseo. I was obsessed with the dot hack//g.u. games as a young teen. Even to this day if he plays a role with an iota of angst I'm instantly transported back to chasing grunties in a field and shouting about PKK LLP BRB BBQ
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"And Rise in Persona 4 stuff up until *Dancing All Night*.

1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I assume he's asking why they picked Cate Blanchett, who is mid-50s to play the 20-something lead in an action movie, that they probably want to make at least 10 years worth of sequels to.

They're not making Taken, they're not even making John Wick. It seems weird to go for someone old to play your young, vibrant mass murderer."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,They wanted The Rock for the role but got his stand-in and didn't care
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"yeah that was the one pick i didnt have an issue with. ""yeah that makes sense to me"""
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Oh god the diner where the person lives with a 200 year old skeleton just hanging out on a table, I forgot about that lol

Yeah it just doesn’t make sense that people wouldn’t try to clean up where they live a bit after 200+ years.

People wouldn’t be stuck living in the past, they would be trying to move forward."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,He was really good in Dune
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"""Knock at the Cabin"" was a trip, if you haven't seen it. Not exactly ""down to earth"", but still drama rather than comedy. Maybe dark comedy (It IS M Night Shamalamadingdong, after all) but that's a bit of a stretch."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Berseria was alright, got pretty far but didn't complete it. To be fair, I've played Vesperia many years before Berseria, and I'm definitely getting more critical/jaded with every year. The newest Tales of is on Gamepass, and I don't feel like playing it. I'm not big on JRPGs in the first place"

1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"Yeah but given claptrap is just voice acting, they coulda got the games VA to play him. Yknow, if Randy Pitchford hadn’t been a massive cunt to him."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"The thing you have to remember is that universe didn't go past the 50s way of life, the hippies didn't spread peace and love, there wasn't the Vietnam War, there wasn't much that changed their world view.

When they went into the vaults that's what they had, for the 200 years that's what humanity grew up with while the Ghouls & Mutants were on the surface.

There isn't much of anything that can be done by the ones with intelligence when there is a real shadow government keeping what little knowledge hidden"
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"He was, but I would like more serious down to earth roles, and not hostile killer alien guy."
1bzdjml,2024-04-08,2024-04-09,"I agree and that would have been great, but like you said; Randy's a dick. And Jack has done plenty of Voice work before (and I'd say he does a good job) so i think it was a solid pick all things considered"

d355n5,2019-09-12,2019-09-12,Thats called ski pooping if someone is interested. In poland we call it “na małysza” which means “like małysz” małysz was polish pro ski jumper. We call it that way because when you stand and poop at the same time you make same position as ski jumpers before jumping. Interesting i know.

d355n5,2019-09-12,2019-09-12,"It's possible, but really bad for you. The body is naturally meant to expel waste in a squatting position since it's meant to relax your bowel muscles and make it easier to force the poop out."

While it sounds like you can and do shit in those RPGs, you don't explicitly HAVE to shit on a regular basis. To me, in order to count as a Game Where You Gotta Use The Can, you can't ignore the use of toilets without consequences, whereas unless I remember incorrectly you could probably play through the whole of Stick of Truth and Fractured But Whole without actually having to use the can without harsh consequences.

No More Heroes 1 and 2 still count for the main list, though. While I think you can probably avoid using the toilet if you're good enough at the game, there are consequences to be had if you don't, since if you don't use the toilet, you don't save, meaning that death would be a significant setback."

Those numbers are from 2017 and India’s Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (aka Clean India) initiative should have improved things since - they’re building millions of toilets every year and running a massive campaign to change behaviours, because as recently as 2014 they had over 500 million people routinely “open defecating”. Even providing toilets isn’t a fix on its own because they encounter *exactly* the issue this thread is about, where people squat over the seat and spray shit everywhere. Which is then exacerbated by a lack of knowledge about cleaning bathrooms effectively.

This isn’t about villagers either. Every Indian city has vast numbers of people without access to toilets."

jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-09,You look like Ana tor
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08,Nice cosplay but you should seriously stop bullying Johnny Depp
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08,Lea Seydoux eat your heart out.
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08,"Usually dont like short haired ladies, but I must say you're beautiful =P"
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08,"Haha yeah, that part is quite long. Hopefully you're enjoying it :)"
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08,i'm getting flashbacks >!lou wake up!<
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08,here for the fitness and nutrition crowd
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08,Are there other sides?
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-09,The horny side of Reddit is always coming
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08,"I can't ..control ..my right hand..

RIP NO NUT NOV."
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08,"It's because of the nose, haha. Thanks!"
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08,Naw more like Katheryn Winnick
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08,"Thank you :) It is makeup, but I kinda look like her irl. I'm not that skilled, I can't pull of people I look nothing like, haha"
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-09,"I had the same thought; ""Wait a sec... are the models doing their own cosplay now!?!"" 

Great job OP!"
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08,"Oh! I saw the hands and thought (potential spoilers) “shouldn’t it be aged, wrinkly skin?”"
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08,"Well, judging by the chiral density in your area, it's BT-heavy, and all the porters, including me, have a hard time accessing it. Please accept the official apology of Fragile Express® 😔"
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-09,Agreed! Thanks :)
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-09,"It depends on your preferences! If you've ever played mgs series and disliked them, then DS probably won't be your thing, because it has signature Kojima storytelling and gameplay decisions. In case you enjoy games that try to push the boundaries of its genre and don't mind some meditative gameplay, you should definitely give it a shot!"
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-09,"I commissioned the umbrella almost a whole year ago and am still waiting for it. The virus wrecked my plans hard :(
I enjoyed the gameplay of DS from the start, meaning my experience is really different feom yours. If you don't enjoy it, I'd say rush it to the end, ignoring the side quests. Imo, when you only play through the mandatory missions, they give you enough cutscenes in-between them to not get bored."
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-09,"Yeah, but is it your 1st birthday?!"
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-09,Ave ziplines (and/or highway)
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-09,"Thank you! She's obviously my favorite as well, so I'm pleased to hear my cosplay met your expectations :)"
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08,Thank you! :)
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08,Thanks :)
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08,Thanks :)
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08,I have some resemblance and enhance it with make-up :)
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08,Thanks :) that's both luck and makeup 😌
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08,Thank you! Can't wait to see no time to die
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08,Thank you!
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08,Yep! Less since the pc release ofc. Thanks :)
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-09,"Likers get liked, haha :D"

jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08,"It's not a competition I think, more of a fun event :) Thank you!"
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-09,Paranoid
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-09,I wish lmao
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08,"What's bad about cosplay? Well, thank you regardless! :) likers get liked, haha"
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-09,"""i don't like cosplay because girls do it and I **really really really hate girls**"""
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08,Bruh what? I'm just sharing my hobby/art
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08,"Can't agree but thanks, haha!"
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08,"I've never been compared to her before, huh"
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08,How much do you bench?
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08," Nose, eyes , face shape ...., you certainly noticed that!"

jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08,"I've actually done the skin before, but just the hands. The whole arm+neck seems tricky, but maybe I'll do that too someday :)"
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08,*Thumbs down emoji*
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-09,Nice! I'll check it out MGS was one of my favorite series.
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-09,Thanks for the help ! :)
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-12-23,"Hi there ! Just wanted to let you know that I've finished the game yesterday, and it was one the most interesting and enjoyable games I've played. Indeed it felt strange and lonely at start , but I guess that's the whole idea - Sam becoming more trusting and finding things he cares about and willing to push an extra mile (or an extra kilogramme). I became more attached to the story and it's characters, and even got a little emotional on some parts. I just wanted to thank you for taking the time to answer my comment. And, inspired by the overall sentiment of the game, I too wanted to share some love , and give you a like 👍 for helping me. Keep on moving on 😁"
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-09,Wow I legit thought it was photoshopped on. If it's really makeup then this is pretty impressive.
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-09,Its not out of the ordinary on Reddit. Just the way its worded seems like it to me.
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08,Ignore him. He posts this every time a woman dares to post a cosplay on his subreddit.
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08,"The whole game, coach."
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08,What's your nutritional intake daily????
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08,"Well, you can check my pinned posts, the second one is me and Kojima-san. Back then I did my makeup awfully, that's an accurate representation of what my current make-up skills give me, haha"
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-09,"It is makeup and not editing. You can check some vids of me in the cosplay here or in my IG, (cisplay challenges and me playing the piano)"
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08,"Oh, I checked his other comments and I see now. Well, guess he is the one starved for (negative) attention..."
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08,"Don't the body part days to work out! Like Arms, Legs and Dick Days!"
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08,"I just took a look at that post, you really do look like her. Also, no hover hand for Kojima I see lol"
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-12,"Oh I'm sure it is, it's brilliant! You are very skilled.  

It's just that I have to question everything I see these days, after I see [videos like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3COBWXegT-E&list=WL&index=5)."
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-08,Looool yes you got me. Its me 😂
jqd883,2020-11-08,2020-11-09,"Haha yep, but he was very lovely irl in my opinion. Thank you :)"
