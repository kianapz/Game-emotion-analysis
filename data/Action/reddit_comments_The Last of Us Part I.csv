5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I guarantee we're going to see loads of people getting Ellie's tattoo.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Don't know if anyone noticed, but the window from the menu background of the first game seems to be the window from the room where Ellie is in the trailer. Or they look really similar.
"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"So it looks like the story will be something like this:

-Fireflies find Ellie and Joel
-Fireflies kill a lot of Tommy's village people
-Feels
-Ellie and Joel will hunt the fireflies
-During the hunt Ellie will learn the truth
-More feels that I cant handle
-Bittersweet ending like the first"

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"It might be just me, but I'm getting the vibe that Joel is actually dead, and that Ellie is saying that at the end to avenge him."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,First Red Dead Redemption 2 and now The Last of Us Part II. My two favorite games are getting sequels and I couldn't be more excited. Maybe 2016 isn't entirely the worst.

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I really wanted a sequel that followed another story in the same setting but god damn if I can't help but hype as hell for this. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"As a 33 year old man, I have played a lot of great games in my day but this is the top the list for story driven gaming. Absolutely fucking incredible. If you've never had the pleasure of playing the original, go now. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"The Last of Us was probably one of the best games ever made - the story, the characters, the gameplay - it was really at the level of a masterpiece.  This trailer completely sold me on Part 2.  Amazing."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Yo is Joel dead? Is that why she's killing fireflies? Is he a hallucination?
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"The Last of Us was announced in December 2011, and released June 2013. Hopefully this gets not later than a 2018 release."

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I was always one to think that The Last of Us didn't need a sequel, but this game is looking awesome, even though it has only a small trailer. Definitely going to play it.

(Also, Ellie should have been playing Johnny Cash for the lolz,  Logan looks very much like TLOU's atmosphere and I LOVE IT).﻿"

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"The Last of Us is the best gaming experience I've ever had, from the gut-wrenching opening through the gut-wrenching ending and all the gut-wrenching in between (especially those rats in the hotel basement). For me it elevated video games onto an equal footing with all other forms of storytelling art; if Roger Ebert had seen TLOU he would have been convinced. When they announced the film adaptation I was crushed; there is literally nothing about a film that could improve upon the experience of the game. It's the first game to make me feel that way. And it's the first game to make me feel the way I feel right now upon seeing this on the front page.

Some are saying the first game was a complete story and doesn't need a sequel. They're not wrong. I don't care. I needed this *badly* and with the same team behind it I know they can do no wrong.

Let's do this."

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Reasons Joel may be dead and he's just a hallucination: 

1. He asks Ellie if she's ""really going to go through with this"", which seems to suggest that she's alone in whatever she's facing (could be that they had some sort of falling out or poorly chosen words if he intends to help her) 

2. He doesn't appear to have any blood on him whatsoever, even though Ellie has several cuts and blood flowing (could be that he just found her and she did all the fighting before he arrived) 

3. A possible motivation for Ellie's anger is that Joel was killed by whomever she's going after (though there may be another explanation) 

4. His hair and beard were graying in the first game when Ellie was much younger and it appears that it looks the same even though she is clearly older now 

5. He appears to emerge from the sunlight as if a ghost as he enters the house 

Reasons Joel may not be dead: 

1. The grass, mud and water appear to move as he walks through the scene 


Please let me know if there's anything I missed. I tried listening to the song but didn't come away with anything other than she appears to be incredibly angry and vengeful against her enemies, perhaps not even caring if she dies.

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I honestly think (and I hope I'm wrong) that Joel is already dead in this trailer. Just how you never see him properly, the way he's just stood off in the doorway, as well as the fact that Ellie never looks at him directly (can't tell for sure where she's looking in the closeup at the end). Would also explain who Ellie is going after.﻿"

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"In the first game you could find a piece of paper that explained that 40% of the world's population was dead or infected. That still leaves a majority of the human population to rebuild. They would just need to stay in walled cities. I wasn't really conflicted at the end of the first game because of that. Humanity isn't doomed, things just got set back for a while."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I'm too hyped for this game. One of my all time favorites. One of the reasons I got a PS3. Then bought it again on the PS4.

But, when did ND decode to revisit Joel & Ellie? I thought when TLOU 2 was rumored ND said they were done with those two. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Holy fuck, my butthole puckered at least 8 times throughout that trailer.  It's been a few years since I played.  Do we know who she wants to fuck up?"

Unless they have a really good reason to include the Fireflies again I worry that we'll get a rehash which fails to explore new issues. I'm sure they can pull it off if they really want to, I just want a good reason for the faction to be back at the center of things."

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Damn right thats jizz on the front of my pants
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Is it ok to preorder?
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"When that guitar came in, I was almost expecting ""You are my fire. The one desire. Believe when I say. I want it that way"""
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I've been so happy all day because of this
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,So excited. It cannot come soon enough!!!!
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Too bad they won't let me buy it on PC.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"The Last of Us is easily my favorite game ever. At first, I was thinking a sequel wasn't necessary, but a while ago I became more open to it after realizing that Naughty Dog can't make a bad game after playing Uncharted 4 and realizing the story can actually still go places. I'm pretty goddamn excited. 2018 is way too far away. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Holy shit. I don't care if I have to wait two years for this I'm getting on the hype train right now.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I really wish I played the first. The only time I'm ever jealous about being an Xbox owner is anytime I see The Last of Us or Uncharted. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"If I had cancer, this would have cured me."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,2020 is going to be awesome. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"This...can't be real?!?
I was so, so, so worried this was going to be fake.

I now wish I hadn't watched it.
It's all I want now!"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Red Dead and Last of Us coming within one or 2 years? I give in, Playstation I'll buy your console"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Meanwhile I'm still waiting for The Wolf Among Us 2.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Fucking chills
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I'm so freaking excited right now! I've been waiting for this to get announced!

Also, my theory on what it going on is that maybe Tommy's place got attacked, but no one really died. BUT, Ellie was raped and now she's pregnant, hence ""Are you sure you're going to go through with this?"" Joel doesn't want her to put herself in danger if she's going to have a baby. Abortion doesn't seem like much of an option, unless you go with old-school ""you will probably die"" abortion. I know, it sounds dark, but The Last of Us was already dark.

Edit: Though my theory doesn't really explain why Joel isn't upset. If someone did something to Ellie he would be totally ready to kill them."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,what's so good about this game? ALso is there a version for pc?
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Ive been thinking about if TLOU2 would be a good idea. After this trailer I am so fucking confident in Naughty Dog. I can already tell that this game is going to be fucking amazing. Just amazing.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Excuse me while I clean up my jizz.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"This is the best news I've heard in a while. God, can't wait to play it when it's released. TLOU I is my all time favorite game. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Last of us made me cry
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I would pay 60 dollars to get a copy that is a. Recording of someone else playing the game. I prefer to just sit and watch the last of us. I watched every minute. My roommate was like do you want a turn and I'm like. No im good. Hah. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Joels voice again... 
"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"You know, I love my gaming PC but this is probably the one console exclusive that actually makes me want to buy a PS4 ;-;"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Finally, still playing the first 1 for the 5th time now.
Played it on all different modes.
Now im on the last mode survival mode and its hard to play, almost by the end now."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"My respect for cinematic narratives in video games has a ""before Last of Us"" and ""after Last of Us"" divide.

I mean, a game has *never* made me cry until the first level of LoU. I felt a deep and visceral hurt for Joel. It changes my entire outlook on video games (and, for the record, I'm an Xbox guy, so I literally stole my buddy's PS3 to play it, haha)

I am not gonna hype myself too hard for this, because those kinda moments only come around once every other generation, I feel - but it isn't easy not getting too excited."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Naughty Dog slaying the competition!
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I'm so excited for this!! I've played the first one three times. It's one of my favorite games of all time. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Man 2016 straightened right up after the Trump win.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Is this one gonna make me cry, too? Cause I dunno if I can handle all that "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,ugh y??? I don't wanna buy a console but I loved the first game so much!! the feels!!!
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I've never played the last of us because I only game on the pc but I heard its got a good story
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,The song being played is called Through The Valley by Shawn James for anyone wondering
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"My theory: Joel is aging and suffering from his long-term injuries, so Ellie becomes the new caretaker. Master becomes the student. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,The best trailer I've seen. Wow
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,yee

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,FUCKING YESSSSS
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"If this came out on PC, I'd be a happy man. I love games with good campaigns and I have wanted to TLOU for so long."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,This trailer has been the best part of 2016 so far. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,This hype train ain't stopping. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Goosebumps.

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Better sell my Xbox and buy a PlayStation

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Naughty Dog games alone are good enough reason to own a PS4.

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Looks like I need to buy a PS4 and play the first one now...
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Whoa
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Well it's time to buy a PS4 now.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,So much gold on this thread.  We are that excited about this game

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,When will this come out? A few years still?
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"My hard erect penis is already trying to reach my wallet to spend money on a game that plays on a system I have never played in a long time. Please help me. I am in desperate need of a game like this to grab me out of my depressing life of loneliness. My goosebumps are as high as mountains, and I am not being sarcastic when I say this. This announcement surprised the shit out of me and it already has over 10k upvotes.  "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Is anyone here more excited for their multiplayer? I still play Factions 'til this day.

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"This is the ONLY game that I found myself emotionally invested in. Stopped playing as much near the end b/c I didn't want it to end.

Haven't played any games in years but with Red Dead Redemption and now The Last of Us, I'm gonna have to get back into it for sure."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,All new gameplay mechanic: Ellie can swim
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I'm probably gonna miss Ellie as a child. Her being out there for the first time ever created some of the funniest moments I had in a game for a long time.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I guess Joel did teach Ellie to play guitar after all. I recall him mentioning he would when they reached salt lake city. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I want to be excited but man, that first game was seriously depressing (it was ""good"" in the sense that it was emotionally powerful and got under my skin, but ""bad"" in the sense that I don't like the lens through which it viewed humanity and the world in general - basically, it was not at all *fun* for me to play, just interesting). Honestly don't know if I can take a second one. :/"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,PLEASE DONT FUCK THIS UP!

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,Even as a PC gamer primarily honestly TLOU was one of my favorite games in the last decade.  Rebought the remastered on PS4 and fully intend to make this one a day one purchase.

Words can't describe how fucking excited I am for this game"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,Saw nothing about this until today. So pumped.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"So what happened to Tommy's? Why are Joel and Ellie on the run? Who/what is Ellie seeking revenge on? So many questions. What if the fireflies attacked Tommy's because they saw the power of the dam and also because they wanted Ellie, and because of this Ellie wants to hunt down every last one of them. I mean... It did show the fireflies logo on a stop sign... Symbolic maybe?"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,You guys realize this is just a giant feelz train coming straight for us.... :'(
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"Time to stop all this PC nonsense then, buy a PS4 *throws laptop in incinerator with shaped like Ellie's face*

In all seriousness, Naughty Dog has never let me down. Ever since Crash Bandicoot (the ones by them, those DS spinoffs and shit sucked) they've been one of my favourite devs. I still dust of Jak and Daxter every now and then. If there were any reason for me to buy a PS4, it'd be them. Who needs Steam when you have The Last of Us? (Ratchet and Clank would be great too, but I haven't really enjoyed one THAT muchsince Up Your Arsenal)"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,This announcement made me so emotional. It will undoubtedly be a masterpiece. Neil Druckmann knows exactly what he's doing.

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"Holy crap, loving how Ellie's face has changed over time and the reference to the Window from the menu screen. This is gonna be good!!"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,I am going to say i
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"I'm a PC guy. Might have to grab a ps4 for this to see what the fuss is about, cause I wanna bite. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"Personally, I want it to be where the fireflies are trying to find and take Ellie in because they've run out of candidates (killed off all the immune they could get their hands on, or couldn't find another and having been trying to track her down since) while trying to find a vaccine for the older generation, and Ellie is wanting to kill them because they're coming after her. 

As you play through the game, Joel is getting old, wistful, and even more tired of the world, and seeing his faux-daughter becoming so angry is making him question whether or not there is any humanity left in the world (I'm going off the theory that Joel saved Ellie not only because she had kind of replaced his daughter, but because she was his idealized humanity - someone who cares enough for others to willingly die just at the chance it might save people), and it starts to slip just all he did to save her, and she begins to realize that she could of been the cure, and that this whole time Joel has been lying to her. At the climax, she leaves him. Literally just turns her back on him and walks out after learning the full truth (and probably somewhere along the line they'll divulge she does have antibodies that are replicable or something, so she'll see it as Joel's fault the world is still the way it is, so that her reaction and decision makes sense). It won't be where she leaves him to die, but she'll do something to save his old ass, and then just leave him, probably with a ""we're equal now"" quip, and it'll destroy him completely. His first daughter was taken from him, and so he tried his hardest to keep people from taking his second daughter, but doing so led her to leave him. 

It would also tie into how joel asks ellie if she really wants to go through with killing the fireflies, as he knows that the greatest chance of her finding out the truth will present itself as they interact on any level with the fireflies. 

It would be brutal throughout with a good fuck-tonnage of feels, but that's what I hope happens "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,Can we get the first one on PC? Pretty please?
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,YESSS!!

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"What's that song Ellie was singing and why can't I download it? I hope they make it sort of like a theme song. In my book, MGS: snake eaters theme song is the best gaming song to date! Perhaps this could top that"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,The only good thing to happen this year tbh. The feels are real.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,yep I cried a little while watching this.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,You don't know how pumped I am for this. The last of us has been one of the best zombie games I've ever played on console. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,I loved the Last of Us. I felt emotionally connected to the characters and I felt the isolation that I figured they were feeling. Truly a great game and I hope this lives up to it.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"Damn! I can't wait. 

I'm glad to see Joel is still alive in this. 

I guess he found some time to teach her the guitar like he said he would. 

I can't wait to get back into the stealth kills. Shooting arrows, throwing nail bombs, tossing fire bombs, slamming people in the head with spiked pipes.... and hopefully other new things!!!

Naughty Dog... TAKE MY MONEY!!!!"

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"I just want to share this with some of the people on the 'imaginary Joel' bandwagon- the SAME ACTOR who played Joel played the hero of BioShock Infinite and in the second DLC plays the hero again but you play a girl and the voice actor who plays Joel/Booker plays the main hero... but he's dead and in your head.

I seriously don't think Naughty Dog is going to make Last of Us 2's 'B. plot' (for lack of a better term) use the EXACT SAME device from a game that had the EXACT SAME voice actor.

Also, you do not see his face,

puberty you grow a lot more than a 40/50 something regresses,

if you make it to 50 with hair and mass you aren't bald and skinny by 55 unless you get cancer,

they do not show his face and light works on hair somewhat so you don't know his hair color- wait for a poster for Christ sake,

and she killed the people in the house or got into a fight, Joel walked INSIDE from the OUTSIDE and had a gun so he probably didn't have to scrap- she obviously did, they could've been in different places,

so cut that Mr. Robot trope shit out right now with your assuming asses

Get a job

edit: the game director said The Last of Us is a story about THESE TWO, they will both be big players, in an interview about it 11 hours ago. I think he's being quite literal. "

Not because of the game mechanics or gameplay..but the story. I played games from the early 90's I never cried in a game..this was my first game I cried ffs. The story was amazing, the voice acting was 10+... 

I just can't wait for this game..omfg "

This game is a cutscene! a movie with mediocre, average gameplay! Yeah that story telling is good but as someone who values gameplay over narrative, I can't fathom why people love this game so much.

I just hate how people rave about how perfect, and flawless this game is when as a game it's actually quite flawed.

I really wish we got more, but a new cast."

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"They are going to ruin it. Even if the game is decent which it might well be.  :(

The Last of Us is unique and special because it is a wonderful standalone story and it is that *because* it is a standalone story.  The ending and the uncertainty is what makes it all better. 

At least they could come up with something new. There's a whole fucking world out there. But $$$$...."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Fk the dont preorder game sht! This is the only excemption for me. Ima preorder this sht right now if i can even if it doesnt come out til 2018

The story had been told. I would have much preferred a sequel, exploring Tess & Joel's relationship or what happened between Tommy and the Fireflies.

Instead we get a stupidly hyped up trailer with the setup simply being ""Gotta kill em all"". Are you serious? That's the best they could come up with?"

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,The Last of us was a gaming experience unlike anything ever published. I cried at the beginning of the first game. So many touching moments. This game could surpass dare I say the original. I'm all in.

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Holy. I have high expectations. But I think Naughty Dog is ready. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,AAAAAAAASSA AAAAAAAASSA!!!! 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I'm gonna be hard for the rest of the day now
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,HOLY FUCK.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Fuck. Yes. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"The honest truth about this, for me, is that I can't wait for this for two reasons.

1.  My wife might play it through and I can watch
2.  World of Longplays on YT will definitely have it after a while"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,OH MY GOD. I almost fell out of my chair. Second favorite game of all time.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"**OMFG** 

YASSSSS seriously with the cancellation of Silent Hills (yea i'm still hung up on that) this is the news i needed!"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,How do you continue that which ended so perfectly?
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Development of The Last of Us began in 2009, soon after the release of Naughty Dog's previous game, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. TLOU 1 came out June 2013. 

So... Uncharted 3 came out this past May... safe to say we could be waiting until ?? 2022?  lol hopefully nowhere as long as TLOU 1 though... "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,God i'm ready to get hurt again 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I read that as the last part of us, which would be a good title for the franchise finale."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"TLOU2 announced. Internet collectively shits itself.

As to be expected. Excuse me whilst I watch the trailer solidly for the next 18 hours "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"The song she sang is beautiful and was written by the very talented Shawn James out of Fayetteville, AR. If you have never heard his music, prepare to have your life changed."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,**YESYESYESYESYESYESYES!!!!!**
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Calling it now.

Joel dies. Games is about ellie"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Not going to lie I was really hoping for just a really brutal prequel that would make you hate joel
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Spotify:  [Shawn James - Though the Valley](https://open.spotify.com/track/2MM8qDOkfV1natcOHC5kER)

Expecting that to shoot up in popularity this week"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,!!!!!!!!
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Let me just say that song fits that trailer perfectly 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"damit...now i have to buy a ps4
"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Holy fucking shit, is there an official date yet?"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,YAY
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Gotta really hand it to the Naughty Dog cinematic team. This is incredible 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I love the Last of Us so much. Seriously. I cannot wait for this!
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,This game is going to be amazing!!! I just hope that they include the infected in multiplayer this time.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Can't wait. 

Hopefully its not a long wait. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"The Last of Us, Read Dead 2, and Mass Effect... 2017 SAVE ME!!"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I don't even have a ps4 and I'm gonna go jerk off over this game
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Hello, my name is Jon. I'm 21 years old. This game looks good."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Can we take a moment to talk about how drop dead gorgeous that trailer was? Like seriously if that's in-game then the new bar has been set for visuals... and I'm a PC player. I suppose 60 fps will be too much to hope for on a PS4, but it's stunning none the less. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I just bought an Xbox One. I dun fucked up. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Well fuck. This is the ONLY exclusive that can get me to buy a Playstation 4. Rip 400 bucks.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I trust Naughty Dog to make a great game, because that's kind of their thing, but I can't help but be a bit disappointed that they're following the same characters after that perfect ending. 

*Spoilers* A man loses his daughter, his heart turns to stone as he struggles to survive in the apocalypse, learns to love a surrogate daughter again after resisting it so long, and then, upon facing the decision between loosing another daughter or watching the world's last hope disappear, chooses her, and speaks the lie that may end the world. Cut to black. /spoilers

What a perfect stopping point. I hope Last of Us 2 doesn't end up in the same spot as Telltale's Walking Dead Season 2, with that beautiful ambiguity smashed to pieces."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I'm so fucking excited. I had tears in my EYES. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,YES YES YES YES
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Haven't played the first part yet, but am already excited and looking forward for the release. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Can someone tell me when the expected release date is? Thanks
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"So is this gonna be a theatre release, or straight to dvd?"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Yeah I knew there was a reason I kept my PS4! 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,The best part about the higher difficulty in TLOU was that it didn't really allow you that luxury. I constantly felt like I was scrambling for bullets and crafting materials. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"You don't really need them anyway. 95% of that game is passable with stealth, bricks and melee weapons."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Then waste 6 of them firing at a clicker without hitting it once!
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I'm not the only one who finished the game with a completely full inventory right? My husband and I would take turns playing and I would get so mad at him for ""wasting"" ammo lol. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"""Seven times at least"""
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Played through the original 7 times on different difficulties and own multiple copies of the game. 



I agree with this comment. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"You know what. I stay in my room all day, playing games and watching shows. So nothing different."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,No no no. We must have incredibly low expectations concerning this. I hear they are planning on making this more a spiritual successor to L4D.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"~10 years before my life expectancy, I'll have to stop playing/watching new series/games/books, in fear of missing the sequels."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"Welp, I definitely feel like I'm going to die now that I read this. Yay. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Not the fact that a second game coming, but seeing Ellie and Joel again was unexpected to me. I could've sworn the devs said they were done with those two. I'm still excited to see what happens next, but I'm not sure I'll be ready for the potential feel trip, they were safe after the ending of 1 :(."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"In case anybody gets too excited, I'm guessing we're going to have a bit of a wait to get this one. Fall 2018 maybe?"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Like /u/PingPongMyDingDong (great username) said, the reveal of another TLOU game wasn't surprising in the least, just that Joel and Ellie are in it."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,That shit gave me goosebumps. My body is ready.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"See this is how a movie should create it's trailers.  It's obvious you know what it'll be about for the most part, but the plot hasn't been completely given away.  It leaves you excited and waiting for more. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Welp. Guess I'm buying a PS4.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"My only problem with this announcement is that the first game had the perfect ending, I felt relief at Joel and Ellie's survival like never before playing a video game, yet the somber realisation of what that meant, the sacrifice Joel made. I really hope Naughty Dog have the narrative mapped out for this. But damn, I can't wait to play it."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"This trailer is fucking brilliant. It barely showed anything, but it got people so fucking pumped. Also, brilliant idea to release the trailer with people's reactions in the background. Hearing the crowd going wild at the key points makes this a whole new experience."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Damn near had an orgasm when Joel spoke. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,[deleted]
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Is there a version without the audio from the audience?
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,Im getting it on my butt
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,Where the hell did she even find the time or person to give her a tattoo?
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I did notice that. I wonder if that's on purpose, like perhaps they sort of planned this the whole time. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Looks like the dead guy in the room was killed with her knife, or at least a similar one to hers as well.

EDIT: Think i'm wrong, looks too big. Maybe a machete?"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"It's [not the same window](http://imgur.com/pVS7CTs), I'm afraid.  "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I will send you $10 if Joel doesn't die over the course of that game.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"At the time of the trailer, Joel could be already dead. Look how much Ellie has aged, while it looks like Joel hasn't aged at all. The fireflies may have killed Joel, and Ellie is trying to avenge Joel."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I think ellie does know the truth already, they had a little prologue that only some people saw, where joel and ellie were mending their relationship, or at least trying to"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,My bet is one of the big choices in the game will be if Ellie should kill Joel or not.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Well I have a new favorite song for awhile 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Jesus christ that dude has a hell of a voice

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,The Rasta Bus
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,For a while.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Do it. The remastered release of TLOU is amazing, & I'd highly recommend ND's much more lighthearted 'Uncharted' games as well (another PlayStation exclusive). With the release of the PS4Pro, you should be able to pick up a 500GB pretty cheap."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,It's pretty rare that a game with as good of a single player story has such a great multiplayer mode as well. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Such an underrated MP. Fantastically tactical. Required more thinking and trap setting than most other MP. Can't wait for the entire package. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Yes!  I poured hours into this multiplayer.  It was unlike any other multiplayer out there.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Was it really that good? I never played it 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Multiplayer being a thing in this didn't even dawn on me until your comment. Now I am even more excited than I already was! The Last of Us had such a unique multiplayer that I can't wait to see what they will do with this one.

But as a huge fan of Uncharted 2 and Last of Us multiplayer... I was really, really disappointed in Uncharted 4's multiplayer. So I hope they get this one right and just make a highly improved version of what they already had."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I'm still playing factions to this day. Best multiplayer indeed. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Hope they expand the little settlement part of the multiplayer, it was a little undercooked in the first game"

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"yea i feel that way too since they didn't show his face, maybe he's in her head"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Oh god. If his death is in the first 20 minutes, I guarantee you that I will be sobbing uncontrollably "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Yes! That makes so much sense. How else is she gonna be so grim about revenge if it weren't for Joel?
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I really think she will kill Joel, somehow. I don't know why, but I feel it in my gut."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,[deleted]
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Idgaf how long it takes. I want this game to be perfect. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"Naughty dog is Sony's bread and butter, so they'll get all the time they need for sure."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Me too!! And I'm a guy
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Don't forget Nioh, Last Guardian, Spider-Man, Detroit

Sony nails variety unlike any other publisher"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I'm actually going to cry man 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Wait what? A new Uncharted?!
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Xbox could pay for as many exclusives as they like, but they will never come close to PS because of Naughty Dog"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Don't forget about Red Dead Redemption 2
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I had mixed feelings. On one hand I really wanted to see Joel and Ellie again, but on the other hand their story was perfect and adding anything to it could mess it up."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Best game ever made in my opinion
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Before this I always said I'd like to leave Joel and Ellie alone but make more games in the universe. Needless to say this trailer changed that.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,[deleted]
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Music too. Score was amazing. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Theories and observations I've seen and made so far:

- Joel materializes out of thin air

- He appears to move through the tall grass in the doorway like a ghost

- He steps over the puddle, and does not step on the grass (it appears to move out of the way if his foot, but it could just have been the wind)

- He looks remarkably fine despite the battle that just took place"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,that was blood running down the gash on her forehead
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Guessing they came for Ellie, killed people close to her (Joel's brother?) and now she's gonna fuck them up. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"The Fireflies track down and execute Joel. Ellie is on the war path for revenge. 

""Joel"" throughout the game is going to haunt Ellie, trying to get her to turn back and let it go, because she knows that if she doesn't, she's going to be killed.

The first game was a father dealing with the loss of his daughter, and this one will be about a daughter dealing with the loss of her father."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"My current theory is that the settlement gets overrun by an opposing group, maybe firefly remnants, with only a handful surviving including Ellie. I get the feeling they'll pull a fast one with Joel and show that he's dead and is haunting Ellie in visions/dreams"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I assume someone has come and killed everyone at the little town they ended up at 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"We just have to wait until we have the PSNow service available for the PS4 so we can stream it to PC.

You know, since Naguhty Dog is *never* going to go cross platform"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Hsha naughty dog ever done anything not for playstation?
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"Speaking of what song Ellie should've been playing, remember in the first game when Joel said he should teach her how to play the guitar? Well... This trailer shows that he actually did... I don't know, but I think that's so **fucking cute**

(Had to curse there to reinforce my masculinity)"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,THATS CRAZY FAM NOBODY ELSE POINTED THIS OUT
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,That's good to know. I assumed it would be somewhat realistic otherwise they wouldn't have chosen to show the hands etc.  
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Original, $249, Slim $299, Pro $399. There's still sales going on."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,Butthurt fanboys. From PC and Xbox
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,A girl who was already 14 or 15 looks way different at age 20-21 while a dude that was 40 doesn't really look much different at age 45.  Even if it is 10 years and Ellie is 25 and Joel is 50 he would not look much different.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Me too but damn I'm hype for just about anything naughty dog makes 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Remember when Druckmann said we'd never play as Ellie? Naughty Gods lie a lot to the press, and I am so glad they do."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-13,:(
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"they said it's still in very early development, I wouldn't expect to see it until 2018, at which point ps4 prices should be pretty affordable to buy back in"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"Eewww, it's almost like he'd be banging his surrogate daughter... Wait, he would be!"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,They didn't seem to be much in ruins to me. The big chase scene had a bunch of them pretty well armed. All we saw was a few dead doctors and a named higher up kick the bucket. They could still be around in force. They probably found another doctor and then went back after Ellie since they knew she was still alive.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,Probably xbone or PC people who are bitter they won't get it
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"there's a ridiculously active amount of positive comments flooding my inbox, probably someone botting it with downvotes"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,Why two consoles? The first Last of Us is on PS4 as well
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2017-01-07,Pretty much no chance sorry 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-26,The story. And personally I love the gameplay.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-24,Storytelling basically

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"you could use PS Now to play it, last of us is a supported title  https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/explore/playstation-now/ps-now-on-pc/"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Disgusting to see so many people saying good things about an amazing game. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"In a world of 7 billion people, the answer is always no."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"I played it and thought the game was good, but certainly not amazing as a lot of people do. I think our opinion is absolutely valid, but you have to understand that when you add the last line of your post, ""Now bring on the downvotes!"" you're de-legitimizing your point, because it comes across as you not liking the game only to be a contrarian and rustle jimmies. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Wow, its almost like people have different tastes. If you don't like something move on, never understood why people feel the need to say something for the sake of saying it."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,There are dozens of us!
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,Nah... it's a great movie trapped inside a crappy game.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Agree never preorder.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"Don't think you opinion will last long here. Props to ya for being honest and all but I fully disagree. I liked the gameplay, like a lot. I played through it on all difficulties. But none the less I ain't hating. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Totally.  I want more LoU, I loved the first, but I didn't want to see Joel or Ellie ever again.  This has so many ways it can be completely ruined."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"When has Naughty Dog ever made something subpar since partnering with Sony?  
Even their lowest rated titles are still in contention for GOTY for their release years."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Exactly what I said. Updoots all around. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"didn't notice, guess so"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,the only way this won't be ps4 exclusive is if it jumps to ps5
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Watch a Stream/Lets Play of it on YouTube, it's essentially exactly the same experience as the gameplay elements are...

erm.."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,There's a trailer in this thread that shows Joel and Ellie. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I never thought there would be a part 2 ... 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I played it on the hardest difficulty the first time through and thoroughly enjoyed it (except for the graveyard clicker stairs that automatically make you not crouch walk when you touch them...). Felt like I had to count bullets and plan it out prior to each encounter, but could do it without bullets if I really really needed to.

Played it the other day on an easier difficulty to revisit the story and discovered that *Joel has radar*."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Yeah I'm pretty much a master of mortar, everywhere I went I just shot bricks out the fuckin ass"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Lol when I saw clickers I shot everywhere but their head
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"> My husband and I would take turns playing and I would get so mad at him for ""wasting"" ammo lol.

is that why you killed him? "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"""On each difficulty."""
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"""And make sure I get the Platinum trophy."""
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"Can't wait to see how they've expanded upon the multiplayer, too.

TLOU 1 surprisingly had an amazingly underrated multiplayer that wasn't expected by anyone. I'm just excited to play a newer version of it"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,Nothing bad can happen to you if you never leave your room
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I really hope they can pull off another story with these two without forcing it or ruining the story arc of part 1
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Common story telling is leading me to believe we are going to see Joel die...and I feel tears build up just at the thought of that
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I'm so excited to get invested in their lives again. Never have I been so invested in two peoples relationship 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"What if that wasnt Joel and he's dead? Thats why Ellie is furious ?! 

*just a theory*,So hyped for the game."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"At best. March 2019, you heard it first.

RemindMe! Two Years"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,2019 the earliest for sure 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I'm thinking either fall 2017 or spring 2018.

I am willing to bet it won't come out in 2019, that's not how these things work. Remember, it's been in development for at least a year, probably even more than that. 

There's no way it'll come out later than first half of 2018."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I'm welling up, they even included the ivy covered window from the opening menu!

So fucking stoked!!"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Same here. I was a little worried about them revisiting Joel and Ellie because the first was so good and I didn't want them to ruin it, but this trailer that barely showed anything makes me feel like continuing with them is just... *right.*"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I'm a grown man that witnessed the birth of both of his children and cried. Watching this is like watching a third being born, so much [emotion](https://media0.giphy.com/media/NmuoUzacWAPOo/giphy.gif) right now. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I want to be fully excited, but I'm nervous considering it's Ellie and Joel and I thought part 1 was a near perfect video game. I mean, Naughty Dog definitely deserves some trust, but I'm apprehensive. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Nah man it's essential for a trailer to give an outline of the entire movie's plot, so you don't need to actually watch it to know it sucks"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Literally the game that makes me buy a PS4.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Don't forget Horizon Zero dawn and mother effing Death Stranding! Oh and a little game called GOD OF WAR all coming to the ps4, i think it is safe to buy one just for those games!"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Joel is one of the most fleshed out characters in any video game ever. He is grey as fuck in his moral dealings, and at the same time completely relatable in nearly every situation. He quite possibly doomed humanity, but you can barely fault him for doing it. Fuck, I loved the characters in this game!"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"It is Naughty Dog we're talking about here. They're arguably the best game-based storytellers in the business. I mean, they made Nathan Drake, an Indiana Jones-esque 10 year old fantasy hero come to life-ish character seem relatable in Uncharted 4 and Ellie is up there as the one of the most connectable (autocorrect tells me that isn't a word but bleh) game characters ever made. They're capable to say the least."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"You felt relief? Man that ending was super sad. They may have survived bit all the trust in their relationship is gone. Joel lied to Ellie and she knew it.  Ellie will always stay near Joel as she has no one else but nothing will ever be the same between them. They may have survived but Joel did the wrong thing and although they'll never say that, they both absolutely know it. 

Heartbreaking.  "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"> This trailer is fucking brilliant. It barely showed anything...

Man, you must've loved OP's picture then. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,">  Also, brilliant idea to release the trailer with people's reactions in the background. 

That was just because the person recorded the livestream."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,You must be really easy 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I kinda think it adds something to it 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,but then you'd just be left with 'nce'
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,[deleted]
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"Someone at tommys safe zone community probably, that's where they've been all this time presumably. Ellie definitely looks older"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"If you can get inked in a supermax prison, you can get inked in a fungal apocalypse."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I don't think that it was necessarily ""planned,"" as much as it was probably put there as a reference.

I recall after the first game's release, in an interview with someone at Naughty Dog, they said the team hadn't planned a sequel and it was about a 50/50 chance that they'd make one."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Plot twist: ELLIE dies, no cure, cut to black as the rest of humanity is fucked"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Someone posted above that there might be a twist. Joel is dead already, that she's seeing visions of him. Throughout the game you think you see Joel around only to find out at the end, his death is what started her crusade."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I reckon Joel in the trailer is a ghost and they killed him.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Remind me! 2 years!
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Are you expecting Joel to go bald and lose all muscle mass in like 5  years?
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I think you're spot on. I think the Fireflies killed Joel and now Ellie is hallucinating and seeing him, driven by the anger of the death of her best friend she is out for vengeance. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,That's what happens with children and adults...  children age faster.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,You can't decipher anything about Joel's appearance from that video other than he has hair and a beard. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,The first game was about a father dealing with the loss of his daughter. This one will be about a daughter dealing with the loss of her father.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"She looks to be wearing Joel's old jacket with the sleeves cut off. Pictured [here](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/ba/0e/75/ba0e75d8d6da08f48cebbc1e952772c1.jpg). 

Edit. I think the shakey hands are going to be some serious psychological problems. Ellie and Joel probably lived in peace for a while, Joel taught her how to play guitar and than the fireflies come to take Ellie by force and Joel dies protecting her. There's a bounty on head so everyones trying to get her alive but only the higher up's in the Fireflies no why. Ellie will have visions/haunted by Joel's ghost while seeking revenge for his death and eventually finding out the truth about how she was saved by Joel. An how he sort of doomed humanity and lied to her. Coming to terms with everything she will have some sort of mental breakdown losing hope and it will get extremely dark. This is all me going crazy with hype lol. Please Naughty Dog i pray at the end they somehow find a way to make a cure with Ellie that doesn't involve her dying and that Joel made the right decision in saving her after all and she can forgive Joel. An done crazy theorizing lol"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Where was this
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Where does this info come from? I don't think they would leave something that important out of the actual game because it affects their relationship so much.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I need the full Ellie version too D:
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"In all honesty I thought it was going to be name something like this. The rest of us, or the next of us"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"So, that's it huh? we some kind of the last of us part ii?"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,🎤we gonna rock down to The Last of Us Part 2🎤
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,The Last of us 3: The Search for More Us
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Just bought a 500gb slim for 249! Uncharted 4 bundle sadly, I've only played the first. Wouldn't be fair playing the most recent one."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"The comment reads like Sony marketing, heh."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,Does anyone still play it on PS4? I never actually played it.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,">Required more thinking and trap setting than most other MP

That was definitely one game where a 4v1 in the last round was never a guaranteed win."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Yes, it rewarded skill and teamwork."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,It was a masterpiece. I've been playing it almost daily since 2014 when the ps4 remaster came out

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Don't you put that evil on me Ricky Bobby!
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"No, they never would start you off with something this sad at the start of the game."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Nooo:( I wouldn't be able to take it
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Well it looks like they are a few years in the future.  I'm just guessing but maybe she is sad that all the people of the town they are in (probably the one with Rick's brother) were killed when they tried to capture Ellie.  So killing pretty much all your friends and neighbors could give the reaction that Ellie had.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I'm hard and wet. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,God Of War 4

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Spiderman: Detroit sounds like a badass game 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,DLC with Chloe from Uncharted 2.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I think calling it Part II is the best way to assure it won't hurt the original at all, because the original is just the beginning of their story. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,You shouldn't have mixed feelings.  Naught Dog does not know how to fuck up.  
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,I agree and it's my personal favorite. There has never been another game that I was so invested in. I have always wished I could get the experience from that initial play through again. It was like reading a really really good book. And now I'll get that chance.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I felt the same.  The story ended so perfectly. But this... it was like seeing old friends, and I can't wait to hang out with them again!"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Story is what separated it for me.  I was so emotionally invested
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Yeah you're not wrong. I replayed it the other day(s) and some mechanics still stick out, like how close you can be to enemies without them seeing you. I understand that it's a game but it sorta breaks the immersion. Still, the story is what made it. All the small interactions really built up their relationship. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,There it is. Worried for my guy but it'll be interesting to see if they do take that on. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Ahh, that makes sense. If she's bleeding, then they're still fighting!"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Ellie goes rambo?
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"I think he's still alive, the emphasis the camera did on joel's gun gives me hope, there's no reason why a hallucination would have a gun, makes no sense, but who am I to say anything? I don't even think hallucinations walk through doors!"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I like that theory! I can see this going very well!
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Stream? STREAM?!  haha no thanks.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,They've only developed for Playstation ever since Crash Bandicoot.

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"I know right? I can't believe the gall of the people in this thread, how dare they be excited for the second installment of a game they loved? Pathetic imo. "

Well. 9th time lucky."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,You can still have an aneurysm.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Not a big Naughty Dog player, but have they ever blown it on a story?"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I don't think it will end with Joel's death but I think his death will be part of the climax and Ellie will be forced to move on alone or with a new character we meet. In the first one I thought Joel was going to die when he fell on that rebar. I actually thought the game was over for a second. That was a tense moment. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"long as it's not in the opening scenes or too early on, i wanna do cool shit as him!"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I feel like he's going to be a hallucination for the game. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,My theory is Ellie is getting revenge for the death of Joel.  and the Joel in the trailer is a hallucination.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"The game kept surprising me in how emotionally attached I was to these characters, something that usually doesn't happen to me unless I'm reading a great book.

I'll never forget when I killed those doctors to save Ellie, I literally screamed ""STAY AWAY FROM MY BABY GIRL!!!"" at the screen in the middle of the night, waking up and scaring the shit out of my housemates. Not many games can get that kind of rise out of me..."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Maybe Joel died, she wants revenge, but starts hallucinating visions of him talking to her. Playing through the game we think Joel is there the whole time then realize it's just in her head."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,She could be insane and that could be ghost Joel.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Yea I'm going to hop on this train of thought as well, Ellie is all busted up so I'm assuming she did all the killing and Joel (who looks clean) talked like a manifestation of her conscience, plus Ellie looks like she is beyond pissed and half certifiable, feels trip is going to be one hell of a ride. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Affirmative. I'll message you in 12 hours about ""hot slut takes fake bang taxi"", ah wait, that's not your request, is it. Oh well, I'll see you in 12 hours!"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Fuck.. I have to not die for almost two years?
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Announce it to ""Fall 2018""

then delayed to ""2019""

then get released by 2020 

as always"

I'm sitting there rocking my new daughter with my foot when i started up the game, by the time his daughter gets killed, im losing my shit locking doors and just sobbing, not knowing at all how to handle all my new emotions.  It still makes me think a lot.  Made me realize I would trade my soul and coukd be capable of awful things just to protect that little girl; something i hadnt considered before her birth."

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"> near perfect

No way man. If I've ever played a perfect videogame in every way possible, it was The Last of Us"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Blame all the dumbass people who complain that they don't want to watch a movie that they don't know exactly what it's about. Those are the same people who within the first 10 minutes of a movie starting complain that they're confused and don't know who everyone is. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Its thoughtful of them really
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Yep.  The first one was the only reason I bought a PS3.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Don't forget to grab Bloodborne when you pick up your PS4.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"That was huge for me. How they created this PERFECT incarnation of a moral choice where the right thing and what's best for humanity comes down to a single choice. How many times we think that we would step left but everything in the entire game built up to a moment where it was so, absolutely crystal clear that the right path is the one we walked down. I didn't question Joel for a second in that last segment. 

I was legitimately speechless at the ending, just felt so agonizing in some ways. That's how you know it was real. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"This one gets me every time, a vaccine would not save humanity at this point IMO. Most of the time the runners and clickers brutally grab the person and kill them rather than turn them. On top of that the fireflies are a group with an agenda, they would most likely use it as a weapon, like spread spores to military to eliminate them. Also since they have had people like Ellie before and they didn't just let her wake up and tell Joel this is what she wanted. The fireflies are shady as fuck so The decision like every decision Joel makes isn't black and white IMO"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"The point is that humanity is doomed whether or not Ellie lives or dies. It comes down to who are really the bad guys? If we flushed out everyone with the parasites, humanity is still going to be evil. Joel realized this and made the choice figuring that Ellie's life wasn't going to be the end all for evil. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"If you're the father of a little girl, his decision wasn't even controversial imo. If the choice was literally my girl's life or the human race, you'd have to take her from my dead hands. Maybe it's biology, I don't know."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,">He quite possibly doomed humanity, but you can barely fault him for doing it. 

Joel did not doom mankind, they were doing just fine when they were working together (like in that village halfway through the game).   It's the human who were causing their own misery in nearly every case.

I mean, yeah, the initial epidemic  killed people, like Ebola, like Black Death, but it's people fearing each other who turned everything to shit.   "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Ding. 

This is why they are bringing them back. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"To be fair, Ellie could simply be evidence that humanity is slowly adapting to the spores. So while Joel may have made humanity suffer for a bit longer, there is still a high chance, imo anyway, that more people with Ellie's condition (brain change after being bitten or whatevs) will appear in the future."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Not to mention in a post reveal interview they talked about how they were so dissatisfied with the stories they kept coming up with they almost gave up on a sequel all together because they refused to tell a story that would dilute the first game.

Which means if they're doing it they know they've hit on a really good narrative."

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I was so excited when I didn't see anything.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Nope. Brilliant.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I'm so dumb. At first, I thought that she was performing in front of a crowd of people and then it showed her in an empty room then I thought that she was just performing in front of a crowd inside her head. I didn't realize until when Joel walked in that it wasn't supposed to be apart of the video. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"When they see that firefly symbol, they know what it means, they know."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Not sure why but when I see trailers for long awaited games/ movies like this with the audience exciting reaction it makes me teary eyed as fuck
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"The moment the fireflies logo came into view people started losing their shit, I got goosebumps when I saw that."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"There's no ""o"" in audience



Edit: Just saw your name... woops"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,Joel must be about 60 now. Shit.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I mean, it makes sense. There's no set-up for anything else and the story is entirely contained, albeit open-ended. It very well could have been a one-off."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,">cut to black as the rest of humanity, minus Bill, is fucked.

~~FIFY~~ FTFY"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Why should the rest of humanity be more fucked than before? They didn't have a cure for the first 20 years and neither did they for the years after Part 1. 

It will just go on how it always did."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Honestly that would be worst. If Ellie dies and it ends that Implies a Joel suicide. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,That would be 2016 as a game.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"If Ellie dies, I will riot."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Joel pulls a resnov?
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"That's some M. Night Shyamalan shit right there, and not in the horrible way "

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Notice how Joel just kinda materialises as he approaches the front door? Could definitely be a subtle clue hinting she is imagining it
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"If this is the case, I hope they mind fuck us and lead us to believe he's actually alive and with you on your journey til plot twist: he's just in your head."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Yes you are the only one to pick up on the shirt.

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Set in India. India is very rich in mythology and mysteries so will work as a perfect place for their adventure.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,They also called the hangover sequel part 2 so you never know
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I guess that's true. If it was any other company I'd be afraid. But ND really knows their shit. So I can't help but feel pumped.

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-07,Just bought the remastered edition the other day after seeing this post. Wanted to see what all the fuzz is about. Just finished it. Holy shit. Great fucking game. Def in my top five. Highly recommended. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"What do you expect in an announcement thread for the game that's regularly cited as a favorite to those who have played it?  90% of the downvotes sum up to ""I don't get what all the hype is about.""

It's a game that won 100+ awards and is receiving a sequel after almost 4 years, but somehow you're angry that fans are excited for it??"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"It's way more fun without it, trust me. I just used patience and camera angles and it was a ton of fun... the whole radar thing didn't seem to fit the game. Joel's not a clicker!"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"That's Grounded Mode (the hardest difficulty)

No radar, less ammo, smarter enemies. "

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,Just spit-balling here (and tagging just in case); [I think the people she killed in the house there were Fireflies. The framing makes it seem like their mark was on a stop sign outside the house and it was their territory. My guess is that Joel tells her the truth pretty early in the game (first third at least) and then the full story along with new information we get makes her want to kill them all](/spoiler)
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Perfect.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Damn you beat me to it lmao

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Yep, me too, and I never played much else on it. Crazy how Sony basically got me to pay $400 to play a single game."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Pretty much the same here. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Just finished Bloodborne and I haven't had that much fun in a while. And stress...that too
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Literally the two games that made me buy a PS4
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I absolutely question Joel's decision . Ellie had made a choice, and he stole that from her.  Not for her, but because he himself couldn't stand losing her.  He possibly betrayed the world to save Ellie, but ultimately, he betrayed Ellie to save himself.  Which is why he lies to her in the final moments of the game."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Eh, that depends on how you did it I think.

I perfect stealthed the last bit, didn't kill anyone and got into the operating room unseen.   My logic was that ""holy shit that's a lot of machine guns"", so I thought I was supposed to do that.

Turns out most people just killed everyone including the surgeons and nurses, and I feel like killing the doctors was kind of unnecessary.  But, in retrospect, I think killing absolutely everyone was the canon ending."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Seems to me the primary threat of infection comes from airborne spores rather than direct contact with infected. A vaccine would be hugely helpful.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Replaying it, they do point out in the beginning that some people get infected just from spores growing in their homes.  The spores might keep spreading--in that case, a vaccine might be the only way."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"> Also since they have had people like Ellie before and they didn't just let her wake up and tell Joel this is what she wanted

They really did have others like Ellie? I thought that Joel made that up completely."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"How the heck did they think they were going to make a vaccine out of nowhere? 

Do you know how long it takes to design a vaccine vector and test it?!? Factoring in their lack of manpower or infrastructure... impossible! Especially as it was just the fireflies. I think the only way would be as a collaborative effort with several governments around the world. Assuming the rest of the world has a surviving population."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"I think saving Ellie was the right choice as well. Was humanity meant to be saved? Think about all the bad people you met in the game, then think about the good people. Two black guys, and one camp. The rest wanted to do the worst to you. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Oh, I bet the fireflies came in and killed everyone where Ellie and Joel were staying, trying to get her back.  And now she wants revenge."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Wait. I thought the ""had immune people,"" was part of Joel's lie. No one had shown immunity before Ellie. Unless I missed something."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"I saw it as more of a conflict of ideologies between Joel and Ellie, and the whole cure thing is just the backdrop. Everybody Ellie cared about was killed by the infected (apart from Marlene, but she doesn't know that), and she sees dying for the sake of possibly finding a cure as like her calling. She's willing to sacrifice herself to get rid of the infected. 

Joel on the other hand, everybody he cares about is killed by humans. They kill his daughter, Tess, and they would have killed Ellie too if he hadn't intervened. So his only real purpose is just to hold onto *something* that people can't take from him, whatever the cost. 

So in the end, even if the main characters don't fully realize it themselves, the main conflict is Ellie's selflessness vs. Joel's selfishness. And of course Joel wins completely. There's a little ambiguity at the end about whether she believes his story or not, but either way it's a pretty tragic ending for Ellie IMO. 

So yeah at the heart of it I see it as just a deeply personal story about the differences between those two characters (bear in mind also that Ellie has probably lost at least as many people she loves as Joel has) and the whole apocalypse thing was just a stage for it to play out on. As far as the story is concerned, what happens to humanity doesn't really matter. :)"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"Yeah that's the background of Joel decision, specially after seeing the game introduction. "
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,I think an interesting plot narrative would be that he dies while trying in some form or another to tell her the truth about her.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Literally just bought a 100 ps4 pros because of this brilliance.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Same here, I thought she was on a stage singing to people."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,"IIRC he had his daughter early, and he didn't go to college? So he was probably ~50 during the first game, late 40s?"

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,The first game explored how many younger people prolly wouldn't survive post-outbreak. I could imagine there being a scenario where Ellie is one of the very few her age who actually survived. 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Not that they even know for sure if they can reverse-engineer Ellie into a cure, which is one of the reasons why the first game ended like it did."
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Yeah, and even with a cure I think it's too late for most of them anyway. (not saying a cute is a bad thing, but it won't fix everything)"
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Without the torture of course.
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,ALL MUST DIE
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"and on top of that, he looks like he didn't just fight and kill those people. He looks clean and unscathed, not like the brutal Joel we see throughout the first one. Plus, he'd be a few years older and is bound to be slower, which makes him being unharmed less likely.

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Also in my opinion the hardest(/best) part about Grounded Mode was there being no HUD at all. You literally needed to count every shot so you know when to reload, and you don't know your health at all until you're critically low and Joel starts holding his arm.

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"the story was a mess but all the returning characters were fine in it, it was just the ideas and the badguys that ruined in the terms of not ruining the arc of TLOU1 i think they can do that just fine"

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-04,The Matrix had one of the very few marketing campaigns I'd like to experience again for the first time. That shit was tight. They made an experience out of it. The campaign for that film was better than a lot of films.

5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,Don't forget to grab Uncharted 4 when you pick up your PS4.   
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"The thing is though, you have to wonder if it would truly be Ellie's choice, or if she would make the choice because she felt obligated to do so. Saving humanity at the cost of your own life is a heavy burden for a 14yo kid. 

Obviously, Joel loves her and had his own personal reasons to lie to her at the end as, but I also feel that he did not let her make her own decision because, ultimately, it wouldn't really be her decision. It's easy for us to say that a single life is a small price to pay, but I don't blame Joel for not wanting to force that sacrifice upon her.

Besides, there was no guarantee that the experiments would even successfully create an effective vaccine that could be mass-produced. And even if it did, the fireflies proved themselves to be a shady bunch. Think of the power to be had by controlling the production and distribution of such a vaccine!

The humanity that Ellie could have maybe, possibly saved, perhaps, would then be at the whim and mercy of the fireflies."

Just pointing out that Uncharted 3 missed the mark (and my biggest issue with the narrative was the backwards and inconsistent character development). 
5gb5au,2016-12-03,2016-12-03,"Yeah, Uncharted 1 and 2 were made by the same team, with the addition of Amy Hennig as the lead writer. Uncharted 3 comes along, ND splits into two teams - Neil and TLOU team, and Amy/Evan and the UC3 team. Amy ends up leaving during UC3's production. For UC4, you have the entire team back together, sans Amy, with Neil as the creative director. 

At least, that's to the best of my recollection. I may have gotten a few details wrong. "

What the hell is the issue guys?  Leaks never tell you a story, and whoever did leak the game more than likely did so with a homophobic agenda, trying to get people to voice their discontent over plot point x or y.  I've avoided most of the spoilers, save for the fact that there is a homosexual relationship involving Ellie.

...but again I have to ask, why the hell is this such a big problem?  If there is something else that was seen in the leaks, then why not take those things with a grain of salt, as ND have said that the leaks werent wholly accurate.  There could have easily been someone intentionally trying to make the game sound bad.

I dunno.  But then again, as someone who played the original 20 years ago, I loved the hell out of the FFVII Remake... If peoplr want to be salty and hate things to hate them, I suppose that's on them.  But hating people for loving who they love?

People arent things.  Dont hate people for such frivolous and trivial reasons.

If the story was the worst ever made, I could just skip the cutscenes. 99.9% of my enjoyment of the first one was from actually playing the game, not watching the movie clips. I don’t even think the story in the first one was all that great, pretty generic. But I’m pumped as hell to play the second one."

Man, it's tough trying to avoid 'politics in games.' Might be easier to stop nitpicking and just enjoy the game. What did gamergaters used to say?

The new trailer with Ellie straggling someone i in favor of this. Others say that after Ellie recovers she does go after Abby but that is the Game Over and it just sets up Ellie as the villain for the next game with Abby still alive. I guess the game will try hard to set up Abby as a good person and the ""homophobic cult"" will probably be used for this as a moral punching bag. !<"

nah. it's an extremely manipulating story because it's a pseudo dilemma: there is no even remotely realistic scenario where you can justify killing an innocent person because of good intentions. At how many people killed would development of a cure be worth it? Even if it's only one person, doctors scooping around an innocent person's brains will always be murder. But you don't even know that it would take one person and you never know that in an remotely realistic scenario it would take one person.

   This is practically anti-gay propaganda as it stands.

1. As I state in my other comment, the devs are totally unconstrained in designing characters, and in Abby they've literally given us a monster. What am I supposed to think about that?

but if there is an extinction event, and you could save humanity as a whole by sacrificing one person, the situation changes.


the thought experiment of saving one, or saving many has been done quite often, and imo there is no correct answer.

thats why i said he is the villain, depending on the point of view.
he might have doomed humanity, and thus is a villain.
at the same time he stood with his morals and protected whats important to him, making him the hero.


he also killed a bunch of scientists and guards though.

gmpto7,2020-05-19,2020-05-20,It is not even a 'cure vs a person's life' dilemma.  They don't have any cure - they just have one person with funny brain chemistry that is somehow immune (or at least highly resistant). And if their first idea is 'let's kill her and root around in her brain' then I doubt they have any researchers competent enough to have even a remote chance to develop a cure.
gmpto7,2020-05-19,2020-05-20,"Oh no, consequences are fine.  Honestly Joel NOT dying would have been unexpected to anyone not currently sucking on their toes..  Storytelling can be pretty simplistic, and people writing for videogames are usually not laureates. You sacrifice the hero character if they have something to die for, especially in a sequel.  I'm just confused why they decided to have the climax from the villains perspective.  The beginning, middle of the story? -cool choice, nice small sequence.  But the whole end?  This is no Empire, it is a video game that people waited 7 years for.  If they have an Expansion in the pipeline, they should announce that now and quell everyone's fears.  If that is coming out in ~1 year then this is actually fucking brilliant, but I highly doubt that.  Imagine generating this much hate and getting to play as Ellie again, it is too genius to be true."

Didn't seem hamfisted to me.  She's a lesbian living her life. If they replaced the girl with a guy this wouldn't even be conversation. It's not like they are preaching equal rights or something like that, it's one minor characteristic of the character. You called this a ""brutal violence on rails experience"", have you played the first last of us? It's pretty violent.

>in Abby they've literally given us a monster. What am I supposed to think about that?

In the leaks it implied that  [Spoiler](/s ""Joel killed her father."") She wanted revenge and she got it. I don't think that makes her monster, but if that's you opinion, why is that a bad thing? Anyone has the capability to be a monster.

I also want to point out that the leak only gave us a vertical slice of the story. We don't know everything that leads to those events. Your opinion of how the characters are handled might be different with the scope of the full story."

gmpto7,2020-05-19,2020-05-20,">in italy they had to decide who gets to live because they were lacking ventilators.

First things first, a bit off topic but this is a proven FALSE story for both Italy and Spain

Secondly, doctors do chose who to treat first in like a car accident incident based on severity, judging who is in most danger and who has more chances to live. 

Both these cases are irrelevant to us because we are not talking about dying people.

> you could save humanity as a whole by sacrificing one person, the situation changes. 

That's why I said the dilemma is a false one and it's just manipulation. There is no situation where killing someone would result in the life of everyone else. How could the doctors know that they would have to kill JUST ONE PERSON before the cure? Literally impossible to know. If anything this means that the doctors actually killed many others previously to get to this point. 

There is no point of view, you cannot kill anyone just to experiment. There is no ""dooming humanity"" because you can't possibly know HOW the cure can be made.

> in the end, there is no actual good or bad in this post apocalyptic world. its everyone for themselves. 

That's nonsense. Of course there is. For example for Josef Mengele, the Nazi's failing WAS the end of the world. That's why he did all the horrific things that he did. You are justifying the same logic."

gmpto7,2020-05-19,2020-05-19,"Not saying for or against anything here, but most of the time, it's because it never feels organic to the situation. It isn't ""A character that happens to be X, Y, or Z"" it's almost always ""HEY LOOK AT THIS CHARACTER THAT IS X, Y, and/or Z!""

A lot of things; movies, games, books, etc. They fall into this trap. They include stuff for the sake of inclusion. Which is fine, but it's going to look and feel bad for people on the outside.

This is especially so for.... oh idk, a game company that fires one of the best game writers in the entire business (who happens to be female) and replaces her with a man who says he wants to empower women in gaming, and proceeds to throw her script and story into the garbage.

That's what ticks me off. Not the character existing, just the fact that the character wasn't intended, and feels shoehorned into a plot that already had a direction before being stripped of it's old identity, and we are left with very little reason why and can only make assumptions.

&#x200B;

Of course there are just some bigoted assholes that just outright hate her because she MIGHT be trans/gay/masculine/whatever. All I know is that even people I hold close to me that are LGBT+ fucking hate this character and the guy who got the original writer kicked off. It's not always about the exact message someone is trying to say, it's WHY and HOW they are trying to get that message across>! and giving our previous main character the same treatment as a golfball in an undignified death by a random AF character is 100% the wrong way, especially since it 1) makes Ellie look weak since she couldn't save Joel, and 2) makes the supposedly ""strong"" female character look weak since she couldn't win fairly!<"

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,No comment on the contents of the list - just wanted to say well done. Clearly lots of work was put into this.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Red dead 1 over red dead 2? And persona 4 that far ahead of persona 5? I love all those games but idk how I feel about that lol.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,What sucks balls after looking to this list is seeing Overwatch 2016 and realizing it's literally the only game on the list that is literally impossible to play anymore. It just... No longer exists... Fuck Blizzard and live service model
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Surprised [the game I love] isn't listed here.  But seriously,  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is wonderful.

Edit: 176 overall. It is redeemed. Although I personally enjoyed it way more than MGSV."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,It's sad there's no C&C :(
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,No MGS2 makes me sad.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Insert this game actually sucks or this game is underrated comment
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Outer Wilds (#67) is my top game of all time. A little indie studio making their first game and it’s amazing to me that it’s got enough of a following to make it to the top 100.  Truly a masterpiece. 
Space exploration mystery game. Think Journey meets Myst. Go into it (and the one DLC) knowing as little as possible.  It’s an experience you can only have for the first time once."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Hold up, is fallout 3 on there and new Vegas isn’t? If so that’s crazy! Or I might be blind"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Cool!


I'm surprised BotW took the top spot... I always felt it lagged just a bit im the end-game. It's cool to see Half-Life 2 so high, that doesn't get enough love.


Ocarina is still my #1."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I didn't realize how old some of these games were. Like, people were being eaten by grues in 77? Wild."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,I just don't get the appeal of Breath of the Wild.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Vampire Survivors sitting at 666 lol.

No Balatro?"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"The fact that Breath of the Wild consistently hits the #1 spot is absurd

It’s not a bad game, but strip away the Zelda branding and people would realize how empty and bland of an open world game it is"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,My fav game of all time is missing. Where is Terraria? I believe its better than overwatch like wtf
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Spelunky let's go!

What a great list of games."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,I see a lot of good games on this list but holy hell I disagree with the ordering of it. Insert unnecessary “everyone has different tastes” comment.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I installed the RPG filter and what I see is that 95% of the games are not RPG or use a couple of stats or perks in their gameplay. ""To the moon"" and stuff, seriously.."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Where is runescape classic with over a million players?
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Breath of the Wild lmao. Give it another 20 years like OoT and then let's see if it's still considered the best game of all time.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I’m genuinely confused how breath of the wild is consistently across the board the best video game in HISTORY. There are so many other titles that were earth shattering for their time when they came out compared to breath of the wild. I also feel like the talk around it died down fairly quickly , and the item damage thing seems to be a pretty big issue with A LOT of people. Not saying it doesn’t deserve a top spot but I just don’t agree with it being so concretely number 1."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Not surprised the persona franchise cracked the top 100. I am surprised that 4 is on there over 5. Both great games tho
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I just spent 15 minutes browsing your site and realized I hadn't even upvoted your post, or left a comment letting you know what an AWESOME resource this is. Bookmarked your site. Will use it frequently."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Seems like the methodology will favor newer *games* because there are more best games of the year lists in recent years. Is there a weighting to list type or some other method of correction for that? 

I'd also be curious to see how much nostalgia affects the ranking. Meaning if you adjust every list ranking by the approximate age of the author, would you see it clump together?"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"There's something truly special about walking out of the shrine for the first time in botw

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,I assume the GOAT FFX is there.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,I just heard about Okami (top 70) yesterday from some random youtube video the algorithm decided to play. Made me smile today that it got on this list. 
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,I never played the last of us so I can hardly judge but it does feel weird to see this being second on such a list.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,All my Bioshock bros should be rejoicing at being #9!!! Feels like a huge honor to be ranked so high amongst all the others
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I was like if The Secret of Monkey Island isent on the list then something is wrong, and there it was at 73. The Secret of Monkey Island is one of the greatest games ever made and probably the greatest point and click adventure game made along side Monkey Island 2 (which is 122). Great to see Grim Fandango on there as well, would have liked Full Throttle also, but you cant get it all. But impressive work and fun to look through."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,I think there is a massive issue with this being only indicitive of how the game was received on release. There is no practical way to measure how well games have aged and/or been updated. It's not like reviewers ever go back and update their reviews.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,I really enjoyed The Last of Us recently which was the remastered version. Solid game all around. #2 all time though? Not a chance.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,How do I get the website to show me the whole list? It only shows the first 100 for me (Firefox on Android)
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I am incredibly unsurprised the list is heavily slanted toward games from a time when people in their late 30’s to early 40’s would be growing up. That age group is the ones often in charge of making these kind of lists, or at least publishing/editing for the publications that produce them. As such, the nostalgia bias toward that era will be incredibly strong. 

Also the heavy Nintendo bias shows the more European and especially North American bias as those consoles were the most successful over here (to the point for many people, “Nintendo” and “video game console” were synonymous in the early adoption days).

Which is exactly the kind of thing a meta analysis like this should produce. This information and data gathering is exceptional and -gorgeously- formatted. I wish I had a resource like this when I was doing research on game history in college."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Am I dumb or can you not view the full 1000 list? It only scrolls down to 100. For anything else you have to apply filters by decade or year.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Great work, OP!"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"While I'm not surprised to see Breath of the Wild hitting number 1 (Not my cup of tea, but Zelda sweep is expected in just about any list honestly, as evidenced by three titles in the top ~~ten~~ eleven), I am surprised that so many people apparently consider The Last of Us to be one of the best games ever created. I mean it's... it's a fine game, top 50 for sure, but #2 of all time?

It's probably the biggest contributor to the overly cinematic slop Sony love to throw out these days"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Am I crazy or is terraria not on the list
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,In no world are BotW and TLoU the two best games of all time
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"This is amazing, obviously.

But I'll be that guy...

I can't fully get behind any list that puts Sonic 3 & Knuckles behind Sonic 1 and 2, or even puts it as low as it is (458th).

BotW over OoT?  Ugh, ok.  But Sonic 1 over Sonic 3?  Just doesn't make sense."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"How is Journey (2012) considered better than Baldurs Gate 3?

No disrespect to Journey of course, but the two games are so far apart from each other in complexity and production quality, and Journey doesn't even have the excuse of being an early video game like Tetris or the Mario games."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,League of legends is the best and worst game
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"It's wild that Minecraft, the overwhelmingly #1 selling game of all time, is #36. It should be top 10, easy."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Having three entries on the top 15 from the Zelda series is crazy cool
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"Your methodology is almost certainly got some issues.

(a) it's incredibly console heavy.  
(b) the highest Civilization is Civ IV, at 94, no Quake, no Elite

That's just some games that spend at least an entire decade at #1-5 on most PC gaming lists for starters."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,I am amazed that the original The Legend of Zelda is not on the list. It is easily a top 10 game in my opinion.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Thanks big bro
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Some games were def skewed by AAA reviewers that haven't stood the test of time. BoTW and GoW 2018 were both terribly mid games with critics ranting and raving about how they looked and felt, rather than the gameplay loop."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,iv played 84 out of the 100
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Nice! But I feel like there's been a sort of a ""grade point inflation"" with more recent games, and I could see the reviewer opinions on games like BotW shifting with time (not just with newer games replacing it on such lists, but older games surpassing it again on such ranking lists)."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,I died a little inside when I saw the top three.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,The data aggregation methodology appears to be flawed; there should be weight given to rankings that align with my opinions. Nintendogs isn't even in the top ten. 
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,It’s missing final fantasy xiv. There’s no way a game I spent 4000 hours in isn’t a top tier game. Please change your list to include this game please. I can’t stop playing it!
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I'm not saying it's wrong, I am just a little confused.

Fallout 3 at 51.

Fallout New Vegas at 153 - more than 100 places worse.

80% of average gamers will tell you that FNV is by far the better, more acclaimed game (I'm one of the 20%, but I am aware of the bias)."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Confirms why I put no value in lists. All subjective though.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Something I'd like to know is where the people who wrote these lists are located. The results can be skewed one way or another depending on what country the writers come from. I imagine there's a lack of lists from Asian countries, for example."

IGN	2019	5	Top 100 Video Games of All Time

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,I love cyberpunk 2077 but it's not on here. I guess if dlc could be on list Phantom liberty would be eligible. Great work!
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,the website is amazing!!! i used the advanced filters to check all the genres i'm interested in on the platforms i have and discovered the most horrifying thing. i have played far too many of these games!
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,FF7 straight disrespect.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Wow that's actually super cool, sometimes with some friends I do the same with not only videogames, even if we don't treat so much information in such a formal way lol. 

Anyway, rating videogames is really tough tho. Final fantasy 7 or halo combat evolved are not even close to be the best entry in the series, still they got the advantage on being the first, value that in videogames tends to be REALLY blurry sometimes. I mean ff7 is not even bad, it did a magistral job creating what it did on PS1, but at the same time, ff9 is just better in everything, but in ""inventing"" the system. On the other hand, most people should agree on the fact that ff6 is somewhat better than ff7 too, even if it a really old style game even compared to PS1 games. Same goes for DOOM, sure it's a legend, but what would a logical human being play today, DOOM or DOOM eternal? It's really complicated if you ask me, even if there are exceptions, like bioshock, cause at least for now, it's not too old but it's still GOAT. Games such as TETRIS are easier to put on top, since the idea lives up to today too, making them more valuable from an artistic POV. 

I'll stop this monologue now I guess, lol."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,I personally think portal 2 should be higher on the list but oh well
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,No Cyberpunk 2077??? I know it had a bit of a rought start but it's one of the best RPGs out there.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,I honestly think this list is super solid. I can't really argue with much of it.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,You misspelled New Vegas.  3 is a strange typo
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Can't argue with the results, but Doom is the best game of all time."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"How can someone do all of this and still end up with a shit list? BOTW the greatest of all time??? It's great, maybe even in the top 10, but definitely not number 1. And Baldur's Gate 3, an objectively better game in many ways, is all the way down in the 40s??? Yikes."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Thank you for this. I don’t get a lot (if any) time to play games so having a list of “greatest” certainly helps me pick something I haven’t played.

I'm surprised that I've not only played, but finished almost all of them. Besides the games you can't actually ""finish"", it's basically the souls games I haven't completed.

I was looking for some like: Space, Crafting, First/Third-person(falls under Shooter?), text-based, etc.

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Very interesting ! 

The breakdown by decade is very relevant. A lot of games ranks higher with nostalgia factor, which removes objectivity out of the rankings concerning the intrinsic quality of the game. 

So to say, pre-2010 3D games feels very clunky in comparison to newer games. Rendering techniques also evolved since and made players used to new standards, making older 3D games visually very obsolete; whereas 2D games had more time to mature and are less reliant on rendering techniques to look appealing. 
Hence I would always advocate to judge games by today’s standards, as today’s standards is ultimately what makes them enjoyable.

Games like Silent Hill 2 and Resident Evil 4 aged quite poorly, whereas Zelda ALTTP for instance looks crispy clean to this day."

Some thoughts/feedback:

Is there enough data to support platform specific lists in the sense that it's based on reviews from sources that are focused on specific platforms?

My thinking here being, for early home computers, a lot of multi-platform games originated on the arcade platform, and could be pretty awful conversions banking on getting sold on the reputations of the original game. Which might be reflected more properly when looking at platform specific critics.

For example when looking at the all time list filtered to only show ZX Spectrum games it shows 38 games. The only game from the developer [**Ultimate Play The Game**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Play_the_Game) (before they became known as Rare and did a little game called Golden Eye) is ranked at 26. UPTG (great games, horrible name) being perhaps one of the most premiere developers for the ZX Spectrum (and me being a Commodore 64 user knowing about this says a lot for those who where around at the time of that specific platform war:) makes me think that list might have looked different when viewed through the lens of lists focused on that specific platform.

I might be wrong and/or I might not have expressed myself clearly, just a thought.

A couple of other suggestions:

It would be nice if all items in the lists where numbered after their place on that specific list (like for a search result), and not only the place on the overall list.

On the **About** page on the site, you should add a link to this post (and any future ones... or past one too for that matter). And other relevant/significant places where discussions about this work of yours (and the ones that helped you) happens:)"

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"It would be great to do an analysis of the authors of these lists based on which games they have not played. Like, the over-representation of Nintendo generally I feel reflects that they are a family-friendly brand with broad appeal, who have huge market share due to extremely effective branding and marketing. A lot of people might play little or nothing other than Nintendo games. Similarly, how many reviewers play entirely on consoles and have little experience of PC-only games?

Which is no surprise, due to its lack of marketing budget, limited copies and its forgotten nature - it was right at the end of the dying Sega Saturn and even though it had high critical acclaim, almost no one got to play it. Probably the best soundtrack, too. Look up its ratings and you’ll be surprised. It’s very close to Zelda Ocarina of Time regarding those. It basically needs to be on this list.

Man this list is like time warping me. I see games and I'm like that wasn't too long ago. Chrono trigger I bought from a drug dealer when for 10 bucks when I was a teenager. Probably middle school. As for the list. I was counting them off from the top, I've played about 28 of 50 of those games (stop counting at around 50) as I was growing up.  I kind of feel lucky to have been able to experience these games as they came out or were fairly recently new. 

From my experience,  I dont feel too good about games going forward. As it's probably age, but I don't feel games have excited me enough to go out and play it. I thought I was done buying consoles when the ps4 came out but them metal gear solid 5 was announced and I went to go purchase my ps4. Nothing has really called out to me with the ps5. I really wanted to play the demons souls remake, but I've played the original and I understand what it is now. But as to why I don't feel good about games, it's the microtransactions thing. Like of course I'm wrong, because great games have come out like baldurs gate 3 and elden ring. But I feel like it won't be like the frequency that this list has shown. Like this list has shown that 99 has the most top games of all time. I'd figure 98, or I think 07 was the greatest time for games. 

Just growing up during these past 3 decades for games, had truly been amazing if people who experienced it look back on it. 

I guess, it was a time where we had a game and usually we had to stick with that game and it became great. Now, there are so many options to play games and or transactions Mar a game that it's kind of easy to look past modern day games or get bored of them quickly."

I would like to point out though, for people considering this list for playing good games from older times, that these kind of lists based on reviewers tend to miss niche or games considered iconic. They also tend to favor console games, specially Nintendo.  

For example, Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun is an excellent stealth RTS, but it's too niche to appear.  
Similarly, iconic games like Thief never get mentioned.  
Even games like Fallout New Vegas, that's liked by hardcore Fallout fans doesn't even make it to the list.

There's also on occasions a disconnect between reviews and gamers. Most recent example is latest Elden Ring DLC that got great reviews but got a mild reception from the people (currently 71%, mostly positive in Steam)."

As a Mega Man fanatic, I find it very interesting that the only Mega Man game in the top 100 is by far the easiest one of the original series. I guess it makes sense that it was more accessible to the general public than the rest of those games. Though the X series was quite accessible, but I guess they didn't have the cultural impact as the original series."

Being the best game of 2007 shouldn't have too heavy of a weight on overall rating to put it in the top 10."

I'm from Poland, so for years a Sony bastion, and we still haven't got an official Nintendo support. Their stuff is sold here through middle men. They make great games and all. But why are such simple games as Mario and Zelda considered one of the best games ever in the west? Like, no way M64 is better than RDR II 💀 it's got to be crowd nostalgia of some sort."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I would be interested (but not knowledgeable enough to figure out myself) how many of those game came from true Indie studios. Maybe about 10% of that list?

I have been wondering this because I have been thinking lately about how much marketing plays into games, music, books, etc. Look at Tetris for example, it became a mega hit purely because of its gameplay. The fact that it was so good that it managed to escape the USSR to become a global phenomenon seems to me, that in terms of pure gameplay, that it would be #1.

The other 9 on the top 10 list, and the vast majority of the games in the top 100, were all good games, but they were also games that had millions and millions of dollars in promotion. How many games, books, movies, songs, etc. are out there somewhere that would completely blow away what we think of as ""the best"" but simply did not have the right marketing behind them. Do we think the Zelda games are great because they are great, or do we think they are great because we were TOLD they were great when in fact they were just okay but we didn't want to be the ones who disagreed with what everyone else SUPPOSEDLY thinks of the games."

Considering you mention you want this website / ranking to be taken seriously, and also mention it has rigorous metholody.

Is there a source for the ranking/methodology? It's hard to take something like this at face value in any statistically relevant capacity without thorough insights into the methodology, algorithms, and scoring used. Your website doesn't seem to go into detail on this either. It would go a very long way to not have this ranking be essentially a black box that cannot be peer-verified.

Having the data set easily available, i.e. a one-click download of sheets/database files/etc... would also help with this, and further help open research into this."

My interpretation, if I may share a half-baked thought: there's not a lot of indie games, it looks like if you want to get to the top, you need to go AAA. Game journalists seem to be biased towards big productions (this begs a question: what it really means that a game is ""the best"" - which is of course, impossible to define with a single definition, or impossible to define at all)"

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"Ignoring my subjective opinion that Chrono Trigger is the greatest of all, there are some objective issues with this aggregated list and the method used to construct it:

*  The people who make these individual 'greatest' lists have not played *all* the games listed here, which is the only possible way to have a completely fair evaluation.
* Recency bias is a *major* issue in subjective ordering like this, especially ones that span decades. This makes older titles rank lower down the list.
* Newer lists should NOT be favoured more. No reasoning is given for this and it incorrect to apply random favour here. The reason for this is that there is a type of reporting bias present - many modern reviews are paid/sponsored reviews which raises their scores artificially, meaning recent scores are usually higher than older scores. This means newer lists should be penalised, not favoured.
* The second reporting bias here is also accounted for incorrectly - there are simply more reporters today than in 1990 (for example). A game may get 5 reviews then and 50 now. This means frequency is not a metric to gauge success, and the fact it has been used as such means the output is distorted not minimally but significantly towards modern games.

All in all, cool post but there are some severe statistics issues that make this list less accurate than it could be."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I don’t think it’s possible to come up with a greatest games of all times. There’s some imbalance between how much innovation and lasting influence some early games brought (Super Mario Bros, A Link to the Past, DOOM…) and the sheer production value, and sales volume, of later games. It’s really apples to oranges. It’s already hard enough to agree on the best game in a year, conceptually there could be a consistent way to look at a decade in gaming but anything longer is not meaningful."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"What I'm most surprised at is that Fallout 3 is 102 places *higher* than Fallout New Vegas, even though most Fallout fans consider FNV far superior to F3, if not the best Fallout game."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Fascinating. It's been years since I did serious stats and this is tempting me. First thing I notice is that the decades distribution approaches a standard curve. Why is that? 

It's because not many people have played really old games or really new games in comparison to games that came out several years ago. I bet if you plot the age of the gamers rating these games, it'll follow the same distribution. I'm not sure how you can account for this situation to get a more accurate list of ""best."""

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"The correct answer is always Chrono Trigger. One of its biggest advantages is that it never turned into 20 sequels and 10 spinoffs like every other successful new IP RPG of its time.

Since nowadays it’s just a popularity contest based on how big the IP is Chrono Trigger will lose to the 50 metroid or zelda games that exist."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,I love that LOZ made so many entries in this list and the number of indie games like undertale also is so cool. One person can really change the world :O

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"The decade distribution is basically a normal map, or, a Gaussian distribution.

This heavily implies that the games rankings are based on the age of the list writers.

For instance, if you favor newer lists, ppl who are ~40 now (likely to have prominent writing positions), were in there early teens to late teens during the 90s and 00s.

That heavily implies this list is basically the writer's nostalgia.

If you do this again on 10yrs, I'd fully expect the 80s and 90s to drop off, and the 2010s+ to bump up. 

That's not even a guess, it's almost a certainty. Since the decade distribution is just a normal distribution."

And there were so many other games that were sitting at the top, and I could sort of understand why you wouldn't downvote them, but on the other hand, they're not one of the best games on the platform."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"This site is another reminder of why I think the way we classify and categorize games is completely broken. Take a quick guess what are the top games with ""Turn-based strategy"" and then check with advanced filters. We mix descriptors for theme, setting and narrative with terms used for mechanics, structure and interface. Few of the terms are so generic they can apply to almost any game, while few are so specific its hard to find examples outside of specific series. Most games are assigned genres that they only have very minor overlap with. Some genres have significant overlap and things that separate them might be meaningless, while there are subgroups that have meaningful dividing factors."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,No knock on Witcher 3... but it cannot be understated just how universally loved games like Mario 3 or Mario Kart were.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"Seems like you could've just looked at some super shallow IGN top 10 list or whatever which I guess is all this is an aggregate of but it misses out on some of the best games of all time for top 100. Like Halo 2 for example despite getting CE/3 of which neither had the same impact. This is important because Halo 2 basically had a full on chokehold on xbox live until late 2007 despite not even being on the current latest generation while sitting atop the list at the end and its the reason most matchmaking/lobby/friends/dashboards lists look the way they do today on services like xbox live or just games in general. When a game that was one of the most enjoyed/played of all time on top of being something that visibly changed the gaming industry doesn't make the top 100 but the secret of monkey island does it kind of exposes how seriously anyone should ever take these things. There probably aren't 20 games all time to have that much impact. This one in particular is an indictment being delivered to gaming media/journalism

There's also games like oldschool runescape that silently prove their worth via people actually playing and enjoying them and for whatever reason they aren't on the list despite heavily outperforming almost the entire top 100 for actual decades. You can tell the lists you're pulling the information from are kind of not really plugged into what players are really doing and its just some journalist typing out their feelings. 

There's also the super questionable picks for top 100 like Outer Wilds. I got that game for free to play and its not a *bad* game but lol it is certainly not a top 100. That shit is totally gassed up by marketing worth a play though"

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"There's a major recency bias and console bias to these lists. How old do these lists get? I expect a list made in 1999 ranking the 90s would look quiet different from one made 10-20 years later looking back at the 90s, for example. 

Additionally, there's a large number of influential and/or financially or critically successful PC, handheld, and mobile games that simply don't seem to get any visibility in favor of whatever the AAA flavor of the month game is.

For instance, if I sort your site by 4X genre, it's largely dominated by Civilization games, and not even the better ones. Civ IV is not the best game in the franchise by a long shot, certainly not better by 200 spots than Civ V and definitely not better by 400 spots than Alpha Centauri, which is an extremely influential game in the 4X space. The list doesn't even include Master of Orion 2, which has an entire cottage industry of MoO2 clones due to just how much it defined the Space 4X genre.

I feel like the only thing this list really captures is the relatively recent zeitgiest of what's popular."

I am a big Zelda fan, but I personally think BOTW was one of the weakest Zelda games. It was like a proof of concept open-world game where they tacked on Zelda IP and assets, then called it good. It is one of the weakest open-world games I have played and didn't feel like a Zelda game at all. There were no dungeons, no item unlocks, no exploration opened up by said items, etc. The shrines were tech demos with a puzzle added, and nothing Zelda-like about them. I just don't understand the appeal and accolades it got. The sequel was better and had more Zelda-like qualities, but it still does feel like any of the other games in the franchise. I understand trying to break the mold and change it up, but you can't just drop all the elements that made the franchise good."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,KOTOR at 47 is way too low imo
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"the last of us being 2nd skyrim being 10th and especially outer wilds not even being on the list makes me question the taste in games of those rankers really hard. I'm a big skyrim fan, I know all the lore, but seriouly, the tenth best game of all time? I would not give it higher than 15 and I'm a fan of the game. Outer wilds not being in the top 10 is shocking"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"If you put a pile of shit in a game box with Zelda written on top of it, the reviewers would give it 10/10 even before opening it."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,I've played 46/100. Phew. If it was over 50 I feel like I would've wasted a good chunk of my life.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"This list is really nice and what to expect if you know the games. The problem with those lists is that it's mostly about the best games at the time. I very much liked A Link to the Past when I was a kid, but it just doesn't offer much nowadays.

I'd find it more interesting if certain games were swapped with arguably better versions or very similar games that offer about the same experience but with a modern touch.

Like I'd say Doom Eternal 2020 should be swapped with Doom 1993 or Super Mario Kart with the 64 version or even a more recent one."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Bro the new Zelda games are so garbage. I stopped reading after the first entry
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Elden Ring in 23 completely invalidates that list for me
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,RDR2 at #42. You fucked up somewhere. Cool nonetheless
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,GTA 4&5 are not more fun to play compared to 3/Vice/San….just technically more advanced…but not more fun
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"To me this list shows that you should not care for any games ranking lists and make up your own mind. Tetris should not be near the top100, unlike smb1"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,FF and zelda series are so god damn overrated lol
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Red Dead 2 not even in top 20? Joke list
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Fnv/2’s placement is a crime
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Sorry but this whole list is subjective depending on region and peoples preference.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,it's hard to take the data seriously when the greatest game of all time is an 8 out of 10.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"No offence to your work, but this is probably the most generic list of ""best games"" I have ever seen. It's like a re-re-rehashed IGN ""best games of all time"" list that has been streamlined through hundreds of iterations. The resulting list is more like a ""statistically most popular games of all time"". The top of the list includes a slew of popular 7/10 games imo, but very few true masterpieces are found near the top of this list.

The historics are quite interesting, I guess.

>all of the big gaming publications have the maximum reputation score

I feel like this is a big mistake."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Botw was boring
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Love the statement about Palestine on the website ❤️
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,I'd throw Vandal Hearts in the ring there
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Red dead 2 being so low on the list makes me sad
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,The Last of Us at number 2 basically just announced this a bad list.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Very interesting but

Elden Ring and GTA 5 only 23 & 25 is objectively hilarious."

Also minecraft at 36 is tough"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,I cannot understand why people like Zelda games so much. 🤣
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"Zelda BoTW ?? It s an ok game but completely overrated.

Plot is zeldishly ok, graphics are decades late, wolrd is empty with close to no decors, some mechanism are interesting

How would this make ofnthis game the number 1 lol wtf"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,That tells you how fucking bad these lists are when crap like that is top.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,No shot in hell BotW belongs about Half-Life 2.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Tetris being number 3 makes no sense to me
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Dogshit list, not even surprised."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Why isn’t csgo at #1 ?
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Sorry, that's not explained very well. It means that, as you go through the list, starting from the highest rated game, what's the first year/decade to have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 etc. games on the list. So, ""6. 1990s"" means that the 1990s is the first decade to have six games on the list (then I have listed all of the games). It's essentially a measure of which years/decades sew the release of a lot of particularly highly acclaimed games. I hope that makes it a little clearer."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"2007 is similarly crazy

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"The way 2004 was so iconic for my gaming taste for the next 8 years with Fable, Halo 2, Wow and to a lesser extent but the most memorable sims game for me and how the first 3 series just dominated my life until I was 18"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,The year of the 2's and 3's.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,i am still maintaining the opinion that the day bloodlines released was the single worst release date in the history of video games - for like half a dozen reasons.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,The Links awakening remake is 5 years old.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"It's a WiiU release, mate. Yes, it's old."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Crazy that a 23yr old is now 30
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"GabeN love this for sure, I have so many games on steam I don't have time to play... Thanks for the list and the impending fomo...

yeah thanks that's actually useful!"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"It really is nice work. I'd like to see the list weighting older lists instead of newer ones, though, just to see how that might change the rankings.

I would think there would be fewer older lists, covering fewer gamers, and weighting in their favor would put them even in weight to newer lists -- of which I assume there's far more."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,It’s brilliant.  I want to argue with certain rankings but I feel that I can’t.   This is the closest we can get to truly objective rankings.  
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I find it interesting post 2020 we have a drop off of games making it into top 1000 or top 100. 

I saw a phrase on Reddit that AAA games are now “corporate games”. Designed with microtransactions in mind, battle passes, fomo, live service, loot boxes, and all the other garbage we hate. 

We still have good games without this stuff… like Elden ring and tears of the kingdom, but they are fewer and farther between."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Uniroinically I kinda agree with #1.

2 though? It's not even Naughty Dog's best game."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Top 100 lists aren’t the top 100 best games there a mix of popularity , actual quality and most importantly nostalgia . Because of this stuff like Nintendo games rank very highly and stuff like crpg often don’t get on the list at all as while both are incredibly good and had an important impact on the gaming industry , Nintendo games just have more nostalgia to them and are less niche ."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I feel like something weird is happening with the Last of Us. Certainly have seen it in top 10 on many many lists, but never two or even top 3.

There's legitimately dozens of games that deserve that spot more than Last of Us, in my opinion obviously."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I also figured TOTK would be higher considering BOTW was number 1, solely for the innovation."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Factorio isn't even in my database. That means it's yet to appear on a single list. Yes, I'm surprised by that too."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Games that only appeal to a certain brain but that REALLY nail their intended demographic would be an excellent video essay idea.

Factorio essentially kickstarted the genre of automation games off the back of mods for other games, and they have done nearly everything right. 

They had to custom build an engine because the things they wanted to do weren't generic game development principals and boy it paid off insanely well. 

A masterpiece of a game, amazing developers, and the closest you can get to  experiencing hard drugs but with a video game."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Same. Lists like this tend to overrepresent popular games, simply because fewer reviewers will know about them."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I missed Portal as well. This game is excellent. I feel like I didn't see Doom either? 


I am going to acknowledge the effort but ignore the results."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Same. It's a masterpiece. I haven't been that emersed in a game since ff7 when I was a kid.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"I can’t be the only one who’s attempted to do something similar in the past so kudos to u/IlmeniAVG for not only making this happen, but for also taking the time to explain their methodology."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I think probably the merging of all time vs. end of decade vs. end of year lists is likely responsible for this. I assume there's some biasing here going on that isn't really getting well accounted for.

> In total there are 98 all time lists, 51 end of decade lists, ~570 end of year lists

The time frames of the ""all time"" ones significantly impact which of those will be available, and the volume of end of year lists has changed over time. 

Also there's some odd inclusion of ranked vs. unranked lists that probably make the data hard to calculate. Some of the ""game of the decade"" lists like the ""CoG’s Top 20 Games of the Decade"" omit RDR2 entirely, which strikes me as super odd.

Would say there's gonna be a lot of noise created by lists that weren't entirely created with this in mind. Ars Technica's GotY list sure reads a lot like an unordered list other than their winner being called out as 1st as Celeste. But they put RDR2 at 11th while still saying, ""Red Dead Redemption is one of the best games of the decade, and its sequel bests it in every way."" Yet rank it behind F1 2018. I'd imagine there's a fair bit of this type of thing going on. (And given OPs note that losing against lower ranked games is a penalty, could skew things quite a bit.)

Probably trying to make an ordered list out of this data is extremely hard and maybe even a lost cause. May have been better to try to group things into tiers based on breakpoints in the aggregate numbers rather than a pure ranked list.

Really appreciate the effort from OP but without being able to see the calculations or numbers, it's hard to figure out some of the oddities."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,">Red dead 1 over red dead 2?

yeah that struck out to me the most as well, i dont care about how it compares to other games but rdr2 is objectively better in every single way"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,CS:GO is technically available still but only by switching to the demo viewer in the CS2 steam properties plus all the core online features were removed so it's almost the same situation.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I haven’t checked myself but there’s something called “Overwatch 1 Emulator.” It’s a discord server that has its own skill rating system and creates 12 man custom game pick up groups on a Workshop-made OW emulation, basically the original OW heroes each as they were at the end of OW."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"I actually have nostalgia for overwatch 2016 which is crazy to me, there was just something about that time where I could play for hours just enjoying myself."

* No ""Osu!"" (instead ""Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan"" makes the list but guess which one shows up if you search for ""Osu!"")
* Or ""Taiko no Tatsujin""
* Or ""Rhythm Heaven""
* Or ""Mai Mai""
* DJ Hero ranks higher than Beatmania
* DDR ranks absurdly low considering it's not just a cult classic but one of *the* classic music games and is still getting updates (DDR is going strong after 25+ years, while e.g. Reflec Beat lasted about 7 years, Wacca only 4)

I don't even like Osu! but it should absolutely rank higher than most of the music games on the list."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"Outer Wilds is so amazing, and I think the fact that it has a relatively small following compared to almost any game on this list while still showing up this much and anecdotally getting recommended so much says enough about it

For those interested in playing it, if you have any questions before or during the game, go to r/outerwilds, not google. The people over there are good about answering questions. It's a safe, spoiler-free environment and people like answering questions over there about anything relating to the game. Easily the best place on the internet to ask about it."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"BoTW at top spot is a bit galling. Just not a game that oozes originality out of every pore. 


Even if not best overall, Outer Wilds deserves that top 2019 spot many times over. And honestly, a top 10 overall finish would be deserved IMO. "

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I don't get it either. I very quickly got tired of the world being empty, full of the same enemies and having to swap broken weapons way to often"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I think its one of those games where your frame of mind makes a difference to the experience. I first picked it up on the switch, gave it a few hours then left it because it didnt seem that interesting

I didnt touch it again for 4-5 years

Then on a whim i decided to pick it up again because the wife was away on work for a couple of weeks. Loved it. 

If you go into it thinking “i need to level this skill, upgrade my gear, max out this stat” etc then it doesnt make for a great game. But if you instead take it as something to explore then its absolutely great. 100’s of mini puzzles, dozens of mini dungeons. Quests to find, secrets to discover, then its far more enjoyable. 

This ironically is why i wasnt bowled over by tears of the kingdom. Its largely the same people, same places. I already knew where i was going. The underground area was dull and the cloud areas are sparse and repetitive.

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I disagree on the branding part. I hadn't played a Zelda game since NES in the mid-80s, so I have no attachment to the brand at all. I found the world to be really engaging, though it did take a few tries to get into it. With that said, it ain't no RDR2 in terms of an open world being jam packed with things to do and see. Much different objectives (specifically creativity and exploration)."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Great game, even a classic. Best game of all time? Nowhere close."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"It's Ubisoft Zelda. Feels like a Far Cry game to me (a polished one to be sure, but just super repetitive). 

Enjoyable enough, but feels like a 7.5-8/10 type of game to me. Wouldn't crack my top 10 games that I've played in the last 5 years, let alone of all time."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"With the exception of a few of the gameboy games (never had a gameboy color/advance), I've played every single Zelda game, starting from the original on the NES.

Zelda Breath of the Wild is a good game, but its not really a Zelda game. Its certainly Zelda themed, and they nailed the aesthetic, but the overall game play felt generic and empty. The durability mechanic is almost universally loathed, and I feel like the dungeons (the highlight of a Zelda game) were awful and poorly put together. To make up for this, you get 100 miles of open empty fields with the same dozen enemies in different colors.

I'm not surprised its on the list, I am just disappointed its above 10th place. Maybe there's some kind of nostagia googles people have it for it, similar to OOT? Although to be fair, OOT was probably one of the greatest games ever made when it came out."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I would consider myself a hardcore gamer, playing dozens of new games per year. Mostly single player or pve types. It confuses me why every critic had this games nuts in their mouths. I tried it twice and couldn’t make it past the 2/3 mark. It’s so bland and boring. I remember when it came out, you would have thought Christ returned and made this game. It’s not bad but it’s like a 7. Have heard the masterpiece and GOAT title slapped on it too many times online."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"This is why I think it’s crazy that people say that  BotW is better than TotK. 

They’re essentially the same game, just TotK filled up BotWs empty world with a ton of *stuff*"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I mean, if it's consistently rated #1, then it can't be. Enough people love it that it reaches #1 multiple times"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"It always amazes me how stacked these lists get towards Nintendo games. 


I seem to be surprisingly alone in this. Like a lot of people I've been a hardcore gamer since I was a wee child, but we were a Megadrive family, then PS1, then PC. No NES/SNES/Gamecube here. 


I've then had an undercurrent of consoles along side PC, but it's been PS2, 360, PS3/4/5. 



Literally never had a Nintendo console. Not even a gameboy. The only flirting I did with handheld gaming was a PSP."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Exactly what I think as well. If someone told me that’s their Goat game I would never listen to their gaming opinion again.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Straight up not true
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,I think all modern Nintendo games are heavily overrated.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"A lot of nintendo defender in the comments, but you're right because it's just not a good game. It was just good enough at a time when the switch was coming out. I have my own personal distastes about it, but in general it's just a boring ass game in a big empty world"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"It seems like a lot of the top games in this list are there because of story or theme/‘vibe’ and not really because they are doing anything super awesome from a gameplay perspective (there are some in there that do, obviously, and obviously that’s pretty subjective)"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I think a big part of it is that it isn't meant to be played to completion. It's meant to be played enough to beat. From that perspective it will appeal more to people who spend less time pouring into each game, either because they play more games, or just have less time to play. Even still it's a systems rich game that has depth if you're the type willing to speed run, or hunt for unconventional solutions.  
  
I can certainly get being disappointed in it, but not every game can be for everyone for hundreds of hours. BotW is great for a lot of people for 20-40, and good to some for hundreds."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"It's the same reason that Budweiser sells exponentially more than a craft brew... at some point being the best is about some appeal to the least common denominator, having mass branding and distribution, etc.   

All of that matters just as much as being the objective #1 highest quality, best version of something.  Heck, I still meet people who think Halo invented the FPS and is the best possible version in that genre... it isn't, it never was, it just had a casual accessible appeal with the might of Microsoft backing it."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"I've enjoyed every Zelda game except for BotW, I had to force myself to finish it. It's just like with Halo Infinite, a mediocre open world that isn't as good as well designed levels. 

I hate the fact that due to it's popularity, we'll never be seeing a classic styled Zelda game again..."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"Can't remember another game that I lost interest in as fast as BotW. Long time Zelda fan, remember being a kid and my mom helping me beat the NES titles and then being able to beat A Link to the Past by myself. Loved Zelda, BotW just didn't feel like Zelda to me. And didn't feel like a strong open world RPG either. Baffled how it could be in the top 10, much less #1."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"Its on Switch, its Nintendo, it gets played by 20 million normies who all think its the best because they've only played Candy Crush and Lego Star Wars"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,It hits #1 because people overwhelmingly love it. It's not that hard to understand.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"No, it deviated from the idea YOU had of the ""Zelda brand"", but it's still a Zelda game.
It's clearly not perfect for sure, the formula could (and I hope it will be) improved on many points, but not seeing the quality in certain aspects, the will to innovate, to offer a game with great freedom, creativity, diversified gameplay with emerging mechanics etc, is quite incomprehensible imo.

This is the type of open world we need to go towards, more interactive and organic worlds with a lot of créative ways for the players to go through"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"You took the words right out of my mouth. It is absolutely criminal that people say BOTW is a better game than Half Life 2. I bet over 50% of the people who even voted in these aren't old enough to even appreciate just how revolutionary the Half Life series were let alone play them.

The Nintendo fanboyism has to stop. The world/story of BOTW was bland and had questionable design decisions that negatively impacted gameplay such as weapon durability. It isn't a bad game it just is nowhere near the #1 game of all time spot. It's so exhausting always seeing fanboyism taint these lists every time."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"This is why I think it’s crazy that people say that  BotW is better than TotK. 

They’re essentially the same game, just TotK filled up BotWs empty world with a ton of *stuff*"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Elden Ring was a far better Zelda game than BotW
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"There's nothing special about the Zelda branding. If you take away nostalgia goggles, they're not good games. They're just simple puzzlers with negligible difficulty."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I'm surprised that it's not there as well. It gets talked about a lot, but it doesn't show up on lists for some reason. Perhaps that will change in the future, who knows."

If you're feeling challenged or invalidated by this list then you're taking it the wrong way.

Your opinion is still your opinion, worth as much to you today as yesterday.

This list is something that's intriguing and fascinating to look at but it's not meant to be THE objective truth and measure of quality. That is something that isn't possible with subjective media in any circumstances."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"The rankings of recent games are bound to be unstable. Baldur's Gate 3 could move up very easily if it does well on the next few lists, whereas Journey's position should be fairly stable for now."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Was a way better game at launch. Everything being min maxed and everyone knowing all the details and macro techniques makes it a very stressful game like starcraft 2.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"And Terraria is in the top 10 selling games of all time, but doesn't even break 100 on this list. Though that's a bit different since it's been on sale for as low as $2 before. I still think it deserves to be in the top 100 though, and I do agree Minecraft should be higher as well.

Honorable mention to Wii Sports, the 4th best selling game which isn't in the top 100 on this list (but realistically most of those sales are because it was bundled with the Wii lol)"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I don't know of any publications that require a specific kind of release (physical/online) in order to be eligible, so I believe that is a minor issue. As for games that had issues upon release, but which have been improved with patches, that's another story. The short answer is that such games are probably underrated for now. That will fix itself over time as more lists come in, but to fix it in the moment would be extremely tricky. I have some ideas for how it might be possible, but it's not a priority for now."

Tactics is my second favorite ff game. I've still never gotten around to playing 4, I will sometime. Barely played 13, no 15 at all yet. Weirdly I've been getting back into 2d rpg's, but not the actual classics, I actually prefer more modern indie games made in the style of the classics."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I love RDR2, but I think its problems warrant it being lower on this list. I could see how the game's length and the repetitive shootout segments in the later acts would turn people off of it."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"One of the sources for the list seems to be ""Best of the Year"" lists, and of course CP77 launched too late in its year and in far too bad a state to make it onto such lists. And of course the game's redemption arc doesn't help much unless it was formally re-released and re-reviewed later on (maybe in ten years when it gets a remaster and comes auto-packaged with *Phantom Liberty*).

Although having said that, both *No Man's Sky*, which had some of the same problems, and *Starfield*, which hasn't even really started its redemption arc yet (but at least worked, more or less), are on the list, which feels weird if CP77 is not."

It's no. 153.

Which makes no sence if Fallout 3 is no. 51, since New Vegas is clearly the better game."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"A lot of it is nostalgia but a lot of it is also how good the game was at the time it was released. Sure, by today's standards you can't compare M64 with RDR2. But in the time that M64 released it was an absolutely incredible game that influenced many many games after that. RDR2 kinda just took already existing concepts and just executed them super well but M64 was a ground breaker. There were a ton of open-world shooters by the time RDR2 released, this was just the best of them. There weren't a lot, if any, 3D platformers by the time M64 released though.

Same goes for games like Half-Life 2 or the original Doom for example. Playing it today the game isn't anything amazing. But back then? It was like nothing we've ever seen before."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"You kind of had to be there.  By today's standard, SM64 is janky and weird, but it really changed what we thought games could be.  Simply being 3D and being able to go in any direction was jaw-dropping in 1996.  There was nothing else like it."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I dunno I actually think you could have an argument about this. I have seen some video essays about rdr2 and how often if you don't do exactly what the game wants you to in missions it swats your hand and says ""No! do it the way **I** want you to"" for even the smallest things. It's on the surface supposed to be this open world game where you creatively approach problems but you get told by the game no do it this way.

Compared to the design of mario 64 which is a 3D platformer you leap and jump around in. Ye it's not exactly an open world there are distinct levels but you are capable of doing what you expect to be able to. I think as far as following the apparent game design goals they outwardly present mario 64 succeeds far more than RDR2"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"My 2 cents is that they’re in the same boat as Pixar movies, where they make content for kids, but it’s REALLY polished, and also has enough bits thrown in to keep adults engaged and enjoying it. They have huge mass appeal and are good at it."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"It's a good question. I think it's a combination of their games being easy to pick up, easy to complete/progress, with some room for mastery. Gaming journalists strike me as people who see that as indicative of an amazing game. I grew up playing the major N64 games that are seen as the greatest of all time on this list. I never thought they were that amazing, even as a kid. It was strange when I went on game forums and saw them being given 10/10s and the best games of all time. Among my friend group who games, it's the same. it sometimes feel like a psyop, but I accept people have different tastes than me."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Mario 64 was revolutionary when it came out.  Someone fact check me, wasn't it one of the first 3D free roaming semi non linear games?"

I'm sure critics are doing their best, but it's far from a perfect industry, and it would be naïve to think that it's not being swayed at least a little by massive marketing budgets. This is why I try to avoid telling people that there's a single, correct way to interpret the list. If one person sees it as a definitive greatest games list, another sees it as definitive proof that critics have no idea, and another sees is as definitive proof of the power of marketing budgets, I'm OK with all of that."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"All of the biggest gaming publications, IGN included, have the highest possible reputation score. The reputation scores are based mostly on how confident I can be that someone on their staff has actually played the main contenders for their lists, with my main source for that being how many reviews they have on Metacritic (15k in IGN's case--more than good enough). IGN pretty easily passes all of my other checks too (e.g. being considered a ""reliable source"" by the Wikipedia editors), so it would be hard to justify anything other than full marks."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,How do does that invalidate an aggregation?
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"There's like 30 comments saying the same thing haha. Though, to be fair, I think people would complain about no#1 no matter what it was. You can't please everyone."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-16,"Fallout NV and Fallout 4 are both there, just not in the top 100. NV is 153rd and 4 is 225th. And, a quick glance at how many all time lists they've appeared on should explain why: Fallout 3 has appeared on 32 all time lists whereas Fallout NV is on just 9, and Fallout 4 had only made 1."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Objectively, Half Life 1 is a mess. In the Xen levels, two different jump pads on the same level can be running entirely different code because Valve hadn't figured out quality control by then."

If I did, then they would cannibalise each other's mentions, resulting in them all being massively underrated. There might be some tricky way to get around this, but it's not a priority at the moment."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,It is! It's 84th.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Very much so. I'm bothered by this, but it's hard to find non-English lists (if they even exist) as someone who only speaks English :( I really hope this will get better as time goes on."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"When did you first play it? 
What don't you like?
PC or console?"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Why? It is one of the most influential games in history, dude. It bridged the gap between casual gamers and old arena shooter nerds like me. Was a good sci-fi game. Great fps that anyone could pick up and play. And it was simple(straightforward) mechanically. 


It's hard to really express how much hype was around Halo 2 because of Halo. And just mow much influence Halo 1-3 had on the industry. Halo 3 remains one of the best times in online gaming because of Halo. The first couple seasons of Apex is the only thing that's comes close imo. "

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I like puzzle games, I played the new version of Myst which was released on Steam a few years ago after hearing so many good things about this game and... well I really didn't find it that's incredible.
I can't put it in the context of the time and I know that the game was important, but today I find it quite poor as a game. It's not ""bad"", but it's very average imo in comparison to many other puzzle games which offer a much better constructed and coherent whole.

I haven't done Riven, I plan to do it but if it's in the same style I might probably not like it much"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I love Myst. It's currently 158th, so there are definitely critics out there who rate it very highly."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Not really outer wilds is great but it’s a niche Indie game. Skyrim was a cultural phenomenon up there with the likes of halo 3.

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"The position of recent games is a lot more unstable than older games. I don't know which way you want it to move, but both directions are possible (I think it's more likely to move up, personally, unless the DLC significantly changes people's perspective)."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I agree, shouldn't even be on the list."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I played a few hours of RDR2 and felt more like I was watching a badly paced TV show than playing a video game. The graphics were good, and I guess it gets better later on, but overall it wasn't really my kind of game I guess."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,So you're saying it's all opinion? 🤔
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"The point of the project is to be an accurate reflection of games media. The result was bound to be generic, because at the end of the day all I've really done is taken an average. I understand that's not what everyone wants to see, but I think making a definitive ""greatest"" games list isn't something you can do with a mathematical formula. Computers are ill suited for that task. It's too personal. Too human. You'll notice that I'm careful not to say that these games are necessarily the ""best"" or ""greatest"", only that they're the most critically acclaimed. Whether or not they deserve that is up to you."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Thank you friend :)
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"No doubt.

What gets me is that this is a ""best games of all time"" list.

A game with one of the worst combat systems out of any AAA game to date is taking up a place at number 6.

Like, come on.

In order to be one of the best games of all time, it has to be a good game first."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Thanks I also didn't get it hehe. Now it's a bit clearer
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Sorry I still don't understand. What do you mean by the +2, +6, etc. For instance, what does 3. 2010s +6 mean? Thank you!"

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"If you think that's crazy, i'm 36 years old."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,I know technically it's a Wii U release but I know very few people who played on Wii U and it was more or less a Switch launch title.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Hypothetical 23 year old, right?"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Weighting older lists doesn't make any sense, because less games were published when that list came out.

When you compare ""all time greats"" lists against each other and look at a list from 1999, then it's no surprise to see only titles from the 90's on it.

However, when you've the same list from 2024 and there are still some titles from the 90's on it, after 25 years of game development and new releases, then you can be sure that the old games that are one it must have something great to them. 

That's why giving newer lists more impact makes sense. Compiling a greatest games list from lists which featured less competition makes it inaccurate."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I’m thinking it’s just that we are still not even 5 years into the decade. If you would have made this list in 2014 instead of 2024, breath of the wild wouldn’t have been out yet. You still have something like 5.5 years to add to the list. Also, logic says this decade should have more games in this list by the end of the decade due to recency bias."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Thats not it. Its just that we didnt have that many lists realeased post 2020 for this compilation to take from...

Thats why Elden Ring is only on 23 place and Baldurs gate on 44th.

The newer games couldnt have appeared on older lists, meaning they got less points just because they didnt exist back then, even if this compilation is giving more weight to newer lists."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"There was a very good video on this by razbuten. While the old big companies like EA and others are mtx heavy now , it's not that today's games are bad rather they're less impactful. This might be a hot take but I'd say Celeste is a better game than super Mario World , or Hollow Knight is better than Super Metroid. Yet , their impact can't be overstated. And , the first type of a game you play will be more memorable than the rest in the genre. AAA games are big budget so they tend to take less risks ."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,*Maaaaybe* also a global pandemic had some small impact on that number as well?
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I think in general there’s (rightfully) hesitation to put new games on a best of all time list.  Part of what gets games on lists like that are cultural impact and how they stand the test of time, and newer games are untested in that respect."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"He does say there's a slight weighting towards recent lists, but it definitely sounds slight. Look at the [""all-time"" lists](https://www.acclaimedvideogames.com/lists/?limit=100&offset=0&type=A) used, and you'll see why earlier decades seem over represented... there just aren't that many from the 2020s yet. Best of decade lists are also used, and we won't get one of those until 2030."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"> I find it interesting post 2020 we have a drop off of games making it into top 1000 or top 100.

That's almost certainly just because of how short the decade is. Don't forget that not only are we halfway through, but that some of these games did not launch with GOAT level scores but instead received retrospective praise (See: Earthbound, for example) which cannot happen to 2020 games yet, plus ordering of games can place more games in the later half of the decade.

For a similar example from a different medium, watch how Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time has albums from the 2000s make up a bigger bulk of the list as time goes on, and how in 2003 only 12.2% of the list was albums from the 90s while by 2023 it had gone up to 20.2%. Time often changes perceptions."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,">Top 100 lists aren’t the top 100 best games there a mix of popularity , actual quality and most importantly nostalgia

Mostly true, I agree. Skyrim is #10, when it isn't even the best in its franchise. Not that I don't like it!"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Or it's that Nintendo games are some of the highest quality games out there.

Super Mario world is still a top tier platformer if you loaded up an SNES today"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"i do think Nintendo fans are the biggest nostalgia players. The games are good but. No. 1 for TBotW... game is just a newer Zelda title that improves on previous titles and has cool features.. 

But I personally judge games more on overall quality and less on gameplay. the things I rate at top are stuff like Chrono Trigger, Bioshock, Fallout New Vegas, TLOU2, Witcher 3, and FF10.. All story focused. 

not everyone's thing but I just cant find a game No. 1, that is all just good gameplay and nostalgia for the feeling you had when you first played the franchise."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Im not surprised.  Simulation and Strategy games are never really on the ""mainstream"" gaming industry's radar, and thus don't receive much attention or acknowledgment outside fans of the genres despite their popularity.

Of those genres I only spot The Sims, SC2K and CivIV on the list, two of which are in the bottom 20. Meanwhile very popular/well acclaimed games such as Factorio, XCOM, Rimworld, Rollercoster Tycoon, the other Civ entries,  etc. are missing."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Probably because any reviewer who played it was utterly consumed by it and never had the spare time to write anything about it.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Not on *any* list is insane. It‘s one of the very best executions on a genre of all time, and unsurpassed after 10 years. Guess that shows how much popularity plays into these kinda of rankings, and less quality of execution on the idea/genre/etc."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,Crazy that Terraria isn't anywhere on here either. They recently passed Super Mario Brothers for number of sales (58 million copies)
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"One of my favorite gaming phenomena is the incredibly high ratings of games like Euro Truck Simulator. They aren't overwhelmingly positive because everyone loves pretending to drive a truck, they're overwhelmingly positive because the only people who play them love those sorts of games."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"I'd disagree there, the 'game feel' in 1 was better, 2 just feels like I'm playing a simulator rather than a game."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,What about in terms of influence on the industry? Red Dead 1 was arguably the first game to really capture the feel of Westerns.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"the general placement also does matter, though. if RDR2 is number 42 on any list, then that list is irrelevant and a mere statistical curiosity. it's got nothing to do with reality and we're wasting time even discussing it. i'm outta here."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,No Dinosaur Game too 😡
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"This isn't on OP though.  You're just not seeing those games make top 100 lists as often across the gaming journalism industry.

Which honestly doesn't surprise me as it's a niche game genre whose popularity really lies in Japan.

Post DDR/Guitar Hero/Rock Band era, rhythm games in the US might see a break out niche title once in a great while.

Case in point, albeit anecdotal, I've been an avid gamer since the Atari 2600 and I've never even heard of half the games you listed."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Do it. Get your heart ripped out and then remember how great it was, and you’ll forever remember the time you went through it.  It’s like remembering a past love that makes you smile.  Totally worth it."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Tread the world curiously, my friend. It is a puzzle game, so if you get stuck, please don’t look up answers. The subreddit r/OuterWilds is fantastic about nudging you in the right direction with hints without spoiling anything."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,If you stream it let me know. There’s a whole community of people who love watching people fall in love with this game.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,that is what I feel is the issue with this guys method for creating the list. Ignoring audience polls and focusing on reviewers. Reviewers notoriously glaze Nintendo titles. often 10 out of 10 always.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Seems the sentiment has changed. Most people view New Vegas as a better game than Fallout 3. Is this a list of game on release or all time?
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"God, Wind Waker was good. The moment it gets remastered on Switch I’m buying it and watching my gf play through the whole thing."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"BotW diverts so much from the established LoZ formula that I understand why it's so divisive (I myself  prefer something more classic like OoT). Having said that, the impact BotW had on the gaming medium was massive: it's really impressive from a gaming design standpoint, it's literal wizardry on a technical level, and totally remarkable to be the first open world game in the series and the first from Nintendo. It's just Nintendo demonstrating that decades later they're still kings in the business. Nostalgia aside, I firmly believe it's a totally deserved #1."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,I have a few friends that absolutely love it and I tried to like it but I didn't enjoy it at all. It's a shame because I love the Zelda franchise. Completely skipped over tears of the kingdom.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I like it a lot, but #1 of all time? Absolutely not lol"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I didn't enjoy Elden Ring as much as others (I still finished it but it overstayed it's welcome in the 2nd half) but I can see why some would rate it as a 10/10 game while with Breath of the Wild, I just don't get it. There are several better Zelda games even"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,The weapons is what lost it for me. Nothing feels special. I shouldn’t need to constantly worry about my steel sword shattering. Less effective sure. But completely broke and now I have to finish the fight with my remaining sticks? No thank you
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I felt the same about tears of the kingdom. I loved it at first. The beginning on the big sky island was fun. The new powers and building contraptions was fun. I liked that the world felt a little more lively. But once the novelty wore off, I felt like I was just playing BoTW again. "
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Yup, that’s why I quit, the weapon degradation. I also hated the cooking. The game just wasn’t that fun. I love almost every game on this list, except No. 1."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"it's baby's first open world game. there's some good ideas, there, but, when you're climbing towers to unlock parts of the map, you just feel like you've already done all this shit in other games over a decade ago."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,All the menus you had to dive into certainly hurt the game I think. Tears of the Kingdom was 1000 times worse with the menu hell.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,">  I never played a Zelda game before

Personally I feel like that kinda helps, it's the least 'Zelda' Zelda game there is"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Funny I always assumed my lack of nostalgia for Zelda was why I thought BOTW was so bland and boring.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,And RDR2 is 42 on the list? This is some bullshit
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Popularity does not mean it's inherently good.

Justin Bieber's ""Baby"" is an objectively shallow, uncreative song, yet it was absolutely massive and wildly popular at one point. That doesn't mean it's wrong to like it, but to pretend it was some lyrical masterpiece definitely is wrong. And if you want an extreme example, well... Hitler was pretty popular at one point, the German people loved him.

Just about anything Nintendo puts out gets a bump in popularity and praise just because it's Nintendo. They have a ton of brand loyalty among a lot of people, similar to how a lot of ""Disney Adults"" will worship anything Disney puts out."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Nintendo is just incredibly consistent with their first-party games. They're nearly always incredibly polished and heavily focused on the ""fun"" aspect of gaming over anything else. It's honestly impressive that they still manage to put out bangers to this day."

There are dozens of us!

Don't get me wrong, Nintendo made some good games in the past, but a lot of the discourse surrounding them (and a lot of gaming nowadays, tbh) feels like people only ever play on Nintendo consoles."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I mean, they make a lot of genuinely great games, it's not super hard to understand lol. To me, they really hit their stride in the gamecube era, but they've been consistently making great games for like 40 years now"

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Sure. But by your own description does that sound like the greatest game of all time?
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,So you mean it was an attempt by the Zelda team to cash in on current gaming trends (like Open-World survival) badly? I agree. At least Tears had stuff that made it interesting.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"TotK added an annoying building system that, while deep, was either abused or ignored depending on your play style but made the durability mechanic *worse* by having you fix your weapons by tacking on stupid accessories to them. That and forcing the story to be told in the order you find the tears instead of sequentially was a big miss for me."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,The question is would we have Elden Ring if we didn’t have BOTW.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I think it’s a game that’s had a slow burn. It’s been around for so long and has been popular for so long, but never had one year where it really really broke out, if you will. Which is sort of what this kind of list requires."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"Any time someone asks me my favorite Zelda game, I say Okami. lol

It's definitely in my top games of all time. Love it to pieces."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,I would agree with you but we are very much in the games are turning into movies and tv shows era. And I mean that literally.

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"For me, it's 100% the length and pacing issues. It's an impressive game in a lot of ways, but i don't think I will ever be able to beat that game start to finish without several year long breaks in between. It's just such a fucking slog for me."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I was disappointed that they built such an incredible wilderness and nothing really challenged you at all. It never felt like you were in any danger whether out in the world or even in a shootout, with auto lock-on, etc."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Depends on what makes a game better to you. I think fallout 3 has better world design, which for some people will outweigh the better quest design of fallout New Vegas.

Fallout 3 is also significantly more stable than New Vegas."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"The fact that they decided to just choose a bunch of lists by ""editorial staff"" without any other factors consider was always going to make this list a look at what was trendy in video game media at the time the list was made, not the actual quality or popularity of the games. 

I think OP put in a lot of effort, and I appreciate that, but this is more a meta analysis of games journalism than it is a list of ""the best games""."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,It’s also comparing wildly different games. I have no desire to play RDR2 because from what I’ve seen I wouldn’t enjoy it much at all. But I could pick up Mario 64 right now and have a blast with it.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I wasn't trying to disparage your list, I was just thinking out loud mostly :)"

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Check out project Diablo 2.  It’s a multiplayer mod that keeps true to the original game but adds a little bit of flavor from POE.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Thanks for the intel, I’m not shocked it pops up low ranked. But the game is alive and well. At least Old School is. Are old school runescape and runescape separated?"

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"It was extremely mediocre.

Deus Ex, Half Life and numerous others were far more important and definitely way better in all aspects, if not even revolutionary.

Sim City 2000, ICO, Tomb Raider… damn, so many games that brought so much into the industry. Halo just recycled and maybe refined some aspects, but definitely nothing revolutionary or great.

Sure, it was easy for casual gamers, that’s why it was popular. But popular != great.

Halo is simply overrated.

Multiplayer is a different different subject."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"Thanks for the explanation. I must have graced over that in your post. I understand the purpose better from a ""general media outlet tendencies"" point of view rather than as the ""de-facto best games of all time list"" (which it could be construed as in some sense)

I do think the project is interesting, and I can tell quite a bit of effort went in. I am uncertain, however, about the usefulness of the result."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"It means that the 2010s is the first decade to have three games on the list, and that those games are the abovementioned games, plus the 6th game on the list, which is The Witcher III: Wild Hunt. It's an interesting metric, but it's also confusing, I know."

This is an odd quirk of ""best"" lists where you're tight for space. If you can list AC2 (or well liked future games like Black Flag), would you spend an entry on the original?"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Or in any vein honestly. Those games are incredible and far too few people have played them
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"There's people who weren't able to get a Switch at launch but still wanted to play the new Zelda.

That's atleast the only people I know that played it on the Wii U."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"If they used the Head to Head scheme for determining results, it wouldn’t matter because any games that didn’t exist yet wouldn’t be affected by the lack of comparisons, unless the method used determines “any games not on the list are considered joint last place” as opposed to “any games not on the list are considered unranked”."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Yeah but the 90’s, 2000’s, and 2010’s all hover around close to 30% of the list. The rate of 2020’s isn’t keeping up with how those decades did. 4.5 years in you would expect closer to 10% of the list. Not 5%. There is definitely a drop off of games making it into top 1000 or top 100 on lists, even with recency bias helping them out."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Not only that but games that rated well back in the day, then slowly dropped down the lists as newer better games were released are over represented.

Let’s not forget that this is also published lists, meaning in many cases money changed hands between game publisher and list maker. There are a lot of games in the top 100 that do not rank above games that don’t have big name publishers.

Not only that ‘Top 100’ lists have become redundant, not much attention is paid to those, reviews on platforms like Steam are as far as most people go in their research. Those types of scores need to be incorporated in this list.

A really cool concept, and a lot of work for sure, but it doesn’t tell the whole story in terms of the true best games of all time.

LoZ link to the past at 11 and Minecraft in the 30s?"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Yeah, 100%. We've had some insanely good games very recently, it's just that there is a such a bloat of good games that we remember the first ones more fondly."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Yeah that’s probably a factor too.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Skyrim is very much the people pleaser choice cause it’s really like an 8/10 but when it released people where on the Bethesda train and if this game was released today even with updated graphics and combat equivalent to star-field it would be torn apart to a similar but lesser extent than starfield as it’s very flawed particularly in combat and story .
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"To be honest for an objective list it’s impossible due to the nature of the industry however that doesn’t mean there are so massive gaps , like new vegas achieved its cult like status only in the last couple years ( for good reason games great) so that got excluded from the list . Games like planescape torment which is very niche but one of the best written games ever is always missing of these list ."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"There are actually quite a few XCOM games, two of which are just outside the top 100. Some people are experiencing a bug where the page numbers aren't appearing, but if you use the search function you should be able to find them. Rollercoaster Tycoon is also there at 548th."

Every time a Zelda, Mario, or Metroid game comes out then reviewers act like they reinvented the wheel by using the exact same core story and game mechanics that exists in every iteration of the franchise."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"I bought and played it on launch, I could not get out of the first town it was THAT buggy and prone to crashing. It was ridiculous. 

It's a fantastic game when it works, which took a long time before it did, long after people had stopped reviewing it."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"That is mostly online sentiment. You need to realize Fallout New Vegas has a very online player base that is very loud but is a rather small group.

If you were to ask online which game is better , 4 or New Vegas, a lot of them would say New Vegas. Than you would look at which Fallout game people are playing and realize most people play 4. In fact, if you were to ask the same about 76, same would apply. 76 has more players than New Vegas.

What people say online does not represent reality in all cases. A small rabid fanbase is going to dominate conversations online more than a large group of casual players."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"It is amazing, and the only thing holding it back from being the best game is that it was rushed at the end and that triforce treasure diving shit was thrown in"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I'm in the same boat as you, the Zelda franchise has some of my personal favorite games of all time, but I could not stay interested in BOTW and also never picked up Tears."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I feel like Tears was so much worse that Breath. I loved the story, but the constant menu switching was brutal and annoying. That said, Colgera is one of my favorite Zelda boss fights ever and it requires very few trips to the menu screen."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"As far as open world games go RDR2 certainly sets a very high bar for added depth, and actually making those worlds worth exploring. It makes something like BOTW look very barren in comparison."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,I hate these arguments when talking about art. Whether something is good or bad is entirely subjective. The song being shallow or and uncreative *in your opinion* doesn’t make something inherently bad.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"It's not just popularity though. They're rating it #1. Like, of all the games, people are rating it the best. This isn't just ""X people like this game!"" Rotten Tomatoes style."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I was responding to the comment that said it was bland and empty, even though the game is quite deep and has plenty of qualities, even if once again it's obviously not perfect.

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Yes?

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Same reason Minecraft isn't higher up on the list even though it's the best selling game of all time. Granted, it's hard to fairly compare a game that's evolved so much since its initial release to games that pretty much never changed."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-16,"I really need to write a tool that shows exactly what's making games climb and fall in the rankings. At the moment, I can only really guess based on match up data. The key thing about RDR vs RDR 2 is the original seems to have done a lot better against the strongest games on the list. Because the win%s are weighted according to how strong the games are, this is \*probably\* why it ends up ahead. 

* Breath of the Wild: RDR: 22% RDR2: 16%
* The Last of Us: RDR: 29% RDR2: 25%
* Tetris: RDR: 30% RDR2: 35%
* Half-Life 2: RDR: 40% RDR2: 25%
* Ocarina of Time: RDR: 39% RDR2: 24%
* The Witcher III: RDR: 30% RDR2: 22%

RDR2 does better against Tetris, but it still paints a pretty clear picture overall. Interestingly, RDR2 is actually winning about 60% of the time against the original, so I totally get why people think it should be ahead. The raw data is messy and contradictory though, as you can see."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"It is not a different subject, it was a massive part of Halo and a massive part of online gaming being where it is today. To hand waive it entirely is looney.


You can be as butt-hurt as you want but accessibility matters. It is far easier to start the campaign in Halo and go ""got it"". Way easier to give someone the controller and have em understand ""colorful aliens bad guys, human soldier good guys"". 


Simple doesn't always mean stupid or bad or compromising. It can just be fun. It's simple fun. Pick up gun and blast away some aliens and grenade go boom. Halo was and is simply fun. The cornerstone of gaming. "
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"No but Minecraft is one of the best games of all time. 

Which is why it’s popular. 

Same w Elden ring, BOTW, last of us and Skyrim. There are great indie games but to be the best game of all time the scope of the game needs to be decently large. 

Outerwilds is great, but it’s just a story, it doesn’t have a gameplay loop, it’s art style isn’t the most unique and it’s not really replayable."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Well yeah, but we also had covid in the beginning of this decade with seriously fucked the development of many games, cancelling or delaying it altogether. I just find it hard to believe that, in a time where the developers have an unprecedented ammount of knowledge and tools that the games are just worse. But I agree that it’s a matter of opinion, you also have nostalgia and lower expectations carrying the older games imo."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Have we taken into account how many best lists are ""best of the decade"" or ""best of ps5"" that simply cannot be made yet? Early 2010s games show up all the time in lists from 2020, so there's an even stronger recency bias than what you're accounting for."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Recency would logically hurt them, not help. The data were drawn from lists of various ages. 2020 games didn't even exist when over two thirds of the lists were published."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,">Let’s not forget that this is also published lists, meaning in many cases money changed hands between game publisher and list maker

I'm guessing this would only really affect new games (at the time of each list's publication, of which there are many)?  I just can't imagine a publisher paying for someone to bump them up a top 100 list for a game that is even a few years old.  I have a hard time imagining they open up their marketing budget for it at all considering how little these lists probably have on sales."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Also it's that AAA games are just too big budget and there's no AA where you can take risks . There was hi fi rush (which I personally didn't enjoy as much as others) , Alan Wale and a few others but lately if you want something that's not mainstream you have to go to Indie only which while creative don't have the scale..

For eg I recently played Shadow of the colossus and while it's a frustrating piece of shit I was just in awe that this was made in 2005 and was one of the best things I have ever played even though it has a lot of rough edges. Idk if a game like could be made today"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"People meme about playing a stealth archer every time not realizing it's because the combat system is incredibly unbalanced, weirdly paced, and clunky as all hell."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Also, how do you weigh/account for games that set trends for the industry going forward? 

Even Twilight Princess is obviously a ""better"" game than Ocarina of Time; the graphics are better, the world is larger, the combat is more diverse, the items are more unique, the environments are way more varied, but TP would never have happened if it weren't for OoT setting the standard not just for Zelda games, but every single third person 3D action adventure that followed. 

Dark Souls 3 is objectively ""better"" than Dark Souls 1, but Dark Souls 1 spawned an entire genre of games.

Edit: Perfect example; in what world would Hades ever outrank Diablo 2? Diablo 2 was a genre-defining cultural phenomenon that people poured literally tens of thousands of hours into and spawned  and/or inspired hundreds of others games including Hades, a well reviewed indie title from the same genre."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"100% 1 or so new mechanics..99% same gameplay 10/10 seems to be reviewers for Nintendo games..

Even the only video game review podcast i listen to Besties will do this for Nintendo stuff. They are my age but go so hard for Nintendo stuff.. and minimize other types of games as ""too much story""

I mainly listen to the podcast becuase it has 2 of the McElroy Brothers which are fun to listen to."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Imo classics like ocarina manage to be awesome because of simple inventories (with like 25-30 items total you can get in the game), and utilizing that small inventory to be able to get awesome dungeons and puzzles that are fun to solve and utilize the few items to great levels. Basically every Zelda game has fit that description.

Then BotW comes out and opens things up a lot, and one thing it does really well is provide puzzles that have multiple solutions and the tools to solve them are pretty open ended - and I genuinely think that’s really cool but not necessarily “Zelda” to me. But what’s worse is the inventory system. I don’t want to have to gather a bunch of random stuff and worry about my weapon’s condition when I’m playing Zelda. That’s what makes it so incredibly unappealing for me. It loses that “simple but complex” thing that every Zelda game has.

I even enjoy the puzzle style enough that I really enjoyed Ubisoft’s rip off (immortals fenyx rising) more because it had all the fun puzzles and much less of the grinding and crafting stuff.

I think botw is clearly a good game, just not for me. It’s not what I want out of a Zelda game at all."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"The show's pacing is way worse than the game. There's so many slow moments that you could only do in a game, like Ellie and Sam walking around talking about stuff they're seeing while you walk around reading diaries looking for a safe code.

I remember when the show aired and when one of the latest episodes came out people who were show only were saying they really liked it cause it finally gave Joel and Ellie's relationship some good development, which is insane, cause that relationship is so well developed at that point in the game. It's still a good show, but it left me feeling the same as most movies I've seen that are based off of books I've read.

Not to mention that the gameplay is just straight up fantastic. I played the multiplayer for TLoU so much, and I miss it constantly."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Hard disagree. I love TLOU and really enjoyed playing it. It also had one of the best multiplayer offerings in a long time.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,"Damn that's a crazy take to read haha. But I guess folks have different opinions. I thought breath and tears have a way way way better open world than rdr2. Rdr2 for me was more like a classic a to b open world game like cyberpunk and Ubisoft games. 

The new Zeldas are more on line with outer wilds and elden ring with real true freedom and lack of forced direction and ofc spectacular open world design"

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I read your line quite thoroughly. There was no real innovation, just stuffing Link into an open-world game with little creativity or new mechanics. I don't even like Tears of the Kingdom but agree it was a better game."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"again, popularity doesn't equal quality: roblox is pne of the most popular game but it's not on the list. outer wilds has a gameplay loop too, not sure what you are talking about. knowledge allows you to gain more knowledge, that's the gameplay loop."

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"For this type of case think of it as first to have -exactly- some # of games on the list, rather than up to. A decade to be the first decade to have one is really a decade that is the first to have only one."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,Not if you're counting as you go down the list from rank 1 to 100. The first decade to have a game is the 2010s because the number 1 spot is a game from the 2010s.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I think part of it comes with the gradual increase in development cycle that, in my opinion at least, often doesn’t really yield anything. “Notable” games have started to become much more few and far between to the point where the expectation has become that it *needs* to be a 9/10 game with the fanciest graphics that promises to “revolutionize the genre” rather than just a fun game.

Take FromSoftware, this isn’t to bash them at all as I truly believe they haven’t released even a *mediocre* game since before Demon’s Souls was released, over the span of like 7 years we got like 5 Souls games from the originals DeSouls all the way through DS3, since then we’ve gotten Sekiro, Elden Ring, Armored Core 3, and some DLCs, again this isn’t to say those games aren’t great, Elden Ring truly was a massive event, but it took a looooong time to come to fruition, and now FS has to follow that up."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Playing a pure mage without cheesing a very high magica cost reduction into your armor is just awful. Beyond that spells are very uninspired in general. Most foods granting effectively infinite stamina because you only need one point to perform actions... Heavy armor having a perk to get rid of all of its weaknesses?

That's just off the top of my head after not playing the game in eight-ish years  
Also shouts totally should have had their own skill tree"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I have to disagree actually. Both are insanely good games. But Twilight Princess has some pacing issues. It has a few too many backtrack heavy lulls in pacing. 

OoT is perfectly paced. 

Yeah Twilight Princess is a little flashier. And has some cool stuff, I find myself less drawn to replay it because of those slow segments. I could pick up Oot again right now. 

Granted both are worse than the true GOAT Zelda game. Majora's Mask."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"My biggest gripe is that while there are a lot of puzzles, they're all bite sized puzzles that each take 5 minutes. You go back to any of the older games, and the puzzles span entire dungeons. It's like the tiktok of Zelda"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"That’s exactly what the person I responded to said. What you think is the best drink doesn’t instantly make it the best drink, because the reasons surrounding are subjective. That’s literally the point I am making lol."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Creativity and depth doesn’t mean something is objectively good. It’s the same argument. It’s why this sort of good vs bad debate for art is stupid.

1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"You know, I'll give you that one."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I agree with you. BOTW didn't really do anything better than all the other open world Ubisoft style games, it just had a Zelda theming slapped on and a weapon durability mechanic that is possibly my most hated aspect of the game.

If I pick up a game to replay in that same style, I'll be going back to Horizon ZD or Shadows of Mordor/War before I go back to BOTW. And that's coming from someone who replays ALTTP, and various randomizers thereof, all the time. I should have been a prime target audience for BOTW, but it was very flat for me."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"The world is bland and empty for you, but not for everyone.

It could have been more filled, but there is also a need to have ""empty"" spaces, it is part of the spirit of the game, which is called ""breath of the WILD"". This ""emptiness"" is an integral part of the game because movement and the way to manage it is a main component, it is also a field for experimentation with the tools and power that the game offers us, in addition to being necessary for the coherence of the world (a world filled with POIs everywhere is less natural and organic than a game that knows how to find a balance between content and ""emptiness"").

I think that one of the main differences between the latest Zelda and other open worlds is that it takes the effort to offer a fairly interactive world, with original gameplay possibilities, and that movement, travel, is a deliberately important component of the concept.

But it is a game that offers great freedom to the player, and which corresponds more to those who like to experiment, to be free and creative, unlike other games much more restrictive and directive, I think that not all players have this desire to try to do things by themselves without the game necessarily forcing them to, and that is why some find the game boring I think. That is why I talk about emergent mechanics, the game offers plenty of tools, it is then up to the players to do what they want with them.

But the game could have been a little smaller and more filled (I say ""a little"" smaller and ""a little"" more filled, because as I said, emptiness is also necessary).

Haha, I think my initial comment was clearly not appreciated by those nostalgic for the old Zelda games, personally I am delighted with the new formula, even if it still has a lot of room for improvement"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Do you know many games of this dimension and ambition with such an interactive world and such great freedom of gameplay and original game mechanics? I think the game must be seen as a whole. And I'm not saying that it is innovative and original in ALL aspects.

TOTK is not better for me, but to each his own. I think that the new crafting and construction mechanics are an excellent idea, but not in a Zelda game, or more precisely not in the way it was implemented (it's not very ergonomic and certain constraints sometimes make the use of these mechanics more annoying than anything else).
And imo it's the Zelda with the worst atmosphere and the worst OST"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"That doesn’t mean that Elden Ring wouldn’t exist without Botw lmao. There’s plenty of other open world games that they would’ve taken inspiration from, which I’m sure they did as well"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-15,Correct :)
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"It’s an expectation game. You think if a game like castlevania came out today it would get the same praise. I don’t think it would, because expectations are different. Games had smaller development cycles because they were simpler, that’s it. You get amazing games with small development cycles today, but they are not good enough to make this list. Nowadays, to make a top 100 game you need a project in the scope of an Elden ring or a true masterpiece like Hades (which still has an enormous scope in terms of quantity of content). It’s like in sports. Players today are way better than any GOAT of the old days, because they have better conditions to do so, and you expect more of them."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"This could definitely be just me, but it feels almost like BotW and TotK are more like polished tech demos for the physics engine and graphic style. Nothing about them outside of the random cutscenes hidden in them feel particularly like Zelda to me. I enjoyed BotW greatly, but TotK was a massive letdown."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I know. You are literally saying the exact same thing as him, but the opposite."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Sorry, I'm specifically responding to your assertion that it's one's opinion that a song is or isn't shallow, I'm not suggesting that a deeper song is a better song."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,Name a flaw
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Exactly. The game is fine. Pretty much everything in that game had already been done before in another form. I know I'm not the target demographic because I don't really like Zelda that much, but it was easily my least favorite Zelda game. To the point where I wouldn't buy another one."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,That can go both ways. The world feels exciting and live to you. I didn't find the tools to be that cool and exciting. The game was fine. I think there are way more games deserving of a number 1 spot
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"Honestly, if we're not bringing the CDi into the picture, I feel BotW had the worst atmosphere and OST. 

But regardless of how I dislike the game in general, my ultimate point is that it is number one on lists not out of admiration for the game itself, but because it is a Zelda game, when honestly, it probably would have been a better game outside the franchise."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,I’m not just saying that. He’s implying that things like Justin beiber are popular and objectively bad. I am saying that it’s not true because his perception of what is good or bad is entirely subjective.
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"But I'm not talking about the ranking here, I was just responding to your comment.
For me a ranking like this one doesn't make any sense anyway, as I said the ""best game of all time"" doesn't exist. Each player can have his favorite games but it remains subjective

And I should point out that BOTW isn't even my favorite game."
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"My comment kinda goes hand in hand with the ranking though. A game that is repetitive and boring shouldn't be in a top 10 list imo. Sure you can't have a ""best"" game but you can have a highest rated game. BotW making that consiste try is what gets me. Every person I have actually met has a similar opinion about the game. It's fun. It's not a great game. It's ok"
1e30pcx,2024-07-14,2024-07-14,"I don't know what to tell you. You and the people around you may not represent the majority of people, don't you think ? Just because some people find it boring doesn't mean it's an absolute truth.
Because you can find people with any opinion if you look, that's not what tells us the general appreciation of a game that, for many people, was clearly not boring.

And once again the rankings don't indicate much, well it's just a kind of statistical average, in any case people shouldn't give them too much importance.

There are plenty of very well ranked games that I don't care about at all and that don't interest me, I would even say that it's most of them. No game can be loved by everyone, and we all have our personal ranking, trying to be objective is futile

All games are repetitive after a while, I think that the latest Zelda are clearly not among the most repetitive games, on the contrary I think that it offers a lot of diversity, even if obviously like all games it has repetitive aspects that would have deserved more attention in the details and originality

You have the right to not like it too much or find it boring, but that remains a personal opinion.
Conversely, no one is going to force you to like it"

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I'm happy to see Subnautica in the honorable mentions. I'm honestly surprised it didn't make the list. The atmosphere and exploration-driven story work so well together. It's truly one of the only games where your fear to venture out deeper into the abyss is the only thing stopping you from progression
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,So glad the first game I’ve ever finished with my first console was on the top of the list. Ocarina of Time was a personal epiphany for me.

Where is Heroes of Might and Magic 3? 
Should be in the top 10! :)"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Good work and an interesting list.

The big problem with it is the sourcing. 

During the period from 1989 to 2000, there were dozens of PC game magazines that comprehensively reviewed computer games. They were far more in-depth and they were contemporaneous to the games being released, not a list put together after years of hindsight.

Consequently, the modern list providers are going back thirty or more years, looking at hindsight memory and sales. 

Games that definitely SHOULD be on this list are left out largely because their genres didn't grow into industry leaders, even though sports and flight sims, and puzzle games, were much, much bigger back then.

Games I would've expected based on their rep at the time would've included Earl Weaver Baseball from circa 1986-87; Wolfenstein 3-D from 1993; The Secret of Monkey Island from 1991 (ish); Falcon 3.0 from 1990 or thereabouts; Wing Commander from 1993,  FIFA International Soccer from 1994; Descent: Freepspace from 1998-ish. 

That's just off the top of my head. But all of those were considered genre-defining at one point, and certainly were among the best reviewed games ever. Reviewing also used to be MUCH tougher. Modern games that get an ""80"" would often have been a ""50"" or a ""60"" in equivalents of the time.

So operating from hindsight sort of robs this of accuracy, to me. But it's a good list, nonetheless."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Maybe i missed it but it's weird not seeing Heroes of Might and Magic III anywhere, as this is still a cult game..."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Awesome data! 1 question:

Could you explain this part more?

>also gave a certain amount of extra points for simply being on the list--otherwise games that ranked low would get basically no advantage over games that didn't rank at all. The amount differed based on whether the list was a top 50, top 100, top 200, and so on. Making it onto more exclusive lists obviously granted more points.

1 ""maybe more of a comment than a question"" (sorry)

Did you control for date of release? As you've written it, any game released later than 2018 is disadvantaged by being excluded from evefifry previous list. What I mean is, Hades or Elden Ring are excluded from lists before 2020 or 2022, respectively. I can see the justification here being that newer games *should* be disadvantaged in a ""best games of all time"" list to counteract the cult-of-the-new aspect, but I'd be intersted in how that was actually approached / dealt with, if at all.

And finally, 2 comments:

\- It's interesting that there aren't any VR games. Beat Saber is the biggest one that comes to mind. Sports games in general are really underrepresented, I don't know if that's related.

\- Pole Position (1983) got robbed."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Is it just me or is this list just a tiny bit biased against PC games? World of Warcraft completely redefined gaming, was the most popular game in the world for years, and isn't even in the top 30. Same story for Doom. And Baldur's Gate didn't even make the top100. And I could go on for a while.

(To be clear, not blaming OP for that. They are just aggregating data. And it's a very interesting post. Just speaking out about such lists in general)."

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Also, I'm a little surprised Unreal Tournament 2004 didn't make it on some list. As it was a 2004 banger, making it one of the greatest games of all time, because it was one of the best games, in one of the best year in history. It has the vaulted ""universal acclaim"" from metacritic and 11 perfect reviews out of 48 reviews. In one of the best years in gaming history (2004), (Only 2007 and maybe 1998 are better)."

I think that’s partially due to being that age where I *really* grew up with consoles. I don’t care much for GTAV, but I have younger cousins and in-laws who would put it in their top 3.

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I favor a more harmonic distribution of points -- 1 point for 1st, 1/2 for 2nd, 1/3 for 3rd, etc.

reasons:

1. each list is bound to a have a 1st place, so each publication is normalized on that, as opposed to providing more points if the list is longer. For example, a t50 list has only 1/4 the number of points a t100 list has

2. with the harmonic pricing system, different positions have different differential values. E.g., the difference between a 50th position and 51st position has a smaller difference than between a 2nd vs 3rd, for example, as it should be. I can't believe the editors of a publication would put much effort into whether crash bandicoot is 30th or 31st. However, I think a lot of effort would have been put into 1st vs 2nd.

That said, I don't think that would change things up too much -- Ocarina of Time is still going to be the undisputed King of our video game history. After that, I'd be curious to see what the differences are"

Also, I am happy that both Persona 5 and Persona 4 made it in this list, but a little surprised they are so far apart in popularity. I guess this shows just how much of a difference modern UI, combat, and graphics can make on a game's overall popularity."

The difference in gaming from PS2 to PS3 and Xbox 360 was a major jump, and then when exclusives became less prominent during the PS4 / Xbox One era due to PC ports and Steam competition might have significant effects on publisher rankings. Maybe a variable for relative console sales."

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"> Number of games with female protagonist: 17

It would be interesting to see this explained/broken down more. Several games on the list have no ""protagonist"" (sports games, strategy games, etc.) a customisable protagonist which can be female or male (mostly RPGs) or a selection of player characters with no single ""primary"" protagonist (fighting games, etc.). I fear by simply including this number without further breakdown, some will read it as the other 183 games have a male protagonist, which clearly isn't the case.

EDIT: I did my own count and came up with:

Ambiguous/unidentified/no protagonist: 14

Customisable protagonist: 33

Female protagonist: 13 (so I'm clearly not counting the same way the OP did...)

Male protagonist: 115

Multiple selectable characters: 25

Note that there's a bit of subjective judgement involved in choosing ""Customisable protagonist"" vs. ""Multiple selectable characters"". In my judgement; if the character chosen/created by the player is the only one that logically ""exists"" within the game, then it's a ""customisable protagonist"", but if the non-chosen selections can appear within the game (e.g. secondary characters, opponents, etc.) it's ""multiple selectable characters""."

Does it hold up? Better than most games of its era


Is it the 🐐?


Noooo"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Ocarina of Time is overrated af, good for its time but now not so much"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Really interesting list and well made. 

97/200 for me, surprisingly low. 

And as much as I liked both games I’m surprised to see Fire Emblem Three Houses and Ghost of Tsushima crack this list, but happy with how high Dishonored 2 charted."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Wow.  Impressive work.  I was surprised that Baldur's Gate 3 isn't on this list considering how popular it is.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Pokemon Red/Blue at 22, yep.  
Pokemon Gold/Silver at 75, makes sense...  
Pokemon Diamond/Pearl at 172, huh?

Just skipped right over Ruby/Sapphire which isn't even on the list. Didn't expect that. Were Ruby/Sapphire hated or just forgettable? I loved them growing up so maybe I just have rose tinted glasses."

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26, Resident Evil 7 should be on that list.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Bloodborne should be higher 

Otherwise very nice job"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Maybe recency bias of me but I think that Baldur’s Gate 3 could be competitive in the future for #1 on this list
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Divinity Original Sin II sitting at 132 is a disgrace. Top 50 easily. Fortnite at 94? GTFO. Wow at 31? Nah it’s top 15. FNV at 92? Put that shit top 50.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"This is well made, get it to top"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"This is quality! 

👏👏👏"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Ocarina of Time is probably the least controversial pick for best game of all time and fits so good up there.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Bioshock barely cracking the top 10, Disco Elysium at #47, and Hades at #53 invalidates all this"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Were Indi games excluded? Can’t imagine rimworld and factorio missing this list otherwise.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"This is an interesting list. But as other have said, it really is specific to only some genres and single player games and what has been deemed popular.

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Outer wilds criminally low at 99
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I understand the logic, but there is no way OOT should be #1 on this list."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,I think the bias towards single player offline story games is a little high
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"The circlejerk around Ocarina of Time as the greatest game of all time is so tiring.

I've literally seen people say ""It's the greatest game that's ever been made and no game can ever be better than it."""
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"What a garbage list though..... This is essentially just based on popularity, not the actual quality of the game."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Nintendo is so fucking overrated
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Morrowind lower than Skyrim? And Oblivion? Bad list is bad.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Zelda is the most overrated piece of shit I mean come on botw is a kids game
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I've taken a lot of shit from people over the years, but I just can't get behind The Last of Us being a good *game*. It was a phenomenal story; maybe the best. As a game, it was like an advanced version of Dragon's Lair. ""You pressed the wrong control at the wrong time. You will now be punished with a loading screen."""
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,We're gonna be seeing baldurs gate 3 near the top of these lists pretty soon
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I’m glad the king is on top.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I am disgusted that BotW is so high on that list.  Game is an atrocious stain on the amazing history of Zelda.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Unless I missed it, no way in hell does MGS5 deserve to be on that list while MGS4 isn't."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-12-14,That's impressive! I'm curious to know what games made it to the top of those lists.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-12-15,"you have a game as being from china, which?"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2024-02-29,"MYST! Only 69?  
Doom is listed for 1993 but Myst sold way more copies.

From Wiki:   Myst was the best-selling PC game for nearly a decade."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2024-05-09,"Go play virtual reality gaming with Astro Bot Rescue Mission (psvr1), Resident Evil 8 in VR (psvr2), Bound (psvr1), The Playroom VR (psvr1 free download), and Sprint Vector. And that list of yours is going to come crashing down in a hurry. Starting VR gaming in 2019 for me was almost like a revelation. The top VR games are at another level of immersion that nothing on standard 3d can compete with. I even sold my Switch with Breath of the Wild back then in 2019 to buy more VR games. Zero regrets. (It was that good!! 😎🏆). These are VR games I recommend if you want to be impressed with the gaming hobby all over again (as if you were 15 again pretty much):

On psvr1 + ps4: Sprint Vector, The Playroom VR (it’s free!), Astro Bot Rescue Mission, Raw Data, Tumble VR, Dance Collider, Beat Saber, Iron man VR, Rigs mechanized combat league, Fujii, Electronauts, Red Matter, Batman VR, Racket Fury Table Tennis

On psvr2 + ps5: RE8, Moss 2, Red Matter 2, Hubris, Runner, Synth Riders, Pistol whip, Walkabout mini golf"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,zelda is so overrated jesus
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Elden Ring 50 spots below Skyrim is travesty
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I wish when people made new lists, they'd not include factors like influence or nostalgia.  The lists tend to be very static otherwise.

A lot of these classics are really rough to play today, and if they released this year wouldn't come close to being top of the list for recent games."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Braid being on there but not The Witness is certainly something. Both amazing games but I thought The Witness is superior in every way. Only the Portal games beat out The Witness for puzzlers imo.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Last of us part II is way too low, especially if part one is that high. Part II is better in just about every way, the only real subjective part is the story and thats been tarnished by bitter people with weird daddy/daughter/protector issues. Other than that, graphics, controls, enemy AI etc. are all objectively better."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"As always, reviews seem to be heavily console and single player focused. It might just be me, but it's comical that Ocarina of Time is #1 and yet Everquest, Ultima Online, Quake, Diablo 1, and Unreal Tournament don't even make the list. 

I was an avid gamer when OOT came out. And yeah, it was a decent game. But holy hype batman. It certainly wasn't better than any of the games I listed above."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,The facts that rdr2 is 26 is a crime
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Great work OP. Sad dark souls 3 is so low, deserves more love"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"It’s criminal seeing GTA IV being placed so low, yet alone below GTA V."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I would put Shadow of the Colossus higher in this list, but I have no idea where. 

Tetris and MineCraft and Super Mario 64 seem like absolute *nonsense* placements. The first two are entertaining and addicting, but have virtually no element of a story. Mario 64 was legitimately annoying to play, the visuals were exciting and new at the time, but holy hell you screamed at the camera controls more than trying to work out how to play the level.

Also, those two Zelda games topping the list? Really? I like Wind Waker FAR better than either."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Fantastic post brother.

Immensely rare mention of Trails in the Sky on a mainstream gaming sub. Immediate banger certified post, ty."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Souls not in the top 15 franchises? WTF?!

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Gtav is certainly not top 3
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Too normie. I can think of many, many JRPGs better than Pokemon.

Bioshock > System Shock 2?

Knights of the Old Republic, Mass Effect 2 and the Witcher over PS: T and BG2?

Totally backwards."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Is Ocarina rlly that good? I mean when it came out it was prob the best thing ever but there are better games now imo
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Zelda games have got to be the most overrated things in history
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,No destiny 1/2. Big sad
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Banjo kazooie should be on this list. Imo it's a superior platfoermer then Mario 64.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,bro wtf
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Huge recency bias, and tolerance for jRPG mechanics that don't translate well to M&KB."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Yep, list still sucks."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Bioshock at 10 beats the shit out of me. Geniune questio, and yes I have played all of them, how on earth do you put it so high? What did that game bring that we haven't already seen until then. If not that, what did that game do better than the games before it?"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Why are we still calling Ocarina of Time the best game of all time? It’s been 24 years. OOT isn’t even the best Zelda game.

I’ll admit, OOT paved the way for 3D game design, it walked so future games could run.

But are we seriously considering OOT better than all 24 years of games that came after it? Better than Majora’s Mask? Better than BOTW?"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Baldur's Gate 2 at 126.  More proof that reviews...especially those so slanted towards console gaming...are useless.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Ocarina of Time is over rated as hell, always has been. Majoras Mask is better."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I’m sorry but BotW has no business being ranked that high.  I grew up a huge Zelda fan and was incredibly bored by it.  No story, no depth, frustrating / meh combat, and side quests that make zero sense in the global context of the game.  Yet it’s hyped beyond belief.  It makes me believe that these best of lists are subsidized. /rant"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,No Cyberpunk on list makes me not taking it seriously though. I wonder if the bad release doomed it?
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Seems more like a ""most well known games"" list."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I saw #1 and immediately stopped looking at the list. OOT at #1 means we can close up shop and go home.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,ANY list of ‘Best Games of All Time’ that doesn’t include Game 7 of the ‘92 World Series is a list with which I have problem (and my Braves lost that game 😳).

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Interesting no Skyrim, I’m not complaining I think the game is boring and overrated but interesting none the less. Also noticed Diablo 2, which I love but no D3 or D4. I also approve."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Here's my personal top 10 of all the games I've ever played in my 28 years of life:  


1. The Mass Effect Trilogy (If only one game then Mass Effect 2)  
2. Fallout New Vegas  
3. The Witcher 3  
4. The Last of Us  
5. Baldur's Gate 3  
6. Bloodborne  
7. Half Life 2  
8. Left 4 Dead 2  
9. Star Wars Battlefront 2 (2005)  
10. Elden Ring   


As you can clearly tell I am not a Nintendo or JRPG fan."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Not sure a GTA after the PS2 would make my list.

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,I downvoted becouse of no final fantasy tactics
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I feel less bad returning Elden Ring seeing it fall that far down the list.

EDIT: It not only wasn't compatible with the native resolution of my high-end gaming monitor, but it also wasn't compatible with my high-end soundcard. I could play it on my tv instead if I wanted... but fuckkkkk that. Get your shit together FromSoftware"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"6 Words, Call Of Duty World At War"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"First of all: kudos, superb job.

Second of all: Wtf... How is Alien Isolation best of 2014?!O_O

It competes with Destiny, Mario Kart 8, Dark Souls II, Hearthstone, Bayonetta 2, Titanfall and it wins?

With metascore average of 78-83 across all platforms?

I need to look into the data because something's off.

EDIT: ok, I am now even more interested in the raw data and calculations that were done by OP. I've done some ""at a glance"" of 2014 and there's no way that Alien Isolation is higher than Dark Souls 2. We're talking 78 on metacritic vs 92. Out of half a dozen publications that I've reviewed, DS2 is higher by 10-15% in scores. What am I missing?

EDIT2: Alien Isolation is not even listed on almost half of the lists that OP mentioned that they used. It leads me to believe that their calculation method is not weighted (i.e. being on 1 out 12 lists with high score, skewes the outcome). It would explain why it's so high.

EDIT3: Empire, Slant, Popular Mechanics, GQ, USA Today? Not sure if I'd count them as reasonable resources for best games of all time."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,CoD 4 should not be higher than Halo 3
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"It's a terrible list imo :D
Played some of them and:
1. No Cyberpunk 2077, which is my favorite game of all time
2. I didn't like Zelda games
3. GTA V is not even in my top 10
4. I don't like Tetris"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Don't like that list at all.... How did you place Prince of Persia only on 188? Are you joking? And where is here original Prince Persia game? It was a true masterpiece.... And you even didn't care to put this legendary classic game to this list 🤦 while some quite mediocre games like Nier Automata you put in top 100...are you serious?
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"This list sucks

No Maplestory, World of Warcraft, Starcraft, Diablo, or Runescape

Tell me your a console gamer without telling me your a console gamer

also Counterstrike? really?"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-28,Maybe it's too recent but elden ring should be on this list.

like Mario is the top franchise, not Zelda, despite Zelda being the top 2 spots haha bro this list....you wasted your time."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Its crazy that Zelda games are even near the top

&#x200B;

2) And the 90s and 2000s were the absolute peak of gaming, making up a tad bit over 60 percent of ""the greatest games off all time"" 

&#x200B;

And a lot of the 2010 games, were early 2010 games to boot lol.

Cut and dry. That is it."

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Elden ring is much better than both Zelda. OoT was ground breaking but it's not that good. Even majors mask is much better
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"""Number of games with explicitly (stated in-game) LGBT protagonist""
What does LG BlueTooth has to do with any of this?"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Breath of the wild was so shit. Why does everyone like that game so much? It’s obviously a me issue but Christ is it over rated. It’s like 40 something spots ahead of STARCRAFT?!?!? Cmon man.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Lol. Funny times im living in. Seems to be very important now to mention if theres female or lbgt protagonist, for whatever pathetic reason. Also those childish Zelda games on rank 1 and 2, just lol. I played this so called ""masterpiece"" BOTW and at best its a cute adventurous kiddo game, a child-friendly peek into the openworld genre, but there were far better openworld games. And GTA5 on rank 3, a game that encourages criminality and ruthless sociopathy. Yet i dont wonder, humanity at its best."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Unpopular opinion but Legend of Zelda is absolute weibo boring game that doesn’t deserve how “popular” it is. Additionally I do not believe Nintendo are selling that many games.. more than pc games. Same counts for Nintendo and all the Mario games…
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"So, out of the 200, I've only played 22 properly, tried a couple more for a few minutes, and 13 I've never even heard of (and that's not counting a multitude of games within franchises I know of but wouldn't have been able to identify the specific game). 

Some might say I have a lot of catching up to do, but I'm honestly fine with it."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Wow. Amazing work. 
Curious as to how you chose the games that deserve a shout out but didn’t make the list?
Are these just your personal favorites?
Did you use some other metric?"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I'm honestly surprised Elden Ring is only 65th considering how much praise and adoration it garnered.

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,This is an amazing post. Shocked that Terraria didn’t make the list yet games like Mrs Pac Man and animal crossing new horizons did!

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Great work, OP! Original content like this is much appreciated."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Quality post. A lot of effort put into this. Well done.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"This is insane, whish awards was still a thing"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"This is actually a pretty solid, accurate list!"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Seeing shadow of the colossus up so high makes me happy it's one of my favourite games
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Is it easy to break this down by console?

I’ve enjoyed other consoles but not found games that break into this list. It’s very subjective and also very personal to every individual. So don’t moan. Post your own!"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"This is extremely cool. Love it. Good work here, OP."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Cool post! As these lists are up to five years old, does it not skew towards older games as newer games will not have been released at the time a significant portion of the lists were made? If you used only lists made in 2023 for example, I wonder if something like Elden Ring would move up in the rankings"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,There’s no way Fortnite is better than oblivion
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Great work OP!!!
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I'm sorry, I think there's a typo in there. You've included Fable II as #132. I think that should be Fable: The Lost Chapters.

I can understand the confusion, but it wasn't a sequel. It was a re-release including additional content. Fable II was pretty good, but the entire Fable franchise progressively got worse after TLC was released. TLC was ***peak*** Fable."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,lol bioshock infinite
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,No tecmo bowl?!?! Blasphemy!!!
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26, This good list
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I’ll fight you in Terraria haha. 

Awesome list"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"With how much people love Fallout NV. I am surprised to see Fallout 3 beating it by a large margin.  Finally my love of FO3 over NV feels vindicated..

I will say I hold both of them in very high esteem over any of the sequels.."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"No Into the Breach, but yes to FTL. Surprising, I think Into the Breach is the better of the two"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Uncharted 4 is 81? GTFO. Easily the best game of the last 10 years.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,This is amazing. That ‘highest ranking game of each year’ list really took me back. Damn dude.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Man it’d be so cool to just work your way up this list.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Glad FINAL FANTASY VIII made the list‼️ 💕
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,It’s absolutely insane to look back and realize that KOTOR and Half Life 2 were only a year apart.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Fantastic post, imo it’s surprising both Horizon: Zero Dawn and Horizon: Forbidden West weren’t amongst the top 200. I’d expect Baldurs Gate 3 to potentially make an appearance if this list were to be made again in a few years."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I always get lost trying to decide which top game to play so this will be a lot of help, thanks."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Most if these lists are usually pretty bad but I actually expected a mix to be better. I was wrong.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,FFIV should be on here
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Thank you for taking the time do this 🤝
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Splendide! Amazing. My gamer heart is almost overwhelmed!
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"wow, great job completing and compiling this list."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I commend and appreciate the work you put into this. But I’m a redditor so naturally I disagree with it
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Awesome work.  Greatly appreciated.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Can you add the best game of the franchise to the franchise list?
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Interesting that mgs1 is rated higher then mgs3
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,What's the Aussie game Dev game?
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,didnt expect to see shadow of the colossus so high
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"This is a phenomenal list and a lot of the placements make perfect sense... however, I'm just absolutely shook that Ghost of Tsushima is as low as 140 😲"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Great post OP. While i couldnt disagree more with the list this is a solid data dump and interesting read.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I approve of this list
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I'm surprised to see Red Dead 2 so low. I haven't seen an open world game with that much unnecessary detail before..
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Is grand theft auto IV not on this list or did I miss it?
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,For the most part this list makes sense.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I immediately disagree with the list, but this is a pretty cool research project you did."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Makes me happy to see Resident Evil 4 all the way at #6
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,This list in 5 years will have BG3 in the top 5 for sure.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Extensive and interesting, great post!"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Why is Dishonored 2 ranked higher than Dishonored?
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Bloodborne 20-ish places above Elden Ring is kind of surprising, but them both being in top 100 doesn’t surprise me in the least!

Popping off with Hollow Knight and Outer Wilds representation, but I’m really pretty surprised that Terraria didn’t show up (if I’m not blind)"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Great post!


But Journey is higher than Halo 3? Fuckkkkkk outta here."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Damn, not even a hint or mention of Destiny. Kinda sad seeing as how its live service has been going for almost a decade."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"For number 147 i think you mean ""Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell Chaos Theory"" you forgot the word ""Chaos."""
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,List is not very useful for finding games to play is it?
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Super Mario RPG is way too low on this list
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Alright I’ll say it, Disco Asylum is overrated. Do with me what you will."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I'm curious why you decided to lump Europe as ""one country"" for the graph? Seems kinda arbitrary given you've included China, for example, with only 1 entry rather than ""Asia""."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I haven’t read nearly a 10th of the post and have just jumped to your listings but I’ve given you an upvote for the commendable effort and time you’ve invested in this post. 

Well done"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,wished you added year released too
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Very few sport games on the list
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I love that on lists like these WoW and Dota2 are hardly ever mentioned while still being actively played for over a decade and more. Shows you lists are bullshit and just clickbait.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I’m super stoked Psychonauts made it in the list! It was such an underrated gem for so long. I’m kind of surprised the Jak and Daxter games didn’t make the cut though.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Anyone recommend more retro style games?

My top picks over the past few years have been Hollow Knight, Owl Boy, Hyper Light Drifter, and The Messenger. 

Would love to find more like those!"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed that I have at least tried every single game on this list.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,League Of Legends higher in the ranking list than Dota2. That made me depressed.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"No Terraria on the list, time to leave."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I think I've played 152 of these 200 games.  And of the remaining 48 I've played at least a little bit of 15 more, but can't really consider myself having actually ""played"" them.  Definitely missing a few I should be ashamed of though.  Thanks for the list and OC!"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"It's been maybe 20 years by this point since I last played ocarina of time. I purposely tried to forget it, so I can play it again and enjoy it almost like a brand new playthrough. But just from what I remember it was a great game for its time, but do I really think it had the power to stay on top compared to other games? I'm not sure. The last of us, I could say, may be a better game. Breath of the wild, was a fantastic game, and may have been somewhat more true to the original zelda game than ocarina of time in terms of you're thrown into a world and can achieve your objective almost anyway. 

I feel Ocarina truly does live off of the fact it was one of the first games to come out as a major franchise to 3d. Because as a zelda game, I do think link to the past was one if the best zelda games. Even better than ocarina. Not trying to shit on the game, it eas great, im just saying I think, it probably would have lost the top spot by now."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Wow! Thank you for making this, a lot of effort I am sure.

Most of the list is pretty mainstream in its appeal and messaging, which makes sense for a general best of anything list."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Good list.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Amazing list. I am surprised Elite did not make it, but Amiga fans never forget. 
More concerning for me, is that by the end of the decade Quake 3 could potentially be knocked off the list."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,[deleted]
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Thats pretty cool
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I never understand why Pokémon red/blue are always so high on these lists like go play heart gold / soul silver, platinum, or black/white 2 and tell me that red/blue are better than any of them."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,List basically boils down to new game good old game bad.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Great to see Eternal Darkness getting a nod. Brilliant original game that
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,What a cracking list of games. Just reading them brings back happy memories of playing them. There's some on the list I have to try too.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Ive been looking for Suikoden II for ages... Good times
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Awesome work OP this was a fun read.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Awesome list! Thanks for putting your tome and effort into this!
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Little Big Planet enjoyer.  Had to make the list long enough to fit that in.  But in all seriousness fair play for the hard work on this.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I don't know if it'll fit the criteria, but I think you should post this on r/dataisbeautiful because this is truly interesting and beautiful!"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I've only played 21 of these games. Looks like I've got some catching up to do lol.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"The fact Pokemon D/P is on there instead of the vastly superior and more widely recognized Platinum is shocking to me. Also that Red, Blue, Gold and Silver are still so widely beloved despite being such buggy, unbalanced experiences speaks to the power of nostalgia like nothing else"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Katamari should be #1
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"this is a very cool project. A scientific approach to games in the vein of Tim Rogers of /r/ActionButton.
     
I would have wondered if preferencing recent publications has a bias towards both the older *and* newer games with sort of a nomansland era in between, but you address it in your data!"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Honestly?

Seems about as good as a list like this can be. I dont personally agree with it but I know my bias is all over the place and I can see reason for this list far more than any other Ive seen recently. I am ESPECIALLY pleased with how high Shadow of the Colossus is, considering I hold it in extremely high regard."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Doom @ 119 :/
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I cannot believe that Sekiro is not on this list, glad to see it in the honorable mentions"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,FNV at 92 is a disgrace to my entire personality.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Really great list.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Star Wars Battlefront 2 erasure

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Hey thanks for posting this, it's always great being able to appreciate someones passion project, I wouldn't be surprised if you spent more than a few nights chewing through this."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"OMG this is fantastic!   You are sending a number of us down a very entertaining rabbit hole.  Also, at first glance, this seems like a very 'correct' list.  Super cool idea and execution on your part"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Really interesting to see! I think Portal is pretty much as close to perfect of a video game as you can get so it's weird seeing it so far down. Same deal with Hades, but that's less of a surprise due to its genre not being for everyone."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,MGs beating mgs3 couldn’t make less sense
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Is TMNT 1989 the NES game that came out in 1989 or the arcade game that came out in 1989 that was later ported to the NES?
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Kotor way to low and last of us way to high.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,No Fallout 4 anywhere to be seen?
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Oblivion should be in top 20

**Mic drop**"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Crono Trigger and KoTOR need to be higher. Much higher. Otherwise, this is a solid list."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"It sucks that even with all that effort and work. The fact that Resident Evil 4 is on the list higher than SM64 and Metal Gear Solid is just factually wrong. RE4 is nowhere near on the same tier but on your list it actually sits above them?

No point reading the rest of the list when the top 10 is wrong lol"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Baldurs Gate 3 will join the top 5. Breath of the wild really is not as good as the other games that high in the ranks.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,GTAV and TLoU are good games but have no right to those places
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Blood absolutely deserves to be in top of all time lists. I didn't play it when it came out but went on a binge playing old games and it was one of the clear standouts alongside Morrowind. I've played through it three times and the fan-made Death Wish campaign and it's just so damn fun.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Umm. This list is trash.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"This is the kind of high quality post that would usually belong in r/games. Good work, OP!"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,what kind of asshole put league of legends in top 100
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Outer wilds being in top 100 makes me so happy, it's not as well known as most of the games on this list so it just shows how good it is

Also terraria deserves that #1 spot"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Final Fantasy VII is much too low
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"> 2008: Fallout 3

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I think these lists are pretty pointless usually

So much about them is based on nostalgia and the time in which the games were released

Mario64 and mario bros 3 arent even close to being the best 3d/2d mario games yet they are at the top"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I need to post for future reference. Excellent work OP
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Feel like Everquest needs a honorable mention. Changed everything. Without it, presumably, No WoW, No Tribes, No Guild Wars, No EvE, etc. Shoehorn DAoC in there too while we're at it.

UT2k4 is king. Happy to see the edit."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Glad to see Chrono Trigger on top 20, definitely a game that marked a before and after in history."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Mario covering more than 10% of the top 50 is absolutely wild for a single franchise.

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,would love to see this but with critic reviews only. gamer/user reviews are a joke in 2023

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Very cool post.  

I'm honestly surprised not to see Total War in there at all, not even the heavy hitters like Rome 1, Medieval II, Shogun 2, Warhammer. In fact strategy seems to be rather under-represented generally, probably due to being largely PC only.

Some other omissions which surprise me - no Hitman, no Elite, no Homeworld, no Wolfenstein.  

Morrowind not being on there when Oblivion is is objectively mad, but makes sense given how Oblivion benefited from solid console presence.  

Tomb Raider is shockingly low on the list given how massive it was. I'm surprised that Bioshock is higher than Halo.  

One other observation - an awful lot of massive franchises are woefully represented - almost all sports and racing games, but also major series like Call of Duty, Medal of Honor, Battlefield. Goes to show that people don't necessarily rate games they play the most of as being their highest quality gaming experiences."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Where’s Bully?
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,It warms my heart that FF8 made the list
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Man, if Starfox 64ms on there Panzer Dragoon Zwei and Saga deserve to be on there."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,For me the biggest surprise is resident evil4. The game is amazing but 6th best of all time with so many games that created or defined genres bellow it? Could it be due to the context of the year it released? Or I'm just not seeing how good that game is?
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"there's a bias in your data against games released after some of the polls were released, so only games 5+ years old have the highest ranking potential. There's also recency bias though which maybe cancels it out probably not though."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Japan: good cars and good videogames.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I've played 85 on the list. Not too bad.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I feel justified knowing that out of my top 10, all of

Halo 3, Breath of the Wild, Left 4 Dead 2, Dead Space, Star Fox 64, Pokémon Red/Blue, Fire Emblem Three Houses, Portal 2 and Super Mario 64 are on this list. 

Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze deserves justice, but that’s a fight for another day."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Okami fuck yeah
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Unless I missed it, command and conquer missed the list which is shocking. Wasn't expecting top 10 but not even in 200?! Also counter strike missing is crazy."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Overall a decent list. But a game like Starfox 64 being there instead of Warcraft 3 is a bit funny.

WC3 is one of the best games of all time. Amazing campaign, amazing online competetive multiplayer, amazing as an esport, amazing custom games with tower defenses, footman frenzy and of course dota. Basically contained one of the best games in the world, that spawned a genre in itself."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"LA Noire was a very good game, but systems still aren't ready for facial animation changes to be a key part in a game."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Overwatch, not Overwatch 2."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Skyrim is stinking up the top 200 games that’s for sure…

Holy shit… 18th!?!? why is it so high… it was mediocre at launch and aged like milk in the trunk of your car on during a hot fortnight.

Nothing makes me feel like a crazy person than seeing Skyrim get praise almost universally.

Thanks for the interesting post though."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I find nostalgia makes these lists useless.

Like objectively I can't really support the idea that Tetris is a ""best game of all time"", like sure I get how important and influential the game was for the industry at the time, but I don't think that makes it among the ""best"".

Something can be influential and groundbreaking, but still be replaced by objectively better games they inspired."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Glad to see your shout outs to Zork and Terraria.

Most of this seems to fit my perception of what people have enjoyed, though I'm a little surprised Hollow Knight isn't in the top 20 or so, and shocked it's as low as 101.

Seeing Shadow of the Colossus up there. Damn I wish the PS4 remaster (And the Ico remaster from the PS3, and The Last Guardian) were available on PC."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"i think what this shows is that to get a GOTY or similar has more to do with being easy for reviewers to play, aka narratively driven or relatively easy games as a whole.

the list also heavily favour RPGs and FPS games, we only have a handful of strategy games, a lot of which are civilization."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Microsoft: We would like to buy you out.

Nintendo: Links MSFT to this list laughing their way to the bank."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Did I miss Terraria or is it not on here?
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Feel like Hearthstone would deserve a place in this list
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Halo 2 being #106 is actually insane
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Where in the hell is Terraria?

That's a travesty!

anyway, amazing work and great list, worthy of /r/dataisbeautiful."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I think it mostly works, with a few notable exceptions. StarCraft should probably be much higher, it’s a better game overall than say any GTA entry by far. Halo 2 should be way above Dishonored 2 (best MP Halo hands down). Fallout 3 is above Portal and KOTOR. BG2, perhaps the best CRPG of all time, should be smack dab next to Chrono Trigger. D:OS 2, Oblivion way above that is silly. Even DA: O righty above it is.

Deus Ex maybe should be top 20 because it transcends just about every other game story by teaching you about how the real world works (creeping centralization of power and authoritarianism).

Also no Tribes 2 😛"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,list is wrong no SSX tricky
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Gone Home higher than Spiderman and Sands of Time?  Game journalists really had a hard on for that boring piece of shit walking simulator.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Bro is doing the lord's work out here
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I could honestly swap Breath of the Wild and Outer Wilds.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Glad to see outer wilds on the list but I’d have it ranked higher than 99. Numbers are numbers though!
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Y'all need to stop trying to treat the list as a presentation of objective truth. The games are ranked as they are because the aggregated opinions of the reviewers and players work out that way. Arguing about what is ""correct"" is pointless because everyone's enjoyment of a game is massively impacted by their own experiences and when in their life they play it. Like 70% of the people you ask will tell you their favorite game was something they played as a kid. That's not because game develepment was objectively better then, they were just at a point in their life when it made a bigger impact."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Where the fuck is sekiro?
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Terraria should be in top 10
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,RD2 at 26 is a travesty
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Bloodborne as the highest Souls game. As it should be
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Shadow of the Colossus top 16, let's go!!!!!"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,No Super Mario Sunshine?? 😭
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Gotta love seeing FFX in the list.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,This is an awesome post!!!!!!!
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Nice list. But all this does is remind me of how lacking the modern gaming scene has been over recent years.

Back in 2006, I said to that this would be the last generation that I would buy all of the consoles on release. It really does seem prophetic looking back."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"So journalists prefered Journey to outer wilds or hades or other indie game ???? It's a nice experiment, but calling it the best indie game seems like a real overevaluation of it."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Very nice
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I'm concerned, what happened in 1983 for there to not be a high ranking game that year?"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Commenting so I can come back later. Awesome post!
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Deus Ex at #94 >_>
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Chrono Trigger too low. Throw the list away
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,alien isolation as the highest rated game of 2014 means the universe is healing
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Don't worry. I'll repost it tomorrow. I found my source information somewhere online but can't remember where.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Don’t worry, we’ll get another “what was a game you were disappointed by?” post within the hour"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,IKR?  This is awesome work by OP.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I’m so confused. Aren’t I supposed to be telling OP what his top 25 games says about him? What is this!?
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Do they want us to discuss what the list says about them or something else? It's been so long I've forgotten what to do.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I really hate how badly arcade games get ignored on these lists. So many of the best and most influential games from the first half of gaming history were arcade titles. Oh well!
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,it just brought a smile to my face to see it. many great memories.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"It should be top 20 tbh, incredibly unique and groundbreaking game. Truly nothing else like it."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Really hoping restitched does a good job of bringing that style of game to the modern era
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Yep, too bad the studio doesnt want anymore LBP anymore"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Other than Street Fighter II and COD Modern Warfare, every game above WoW on this list appears to be focused on the single player experience. They may feature multiplayer, but they have very strong single player. Maybe that's why WoW is only 31? I agree it's genre defining and has a huge player base."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"There are a lot of games that could be considered the GOAT of their genre that are way down on the list. From Blizzard alone Diablo 2 & Starcraft are both down around the 50 mark despite beng arguably the most culturally influential releases for both genres.

RTS in general is hugely snubbed with AoE2 down at like 120 and Warcraft 3 not even on the list, which is insane considering the impact it had on the whole gaming landscape (I get that custom games are hard to include on these kinds of lists, but how does Starcraft 2 make a list like this but not WC3?).

These genres just haven't been that relevant for the last 10 or more years so even the influential titles are thought of much later, especially since this is only looking at lists from the last 5 years."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"San Andreas is probably the best GTA for its time. It deserves to be up higher. I feel that GTAV is very good, but benefits from recency bias."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,">Also, World of Warcraft. Defined a genre for almost 20 years. But always seems to get shafted on lists like this.

It's the typical ""live long enough to become the villain"" type of thing, I think.

They had an extremely good track record - but they also had enough time to make a huge load of mistakes. And that obviously shifts the perspective on the game."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Thata because WoW isn't a game, it's a lifestyle"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"GTA 5 being so high in general seems really weird to me.  GTA 3 and GTA San Andreas both seem to be more cultural standouts, not sure what makes GTA 5 so worthy that its listed this high on so many rankings?"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"My first thought too, obviously I'm biased but the fact that every game in the same genre for the last 2 decades has had the goal to be the ""wow killer"" and failed really says something."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"For other series differentials, I was shocked to see such a big difference between FO3 and FO:NV. I think if you flipped their relative spots no one would really bat an eye. FO3 was better received on release but NV has aged a lot better in the eyes of fans"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,In what fucking universe is earning 31 out of *200* spots getting shafted? What a daft take.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"You’re misinterpreting the data. Lists like these just take an average of how people feel about a game, and it’s usually a recent feeling shortly after these games come out. 

Stuff like WoW defining a genre for 20 years(true) wouldn’t be included in these numbers, and the numbers reflect the fact that a lot of people simply don’t enjoy that genre of games *at all*. 

If you polled 1 million gamers today asked them to select games from a list that were extremely influential, and WoW was on that list, I’m sure it would rank very high.

Basically what I’m saying is that you’re right, but the list is also right. It’s like, by definition right since it’s simply averaging out ratings. It can’t however tell you the things you’re talking about(influence)."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Man big ups on that warcraft comment fr so true and it’s still the standard pretty much
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"CSGO isn't even on the list and Starcraft II isn't in the top 100.

It's interesting to me that some of the most iconic games ever made are just completely absent, but the bias is pretty clear: competitive RTS/FPS are not what these reviewers focus on."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"The fact that WoW isn't a top 5 game on *every* list is laughable. It was a cultural phenomenon. It's *still* a good game 19 years later. It *still* dominates an entire genre.

It is, in my opinion, the single greatest game ever made. It's timeless."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"The fundamental issue with lists like this (and by no means is this the fault of OP since they just aggregated other lists) is that they seem to mix up the concepts of ""best game"", and ""most influential game"" and throw them into one list. 

 If this is a list of best games, Tetris doesn't deserve to be anywhere near the top like it currently is. Tetris can be an enjoyable way to pass time, but it's hard to argue that it's better than most of the 195 other games on the list... If this was an influential game list, then it absolutely deserves to be there. 

But if this is an influential game list GTA5 as you said doesn't belong this high up when it is effectively just a derivative of all the other 3d GTA games, with the addition of some cover shooter and weapon wheel mechanics from other games that did it first. Perhaps you could argue that the multiplayer influenced a decade of horrible microtransactions and live service games... But I think usually these lists look for a positive influence..."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,The fact that GTAV is even in the top 20 is all I need to know about the quality of this ranking system.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"GTA games have always been a big deal. GTA3 changed video games, and pre-GTAV, San Andreas was nearly universally considered the best game in the franchise. Had to be there, I guess."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Interesting, what’s your personal top 10?"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"12/100 and couple of those only few hours. Made me realise how I have not played that many games, I just play same games long time."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,125 here. Didn't include ones I only played a few minutes. Maybe 130 if I did. Played everything in top 20 except last of us (played a few minutes only).
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Recent bias in action.  Certainly a product of reviews still being in traditional media and magazines at the time.  No one is going back on Metacritic to review games they played 20+ years ago.

Warcraft 3 spawned an entire genre of MOBAs in its wake and underpinned the most successful MMO of all time.  All while being super popular and revolutionary in its own right.  Features we take for granted today like automatic match making, ranked play, modding communities, etc. took giant leaps forward in that title. 

It is easily one of the top 10 if not top 5 most influential titles of all time."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I played multiple hundreds of games in my life, Warcraft 3 is still #1.

It's just objectively such a fucking good game, from the campaign, to the sound design, music, atmosphere, story, competitive potential, responsiveness, character design, innovativity relative to its time, the custom games, replayability, the legacy it left, how well it holds up today.

I'm sorry, but if a top 200 list doesn't include it, I can't take that list seriously. In no fucking universe 200 games are better than War3."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"League of legends and dota are on the list, both were spawned off Warcraft 3. The spirit of W3 lives on."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Any guesses as to why there was no top rated game of 1983?
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,[deleted]
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I will never understand the hype around this game. The universe was great. Unique and inovative. The gameplay not so much.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Terraria, Titanfall 2 and Sekiro didn’t make it either. You"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Outer Wilds shares some of that DNA and is on here. Both excellent games
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I've never seen Guild Wars on any of these lists, which I feel should at the very least be an honorable mention. One of the better MMO experiences that didnt even require a subscription, yet still had a ton of content."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Can't think of another singleplayer game in recent memory that I enjoyed as much as Subnautica, though I do feel that going in blind is a huge prerequisite for fully enjoying the game. If all the of the wildlife and progression has been spoiled already, it'd be nowhere near as fun."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"it's honestly such a perfect game in what it tries to accomplish, one of the few games i'd rate a 10"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,I remember those dungeons taking me forever when I was a kid. My roommate's girlfriend played it for the first time in college and was just blowing through it with a strategy guide.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,I played it (the 3DS version) for the first time last year and it’s one of my favourite games of all time.

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"So deserved, and I think they didn't even factor in the 2 expansions that many consider even better than the main game."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,It’s probably because Fallout 3 mostly worked at launch so it’s easier to review higher. Fallout New Vegas was a disaster at launch.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Everyone says NV is better, and I don't doubt that, but I could never get into it as much as 3. I tried twice, about 10 years apart, and didn't get far. Fallout 3 on the other hand, I played that so much that it largely contributed to two red ringed Xboxes. I also played it within the last few years, and got all the way through all DLCs and got most achievements again."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"New Vegas grew in popularity over time. Pretty much everyone I knew didn’t like it much when it came out, including me. But, a couple of years later I picked it up and tried again and fell in love and is now one of my favorites ever. I think Fallout 3 is very Bethesda, immediately addicting and awesome and super fun world to just be in. New Vegas is one that takes time to get into but I think is so much more rewarding once you do."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I agree with the placement but also agree that you would not have thought it would be that way round considering comments on many forums.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Fallout 3 was honestly a much more memorable experience for me. I remember most of the possible companions in FO3 and several notable NPC's, the most memorable thing I remember about FONV was the start, the ranger base I spoke to three NPC's using the same voice actor within two minutes of each other and then the ending I got.

People love New Vegas because it was obsidian returning to the franchise to fix Bethesda's ""shortcomings"". It fell flat for me."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Perfect Dark was better than Goldeneye in all areas, yet Goldeneye is top 4p and Perfect Dark isnt listed. Perfect Dark added the ability to play against bots which I thought was huge at the time."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I, like most, agree NV is far superior but it’s not too difficult to see why many rank 3 higher. The bugs and lack of polish in NV made it so much harder to enjoy. Yeah 3 was still a Bethesda game with all its warts but at least it functions. Even to this day, I reinstall NV sometimes with a bunch of stability mods and it still crashes every 2 seconds."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"At the time, Fallout 3 was insane. Fallout NV came late in the console lifespan, was seen as ‘DLC’ by some, was a buggy mess at launch, and to the laymen wasn’t ‘wow’ enough after Fallout 3. It also didn’t have the same marketing and hype around it. All that said; NV is a way better game than 3 without a doubt in my mind"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"3 sold way, way more and was a flagship title for a new generation of consoles. NV is basically a great expansion for 3. It’s better for sure but was built so heavily on fo3 that it pales in comparison"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"New Vegas may be be the better game, but its still fundamentally a derivative sequel to Fallout 3, which meant that it was never in a position to be as disruptive to the industry as FO3.  Its harder to appreciate now that open world action-RPGs are so ubiquitous that the success of a traditional CRPG like Baldur's Gate III is considered newsworthy, but there was a time when the shift from traditional RPG combat (as poorly defined as that is) to action combat was deeply controversial.  Some of it comes down to timing, but between the weird-ass VATS system tricking RPG players into playing an FPS and the physics-based gore vanity cam tricking dudebros into playing an RPG, Fallout 3 is arguably the game most responsible for the industry shifting towards ARPGs and away from traditional RPGs."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Not me, I thought 3 was way better but I agree it seems to be an unpopular opinion these days. My reason is that 3 has a more emotional and cohesive story where as New Vegas has a really strong opening and then it seems like the main story quickly unravels into a bunch of side quests."

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"The joke was you could watch a Saturday morning cartoon in the time it took to go through most doors in New Vegas.

The joke didn't exaggerate much.

Perceptions of the game improve exponentially as the perspective person tried it later in time."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,New Vegas had poorer ratings on release because of how buggy it was and the poor performance. Once the patches fixed it however it was vastly superior to fallout 3 in every way.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Played FO3 to death and loved it. NV just... wasn't it, it felt like a half baked expansion pack with an entirely different setting tone and texture, it wasn't bad at all but it wasn't what I liked or wanted so it hardly even got 10 hours of play from me compared to 100+ for FO3.

I just assume it's a different strokes thing but I can't help but roll my eyes whenever I see revisionist history posting about NV bring the best FO."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,RS never gets its due respect as far as I'm concerned. It was massive and was one of the most defining games of the 00s.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"That game thought me how to type fast, and mix in British spelling now and then so I have to self correct."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Warband might just be janky enough that it's fine not to be in a top 200, although it's a blast. Heroes 3 and Factorio missing is criminal though.

Or Paradox games like EU4, CK2/3..."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,HoM&M3 not making the list is criminal
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Haven't played Heroes of Might and Magic, but those first 4 absolutely deserve a spot on the list. 

Rimworld especially is such an awesome game"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"As a Gothic fan I'm not even surprised, I know the series is not popular / remembered enough to make it into such lists with way more popular games. Best games are subjective and sometimes not the most well known."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"HOMM still plays beautifully today which is more than I can say from almost any other game in that time period. The spritework and pixel art gives it a truly timeless look that is more colorful and vivid than most games on the market today.

Anyone who's interested in diving back in: it's still every bit as good as it was in the 90s. It's actually better, as there are some dedicated modders out there who have made HD patches, rebalanced the original, and created entire add-on campaigns and new castles. Look up HOMM HOTA if you haven't yet!"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,New World Computing and 3DO being robbed here.  Might and Magic / Heroes was a staple of PC gaming in the 90's.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,I put some hours into that game as well.  I realized after looking at this list that my game time must have dropped considerably after the late 90s.  I played every top game of the year on this list from 1980 to 1997.  From 1998 to 2022 I've only played 7 of them.  Clearly adulthood has ruined my gamer status.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Was also looking for Heroes 3. To me it is still one of the best turn based strategy games 24 years later. I think it is also the best selling game of all time on gog.com
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I was personally shocked command and conquer wasn't on the list at all....

Lucasarts, Sierra, Bullfrog, Westwood Studios, Interplay, Origin, and more.  

I'm pretty sure at least half of those names gave us multiple quality genre-defining releases."

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Like Guitar Hero was a phenomenon.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I was thinking exactly the same.

I said it elsewhere, but there was a several-years-long period where the original Medal of Honor was the #1 rated PC game across the board, even displacing Half Life and Deus Ex. I didn't like it myself, never understood the hype.

Freespace (Conflict: Freespace as I knew it, literally learned the Descent part just now because I thought you'd got something wrong or I was remembering wrong) was absolutely amazing, as was the sequel. They do not make games like that any more."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,">Games I would've expected based on their rep at the time would've included Earl Weaver Baseball from circa 1986-87; Wolfenstein 3-D from 1993; The Secret of Monkey Island from 1991 (ish); Falcon 3.0 from 1990 or thereabouts; Wing Commander from 1993, FIFA International Soccer from 1994; Descent: Freepspace from 1998-ish.

M.U.L.E. The Ultima and Wizardry series. The Roberta Williams/Sierra adventures (Kings Quest, Space Quest, et. al), lots of formative titles missing here. 

That's kind of to be expected though. No list like this can be expected to capture historical context across a 40+ year span."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,One gaming magazine I read back in the day gave its highest score ever to total annihilation yet no mention of any rts on this list
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"secret of monkey island and wolfenstein 3d not being in the top 200 is seriously fucked.

like, they're clear top 100 games too. PC got screwed."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Right? HoMM3 wasn't played by the critics when it was new it seems. That's the only explanation for why it's not on this list. It was such a great game for its time that I still play here and there over two decades later.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Half Life Alyx is VR and made the list. Newer games are naturally disadvantaged and there’s not really a good way to fix this without giving them some type of consolation points for lists they weren’t yet released for—but I also can’t just assume they would’ve been on those lists.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"PC gaming is less accessible. The reach of Nintendo consoles is insane. People who haven't played a game won't vote for it no matter how good it is.

PC-exclusives also include the more complex games that were too hard to develop for console as well as indie games that benefitted from PC being a more open platform. Having a smaller audience is inherent to both."

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,It's probably outshined by ce and 3 because people don't tend to choose multiple games from the same franchise when selecting the best games of all time
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Halo 2 did a lot of things great but had plenty of missteps that I think sour people on it. And I say this as someone who thinks its much better than its reputation (its my second favorite in the series).

Things Halo 2 disappointed at upon release:

1. A lot of people were very upset at what they thought were ""false promises"" about fighting on Earth. Previews promised a whole campaign when it turned out to just be two missions.

2. The fact that you don't play as Master Chief the whole game upset fans who were not expecting the Arbiter gameplay

3. Story that became a little to complex for its own good only made worse by a frustrating cliffhanger that left a lot of people confused.

4. Difficulty that was perceived as punishing at best and unfair at worst (does anyone like sniper alley?) combined with some really atrocious level design even considering this is a series that has struggled with level design in most of the titles.

5. New features that weren't very revolutionary and sometimes just bad, dual wielding, damagable vehicles, no health, etc...

Halo 2 should get praise for what it did, and xbox live was clearly a killer app. But at the time it was widely seen as a disapointment based on Halo CE's promise.

I think the bigger Halo related issue with this list isn't halo 2's position but the complete lack of Halo: Reach which is in my opinion the best game in the series."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Jackal Snipers alone knocked halo 2 down 50 spots on the list
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"UT2k4 definetly one of the best arcade multiplayer shooters ever made! Strange we haven't even gotten a remaster yet. Since ow2 got ruined I have a big hole for arcade shooters, would play the hell out of it"

I wonder how many people"

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,This made me look for UT99. How tf is that not on here either? Like how is there no UT game at all??
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Ocarina of Time absolutely deserves all the praise it gets though.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,This list took into account user reviews
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,As do players.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,feel like I'm the only guy on earth to have never touched a Zelda game
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I mean, for good reason. Even the ""bad"" Zelda's (Skyward Sword, Phantom Hourglass, Spirit Tracks) are generally considered well above average, and not just by critics but by users as well.

I was plenty critical of Skyward Sword, with  it's repeating areas and iffy motion controls, but even then it's a solid 8.5 out of 10 for me. The dungeon and puzzle design is still better than any other single player adventure game I can think of from that generation (besides maybe Okami). If a title like that is a low point for a 30+ year old franchise, then that franchise deserves a MASSIVE amount of praise."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,It's almost like they're pretty good games
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Zelda games are world renowned with critics and fans alike and have been for a very long time.

There's a reason for that. They are phenomenal games."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"They're usually genre and generation defining games that sell millions across different continents.

Even the lowest rated Zelda games are usually in the top 3rd of a console's top games."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I honestly don't get it. I never played a Zelda game and felt like I was missing out. I then finally played BotW a year ago. It wasn't bad, but I wasn't overly impressed either. The world is fairly atmospheric, but also relatively empty and at times even lifeless. The shrines are kind of fun, but get repetitive quite fast. They are mostly rather similar. The weapon degradation mechanic is incredibly overbearing. The story isn't bad, but felt rather minimal. The combat and playing around with the physics was fun though.

Still, to have BotW as top 2 best games of all-time just isn't even close to my taste. I seriously don't get it. Decent game, nothing revolutionary or extraordinary in my opinion. Same for a lot of the rest of the list to be honest, none of the games I have in my top 10 got near the top 10."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Ocarina of time is still the most perfect game I’ve ever played. At the time it came out it was miiiiiiles better than anything I’ve ever seen with the exception of maaaaybe Mario 64 which would still be a distant second.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,People are gonna rip on it but tbh imo it still holds up. At least much better than most games from that console generation. Its easy to hate on now for the same reason friends is. OoT is a game that was huge and influenced almost every game that came after it so if you’re a newer gamer its easy to compare it to things that worked off the same formula
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Be ready for 25y-old graphics, and moderately cheese writing. Beyond that, allow yourself to get swallowed up by the adventure. It's my own personal nr 1, shoulder-to-shoulder with BG2."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"It’s my favorite game of all time. 

I’m sure a lot of my love is because I got it when I was 13 and it blew my mind. I remember that Christmas break I stayed inside almost the entire time playing that game. 

The time jump was something I was not expecting and the world just felt so huge to me."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"There is a PC port, better in almost everything"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"It honestly hasn't aged very well in my opinion.  It's still a good game, but the problems with the game that are there really stand out today. Nintendo recognized a lot of those things quickly, and removed most of them by the time Majora's Mask came around.

OoT has a problem where there's a lot of down time that doesn't add anything to the game.  Waiting on certain enemies to let you attack them feels bad when you have limited time to play.  The long travel time between places before you get all the teleport songs. Hyrule field is just very big and empty.  Push blocks being very slow, and sometimes very long to get into place.

It also houses some of the worst dungeons in the entire franchise, in Forest Temple and Jabu Jabu's belly.  Granted, there are still a lot of positives about it.  But there's a lot of things that haven't aged well that people don't talk about when it comes to OoT."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,You think Factorio is a game? Don't be so silly.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Factorio was such an *incredible* game for the 20-30 hours I got out of it. 

But after a torturous 2 days not being able to shut my eyes without seeing conveyors I never touched it again. One of the worst night's sleep ever."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Had to scroll too far to find Factorio referenced.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"No time to write reviews, the factory must grow"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Super metroid is wayyyyyy to low. That is an almost perfect game. Just completed it last year, never gotten to play it during the snes age, so did it in switch online and loved every single minute of it. Dread gets close but is too linear."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I'm not the biggest fan of RPGs, and if I like them, it's usually the other stuff they bring to the table, like Divinity OS 2, which is my favorite game.

I finally got around to Chrono Trigger in 2020. That game is insane. It took a couple hours to get used to the older mechanics, but once I did, the game is a solid 10/10. The music, the story, the characters, the sidequests, the alternate endings. The gameplay was great too. I sat through 2 1/2 playthroughs before I touched another game, and I plan on going back eventually."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,I am unhappy that Symphony of the Night is as low as it is but I honestly could only make a legitimate case for a very small number of games above it that it is better than.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Braid blew my mind. And then to add a great twist on top of that was just so darkly perfect.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,What’s Braid about?
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Do it! It’s good
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,It is
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"YES YES YES !!!!! 

Seriously these games are fun as hell and the Switch has a pretty good selection of games. 

You have the modern open world Zeldas in Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, you have the HD version of Skyward Sword (traditional 3D Zelda) and you have the remake of Link’s Awakening (2D Zelda). You can also play Ocarina of Time, Majora’s Mask, the Oracle games and Minish Cap through the premium Nintendo Online subscription and A Link to the Past, the original Zelda and Zelda 2 with the base subscription. 

Pretty much the only noteworthy games you can’t play on the Switch are Twilight Princess and Wind Waker."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Just gonna add my 2 cents that I personally find my self motivated by narratives in video games and I’ve tried to play every Zelda and never made it more than 6 hours in (besides Ocarina as a kid).

They aren’t for everyone imo."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"It wasn't out yet for 25% of the media rankings sample OP used, so it can be partially explained by that. For Elden Ring it's even more than that."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Sekiro is a must play game imo because it shows you how much you can improve. You don't need to finish it In a set time , just don't give up on it and keep trying. You will eventually beat that boss .  And when you do , and then eventually replay the game, you realize that you can now beat the boss that took you 50 tries to beat on the first time on the first try."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"If you asked me to name The Best Game, I would think of Sekiro before anything except maybe Tetris."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Sekiro is a better game than Elden Ring, there I said it"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,">Not a single non-blizzard rts game?

 There is Age of Empires 2 at rank 122."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"No WC1, 2 or 3 and none of the Command and Conquers. Red Alert has to be an all time."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Everquest always gets the shaft in these all-time lists. 

The people who made WoW?  Yeah I remember playing with them (Legacy of Steel) on Nameless. 

I know AC was first, but EQ was the game that really launched the genre into the mainstream consciousness. The lack of respect it gets historically is kinda sad, like it’ll be forgotten completely once my generation dies out"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,The original Counter Strike is number 120 and Team Fortress 2 is at 117
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,It’s such a mainstream list. Everything is what was popular at the time. I get that it is popular because stuffs good but the flaw is good stuff that is not popular won’t make a list like this
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,WC3 not being listed is really absurd. But speaking of rts: Erm... Where is Dune 2?
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Sorry for being pedantic, but tower defense and the precursors to mobas existed in StarCraft UMS maps before WC3 was ever released."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Bunch of highly rated PC indie games not on the list.  No Mount and Blade, Kerbal Space Program, Project Zomboid, Rimworld, ~~FTL~~ or Factorio among others I've probably missed."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,The vast majority of reviewers came nowhere close to beating it.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Binding of Isaac not being here is probably my only gripe. Especially seeing so many other indie games present. BoI is THE best roguelike, paved the way for others that are present on the list like Hades. I understand that the approach is data driven, so I think this says more about games media not including it than it does about any of OPs rationale"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I get what you're saying, but V has a lot more cultural impact and is the 2nd best selling game of all time. And even though san andreas aged really well in some ways, it aged really poorly in others."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Spyro needs to be there, although it was released the same year as Ocarina of Time"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"The same can be said about Pokemon. As iconic as red and blue are, those games are broken as shit and later iterations are so much more polished. Hell even leaf green and fire red are a huge improvement on the originals. But nostalgia be a hell of a drug"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Then what about Metal Gear Solid at #7? Mario 64 at #9? Have those aged all that well?
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I was looking for this. Super Mario Kart (1992) wasn't that popular at all and isn't very good. Mario Kart 64 (1996) was incredible and somehow not on the list at all? (I will also accept double dash)

I can only imagine people think Mario Kart 64 is actually Super Mario Kart since that is the first one they know in the series. Otherwise I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. 

Super Mario Kart (1992) is garbage to mediocre. No game deserves to be on a list if it's sequel made the original completely obsolete (or at least higher than the more popular sequel, like how Portal 2 is higher than portal...)"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Because games age differently than movies . Old games usually miss a lot of qol stuff we take for granted today , like fast travel , no durability/inventory limit, minimaps and many other things you just don't think about because every game usually has them 

Movies don't suffer from that . Aside from cgi and visual quality, a movie filmed and edited  on 30 year old hardware wouldn't be so different from the same movie filmed and edited on modern hardware."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,That’s a super cool website
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Having played the whole top 10, CP2077 2.0+Phantom Liberty is above Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and would be in there now. I’m entirely serious. It is brutally underrated. If it launched like this, with PL, it would have been GOTY."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Just beat Cyberpunk 2077 an hour ago, it’s a masterpiece."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I get why they're not, based on how OP collected his data. Also explains why New Vegas is 60+ spots below Fallout 3, despite NV being better in every conceivable way."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Gamer in my 40s, Cyberpunk not being on here isn't just a crime. It's a warcrime."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,BoTW at 2nd place and Outer Wilds at 99th place is shocking.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,NGB: possibly the best third person combat engine & combat design EVER.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"The Bioshock love is utterly baffling to me. I played it on release and had a good time, but forgot it very quickly. I can think of a bunch of similar first person games that were better to play and more memorable."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I think it would be nearly impossible to get an agreed upon top 10. Games never age well. Even the best ones are worse now than on release.

But, given that, BotW seems like a fairly safe pick. And I mean that literally. It's extremely polished in basically every area, from gameplay to story to visuals. It's one of the few games where it's really hard to find generally objective critiques. That's why it's here; lots of other games have flaws that will push them out of the top 10 on various lists, whereas BotW is a safe inclusion on all of them.

Also it did all that on the Wii U, so given that handicap I think #2 is justifiable."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Agreed.

Combined with FTL, they are the best example showing that you can create the feeling of ""exploration"" while being the opposite of an open world game.

On top of that, STS is mechanically distinct and fun enough that it spawned an entire ecosystem of STS-likes. And even though it was released almost 5 years ago, I still think it is the best of its kind."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"OoT is like Citizen Kane. We all just collectively agreed it's the best and we just don't question it. It's not my favorite game, but if I saw The Witcher 3 above it, I would think ""That's not right""."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,GTA 5 at 3rd is weird to me.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"The weapon break feature nearly ruined the game for me. BOTW and OOT are awesome games, for sure, but the greatness of Zelda started with A Link To The Past for me. Man, what a game!"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I feel like elden ring would be much higher but it released after half of these articles came out so the fact its at the 60 spot is pretty crazy
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,This is the problem I have with greatest game ever lists - they're scored on how good they were for their era and also just nostalgia. Like is Zelda OOT still the best game we have in 2023? It would be interesting to see the top 100 lists of the younger generations in comparison to millennials.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Don't worry , as long as you are having fun you are doing it right"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Compared to most other games on this list it's quite obscure. The fact it's in here speaks for it's quality I think.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Same. I play Suikoden I and II every couple years. The nostalgia just hits different.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I wasn't expecting top 10, but not seeing terraria on this list at all is surprising."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"No terraria was incredibly surprising, i feel like nowadays its even more popular than a lot of games on there (or at least it has a very active and dedicated fan base)"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"For real, I'm not really a fan of the Xenoblade games, Xenogears is one of the greatest though."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"It's a crime, really."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Making good games makes people believe you make good games. This and other news at 11.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Is it really that biased? Zelda has always been the benchmark for single player dungeon crawling and puzzle solving, and Mario basically invented the modern day 3D platformer. 

Skyward Sword is considered one of the worst 3D Zelda's (and I agree with that statement), yet I still can't think of a single adventure title from that console generation with better designed dungeon and puzzle mechanics than that one outside of Okami. If that title is considered a low point for a franchise, then I don't really understand how people can think that it's overhyped or biased."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"What is up with r/gaming's heavy anti-Nintendo slant? I've seen like several posts on this thread wondering why Nintendo has so many highly rated games. A lot of these games are just obviously good. I have heard people love and consider Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask their favorites for decades. Same with games like Super Mario 64, Galaxy, Odyssey. Same with Metroid and Metroid Prime.

Anyone who grew up gaming throughout the 90s, 2000s, and 2010s just... shouldn't be surprised that Nintendo dominates a large part of this list."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"It's because these ""all time"" lists are heavily swayed by nostalgia and Nintendo ruled the community for a long time."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"i mean, honestly, the fact that basic games like that make it so high is a testament to how important they are in the grand schemes of things. 

Is tetris a graphically impressive game? Is it the most techinically challenging game of its time? probably not in both cases, but its impact on gaming as a whole gets it so much credit.  Its a game that EVERYONE AND THEIR MOTHERS have played.  Its has world wide recognition.  It is a game that has inspired other newer puzzle games.  

In the micro is tetris the #5 game of all time. No.  In the Macro? Does it deserve top billing, HELL TO THE YES."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Tetris is amazing
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Completely agree with you. Just played through the remake actually, and while I enjoyed a lot about it, the gameplay and map design was ridiculously simple and not really worthy of top 25 *of all time* considering some of the games with both amazing gameplay and other aspects as well."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Gameplay wise, sure. But writing and design?"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,There is a remaster with improved controls if that’s what’s bothering you.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,The hate around the sequel is because of the poor story direction
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Thought the same thing until I saw someone mention this takes in user reviews, Part 2 got raided with bad reviews because it was “woke”"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Masterpiece, think I've actually played it 50 times over."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Absolutely, I was just thinking the same thing! The first one has a very classic button-mashy vibe but the second is an actual game with a lot of interesting mechanisms and tons of replayability"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Same dude! And I don't say that lightly!
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,">No FPS would be on this list were not for Half-Life

Uh.. DOOM existed before Half-Life did. I'm not arguing that Half-Life wasn't a revolutionary game, but even Half-Life has to give credit to games that which came before it, and inspired it."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Deus Ex is 74, this list is criminal... Still interesting though."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Most games are recent but not so recent as to not have had time to be on lists, they overlook/underrate most old greats."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Ita say ""best"" game not ""most influential"" or ""most popular"" game, but it is clear that those distinctions are not well defined at all across the sources."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"> Sources are biased mostly by being recent. 

Wildly disagree. Doom, Half-Life, etc. Whenever they list ""all-time"" they are biased towards nostalgia, ie age or at least age of series (Zelda, Mario)."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Yeah hl1 being that low is really surprising. Hl2 should even be a bit higher.  There's no way biohock if better than hl2
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"not deniyng recency bias here, that certainly exists.

but a game can be a genre definer/creator or popularizer, and still NOT hold the test of time.

Whatever half life holds up(the original, not black mesa) is up to you, i personally dont think it holds up to well. and a ""game of all times"" needs to at least partially account for ""what if its played today"". You can give older games leeway in graphics and presentation, but if otheraspects that are not explained by ""its old"" are worse then contemporary today then thats that."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"BOTW = yes

Ocarina of Time = no"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Lmao said like a true Redditor.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,It will be higher for sure
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"By that logic, 99% of these games will be dogshit because VG are an evolving art form. You have no understanding of how these lists are made."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,The problem with a lot of these lists is that it factors its impact by the time it was released. Was it the best game in 1998? It probably is. Is the the best game in 2023? Highly doubt it.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Ignorance.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Give it 5 years. It will be very high on these lists
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,It was probably compiled from lists that don't have it yet listed as it's brand new and hasn't received GOTY yet
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Too much water bro
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I thought I was the only one. I get massively downvoted for saying this but im glad to see im not the only one with this opinion.
I dont even think its a bad game, its just mid."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Just beat this one and I was really impressed, they finally made a scary Resident Evil game!"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Definitely not above DS1 in my opinion. I don't know why there is such a spread there, let alone how it got above."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Recency bias. Lmao.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Yep it's now my #1 personally.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I have it ahead of BOTW easily at 2 but not Ocarina of Time, that game deserves it's crown."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"It's almost as if  
(don't hold your breath)  
a game's popularity is correlated with its quality."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,We're blood brothers.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Nah it ain’t :) 
The fact that it is basically okay for all ages, is a quintessential adventure with fully open world and exploration unseen in a game before it, (that games like Genshin Impact ripped off because it was so great and groundbreaking at the time) is what makes it such a great game.
If it’s not your particular favorite, at least get your insult right.
Zelda isn’t just for kids. And Breath of the Wild is not very overrated."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Lmao brain rot comment.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Stop being afraid of fun.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I'd go further and say it wasn't a ""good story"". It has great dialogue, and amazing performances. But the story overall isn't that good."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,I hear that.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I have played a lot of Zelda and I know I am in the minority of people in the same situation as me, but BotW is just more fun to play than any of the other Zeldas. I absolutely loved the stories of like OoT and Majora's Mask, but even as a kid when they were all I had, the puzzles felt nonsensical and the back and forth felt frustrating"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Lmao its literally the best Zelds game and its not even close. You are in such a tiny minority but you think you’re loud because you’re screeching.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"By this logic, all these games will mage outdated in like 30 years. This is an evolving art form. Nostalgia is part of the bias but also these games are good in general."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I completely agree about The Talos Principle. I’m almost finished with TTP2, and it’s different but equally magnificent."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I hate Destiny. Play it every day.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Obviously

I am a PC user , I usually prefer mouse and keyboard , and I am telling you that you can just plug In a controller. It's not that bad"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"The underwater location, bringing immersive sim gaming to the masses, the graphics were really impressive for their time (the way water moved and flowed looked great as well), the story was decent. The world, art, sound design and gameplay all meshed together really well."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Probably the setting and story
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"You guys are downvoting him, but he's right!"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Im a huge Zelda fan and was incredibly entertained by it. Fantastic story with fun characters, simple but effective gameplay mechanics and side quests that made the world more homely.

See, I can do it too.  Now tell everybody how you really feel."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Because it’s mid as fuck, thats why."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Boo hoo.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,I had fun doing it!
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Wtf is starcraft? There is your answer right there.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,So brave.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Well yes, you’re free to take these rankings with a grain of salt. This is just an interesting exercise meant to show what patterns exist across these types of rankings, it’s not a definitive list nor is it meant to be viewed as objective."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Still too recent, released after many of these lists were written."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I started gaming back in the Commodore 64 days. I can’t believe how much I keep enjoying games as they get released each year. 
I personally find my gaming experience so fulfilling, especially the past couple of years. Most recently have fallen in love with Cyberpunk and Elden Ring. 
There’s no doubt that the classics were great in their day but more modern gaming absolutely rocks … to me at least."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Nostalgia plays a huge part.  Modern games have never been better, especially this year."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Man that's wild. I can still play OoT it holds up so well. Yes it's showing its age but when I played it on release it was life changing. Gaming was never the same and it shaped the genre. When I played Elden Ring I beat Godrick or w/e his name was and lost interest. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Although great, I do agree that BOTW is a bit overrated."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,(Fantastic work btw)
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Amiga games getting some love warms my heart
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Zero dawn is like 129. Bit HONESTLY surprised it's not higher.

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,What are your personal top 10?
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Yeah 28 is ridiculously low. I believe IGN or some other major game site had a top 100 or 200 recently and Mario World was #1. That must have not been included in this dataset for some reason.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,My 1st ever pc game that came as a bundle with a new pc
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I'll make sure to compile the top selling games from 20xx , remove the sports games / cod , / pokemon and say that 20xx was one of the best years for gaming ever"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Post it as a low quality screenshot.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Can you make it truthful too? Can't have halo 2 below any halo
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"What was a game you were disappointed by...that was on the list?

Gotcha"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Don't forget ""What was a game you liked but others didn't?"" and vice versa"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I’ve screen capped like the entire post and sent it to many of my friends this is gold
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"As far as I can tell, he has good taste and no job."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"It’s not a perfect comparison at all, but it’s like silent film and movies with sound.  The arcade experience was undoubtedly hugely influential to all of gaming as we know it, but the last two cultural generations don’t really even have a reference point for it."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Not super shocking. They had a huge influence, but I'd rather play just about any game on the SNES than most classic arcade games, and I love arcades.

I worked at one when I was 16-20, and a common sight was a 50 year-old getting excited to see the old games, head over, sit down for 15 minutes, then look bored, get up and leave.

Outside of Breakout, Centipede, and a few others which hold up and are still just extremely fun in 2023. Those games were always taken and had a few extra people watching."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Just out of curiosity, which games are you referring to?

Funny enough, I went the largest arcade in America last week (Galloping Ghost) and played a couple of these games. I was pretty upset I couldn't find Marvel vs. Capcom 2. Maybe it was out of service."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"We are addicted to lists for some reason, but if there's something that's really not fit to be ranked, it's video games as such. ""Which is better, Last of Us or Tetris?"" is a nonsense question to start with. It's like asking ""Which is better, Sushi, Albert Einstein, or the color green?"" Completely different categories.

Then again video games don't restrain themselves to genres, either, there's a reason the Steam catalogue is mostly tag-based nowadays and some award categories continue to be absolute jokes due to the games they mix together (looking at you, Crusader Kings not winning best strategy because of MS Flight Sim being in the category, too)."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Absolutely. Fired up my PS3 the other day to play it again. It’s still amazing. An updated version with crisp resolution and better frame rate is at the top of my wishing list…
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Unique, yes.

I wouldn't say groundbreaking.

Couch co-op just got a little funky after it came out but I always found it a bit boring. I'm glad others like it."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I think most of these lists kinda ignore MMORPGs in favor of single player story based games. With special exceptions for shooters and fighting games. 

But I think the reason is because most of compelling nature of mmorpgs and the motivation to continue to play is dependent on the social circle you engage with. Someone who plays WoW or Eve: Online probably won’t play long if they don’t get involved in a solid clan or corp or group. 

MMORPGs, when you take away the MMO part don’t always hold up against the others on the list. They are a different breed."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I feel it's really hard to quantify how good a multiplayer game is, since it's so intrinsically linked to each one's own personal experience that's going to vary wildly depending on when they started to play it, how good the servers were, how toxic other players were in their servers, how many mods and customization options were available/allowed on those servers and probably other factors that haven't even crossed my mind.

WoW has an even greater variable considering how long it's running, player experiences in each time and expansion is going to be very different."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"The tricky thing with live service games/MMOs/multiplayer games in general is that they tend to make decisions that result in them getting worse over time

See recently: Diablo 4, which everyone seemed to dig at first"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Definitely a hard game to compare others to
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Tetris is repping hard for the ever popular puzzle genre though
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,The real crime is that brood war isn't on the list
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"GTA3 was the landmark game that changed the series and revolutionized the open world genre. It's the most significant GTA game, albeit no longer the absolute best. Kind of like debating Breath of the Wild vs. Tears of the Kingdom. TOTK is the better game, but there's no TOTK without BOTW. GTA3 is the definitive GTA game. Everything else is built on that foundation."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I feel like V has been on the radar for so long almost only because of online multiplayer. It really increases replayability. Nothing against that, but I played single player V once and never went back. And I wasn't nearly as engaged and immersed as I was in San Andreas."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"GTAs specifically seem to hit very differently for people from other times and places.

I grew up in the 80s, so the soundtrack and ambiance of Vice City made it for me the best GTA of them all. San Andreas on the other hand, since I grew up somewhere where the Rap and Hip Hop culture had zero impact, I had a really hard time identifying with it (plus the MC is a little bitch being pushed around by everybody lol)"

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"WoW was definitely the most mainstream MMO but that's a double edged sword since we're talking about a genre whose roots are quite niche. It's easy for familiarity to become contempt when quite a few of your most hardcore guildies would probably rather be playing guild wars or runescape or everquest or even their old mud but they feel ""stuck"" with WoW because that's where their buddies migrated to. Ultimately though I actually think 31st is fine and if anything Command & Conquer, Warcraft II/III & Starcraft got shafted worse."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,GTA V got nothing on GTA SA story.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,The amount of money it made 😉
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,It's been relevant for over a decade at this point. That sticks in people's minds.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,GTA 3 and SA were great games but not relevant for a decade games.

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"> competitive RTS/FPS are not what these reviewers focus on.

Morrowind is better than Skyrim, minus modern creature comforts.

Baldur's Gate 2 is better than most modern RPGs, but with old if brilliant game dngine.

A beautiful immersive 3D chess adventure game the world has never really known before. After it sold like crazy, could even get this junky parody game called Pyst *in stores*.

There's 170 other games above Myst on this list"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,100%. The world of games has changed monumentally since the likes of Warcraft 3 and many other old genre defining games. Many of which are ignored or put so low on the list to be a little insulting. BoTW is maybe a top 50 game while Half-Life somehow doesn't make Top 50.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"WC3 deserves top 10 at least for the impact it had on gaming, people still play DotA, LoL (and WoW) to this day. And also it's like a top 10 game based on its on merit."

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Industry wide collapse caused by ET, maybe?  That or just forgot by the author."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Um, if you didn’t know, Bioshock 4 is in development. Whether it’ll be good or not with a completely new team at the helm is anyone’s guess."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Honestly as I’ve gotten older I feel like infinite shows/has way more problems than 2 whereas the only issue with 2 I have these days is that sometimes it can feel a bit too safe. Infinite tried to do too much without really achieving any of their goals aside from Elizabeth really innovating in the gaming industry and porn
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,I have never in my life heard someone say that infinite is better then 2.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Its not dead: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_Chamber_(company)

""Year ---Title ---------------------- Platform(s)

TBA --- **Untitled BioShock game**	 --- TBA"""
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Things that are good don't need to get milked until they lose all relevance they once had. Let bioshock be good and let it inspire new things or let the studio make a new good ip.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"2 was fine, it was an extension of one which made it tolerable. Infinite was like playing a different franchise. I was shooting rocket launchers and was recharging Halo shields before the first set piece. No tension, no drama, no mystery just explosions."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,">Infinite had problems, but was vastly better than BioShock 2

I don't think I could disagree with a gaming opinion any harder. Infinite has absolute dogshit gameplay compared to 2. Like the design decisons in Infinite just had me angry the whole time I was playing it. Maybe the worst game I have ever played to completion."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Which game, Bioshock? I mean, it depends on the time you’re viewing it from. Sure, now it’s gameplay might not be considered something special, but 2007 was a different time"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Going back now, Bioshock 2 is much more playable by modern standards as it refined on all the aspects of the original. It might not have ~[The Twist]~ of the first game but imo it's the better of the trilogy"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,The first Bioshock's gameplay was definitely innovative when it came out. No other game before it did Special Abilities + FPS as well.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Wow you're right, I'm also shocked Titanfall 2 isn't up there! One of the best FPS campaigns ever"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Sekiro not making the list surprises me most of that set. Terraria and Titanfall 2 I'm not *terribly* surprised missed the cut because they're both more grassroots ""fan favorites"" than they were super notable critical darlings, but Sekiro I feel like was both a critical darling *and* had a big community around it."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Terraria is literally one of the best selling games of all time and is famous for all the free updates it's released.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Terraria not making the list is a crime. Blows my mind that it's not here.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I was so glad Outer Wilds was on here, just finished it and it’s definitely one of my favourites"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Agreed. I went in with the only thing I knew being that it took place underwater. Best single player gaming experience I think I've ever had.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Playing a puzzle game with a strategy kind is ruinous.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Sorry about being born, guys :("
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Wind's howling
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,It's true.  I bought it and stopped playing right away cause I thought it was a buggy mess.  Then I came back later and it became my favorite Fallout and one of my favorite games of all time.  I'm still waiting for something similar to appear again.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I'm with you, and I love both.  But 3 was a way cooler area to explore and I had a lot more fun with it than I did NV. NV had a better story but felt like nothingness to me in between plot points. 

Can't wait to get flamed for this comment."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Exploration is much better in Fallout 3. Everyone makes a big deal about choices in NV, but they aren’t as earth shattering as everyone makes them out to be."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,fallout 3 has less RPG elements than NV
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Fallout 3 does a great job of slowly showing you how the game works and opening up at the right times and guiding you to be in the places you should be without overwhelming the player; whereas, New Vegas just kind of throws you out there and hands you a lot of different systems and elements pretty quickly, which I think makes it a little too complicated for the average gamer."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Yeah, it's funny nobody ever talks about that. I wasn't high on FO3, but immediately enjoyed NV. Some of my friends and people I know irl didn't like it though, and I saw that sentiment echoed a lot online. Flash forward to now and it's considered the definitive FO experience to the point where people are begging Obsidian or ~~Bethesda~~ somebody to make a worthy spiritual successor."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Seconded. Whenever people praise NV like it was an instant classic, I have to wonder if I slipped into bizarro world, because back when it came out, I remember both the outlets and the online discourse loathing it as a ""cheap, rushed cash-grab DLC sold at full price"". Among all my friends, both online and offline, I was pretty much the only one who liked it, warts and all, and seeing it getting unanimous praise nowadays and everyone pretending they always loved the game is just baffling."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"it still is massive.

hundreds of thousands of people have been playing it every day for more than 2 decades.

how many other games can say that?"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Paradox strategy games are a very niche market. They have a very solid fanbase, but they were never truly big enough to be featured on lists like this (and I say this as a fan)."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,The RTS genre just didn't continue with the steam it had. I think only Age of Empires II is the only RTS game I recognized on the list
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Right? Or Dune II!
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Specifically Red Alert, right? I never played any of them but that one I would hear about all the time back then."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"This is going to be countered at least somewhat by the other flaw in the methodology. Points are given solely by ranking regardless of year. Therefore newer games are going to get fewer points because they didn't exist when several of the polls used were created. A game in 2023 could be #1 on every list created after the game was released, and still get fewer points than an older game that scores even moderately on every source used, because they get 10 extra scores to add to their total."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I would have at least accepted Tie Fighter as a consolation option, but yea Wing Commander was such an immersive pioneer in the space combat simulation genre."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Secret of Monkey Island is #110
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Reach is really underrated
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Unreal Tournament is always forgotten amongst all the other greats. Just how it be.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Hell yeah.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"It absolutely does. 
Hard to imagine Mario 64 and Quake as the first larger level fully 3D games were less than 2 years old when OoT came along…"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,As does Link.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,As do humans.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Yup
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Makes 2 of us
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I hadn't either until my friend talked me into buying a Switch, and since I've put over 700 hours in between BotW and TotK. I didn't think I was a Zelda fan until I somehow was."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Why, when emulation is so easy?"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,They’re really great and also overrated. There’s a lot of games in the series so I’d check some out.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Skyward Sword and Phantom Hourglass are both absolute bangers in my opinion. Spirit Tracks though... Boy that game is rough.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"They're good games, but a more important reason is that they're *very* casual friendly while still offering an actual gameplay experience, rather than something arcadey.

Very few casual games manage to get anyone invested in them, and Zelda has built it entire legacy on it."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,BOTW is very different from most Zelda games. I wouldn't write off the series as a whole just cause you didn't like BOTW
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Between Breath and Tears, I think Tears is a better game overall, although it does get a lot of criticism for being BotW 2.0. The building mechanics alone make it much more interesting and fun to experiment with, and there's a wider variety of enemies. Weapon degradation is still there, but the fusion mechanic more than makes up for it (there's also an enemy in the game that allows you to restore weapons, although I'm not sure if that was intentional on Nintendo's part). Both games are also very different in the franchise for not relying on linear story progression.

Ocarina is probably the most nostalgic out of all of them. It introduced many musical motifs that have since become a mainstay in the franchise, and it has so many memorable characters and moments. That said, the gameplay and camera do suffer from that early 3D jank like many games in that era. If you ask individual Zelda fans what there favorite game is, you're likely to get wildly different answers, but I think that's a testament to the franchise as a whole that you can have so many different experiences depending on the game."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Tears of the Kingdom isn’t up there. It’s Ocarina of Time.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Huge same. I played Zelda OoT when I was a kid and it was by far the greatest gaming experience of my life. Then Majoras mask, which was amazing but not as revolutionary. Then sort of lost interest, tried Twilight Princess and didn't like it. 

Fast forward to last year I pick up BoTW to play with my son. He loves it, similar magic to OoT I experienced, but for me...not so much. It's really just uninteresting, feels very flat and procedurally generated. Fun to see it through his eyes though, I just pretend to be having more fun than I am. 

Honestly Zelda fans will just give their games a 1-2 point bump for nostalgia, which pushes it into overrated terrority."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Try A Link to the Past. Different game from a different age, but I think it still stands strong. The world is much, much smaller than BotW but is much more dense. The dungeon design is top notch. You will get lost, you will get confused, and you will die. But that's all a part of the adventure. 

I'm curious what is in your top 10 if they didn't get near what you see in the top 10 here."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Couldn't agree more. I still play it from start to finish every few years. Playing the PC port recently was an absolute joy. Strongly recommend giving it a try if you haven't yet.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Do you have a name or someplace I could look to find it?
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Most games that are (high) on this list are not great by todays standards

Just the way you have to swap items in n64 oot is a horrible experience"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Forest Temple as one of the worst? Do you mean the Deku Tree, or are you on crack?"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Actual braindead opinion. Forest temple is great and most of the temples in game are some of the best crafted in the entire franchise.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,">Forest Temple and Jabu Jabu's belly

Meh, those dungeons were fine. The only real kick in the dick was the fucking **water temple**"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Fair. I knew it was a purely addictive drug before I ever tried it. I stayed away from it for years, literally knowing exactly how it would destroy my life. And yet when I did dip my toe in years later.. Hahaha, we kidding, no one dips their toe in factorio!"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Consider yourself lucky that you were able to get out early. I’ve got over 1,000 hours in it and I really don’t game that much *generally*. Probably 15% of all my brain capacity is reserved for useless Factorio information"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Super Metroid is an absolute gem and what makes it is the environments paired with the music. In a game about exploring, what you explore has to be interesting/engaging - just running around the play space has to be rewarding in and of itself - and Super Metroid has that in droves."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I loved Dread, but the SM music just has that like... standard SNES-era OOMPH to it, similar to Chrono Trigger. Idk what they were doing back then to compose music like they did."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Very cool to read this. CT is arguably my favorite game of all time. But it's hard for me to separate the game from my 9-year-old kid nostalgia. Hearing this from somebody who doesn't have that nostalgia attachment helps reaffirm that is truly is a great game and stands the test of time.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"It's a puzzle platform game that has time-rewinding mechanics. It's pretty short so there's no grind or repetitiveness. I won't spoil it, but it has a great ending.

It's a great game. Everyone I know who has played it likes it.

Edit: It's currently on sale for $3.74 on Steam for the next 40 hours."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,">They aren’t for everyone imo.

You're right. They're for cool people."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Yet Elden Ring managed to appear at 65 while being only 1 year and a half old lol
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Yeah, I read the first few paragraphs and thought ""damn, Elden Ring gets utterly shafted because older games are heavily favored here.""

And then it's *still* at 65, lol."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Exactly. It was the first game that taught me to never run from the boss grind, and that served me well in games like AC6, Lies of P, etc. I’m no longer afraid of big scary bosses!"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"it’s my GOAT game, Yakuza 0 is number 2. oh well"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"That's way too low. 

RTS games in general get so underrated"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Deserves *at least* top 50
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I stopped playing WoW after the free trial ended because I had been addicted to Everquest for many years before it came out. Saw the writing on the wall. Games were too good. No real pay to play back then. Old school grinding paid off. Not saying EQ was the best, but it was damn good. Povar server FTW!"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Yep if success is based at all on longevity, income and modern relevance then EQ should be number 1."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,We all knew Furor was a raging asshole decades before he got fired from Blizzard.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Really sad I had to scroll down so far to see someone say this. EQ was the MMO that showed MMOs were financially viable. If it hasn't been such a massive success WoW would've either come along much later or not at all.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I agree , horizon zero dawn should not be ranked higher than warcraft 3 . It's not a bad game , but not a top 200 of all time game too"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,[deleted]
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I get that Spelunky and FTL helped jumpstart the genre and Hades is super polished, but I feel Isaac and Gungeon are at their core the best games in the genre, and both are absent."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Playing red and blue normally, it's rare you'd find it to be ""broken as shit""

Red and blue play largely the same as the newer pokemon games. The biggest change is the graphics. The same cannot be said about mario kart."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I do think that historical importance needs to be considered in these kinds of lists, but you also have a point, especially when close to identical remakes/sequels exist that basically do literally everything better"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Can’t speak on MGS (never played it), but Mario 64 is literally one of if not the most popular game for speedrunning to this day. There are more people playing SM64 every day than there are for a lot of the other games on this list. Graphically it’s definitely aged but the gameplay is still just as enjoyable, complex, and beloved as it was in 1996."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I LOVED the original SNES Mario Kart, played it to death in high school, used to have nightly races with friends in college."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Super Mario Kart wasn’t popular? What world did you grow up in?
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I would actually probably put the Wii Mario Kart on the list over any of the others. I agree for its time, Mario Kart 64 was better than SNES, but I'm not sure I'd say the SNES one wasn't that popular. Honestly it was pretty groundbreaking for having any sort of auto-driven battle mode to play with friends.

But the Wii one and being able to play with friends remotely and overall play online with people around the world was pretty incredible, and it did a great job of meshing together interesting new tracks with ones from past games."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Yeah, it's tragic that Cyberpunk's release was so scuffed. It's become a truly incredible game."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I'm playing outer wilds atm and wondering what the fuss is about. It's sort of clever but also... idk what the big deal is. I know there's this big reveal that makes it all mean something but man, braid had that and the game was actually fun to play."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I don’t understand why people bring aging into the equation. No car collector buys a model T and is like damn… my hellcat is way faster.  They buy it for what it was… revolutionary.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"> lots of other games have flaws that will push them out of the top 10 on various lists, whereas BotW is a safe inclusion on all of them.

I think this applies to nearly everything Nintendo produces. They make games that are nearly flawless, in the literal sense of them being largely without flaw, but that doesn't inherently make them *good*. It usually means they haven't taken sufficient creative risks to truly excel.

It's like a car that performs well, is safe and comfortable to drive, is affordable with all the extra features but bores you to tears because everything is just ""OK"". Sometimes the exciting European sports car that will shit itself every 5,000km is the better pick."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I'm a massive GTA fanboy, but I'm inclined to agree. GTA V isn't even in my top 3 GTA games."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,I think it will pass dark souls one day. Especially if the expansion is as good as the base game
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Absolutely! Plus I remember as a kid my mind being blown by the fact you could recruit 108 different characters. It makes the replay value so much better experimenting with different parties each play through.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Yea that and Factorio. The gives me some serious doubt lol Factorio literally defined an entire genre of gaming
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"r/gaming has a heavy PS and PC slant, similar to r/games. Speaking as a multi-platformer player."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,I played the original like legit 20 times. I played the remake like 10 times. 30 in total. Im catching up to you.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"There are a couple of mechanics I think KH1 did better, but KH2 expanded and improved on like 95% of gameplay from KH1 and that’s also the last game before the story went off the rails, so you can’t use that as an excuse"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Sure, but that doesn't excuse the title being so low, doesn't it? Every single-player FPS coming after HL used its storytelling methods."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"How long ago have you played it? Half Life 1 holds up very well as for a game from 1998, both singleplayer and multiplayer, the gameplay is still great even in 2023"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Nah, its True. Games have come a long way, and vastly improved over titles like OOT"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Because it doesn’t deserve it.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,nothing's quality is directly correlated with its popularity
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,Millions of flies cant be wrong about eating shit!
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Except that's not always the case. Some deserved the popularity. Some didn't. Some are just way too high up.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"That is how I really feel.  And it sucks because I LOVED Zelda growing up.  I played through both BotW and TotK.  The second was a bit better but neither are good enough IMO for a best of anything list.  Half voice acted cut scenes, a paper thin “story”, immersion breaking “side quests” (hey the world is ending and only you can save us, go get this bottle from a lake for me so I can make cheese or pickup all my stuffed animals), poor combat mechanics, really poor inventory management, poor level design (at least they tried to fix that in the sequel). If it was identical in every way, but called the The Legend of anything other than Zelda, and published by another studio, it wouldn’t get nearly the acclaim it does."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Yeah problem is there are too many people that these rankings are overly important. I love a lot of games that have good rankings and reviews but a few of my all time fav games are also games that arent as highly reviewed.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I couldn't disagree more, Baldur's Gate 3 was the proof that it wasn't me getting older and more grumpy, it showed that I still could enjoy games like I did 25 years ago.

High budget games are being made for the lowest common denominator, maximizing profits over innovation, depth and fun. And it has all to do with how the industry is set up at that level, where games are made with investors putting money in with the guarantee they get more money out. Stopping devs from taking any risks.

A game like BG3 isn't perfect, but it shows what's possible if you don't have to stop development when market research tells your return on investment will only decrease by allocating more dev time. 

When was the last time a AAA studio surprised you with something new and interesting? And we're not talking here about better graphics or executing a proven genre to perfection."

&#x200B;

I don't think so. But whatever, 2023 was just slightly less lame than 2020 or 2021 or 2022. But if you took 2023 and transplanted in back in the 2000s....

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,A pretty good comparison. I also think that a big part of it is that arcade games were much better enjoyed in the arcade environment competing with friends for high scores. I feel like most people who try an arcade game for the first time today will play maybe four or five rounds and then never touch it again.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I would say that neither Space Invaders nor Galaga not being on the list is outrageous. Frogger, Asteroids, Centipede, Missile Defense and many other arcade classics I would expect to see at least one or two of these on here."

The way enemies come at you makes it feel like the game was designed for a cover based system (also a ton of environmental cover and a mostly unused crouch ability). Your guns always feel a step behind where they should be, and how fragile Jesse is feels a little at odds with how aggressive the game wants you to play.

I don't know if it's really all that good. The graphics and atmosphere were what made it on release. A lot of what makes the world compelling was kinda filled in later in laer games and books.

Certainly, the industry has moved on, and I think at least Riven surpasses the original in basically every way (other Myst titles like Exile, MOUL, debatable, I think Obduction is probably their best game mechanically and in terms of really nailing integrated world building/mechanical play."

BioShock was the spiritual successor to System Shock 2 (hence the name), which introduced pretty much all of the gameplay concepts in BioShock (also the plot was very similiar, with the same basic story and twists just in a different setting).

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Those are basically the words I was looking for! I just made a comment about how Fallout 3 places just seemed to have more personality. I can't put it into words very well, but I just had more fun exploring. There was something silly and quirky around every corner, like a teddy bear and a gnome playing chess on a toilet. The dumb themes that kept popping up just gave the Capital Wasteland so much more flair."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"In Fallout 3, the main plot doesn't take you to much of the map at all, when you look at it.

FNV takes you all OVER the place.  And sidequests are often triggered in places where the main plot takes you.

So Fallout 3 rewarded exploration more. All sorts of side quests hidden where you actually had to go and search them out.

Plus the encounters in the wasteland were completely different.  In FNV, you could say ""now a gecko will run in from the left"", whereas in FO3, the best you could say is ""SOMETHING will happen in this place, when I come up to it for the first time"".

Here's Jon, from Many a True Nerd, with 2 hours on why FO:3 is good.

It also makes me realise that Baldur's Gate 3 has most of the things about both that I like most, and lacks many of the elements I don't. As much as I loved Oblivion, Fallout 3 was probably the first game that made me fall in love with open world exploration and side quests."

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"To be fair those are very different than previous Zelda games. The traditional Zelda formula has never really hooked me, but I loved BotW and TotK."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"I haven't played the other Zelda games. So I can't comment on them. I do believe you that for example Ocarina of Time is very different though and it perhaps it was revolutionary at the time of its release. I didn't play it back then though, so it can't have an educated opinion on that game. It's difficult to revisit games that old and adequately judge them. Same with a game like Morrowind. I think that game was mind-blowing at the time of release, now it feels rather dated.

My problem is that Zelda fans absolutely **rave** about BotW and I personally found it a very middling game. So I'm just very skeptical about what those same people have to say about games in general. Simply based on how a lot of people go crazy for BotW, I've always just assumed that there are a lot of Zelda fans who are dedicated Nintendo gamers and who have not played open-world games with actual qualitative content like RDR2 or The Witcher 3.

Maybe that's an unfair assumption though."

184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"“Min-Maxers” sometimes think that because an exploit exists, that they must use it, and then complain that the game is trivialized because of its existence that they chose to use."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Ironically that sounds like my experience with breath of the wild! I found it a total bore to play.

I don't think Outer Wilds is about a 'big reveal' at all. Certainly it has some, but it's more a series of smaller discoveries on the way. Anyway, as they say the less said about the game the better (as discovery is pretty much its main selling point), but if it's not doing it for you so far then too bad. It probably doesn't help that it's been hyped up beyond belief."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Yes, but collectors aren't ranking their collection based on ""best of all time"". ""Most influential"", maybe, but not ""best"". It's an entirely different metric. Because the ""best cars of all time"" list if aging is removed from the equation would be dominated by modern cars, which have infinitely better safety, faster speeds, better suspension, softer seats, etc, etc.

Video games aren't quite as bad as cars for that, but both graphics and gameplay are features that age extremely poorly. Every generation gives much better graphics, so every game aiming for top tier graphical fidelity is going to look bad in hindsight. Gameplay of popular games also gets ripped off and refined, so what was once revolutionary gameplay becomes modern day cliche gameplay.

It's impossible to separate such things when talking about best. Each person has their own metrics for determining how much gameplay and graphics aging affects them. For some people, what might matter is just how they felt when it first released; for others, it might matter how well it holds up if it were first played today.

Basically, you can't dismiss aging when talking about the quality of games; its intrinsically tied to them."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"It holds up well but the problem is that Half-Life 2 exists.

I heard a comment somewhere that basically summed it up as ""If HL1 was the greatest fps ever, then HL2 is the greatest game ever""

So if your goal is to make a list of the best games ever, it would be weird to put HL1 over HL2 just because HL1 was an original when HL2 is a better game

Same reason why World of Warcraft frequently makes these sorts of lists but EverQuest doesn't. EverQuest was certainly a pioneer, but that doesn't make it better. If we gave extra weight simply for being first, these lists would just be like Pong, Breakout, Galaga"

I grew up in the 2000s. It absolutely does not have every year as good as 2007. 2023 beats out multiple years in the 2000s."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,... You took the best year ever in gaming. That isn't really fair
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I also played Fallout 3 recently and no, it's not even close to being better than any game release in the last 5 years. If Fallout 3 released this year it wouldn't even crack top 15 games this year. 

Let's not even count the last 5 years of games like RDR2, GoW+Ragnarok, Returnal, Elden Ring, Sekiro, Ghost of Tsushima, Zelda: BotW + TotK etc... that blow it out of the water."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"Mine too! I was obsessed with that game and lost odyssey. The stories in the latter really made that game special. Goosebumps thinking about it bahah 

I need to replay both asap"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"FF13 came at a time when I was in high school and addicted to Call of Duty, I never actually played it... but I had hundreds and hundreds of hours playing X, X-2, and 12. I actually like 12 the best of all the modern entries, even more so than X."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Pay note people, they said boss theme, as in *the only one in the entire game.*"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"Ocarina of Time was reviewed in 1998. For metacritics sake, it is either the highest reviewed game of all time for them, or 2nd highest. It's a 99."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"lol, whatever. I mean, like you can have the opinion. It's wrong. But I'm not going to convince you. 

&#x200B;

And for fucks sake, ONE GREAT GAME DOES NOT MAKE A YEAR GREAT YOU NEED AT LEAST 5 truly great games for a year to be considered great. BG3 is the only really good game this year. I don't think it's great. If it were great I wouldn't have gotten so bored with it. 

&#x200B;

Because I'm still playing UT99 or..... Fallout 3 or... Mass Effect 2.... Or counter strike, or RE4.... Years and years and decades later. 

&#x200B;

No one will be playing any of these new games in 5 years... Let alone 10, 15, 20. 

&#x200B;

I mean Half Life just had it's 25th anniversary and it's one of steams most played games lol. Because it's great. It has a legacy. These modern games do not, and will not. 

&#x200B;

But cheers man. Go play the BG3 if it's so great. Don't waste your time with me. Shit I know in 2007 I didn't have to convince anyone that CoD4 was an all timer or than UT3 waas great or that bioshock was off the hook. Everyone just kinda knew they were. We took it for granted. We didn't know how great we had it. But.... You now. Casuals and mega corps ruin everything eventually gaming is just the latest, and coolest, thing they've ruined. 

&#x200B;

And I'm not saying that BG3 isn't good. It is good. I mean, the fact that it doesn't try to game the player and has actual engaging content, for 2023... That's a BIG deal."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-27,"""Mine too! I was obsessed with that game and lost odyssey.""

OMG, you just brought back a memory I didn't know I had when you said Lost Odyssey 😳my buddies, and I loved that game till we found Resident Evil"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,Metacritic didn't even exist in 1998. Its reviews from prior to 2001 were either done retrospectively (most of them) or taken from older publications that shared their data.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,There. Are. 13. Other. Equally. Weighted. Lists. All. Made. After. 2018.
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,">I mean, like you can have the opinion. It's wrong.

Opinions can't be wrong. Otherwise they wouldn't be opinions.

>But I'm not going to convince you. 

Sounds good to me, you're the idiot getting downvoted"
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"I don't really care about downvotes. Reddit is a hivemind of mostly libs and zoomers. I'm not too concerned. And it's a fact that our game industry (millennials) was better than the modern one (zoomers). That's why 60 percent of the best reviewed games are form the 90s and 2000s. And overwheling majority of the great games were made for the millennial gamers. It's not nostalgia. It's just facts. 

 

I know reddit doesn't like facts. But it's just facts. I don't care about downvotes I don't care about upvotes. I say what I say and then keep it moving."
184e4zj,2023-11-26,2023-11-26,"""I'm right and everyone else is wrong""

What kind of glue did you eat this morning? Gorilla or Elmers?"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"It’s a great lesson on loss actually. As parents we want to fix things like this, but ideally OP your actions should be to start another game with her. Then, in like 6 months if she’s still taking about the game revisit. 

Most parents would make the poorer choice of just playing it again to placate that feeling of loss (change.) Show her they even when things change, parts remain the same - like gaming with dad!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Okay but did she cry when you fucked Cutie up?
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"You should check out little big planet 3. It’s cute, fun and a good couch coop to enjoy together."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Unless her reaction was more due to the fact that the game ending meant that she wouldn’t be able to play with you anymore rather than for the game itself
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I worked on It Take Two. Thank you so much for sharing.

These types of stories solidifies my love for game development and the impact it can have on people. She must have really enjoyed the time with you, accomplishing things together. It must have been hard for her to lose that, knowing the game was over.

There are so many games in my life that have basically raised me. It has always been a goal of mine to work on something that has a greater impact than pure sales and isn't forgotten so quickly.  
To work on something that even manages a fraction of that means a lot to me.

Thank you for sharing. I hope you continue to play games with her. There are plenty of gorgeous games out there that can take you two on many more journeys to come!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Just tell her there are many more stories you can explore together! So often adults skim over the obvious things and wonder why a kid doesn't understand that *that* game is over, but there are many more. Sometimes this small clarity can clear up a kid misunderstanding."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Beat this with my 10 year old and he was so happy. It really was magical to play together.

If I may suggest - you two could play again, but as opposite characters. There are lots of moments when you have very different mechanics, so it'll still feel fresh and new."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"It’s awesome that she’s having so much fun playing with you. 

If you need more coop games, I heartily recommend the Lego games. They are all amazing. I’d start with one of the older ones, like the original Star Wars or the first Batman. Lots of replay value as you try to find all the little collectibles!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"My son and I have been celebrating the night before the last night before school starts since he was nine (14 now) by staying up wicked late and gaming together. We just finished It Takes Two a few days beforehand so we could start Tiny Tina's Wonderland. Gaming with your kids is *awesome!* 

If you're sensitive to certain content or she likes certain types of gaming, maybe do some reconnaissance first, but as you probably know there's a world of co-op gaming for the two of you to explore together. Borderlands might not be her thing, but sit with her while she plays Portal (never thought watching someone else play could be so much fun) or join together in a Minecraft world ... adventure awaits!!

(And read books together too! That feeling of ""oh no, it's *over*?!"" never really goes away, but it does become a joy.)"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Try unravel 2. It Takes Two is hard to beat, but unravel 2 is a lot of fun."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Here are some coop game recommendations for you to play with your daughter:

Moving Out

Children of Morta (highly recommend)

Terraria 

Heroes of Hammerwatch (might be too hard)

Cat Quest 2 (my 9 year old loves this switch game)"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I still feel like that sometimes at the end of a good game or book.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,She might be sad about losing the bond you two made through the game. At least in her mind. I think it’s time to find a new coop game!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I hope to be at this level one day with my daughter who is almost 5. We just got the platinum for My Friend Peppa Pig (small steps). It is a proud platinum to have.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,What a lovely post.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Aw. Also finished with daughter. It's the best. We've then enjoyed.. cat quest 2 and now on nobody saves the world. 

We also had a 3 year battle defeating cup head.. it is as a proper experience (our routine for so long!) But not really a recommendation unless you are mad. But I think we will always remember it. Maybe in a few years"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Perhaps It's not the best recommendation, but have you thought of playing Stardew Valley with your daughter? If it's gonna click with her you both will have fun for MANY hours, also I think the game won't be that hard for a kid her age. Of course it's something entirely different from it takes two, but that was one of the games that you can play as long as you'd like and I thought it might be a good idea"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Dark Souls is co-op. Story kinda sucks but the gameplay is unmatched 

/s"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"My partner and I started playing Grounded right after finishing It Takes Two - it’s kind of like if you took Honey I Shrunk the Kids and blended it with Minecraft and It Takes Two. Being little in a big outdoor world reminded us of It Takes Two so it felt like the perfect next step, I’d recommend checking it out! The insects can be a little difficult to kill but there are creative modes you can turn on so that you and your little one can explore and build freely without facing aggression, and despite that it is mostly open world, there is a robust plot-line that isn’t too difficult to follow. You can also make pets out of the weevils and aphids which can be pretty cute."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"My 13 year old and I beat it not too long ago. She had a blast. Especially the scene with the elephant. Oh dear Lord, we couldn't believe it

My 10 year old and I have been playing Ibb and Obb off and on for years. You should give that a try. A very cool cooperative puzzler. No story but it's fun to figure it out together"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,">  I had to explain that games don't go on forever.

just teach her factorio lmao"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Luigis mansion 3 is a great co op
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"We played Unravel two. It took just 7 hours, but it is amazing game and we had nice time together 🙂 Will try It Takes Two 🙂"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Damn, right in the feels. My reaction to her saying “its over” would have been “yes but you beating games has just begun.” Then pop in Super Mario World or something."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,It's not a traditional 2 player game but my daughter and I really enjoyed playing Stray together. I'd let her pilot unless it was a hard section and she asked for help. It's a very fond memory for me now.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Some couch co-op me and my daughter (now 11) loved besides It Takes Two:
Ki Wi, Heavenly bodies, Overcooked, Moving out, Unravel 2, Sackboy, Little big planet.

We've now started Portal knights which is cute and fun."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Thanks a lot man , I’m playing this with my 8 year old daughter right now and am now tearing up in the school pickup line, Thanks Jerk!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"My family loves couch co-ops.  We just finished “Humans Fall Flat”.  She might like that one.  The character mechanics are crazy (think floppy meat puppets), and it’s a very simple game.  You just have to get to the exit, using your floppy meat puppets."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,You are a good dad. Keep it up man!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"I just wanted to say thank you for sharing this.  

Me and my soon to be ex-wife have a 3 year old daughter and this hit really close to home; in a good way"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"She probably saw the end of the game as an end to your routine and special time together, you should think about getting another game to play together so she doesn’t feel like she’s lost you in some way"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,I think she just really enjoyed doing something with you.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Trust me, u only get this feeling for the stuff u love the most. I'm +30 I still do cry after finishing great stuff, it's ok. It's actually a mixed feeling between happy, sad and feeling empty. 
She will get used to it, hopefully u found your next game soon and start enjoying it again."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons

Check this one out, the same Dev as it takes two. Very story driven and wonderful game."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"That's really something beautiful, man!! My brother is currently playing  with his son. I can't to see his reaction now when done :)"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I played this with my brother-in-law and it was an absolute riot.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,That's a beautiful story
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"It takes two is such a great game, cant wait for my daughter to be able to play it with me."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I had a similar experience with the Pikmin 4 demo and my daughter. Eventually I'll pick up the full game and we'll give it ago. Can't wait.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,💕 I love you both
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Replay it and swap the characters around.

Both characters have different roles in the game so it'll be a new-ish experience for her."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"My dad got me It Takes Two for my birthday so I could play with my boyfriend. After we beat it I was so bummed it was over too! We had a ready date night thing to do and it was a lot of fun showing each other cool things in the game, like making snow angels. I have been on the hunt and collecting two player games since. Like split screen, not only playing online with each other. It's a really good way to bond with someone, so glad you both were able to enjoy it!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"You can replay the game as the other character, and that way you get to fully experience the entire game.

Plus you can find all the mini-games and go achievement hunting your 2nd time around. This is how I extend the games I love. Use a walk-through guide so that it helps you find and unlock everything."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Portal 2 has a great coop mode that she might really like
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Time to get her hooked on WoW… it’ll never die. No matter how dead it gets.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Maybe try Minecraft. It has goals you can set but doesn’t have a legit end so to speak.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"While not a coop game by default, Scribblenauts Unlimited is a really fun game where you can create almost anything with words to solve problems.  It's art is simple but charming, played it over a few years with a younger friend and was really fun."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"I'm in my 40s and I've always felt like your daughter did when I finish a game.The concept of ""beating"" the game has never resonated with me, because the gme is the experience and the enjoyment is the prize. It's not a task that needs to be ticked off a list, it's something I am emotionally invested in. If I'm enjoying it, I don't want the experience to end."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I recently just finished the game with my five-year-old and I was pleasantly surprised as to how good the game was. Fun puzzles, interesting level design, and never was repetitive. I highly recommend it for anyone looking to play with their young kids. I was also shocked as to how long it was though"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Thank you for sharing.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"hope you 2 can play more games together, like Halo or castle crashers or a bunch of other games, just to show her playtime with daddy doesnt have to ever end"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Play Stardew Valley with her. I play it with my daughter who will be 9 in a couple months. There’s a lot to do and it seemingly never ends (we’re only on year 2 summer so far)
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,You could look into any of the We Were Here games. It's cryptic on story but its got good puzzles.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Wholesome story, OP. <3"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Animal Crossing is the game she needs.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,One of my favorite games of all time. A literal gem of perfection.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I beat it with my little girl and it was the best experience. Unraveled 2 is another one she adores if you guys haven’t done that one. Gaming with our babies is the coolest thing possible
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,And now you look for a new game together. The game ended up gaming together didn’t
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,My son and I started the unravel games after it takes two.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,You might enjoy Snipperclips! It’s a cooperative puzzle game. Untitled Goose Game has a 2 player mode that is lots of fun. Maybe give her a choice from a few options?
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Game was GREAT!

Start a minecraft world with her.  Even after you beat the dragon, you can keep playing forever."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"> I had to explain that games don't go on forever.

Let me introduce you to /r/civ. Just... one... more... turn.

In all seriousness, that's a really cute story. I look forward to when my daughter is old enough for something like that."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I don’t think your girl was upset about it ending. If this is the first game you’ve prioritized time with her on, then to her it ending could mean the end of spending that really fun time together."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Oh, i was expecting the tears to be about the message of the game relating to her life experiences.

But you sound like a great dad, keep making these memories!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Lego Harry Potter games are super fun! She might like playing those with you as well :) I played them with my fiancé and it was super fun!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Haha, that's nuts. I finished that game with my 10 yo this year also, and she had the same reaction!

We had so much fun, and now that fun was over, so I think she was just grieving. 

Vidya with my kids has been extremely fulfilling, and an unexpected joy of parenthood.  She and I are gonna take a whack at Lego Harry Potter next."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Dude, just take her to the store and say ""now we need to get another game."" 

It's about you and her, not the game."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"If you liked It Takes Two I would very highly recommend the following couch co-op 3D adventure games:  
  
Sackboy: A Big Adventure - PS5  
Super Mario 3D World - Nintendo Switch  
Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga - all consoles  
Luigis Mansion - Nintendo Switch  
Untitled Goose Game - switch and pc  
  
There's also these 2D adventure games which are great:  
Donkey Kong: Tropical Freeze - Nintendo Switch  
Rayman Legends - all consoles  
  
And these are amazing single player games with a 2 player mode (2nd player controls are limited):  
Super Mario Odyssey - Switch  
Kirby and the Forgotten Land - switch  
  
Portal 2 on pc and switch also has a fun 2 player mode."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Wanna know how to make the devs of this game cry happy tears? Send them this post OP or wrote them a sweet letter about how much u and ur daughter enjoyed this game would make their week and bring out theirnpassion to bring more games out like this :)
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Me and my daughter love coop games. You should try:
* Journey (absolutely beautiful and no killing things). 
* Rayman Legends (really fun for the whole family)
* Ratchet and Clank: All 4 One (great multiplayer version of a great series)."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Maybe she wasn’t sad that the game ended but that her future daddy daughter gaming time would end.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Follow up with another co-op ASAP so she can see/feel proof that it is a repeatable magic when it's needed.

That game is an especially good one to elicit that response though.  Gotta say, I really empathise with her  lol"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,She was prob sad because she was enjoying that game and time spent with YOU  let her know that you will keep playing together!  Play it again !  Or another game that is “next level” . She sounds like a great kid.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"She is grieving the ends of the game, yes.

But she is also grieving the end of that special bonding time.

The two of you should pick out a new on together."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"IMO it's not that she was sad about the game ending and instead was about the ""project"" you guys had, the time spent together and the good moments. It could be that she took a moment to make peace with the game ending and understanding that this isn't, in any way, a sign that your good times together are ending. So, as others said, picking up a new project with her will do wonders.  
On another note, keep it up, you seem to be doing an awesome job at fatherhood, kudos."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Wow.

I'm a single dad who has been laying it with my 16yo daugther...

We had a go a few years back and just recently when school holidays came we tried again.

When we first played, I always had to wait for her to catch up.

Now she always has to wait for me. She;s so fast I cannot keep up.

I hope you find another game you can play together. I play minecraft with my son and daughter too."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Played this w my youngest daughter, as well. We moved on to finish Sack Boy. Now we play split screen Fortnite. Enjoy these moments. They will fly by fast! My oldest daughter doesn’t play w me anymore."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,Try Unraveled next :) very similar style. My wife and I loved it.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,It’s a shame because you won’t find a couch co-op game as fun and polished as It Takes Two.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,Tell her this is just the first of hundreds of adventures you will play together. I'm sure you already have a new game lined up.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Lego Star Wars. I played that game with my daughter getting 100% on Movies 1-6 when she was 8-9. It took us over a year. We still talk about it now and then, and she’s off to college. 

Remember these moments."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,She may be worried that now that the game is over so is father daughter time.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Oh man, I empathize with your daughter. I play a lot of games, and those good ones...I ugly cry every time. Just remind her that for every adventure that ends, there's a hundred more waiting to begin 💜"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,">The developers really created something special with this game.

I wonder if it's more like y'all created something special with your time together. You sound like a good dad."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"I wish I could recommend their other game A Way Out to you, but mostly due to violence, I can't. But man, it's a blast to play together as well."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,Didn’t that game end with the two parents who were about to divorce getting back together?  I wonder if any of her emotion stemmed from her wanting her mom and to get back together?
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,">I only have my daughter 50% of the time...

>I looked behind me... and she was just sitting on the couch with tears welling up in her eyes looking incredibly sad.

I'm guessing you're a divorced parent? If so, she could be crying because the story of the game is too close to real life?

If not, sorry I'm reading into it more than it appears.

I've also beat this game with my 2 daughters. Some other games we also beat: Human Fall Flat, Rayman Legends, Trine 4, TMNT: Shredder's revenge, Unraveled 2, Pikuniku, and Kemono Heroes.

Co-op Games we haven't beat or gave up: Lego Star wars: skywalker saga, Sack Boy, Battletoads, and SpongeBob."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"I am not sure, you took the right lesson from this."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Homie out here thinking his daughter gave a fuck about the game, not noticing she just enjoyed spending time with him, sad"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Wait, you played a game about dysfunctional parents working it out together with a nine year old child of divorce?"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Be sure to tell the devs too, coming from game design and being a dad I can tell you that they would LOVE to hear such an experience."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,Sincerely happy for you and a little jealous😂 My son is 3 and I'm really looking forward to playing together !
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,I don't think it's about the game. I think it's about the two of you having quality time together and now it's over. I had a shithead of a dad but I still have good memories of things we did together. That is core memory stuff. Play another game and continue doing stuff together ♥️
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Tell her you'll find other games to play together. I recommend unravel 2, the only game i managed to play with my wife."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,Honestly kind of a brutal game to play with a 9 year old with divorced parents seeing as the whole plot is about a girl that's sad about her parents getting a divorce...
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"You need to tell her, we can play it again. Don't worry"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"You played a game about getting divorced parents back together with your daughter who has divorced parents. It probably ended without the parents getting back together and that parallels her real life.

And you wonder why she's sad?"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,I think she probably liked the time with you and was worried that it would be ending now that the game is done.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"I think I've stopped short of beating a couple of games just to avoid that feeling, honestly.

I have a hard time enjoying games as much as I used to as it is, and that ""it's over"" feeling is something I dread if I've got a little emotional investment going on.

Mental gymnastics. I quit THE GAME, THE GAME didn't leave me."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Probably not the best game to play with a daughter as a divorced dad, lol"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Try playing these with your daughter:

portal 1 and 2

unravelled 1 and 2

don’t starve together

Might also be able to team up with her on Dead by Daylight if you guys are horror buffs. Hide & Seek style gameplay with some objectives.

Game on, my son."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Sounds like me after life is strange or TWD season 1.

This will make her stronger"

16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Thank you for sharing, what a lovely story!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I'm almost 40 and have the same reaction when I finish a game I really like. 

Now I wanna check this game out you two played!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Get Shift Happens! It's a similar co-op platformer and could be a great follow up game
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I play these cute little co-op games with my girlfriend and I have nothing but good things to say about Sackboys Adventure. It's funny, easy enough and pretty customisable in some dorky ways."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Yeah it was the elephant part that made me the most sad
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"That's the most heartwarming story, she must look at you like you're 10 feet tall, and she enjoys that time with you SO MUCH, she probably feels 10 feet tall as well doing that with you, and was simply very saddened when it ended. Definitely like others have said, find SOMETHING else you can play with her, it doesn't even matter if it's like a one player thing but yall swap controller on every death or something, like me and my wife playing Crash Bandicoot. But certainly sounds like she will cherish that time forever, so good on you for that mate."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Oh, man. It's awesome that she enjoyed the game so much and touching how she reacted to the credits rolling. Just tell here that there are so many more great games to play together and that if one holds a special place in your heart, there's no reason why you can't play through it again. You're bound to find something else that she'll enjoy.

Games like Ocarina of Time have me seriously tempted to start over from scratch as I'm watching the credits roll. They're magical experiences.

My daughter is only 15 months old, so I can only hope she'll one day share or understand my passion for games someday."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Got yourself an MMO kid
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Don't just rush into the next game. Take a while with her to look back on the adventure you both had and share some memories. And once you're done reminiscing, maybe have some fun shopping around with her on what to play next, dreaming of the adventures yet to come."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I think you may want to reassure her that you guys can still game together. I think that might be part of it
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,You guys should play through again but switch characters.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Rayman Legends next...  When you hit those music levels it's a blast right up until the last one...  She will be elated when you pass it via shear memorization.

&#x200B;

Spoiler alert look up rayman grannies world tour 8 bit"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"My best friend and I played through it. It's such a great game, so I can understand how upset she was that it was over. Especially at that age. Spending months on something is FOREVER when you're 9. This was a huge part of her life and a big part of her relationship with you, so it makes sense why the ending hit so hard for her. 

As others have suggested, there are two options. The first is to play through again but this time as the other character. That way you can still play the game but it's different now. The second option is to find another great couch co-op game that gives you time to play together."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"keep playing games with her, she will cherish these moments her whole life. i recommend Terraria(maybe on a easier difficulty) or stardew valley!! great two player games that anyone can get into"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"A good story driven game is exactly like a really good movie or book. I remember I felt an imense sense of loss and emptiness after finishing The Kingkiller Chronicles by Patrick Rothfuss. 2 of the most amazing fantasy books I've read (and I've been through most of the big name series).

A game that really brought forth a lot of emotions for me was Dragon Age Inquisition. That cinematic after you finish that 15h or start of the game, right after the first fight with the main antagonist? Those who have played it should now the scene. I cried like a bitch."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Time to find the next game pronto, dad. Good work."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I did this with my then 9yo sister in 2020-2021. Some remarks on the game and yours and my experience:

- regarding your kids reaction, I'm really sorry about that, but it makes some sense because in the end, the duo sticks together for the kid and themselves rekindling. I see you mention 50% time with you... assuming you're separated from the other parent and she had mixed feelings on the ending (a good ending, just not realistic for her and you particularly). It is what it is. I for one had a LOT of trouble with my little sis on the elephant plush bit xD she didn't want to play for a week!

- absolute blast of a game and that's why it took game of the year award. In a couple of years, maybe more you should try the previous game from that swedish gen of a game maker (Josef Ares and Hazelight Studio): A Way Out. It is more adult and less engaging but more adult tone. I tried starting it with my now almost 12yo sis but maybe it's still too early with the rough language and more manly theme.

- if you want more games to play with the kid, I can't stress enough how good the Zelda series is. Unfortunately the best absolute game for her age is stuck on the Wii U/N64/Wii - The Wind Waker. Yeah, it's not a co-op but it's simple gameplay and tone are just right for a 6-9yo and she'll have a blast playing or watching you play for her on the rough bits. Ocarina of Time, Skyward Sword, A Link Between Worlds (3DS) are just other great examples. But if you got nothing else, of course there's BotW and TotK, of which you should REALLY PLAY BotW first if you want to have an extended experience. BotW is at least 30h of good gameplay just for the main story, and hundreds more for her to enjoy the huge, filled world of Hyrule on the Switch. Then TotK is maybe 40h more of main story and hundreds more (even mote than BotW) that improves the previous game in like 70% (the first game was already too good, hence why it also got GotY on its year, and you can bet it's getting the prize this year too).

- I know I'm being a shill for Nintendo at this stage, but you really can't go wrong with great games for a kid girl (or boy) on the Switch or rpevious consoles. I bought a Wii U I like 4y into its life for just 200EUR and it was the best platform for my sis to play 3-6 games a year from when she was 3-4yo onwards. If you don't want to spend on a Switch, a 50-100 bucks used Wii U and some remotes+nunchuck are just good fun, especially with great games such as Nintendoland, Pikmin, a load of Mario's the Zelda's I already mentioned. But most games on that console are just extra polished and super appropriate for kids from.4yo and beyond."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Here are some more coop games you could try on PC or switch for someone that age

-Sackboys Big Adventure (PC)
-Untitled Goose Game (Both)
-Lego Star Wars Skywalker Saga (Better on PC)
-Biped (PC)
-Battletoads (PC)
-Luigis Mansion (Switch)
-Pikuniku (PC)

-Pode (Switch)
-Pikmin 4 (Switch)"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I had to look it up. Cute father and daughter game. Find her another one. Co-op games are so much fun. 

I like brothers in arms games, that EA prison break one.. the Way Back? and the Wolfenstein one with the two Texas sisters. Obviously more adult titles but you get the idea"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"As a dad this made me tear up pretty hard.  
Congrats because what a great connection with your daughter. I'm sure she'll remember it with fondness later.  
I had a similar experience both with my kids and a niece that half grew up at our house. Luckily it was with Minecraft so no real ending. Many enjoyable hours exploring and building houses, castles, railroads, etc."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"My 10 year old finished this with me a few months back. We then did some achievement replays to 100% it. It’s a fantastic game and the characters were brilliant.

He has since found Brothers a tale of two sons and wants to play that with me."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Isn't this game about the parents getting back together?!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"That's very sweet that she enjoyed the gaming time that much.

I guess the main thing that could help is to tell her that this isn't the end of your gaming time together. There are other co-op games you could play together.

Maybe something like Untitled Goose Game (geese pranking humans)? Operation Tango (spy and hacker work together)? I think Stardew Valley also has a co-op mode now.

If you have a switch, Mario Galaxy and Odyssey both have co-op modes, where one person has a much less involved form of co-op."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"future mmorpg, moba, or any similar kind of grind never stop gamer right there >_>."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"There needs to be more good co-op focused games like that out there, for more experiences like this."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Spiritfarer is an option.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Check out Two Brothers! Similar concept, my daughter was 8 when she played it, an emotional and powerful experience."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,We were here series on steam is another good co op game
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,It takes two is a fantastic game. Honestly amazing and very hard. I cant wait to play it with my son one day
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"This is actually how I was at close to that age with books...

And I developed a bad habit from it... I would just not finishing reading books."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"It Takes Two was an incredible game.

My friend and I call it divorce simulator lol"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Time to pick up another coop game
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"The game is amazing. Our kids watched as my wife and I bickered, laughed, and cried while playing and beating the game. Same reaction from our children even as onlookers. YOU will be the one crying when you look back on these bonding moments as she gets older. ❤️🤘"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"The devs created a great game with a great story. You, however, created something special with your daughter. Be proud of that and take no shame in taking credit for it. Then, do it again /u/WTF_Conservatives. It's something she will never forget."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Pokemon Let's Go Evee/Pikachu has co-op. One player is the ""main"" and the other jumps in during battles with trainers (you each control half the team like a double-battle). When you catch Pokemon you actually make a throwing motion with the controller. Its easy enough to be a good intro to the series. 

Mario Odyssey is similar in that one player is Mario and the other is an invincible hat. Probably actually an easier game than It Takes Two, honestly. And definitely a less engaging story if that's what she's into."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Highly recommend Unravel.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Yeah dude time to walk in her room with a new game and go “ Alright Now let’s go beat this one!” Your thing isn’t the games, but the time in them. She doesn’t understand yet, but what she loved was time with you. The game just happened to be this one."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Try Ibb & Obb. It's little, fun coop game if no one recommended yet."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Check Knights and Bikes. Also emotional engaging story, cute graphics, good coop. I play a lot of coops with my gf but not so many are based on engaging stories and more in a kind of level progression like Overcooked."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Play Unravel Two with her. A little less storyline, but equally as wholesome and you will really need to work together to get it done.

You could also try playing Gang Beasts and Human Fall Flat.

They are both really, really funny games. You'll both have a blast playing them. Especially Gang Beasts."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Time for Portal 2!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,That's sad :(. I would recommend starting a new game with her (maybe introduce her to multiplayer games that may last longer). By the sounds of it she may like an RPG. Maybe try Pokémon Scarlet. It's great for kids and you can play it for a while before fully beating it's three different stories.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Bro, she liked playing with you. Start up Stray or another game appropriate for her age! I built a shed with my dad. I loved the building part but I also really liked having a thing for just us. He didn't even let my brothers help when they became interested. We finished and I was sad and suddenly the shed needed a sitting area and when that was done, it needed a place for the stray cats in winter time and what good is a shelter if it's not heated so we built in that, too. I'm an adult now and that shed is still our little place where we both go sometimes together to get away."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Maybe it wasn't about the game, it was the time you spent together that she enjoyed. You just need to keep up the good work and find more stuff you can bond over."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Play Valheim with her...
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Hey OP, be thankful we live in an age where a lot of decent indie games also have co-op.

You could try to get them into something like The Swords of Ditto, which was made a lot easier in recent years. It also has a very ""Saturday morning cartoon"" aesthetic, and isn't absurdly difficult. It's good for onboarding someone to a Legend of Zelda type game.

And hey, there's always Minecraft. Kids dig Minecraft."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Tell her you guys have 10 more games to beat!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I cry every time I finish a video game too. I don't finish them too often, but when I do it's because I fell in love with the game and am just full of a on of emotions at the end. It's pretty overwhelming, just saying this so maybe she will understand she's not alone in her experience. 

I wish I had another game to recommend for y'all, that one is pretty unique, it's going to be difficult to follow it."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Most likely she’ll be missing the time together
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Play Minecraft with her it's forever.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"There are other games to try out. I recommend Spyro Dawn of the Dragon. It's another platformer with characters that have unique abilities. 2 Player Co-op. It might be a little harder, I remember specific bosses that can kill you pretty quickly and only really take damage from 1 Element.

Anyways even if that's not the one for her, probably best to seek out another game. There also exist some games that don't ever end. You just keep playing until the developers ruin it too much for you, but that could also be an option if you got the set up.

If the game doesn't need to be multiplayer, you can watch/guide her through puzzle adventure games like Zelda games or Portal.

If it must be multiplayer though. When in doubt, there is always Minecraft.

Also if your looking more for story in a game and your daughter is old enough to be exposed to non-graphic death. Tales of games are multiplayer story heavy games. Only one person moves around in the overworld but battles are multiplayer. (The exception here being the most recent game, Arise. Which is not a real Tales of Game and fails to have multiplayer without mods)

Anyways I wouldn't give up on moving to another game if I were you."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I highly recommend you both play a game called Sky Children of Light. It's on every console, including iPhone and Android with cross play across all platforms. My daughter and I played on two PS5's and my wife joined us on her iPad. Although the game has ending credits it's free to play and never ends. There was also an Aurora concert recently and we all attended together. It was an amazing experience. Take a look."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I felt the same when I finished that game. It's so bittersweet because it's such a great game and you spent a bunch of time with a friend to beat it.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Loving something so much that you feel grief when it ends (be it a book, a game, or a tv series), it is one of the most wonderful things in the world. It is proof that you are alive, that you are really loving and squeezing the most out of your time here. I’ve really come to enjoy that soft melancholy that comes from turning the last page of a book and saying goodbye to the friends I made while reading. There is nothing else quite like it. 

Obviously in this moment, it sounds like a big traumatic growing moment for your kid, but it’s really an incredible gift of sorts. 

Finding the next thing that brings the same amount of investment and emotional connection will get easier and easier for her, and if she keeps it up, she will eventually have the perspective to see that connecting with a piece of art like that is one of the great gifts of our short lives. 

I’ve been meaning to check out It Takes Two with my little guy, and definitely will be doing it asap now."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"That game is phenomenal on so many levels.   

Consider Rayman legends, or Rayman Origins, just a brilliantly fun game, Portal 2 though if you're playing PC that might not work (on one computer) or just Minecraft (if you have a laptop).    Also Cook Serve Delicious are fun in 2 player, but they can be a bit intense.

My daughter and I are/were playing It takes two (Sadly she's 19 now so she has less time to play), but she loves to play minecraft and I join her."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Can somebody give me karma so I can ask a question on a post
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"My daughter reacted the same way when we finished Super Mario Odyssey. She calmed down when I explained that we could still collect the rest of the moons.  
Since then, we've played Grounded, Sea of Thieves, Monster Hunter, and many others."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,It wasn’t just the game.. it was the ritual of sitting down with dad and having fun.  Just gotta find another game.. video or otherwise.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"My husband and I played it. We loved it! Although I kept telling him how woman in the game was going most of the work and all he had to do was simple stuff like stand and turn back time, much like our real life!"

16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Time for some Portal coop
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Play little big planet, it's very similar and they have a trilogy."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"It's actually quite an intense feeling of loss, when a game (or book, or tv show) you're so deeply emotionally invested in just... ends. Just that moment of reckoning when you realise there won't be any more of that particular brand of joy. You can never experience that thing for the first time ever again, that feeling of discovery that can never truly be repeated. It leaves a hole, for a while anyway. 

Maybe that's what she was feeling, and it might have been a new experience for her if it hit her paricularly acutely."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"A true gamer :') It is always bittersweet to beat a great game. Especially when the journey was so special doing it with you.

16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I don't have any philosophic lesson, but I agree with the top comment. Just wanted to recommend another game that could be very fun for you guys. Knack and Knack II is multi-player at times, though if I remember correctly, it's a little different than normal co-ops"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Just replay it with her, and then again and again until she moves on to another thing.

But please, replay it.

My dad has an old age disease, similar to Alzheimer, and I can say my dad is no longer with me, and will never be with me again, despite he's still alive.

Obviously I've spent quite a lot of time thinking about the memories I have of him, and the fondest of all of them it's him playing with me an Spectrum game, Montezuma's Revenge. (aka Panama Joe) 

I was 9 or 10 then, now I'm 46, and yes, after reviewing all of my shared moments with my dad several times... that's my best memory with him.

Never let go the opportunity to do something together with your kids."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,You are playing with fire considering the entire plot and resolution of that game.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"My daughter and I also played through it takes 2. Shes 7 and found some parts difficult but we persevered . I’ve been gaming for 30 years and it was by far the best gaming experience I’ve ever had. There are so many beautiful moments, amazing locations, the gameplay mechanics vary from chapter to chapter. I can’t recommend this game enough to anyone wanting to game with a family member, especially one less use to it.

We were also sad when it ended and have tried other games together but so far nothing has come close. An absolute master piece and hopefully something we’ll always remember sharing."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"That's beautiful. My kid and I play minecraft on the weekends. She loves it so much and gets so excited when it's time to play. The fun of playing it has worn thin for me a while ago - but seeing my kids face every time I ask ""You wanna play some Mine??"" is worth it every single time."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,The Trine series has some solid couch coop for a side scroller and there are a few of them.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Aww. What a touching story. You sound like a wonderful family. I wish I could play the game along with you guys!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I bet she would love it if you had another game to play together.  I bet part if not all of the sadness comes from thinking no more time to play with dad every night
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,100% she fears losing that special time with you now that you e beat the game. Hopefully you start a new game and continue the tradition.

16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Me and the wife played this, had a lot of fun with it.  As with your daughter, she was sad that we finished and still wanted to play.  

We switched characters and it's almost a whole different game for the two of us."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,Unraveled 2 was another awesome 2 player game!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Portal 1 & 2, fantastic games!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"She’s sad that the time with *you* is ending, not the game. Pick a new thing to do together ❤️ you’re great."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,The only logical progression is to play A Way Out with her now
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"i would suggest a tale of two brothers, but that is very tragic for an infant, so maybe not"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,Reassure her that the bonding time is not over. that may be a big piece of it.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,Is tldr just dead now.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Pick a new game to play with her right away and explain that real gamers don't really run backlogs. Pick one from your backlog.

This very thing is why you guy kids a hamster. They don't live long. Get a new pet, right?"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,Buckle in kiddo next we’re going for Elden Ring all Remembrances!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Some advice to keep the happiness going; try to switch characters and play again!

My BF and I are playing It Takes Two and I love it!! It's such a fun game for the two of us to chip away at. Many times I think ""I wish I was playing as Cody, so I could have X super power or weapon"" so we agreed once we finish, we take a small break and will do it all over again but different characters. It might be repetitive but this time you can see how you favor with different tasks. 

I am glad you two found something you enjoy, and I totally get your Childs disappointment. I hate finished games for that exact reason, it's tough to say goodbye to your characters and your routine. Hopefully you can find another two person game soon!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"When my son was 4, we finished Kirby’s Epic Yarn and it was a similar reaction. He was sad that Kirby and Prince Fluff’s journey together was over and that Kirby was going back to Dream Land. I had to console him by reminding him that Kirby still had the magic sock and could still go visit his friend any time. 

It was a very bittersweet moment for one so young. 

By the way, Kirby’s Epic Yarn is a good co-op game if you’re looking for something else to play. If she can handle it It Takes Two she might find it too easy, but I still found it charming and enough of a challenge if you go for all the collectibles in each stage."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Well, at least you and your daughter wont get divorced now.

Pro Tip: Start playing World of Warcraft with your daughter."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,So buy another game and play that.  It's like finishing a good book.  Grab another.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"I get the same way when I finish a long book or series. You spend this time getting to ""know"" all these characters and then suddenly you don't get to know what happens to them next. There is no ""next"". It's over. And even if the ending was good or satisfying, you still grieve a little knowing that these imaginary people l got to know."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,She is just sad that you guys won't have that experience anymore. The good news is that there are tons of games that you guys can play together. I have a 9yr old as well and he's an excellent gamer. All of the Lego games are co-op and she appropriate. Knack 2 is a good one. Minecraft is his current favorite. Just plug a few different ones in front of her and a new one will click.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Congrats to your daughter! My wife couldn’t get through ITT with me sadly. Got through a few worlds though! I love it, I’ve beaten it with a buddy over a few sittings with beers. Amazing couch co op. Unravel 2 is amazing and a good recommend, as the stronger gamer can carry (literally) through the tougher sections"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"No.... you created something special by spending time with your daughter. She may love the game, but what she was really reacting to was her thinking this special time you spent together would be over."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"I made an indie game in the same vein as It Takes Two!

&nbsp;

It's very short, so ""It's over?"" would have a bit more bitter, a bit less sweet connotations than the one in the OP!  You can finish it in about two hours.

&nbsp;

And there's no production value, as opposed to ITT, which is just brimming with it.  My game has primitive graphics, music, and sound.

&nbsp;

…aaaaand, seeing all the crazy good indies that have come before and after it, I must admit it's a little overpriced for what's there, at $5.

&nbsp;

But it's co-op OR single-player puzzle platforming, start to finish!

16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,The cool thing with it takes two is that the second playtgrough might be fun aswell since you switch tasks for everything including minigames
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"As a woman my many of my most treasured memories with my dad as a child are around gaming. 

While she might be disappointed the game is over, maybe part of it is worrying that special time with you will go away if this was your first time playing through something together.

It’s not co-op, but Wytchwood is adorable and has puzzles you could work out together. My favorite memories are playing Mario with my dad, so maybe getting some of the classics and testing those out? There are so many options now that it can be overwhelming, but I hope you don’t let this special time slip away."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,I would like up know her reaction to the elephant part
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"We’re working on Escape Room together. Excited for the portal DLC. It takes two sounds great though for the two player dynamics and story. Thank you for sharing, I hope I can play this journey too, even If only 50% of the time."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,Kids like to play the same game multiple times. Maybe play it with her again
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"I bet a big part of it was her thinking ""guess time with Dad is done too now""

And that would get me upset too."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,I suspect it’s not about the game. It’s about time spent with you. Talk to her and the two of you pick out another game to play together.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,Replay the game as the other characters! This game has great replay value because of this.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Mines 8. She had a similar reaction.

My solution: ""you know what, we have to go back and get all the secrets!"""
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"That’s so great that you got that time together! I’m a single dad too with my kids 50/50. I love my game time with them. I tried finding a couch co-op game to play with each of my kids (12 and 9) My son and I started It Takes Two but my daughter hated Overcooked so we started playing It Takes Two also and I played through it with each of them. Eventually that ended and the only trauma we had was over what we had to do to the elephant. We’ve moved on to other co-ops like Unravel 2 and it’s just becoming regular bonding time. I’d say let her know that your bond and the time you spend together is never over, just the games you’re playing change."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,Oh. My heart.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,Formidable Moment win. She will eventually realize that the adventure was the best memory and that its worth it to do things even knowing it will eventually end.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"That’s adorable… I definitely know how she feels. I don’t get interested in games easily, so when I enjoy one and it’s getting close to the end I can’t help but feel sad that it’s all over."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Human Fall Flat is a super fun 2 person co-op game, highly recommend!

Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime might be a good co-op game for you both as well. It's for 1-4 players but it worked well with just 2. 

Also, you can always circle back to playing It Takes Two again in a few months. I found it fun to switch characters with my boyfriend and play the other role. Made it a bit different for the second time through."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"When I was that age, I remember getting EXTREMELY stressed and sad about things ending or changing-- and I cried at the end of every good book or game. Super Mario 2 (on GBA) especially with that saccharine dream-sequence credits roll.

I suspect your daughter will eventually grow a strong sense of mindfulness-- taking time to cherish good things right when they're happening, because of how hard she knows it'll hit once it's over. A good trait to have!!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"I play games with my son (7yo) We beat It takes two and it did hurt because it was a game that relied so much on working together. Some other games we have beat are Luigis Mansion and Mario Odyssey. I think as long as it's a fun silly game, they will enjoy the experience. Keep gaming together!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Several years ago, my two kids were watching reruns of the animated TV show *Code Lyoko,* on some not-quite-legal site that made them watch no more than 2 to 3 episodes a week. They were something like 10 and 7 years old. They made a thing of it—they’d sit together in front of the computer and watch. And then they’d talk about it.

They finally got to the end of the 97 episodes. As I recall, it didn’t really wrap up that neatly.

And at bedtime that night, my son asked me, forlornly, “Do you think they’ll make any more?” And then he just silently started crying.

He was sad it was over.

When the last Harry Potter book came out, I was sad–for the months leading up to the release of the last book, it had felt like the entire world was united in anticipation, and then it was over. And I knew it would be a long time before something similarly unifying came out.

The thing is, for both situations, it wasn’t so much the TV show or the books. Sure, that was sad, to have those good experiences end. 

But for my son, it was the time with his sister, the shared experience, that made the show so very much more enjoyable. And for me with the book series, it was this sense of having so many people sharing my anticipation.

It’s not *just* that this game was particularly good, and that she enjoyed the *game.* It is very much that this was the game she played with daddy. *That* part, you can reinvigorate. You can’t recreate it, but you can create something similar. 

All my sympathies to your girl!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Op: look up a game called Brothers, a tale of two sons. Very unique coop game"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,Maybe she thought that daddy/daughter time was all over because the game was over.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Minecraft dungeons
Diablo 3

Both good couch coops"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Similar thing happened with my youngest and cuphead.  We played it together and beat it together.  For a platform shooter, it’s friggin hard for a casual gamer.  My kid now has wicked fast reflexes though."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,Play overcooked next! Or movin’ out!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Play minecraft together - it doesn't end :D

You can also play mario party/mario kart...super smash brothers which you pretty much play against eachother"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,Time to set her up on an mmorpg.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Maybe she thought it wasn't so much the game, but the incredible time with her father that she thinks she's going to lose. Grab another game and get back at it! You're an amazing dad btw"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,The game itself is amazing but I think your daughter just loved spending the time with you especially since you are only with her for what feels like an incredibly short time to her. This just proves that studios and developers should make more multiplayer games instead of everything being online and separated. I remember the days of Nintendo 64 and GameCube having a blast with friends and parents in the same room - kids don't get that today. Sad really.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,Sounds like she really loved doing that with you! I kind of wonder if part of why she was so sad was in her head it meant no longer getting to play or with you? I bet she'd love to play more games with you! :)
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"This was my reaction to finishing Ocarina of Time at roughly the same age. One of the first games I beat, I distinctly remember crying and saying ""It can't be over, I want *more*."" I've been chasing that feeling ever since. I've caught it a few times, but I still want more."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Damn dude, I teared up reading this. Good job as a parent, and a human being."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"This is just me taking a guess here, but maybe she wasn't sad that the GAME was over. Maybe she thought father-daughter bonding time was over. I would start a NEW game with her. Let her pick it out, and whatever it is, just go with it. It might be Barbie happy fun time dress up makeover edition, or it might be dark souls 3. Just go with it. If I'm right, the game doesn't matter. YOU matter. Your bonding time matters. 

Or I might be wrong, and she loved It Takes Two. In which case, bug the developers for a sequel. 

But I like to think it's the wholesome one, and she just wants to spend time with her dad."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"What was the experience like playing that with your daughter given the divorce storyline? 

Seems like you'd both have an interesting relationship to it than me and my housemate playing it together haha"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"She just wants to keep gaming with you, try and find similar games for y’all to play together"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Play it from the other side!

And then play “Adventures of Cookies & Cream”"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Dang. The elephant scene made ME cry. I couldn't imagine being a child and playing through that. Then again, kids seem to have different resistance to different emotional things."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"My daughter and I started Stray a few weeks back. Shes 5 and AuDHD like I am, so its gonna take us ages naturally but im dreading the end as I have nowhere to go from here. Its *slow* going as I have to read all the dialog out and she runs around bein a cat slowly progressing along while mostly knocking paint cans over... I gotta deal with the lil bugs for her, she gets scared.

Its truly wonderful and brings me back to playing the OG LoZ with my mom. I don't want to push her too hard but I hope she develops a love of gaming for us to share :D"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,Just wait till she finishes Return of the King
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,Little Nightmares 3 will be co-op and you guys could enjoy playing the first two together if it won’t be too scary for her.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,My wife and I play Overcooked every night before sending the kids to bed and it's been a great routine we both love. The sequel is even better and there's an arcade mode with expansions that keep it fresh for a long time. Cheers!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,It’s an amazing game.  The good news is that you can always play it again or look for another game to play.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,There is a great little indie game called Knights and Bikes. Couch coop my wife and I had a blast playing it. Story is kid friendly but with depth and lovable characters.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"If you don’t know it, Spiritfarer might be a nice follow-up. It’s a sandbox building management about a girl and her cat that basically escort different characters to the afterlife. It is made with a lot of heart and emotion, and player 2 plays as the cat. Be warned though, it will definitely make you feel things since it’s about grief and loss, but is absolutely beautiful."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Check out Spider Heck, that’s a fun game for two people that pretty much doesn’t have an end"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"theres more videogames, I suggest “untitled goose game”, take turns and try to figure how to continue togueter"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Unravel and Unravel 2 exist. While I like It Takes Two, I find the story highly problematic especially for a young girl who is going through this same shit, and the lesson of the game is pretty much ""stay together for the kids"" which makes you look like an asshole when and if she ever figures out what the plot is.

Also, I would buy her Spiritfarer: Farewell Edition to play at mom's house. For the lulz."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Keep in mind it was likely not just the game she was mourning Dad. You were a team, don’t let that stop."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Did the elephant scene traumatised her as much as it did me? Lol

Well done though! Now go for stardew valley, dinkum or other games like that for a relaxing gaming experience. :)"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"After some time, you can replay It takes two with her but switch the roles this time. That’s what my husband and I did, and we enjoyed the second playthrough almost as much as the first time."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,I had played it with my kid as well. Can totally relate to your experience as I see her also only 50% of the time. And it was kind a similar. She was not really inconsolable but she was kinda disappointed that it ended. And I miss it too now because I haven't found a similar fun local coop game for us. I think we have to start it again it's over a year past now 😂
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"That's why I taught my son pretty early that having a vast collection of games you never play is more important thant finishing a single one.  
  
Jokes aside, when we finished Mario Odyssey I tried to teach him how selling the game allowed us to buy a new one, it's been 5 years now and I'm pretty sure he still has Mario Odyssey loss PTSD buried deep down."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Welp, you just sold a copy of It Takes Two to a fellow dad."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,My husband and I played It Takes Two together. It's a fantastic game. The best part about a game ending is you can play it again! Maybe play it this time by playing the opposite character?
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"I dont think your daughter cried because the game was ending. She was sad because the quality time with here father was ending. 

Well thats my take on it anyway. Keep playing games with your daughter♥️"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"That's lovely 😊

There isn't enough couch coop games.

Multiplayer online doesn't interest me, but playing with the family does.  Dug out old Wii out last year for that very reason"

But
Try human fall flat.
Me sons is a bit older 17 now but we have played this game for3/4 years now. When they add new levels or just for the fun of it.
The movements are hilarious and we often spend more time finding fun ways to sabotage than actually solving.
But every session is filled with laughter, I've actually had to pause playing because of tears, stomach pain and running to the loo from laughing so hard.

Also Phogs where you play opposite ends of a dog the controls are a little easier and it's got a great cartoon look"

16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"I looked at this game t to play with my 8 year old. There’s a real lack of couch co op gaming out there?

In the end we settled on sack boy but ill look into it takes two when we are done."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,now people will now screen cap this and repost on r/mademesmile till the end of time
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,Honestly I think your daughter may be more sad about not being able to do something with you anymore. I’m sure she’ll perk up again in time. Plus you get the excitement of choosing a nee game to play together. Others recommended Stardew Valley which is a great choice for a never ending experience. But if you want something more linear and have a PlayStation try the Puyo Tetris games.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,Unraveled 1&2 another cute multi-player I highly recommend
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Stardew Valley.  

It *never* truly ends.  

Local couch co-op on PS4 (so PS5 as well).  

or, just start again.  I have played It Takes Two twice with my daughter."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"She was sad because (a) the game was over and (b) she enjoyed playing it with you.

That's really great.

You need to find something else to do together."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"She probably thinks that with that game ending that that time you spent is over too.
Better find another game lol"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,This is the time to create a family tradition and beat it with her every year. Thanks for a beautiful story!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"It’s a great lesson on loss actually. As parents we want to fix things like this, but ideally OP your actions should be to start another game."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Sweet child! A lot of good recommendations for some co op games here OP!

My son did something similar and we explained it like ""a video game is like a book. The book ends, yes, but that doesn't mean we can't read it again later. Same with video games""

You're a good parent and this is a good bonding experience! Tell her that there's a lot of other games yall can play together but you can always play this one again."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,My girlfriend and I had the same reaction and recently replayed it! We really took the time to explore each level. Perhaps y’all can do that too one day:)
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Go for Stardew valley next. Amazing game with no real ""end"" besides reaching 100%. My wife and I have a ton of hours in that game"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Well you found your co player for portal multiplayer!

Maybe have her solve the game by herself and sit with her and then once she knows the basic mechanics or completed it play the multi player with her!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"A totally normal reaction! My wife and I have played through this game 1.5 times (so far), and my wife, who isn't even a big gamer, considers this to be her favorite game ever. It's truly such a fun well done game. I look forward to a hopeful sequel.

Use this experience to start a new co-op game with your daughter. Yoshi's Crafted World on Switch and Yoshi's Wooly World on WiiU are both fantastic, Mario 3d World/Bowser's Fury on Switch, Donkey Kong Returns/Tropical Freeze, Unravel 2, Trine....  all of these are amazing games for couch co-op of the non-FPS kind that provide many more hours of fun.

&#x200B;

Thanks for sharing!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,Unravel 2 is a great game for two players. Look it up It has it all.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-08,"I’ve been thinking about this post for days. I remember being like that with a lot of books as a kid, too. The idea that the world was ending was so heartbreaking"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-17,I’m not crying you are 😭😭
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-21,Just beat Shredder’s Revenge with my 3yo and he was just ready to start all over - so we did with new characters.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-12-04,I got stuck and gave up . Congrats and my daughter is 10  I can relate
16brgts,2023-09-06,2024-01-06,"I think she thinks your time with her playing together will end too and that's what she's mourning....

Go buy another game and challenge her to win it with you"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Damn, I hope I get the chance to have a good chance to bond like this with my kids when they're older. I definitely felt a slight sting in my heart reading this."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Play it again :)
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"I went and watched a video of It Takes Two and cried like your daughter.  My parents divorced when I was young. If I played this game with my Dad back then and we finally beat it and my parents were still divorced I would have lost my shit too.  I kinda just did lose my shit.  

You sound like a great dad.  It's really cool.  But for a 9 year old from a divorced family... It's gotta be like watching Lion King or Bambi.  It's good but it's tough, ya know?"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-12-15,Love thos game.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,Post reads like a shill lol
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Welcome to the reason most players wont finish a game but leave the final misson unfinished
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,Play Portal 2 with her!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,What in the LinkedIn is this?
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,Just restart and show her you can keep playing
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,To be fair it’s a pretty easy game
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,[deleted]
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Hello everyone! I am looking for a game i can't find, i have searched for more than a week and still can't find it, i also used chat gpt and it was not enough, so I came to the last place where I can try :))
The game was an RPG, similar to ghotic 2/3 where the combat was turn based ( similar to heroes 3) you controlled your hero and leveled up and explore a medieval/scifi world. You could get cyclops and other groups and humans to join your team. I obly remeber that at the end you had some battles in a castel that was under siege. It was around the year
2008-2010 when I played it. Ps it is not dive divinity or Kings Bounty or other bigger names.
If you guys could help me I will thank your verry much!
Have a great day!!!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Sounds like y'all should play Baldurs Gate 3 splitscreen. Will keep you busy for the next few years, she'll learn a lot, etc.

lol."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,Hit her with the Cuphead
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"OP Get Portal to play with her. It's a ton of fun as a full adult. Also, he could build her a PC and play modded minecraft with her. That way the game doesn't ever have to end. Just download a new mod with a different challenge. You'd be surprised how much physics, engineering, and chemistry they'd pick up and there are some lighter magic based mods but all involve a large degree of problem solving."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,why didn't you explain that the game will eventually end whilst playing? seems like a missed opp at explaining the circle of life🦓🐖🎮⚰️💀
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,Hello everyone I am trying to gather point in order to post regarding to a game I can’t find. Please help a brother up
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Yea it’s called digital addiction
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,[deleted]
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,You need to spend more time with your daughter homie
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"The difference is 

You saw it as a chore/task to be completed.

She saw it as something she really enjoyed and got attached to.

This is like watchin a TV series. Some shows start off good and I feel I'm too invested to stop watching after the 4th season. Once the 6th season is over there is a sign of relief. 

Other shows that have an amazing season but the story ends after the first season. Those truly leave a feeling of sadness.

Asian shows do this quiet well, while alot of American shows just keep farming it non-stop. Vampire diaries, suits, both started solid, then it just kept going......"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,[removed]
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Maybe let her pick out a single player game you own and let her have a fun journey where she is more in control with you right along side her to offer advice and help if she needs it?
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"As a kid I always got stuck on the 2nd or third level of games, so I basically got infinite play out of them. It took me 3 years of random wandering to beat pokemon black and white, the first game I ever beat, and I will never forget how that credits roll made me feel"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Are you sure the primary reason she was upset was just because THAT game was over, or could she have been sad/afraid because she worried that the game ending meant she was losing that time to spend and play games with you? 

It's a really good game, don't get me wrong, and also can be quite emotional (the only thing I can think of in gaming that made me more uneasy than the >!""Killing the Stuffed Elephant"" !<portion of it Takes Two was the final chapter of The Last of Us 2), but it just seems like a young kid might really be caring more about her loss of ""Dad Time"" than the end of even a very good game."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Try the remastered versions of Sam and Max of the last two years, great fun to do together"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I'm in my 40s, and I still get sad when I finish a game I was really fond of.

The Trine series are probably my favorite co-op games. They focus more on puzzle solving than anything else, but I recommend checking them out to see if they might be a good fit for you two."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Welp, time to whoop her ass in COD or go bang some hookers together in GTA"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"lol aww. im happy u two got to experience that together <3. I remember gettin my super nintendo when i was 5 years old and my dad played some of the games with me. Eventually it was just me playing, but i still hold those early memories of playing video games with my dad. 

&#x200B;

FFWD me being 35, and i always feel a slight sadness after beating a game i put so many hours into. Mostly rpgs tend to have this effect on me. Like damn, its over. Usually when i beat a Final Fantasy game, i get hit with post game depression lol."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"The developers were great. But I'm sure you know that almost the entire value for her was to get to spend time with you, where both you and her enjoyed something together. 

You're the one who made her feel like she never wants it to be over. Hold on to that, and keep the tradition going. You sound like a great dad."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Overcooked is a lot of fun. Light on story but cute graphics and challenging enough to keep you entertained.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,My 8 year old son and I played It Takes Two and it set the wheels in motion of us playing a game together every Saturday morning if we're able.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Game might end, gaming doesn't. Try another Coop game, keep playing games with your daughter as long as it is possible."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Tell her you still need to go back and unlock all the mini games, and you can still play those against her.

Get a Switch and get Kirby games, those are usually good co-op games too, although a bit on the short side.

And you can also choose a few games and ask her “so, what should we play next?” so she knows that there are other games for you two to play together."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Aww, poor  thing. Still, that sounded like the most lovely way to spend time together. Thank you for sharing."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Yeah, my daughter and I have played it twice so far. We've been looking for something to match up to it, but no luck so far."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Absolutely beautiful game and precious reaction. If you haven't already, play Unravel 2 with her as well. I'm currently playing IT2 with the wife who is also not a gamer at all, and it takes ages but it's part of our ""relationship"" time.

And when your daughter grows up introduce her to HL2 and then tell her HL3 never came out and you can both be inconsolable together."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Thats a core memory moment
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Check out Unravel Two. It has won multiplayer and family game awards. Might be good for a next one? :)

https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/unravel/unravel-two"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Time to break out Overcooked!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I had much the same reaction when my mum and I finished Goonies II on the NES. Definitely felt like I'd been on an actual adventure and felt sad it had to end.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I remember something similar happened to me as a kid with a movie that had a sad end and I couldn't assimilate it was over...

I can understand how she feels. I would tell her that you guys can keep playing a lot more co-op games together! Maybe what she really liked was to enjoy it with you."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Time to get her playing dark souls.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I still do this when I beat a game I really like.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,My first game with my daughter was resident evil 5. She was 6 or 7 at the time. She’s now 12 and we’re actually working on It Takes Two ourselves right now. Let her know there are more games out there you can beat together!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,If this feeling is too much for her you could look for a procedurally generated game. Technically endless.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"My wife and I played this game together. We have no kids yet. Practically the same for us. Was sad that it ended as we enjoyed it and loved it so much. I hope they make more. 

There are tons of other couch coop games that are great. Start the next chapter of your gaming together!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Dang, my son keeps telling me we need to play together. He's 10. I want to check it out more now."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Yes the developers created something dope. However LISTEN TO ME: the memory you created is something so incredibly powerful. Yeah she’s sad the game ended but probably more so the bonding over that specific thing has ended. How often do kids get to share something they like with a parent on such a deep level.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Overcooked and Moving out have multiple games and a lot of extra optional challenges
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"This was such a good game!  I played it with my 9 year daughter.

Another couple fun games

PHOGS 

Pile Up! Box by box"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I reccomened Magika 2, it's a pretty fun ceap Co op game where you play as wizards!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Aww... 😔
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,r/wholesome
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"My son and I had a similar experience with that game, he was maybe 7ish at the time… for the following weeks after we beat the game, he still turn it on once a while just to mess around and asked me to play more of those “challenges” with him. He knows the game/story is done but don’t want it to end either. We have completed other games before but for some reason, this story stuck with him the most. 

I have completed many stories/games so I understand, but seeing his reaction reminded me how I have buried some of that emotion deep inside, and it hurts me more seeing him sad than feeling the sadness myself. 

We are playing Destiny2 as a family these days, but my son still ask about games like It Takes Two all the time and ask me to find “more like that”."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I too played this game with my daughter. She did need help on parts but it's a great game!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Play unravel!! Is a wholesome coop. And if she is in for the experience. little nightmare 2. Could be magical
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Dead Space 3 has co-op
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Find more couch co-op games the girl wants time with her father, the game was probably just a bonus."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I find it interesting that you played that of all games with her, lol.  My wife and I played it together, and our take away was that they were both HORRIBLE parents, lol.  We loved the game.  It's well made, we had a lot of fun, and the idea that you HAVE to play with someone and work together was great.  But those two people were just shitty parents.  So it's kinda interesting to me that as a single parent, you played it with your young child.

All in all though, I agree with others.  Just because you beat that one, doesn't mean it has to be the end.  There are plenty of other games you can play together.  You could always do Minecraft, which basically can go on forever, lol."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I would suggest overcooked to you if you both like high stakes fun multiplayer!
It can get rather tense but there are soo many levels to revisit, it has a star rating where you can try again if you did not make it to three (and it has multiple games), so there would be a whole lot of play time you can get out of it! It is for sure not as detailed as it takes two, but its quite the fun multiplayer game! 

(That or unraveled 2/and multiplayer mario platformers like the mario bros series. I still play mario with my dad still at 19 and it is just so much fun (cant wait for wonder!))"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I’ve been playing this with my niece for months and it legit is taking us forever since she told me she didn’t want the game to end. So we barely play it and when we do we rarely focus on the objectives. We’re basically in the end game part and just choose to play something else instead of ending this one.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Time to restart!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,My sister also cried when it was over. So we are on our third play through now.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"If you want another fun game to play, look up unraveled. The 2nd one also has coop"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Awe, that reaction reminds me of when I finish a really good book and I feel sad it's ended."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Not all games have an ending though. You can introduce her to one of those.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Haven't played it, and I don't know how appropriate it would be for your child, but the studio does have another similar game titled ""A Way Out"". I believe its similar as in its mandatory 2 player co-op, and story focused. It is about two dudes escaping prison though, maybe someone whose played could weigh in."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,My daughter and I have played through the game twice and it holds up so jump right back in! I would also recommend checking out Unraveled 2 for some dad/daughter puzzle solving fun.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Just a thought here, could it be that gaming with her dad was such a bonding moment that she felt the game ending as a loss of that experience you shared? I might be totally off with that thought though."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Can you tell me another story? What was her reaction to the elephant scene?
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Awwww
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I still have that reaction with books. Always sad when a great book ends
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,You can go back and replay all the mini games!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I played this with my 7 yo boy and we absolutely loved it. I think he enjoyed attacking my character a little too much though. I think we’re going to play again a switch roles this time!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I still cry like a little girl when I know the end of a game I love is wrapping up
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Play Mario with her, up to 4 player one. My sister, my niece, b-i-l and I played it and we have so much fun together just dying and repeating levels. It's a great family game. 

Best thing is when you beat the game there's more Mario games like it"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"To chime in on new game recommendations - highly recommend Overcooked. There are a million levels, it's all co-op, it's super cute and collaborative, and very fun."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Literally like a core aspect of the human condition, good things, (like life when taken to the extreme) don't last forever. Harsh lesson for anyone to learn but...but yeah we all have to come to grips with it. 

Must be hard to watch, kid certainly lost a bit of innocence realizing it. The good news is you can assure her that in this instance she can start a new game to enjoy...it won't 100% replace It Takes Two but she may have just as much fun."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Every time a story I love ends I’m sad. I feel her.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I’m a child of divorce and I have very fond memories of going to my dads house and playing video games with him.

So I just want to say as someone who’s been in your daughters shoes before, thanks for being there to make these memories even if it can’t be as often as possible"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"if you guys havent found all of the mini games yet, definitely go back and try to find them with her. my bf and i completed the game a while back but just now found all the games. plus you can go back and play them whenever you want!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,What was her reaction to torturing and dismembering the cute elephant?
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I feel her... even though we wanted to quit halfway through (plushy, not saying more).... I kinda wish I could erase my memory and play it again. :/"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Time to start Unravel 2! :)
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Now she’s ready for The Last of Us!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Maybe a tale of two brothers
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Portal 2 coop
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"If she can beat that game, may I recommend Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime . It has a cute art style to it but it can get crazy difficult"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I hear half life is a great story telling game that the 2 of you might want to pick up next.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Castle Crushers is 4 person Co-Op. But you can play two as well as solo.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Next game: A Way Out
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,My kids want to play this. They are 11 and 6. Would you say it's ok?
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Well, time to introduce her to endless games like, WoW"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,My husband is like this so he almost never finishes games or TV shows or movie series. I end up finishing it by myself because I love the feeling of completion and I'll happily play through again with him.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"This reminds me of the time I finished yoshis island back when I was 6

It was the first game I completed and I waited on the end screen for at least an hour hoping there was something more coming afterwards 🥹"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"""It's ok! We can play a new game together. Let's pick another one."""
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I think making a special moment of picking out a new game together for another challenge will help. It will help her work through moving on and that you both still get to continue with a new adventure.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Hey! Time for you two to start looking for your next adventure. 

If she wants a co-op puzzle/platformer if there’s a Lego game she’s into they’re pretty good, Harry Potter maybe- I’m not sure what 9 year olds like. My son and I loved Lego un ser over.

Otherwise sack boy and Mario brothers are fun ones I enjoyed. I also love overcooked as a co op game, that same studio also makes one where you pack a moving truck but I’ve never played that game."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I was about that age when I had an existential crisis in a bookstore, because my mom told me I couldn't get every book I had picked off of the shelf.  I realized that no matter how fast I read, I'd never have enough time to read every good book before I died.   


It's funny how comprehension of some things arrives for kids -- big huge understandings showing up in unexpected ways. I remember that moment like it was yesterday. I'm glad that you guys got to have that experience together."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"""games don't go on forever"" .... Yeah... some of them do (at least to the extent of what forever means to a mortal human).... I know people who are still playing minecraft to this day on the same world they started many years ago. Sure you can beat the ender dragon, but then the game actually opens up more with Elytra and end resources. At that point you just make your own fun. You just pretty much keep on playing till you get tired of it. Minecraft isnt the only one, there are tons of others like that. 

I still have a Dwarf Fortress world I have been playing on for a long time. Because I'm so invested in the lore and history of that world that I have had quite a few fotresses and adventures (in adventure mode). It's honestly great. We have actually finally established peace with goblins so no more raids at all. Our current fortress is focused on ridding the world of werewolf infestation that rampaged across the land."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,If you play on Xbox I’m not sure if it’s on PlayStation but you can go into the store and hit co-op games and load’s should pop up
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Sandbox games go on forever. This is a cute story though, thanks for sharing, I hope you and your daughter find more games to love and play together :)"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,It’s more serious and less cutesy but I think the same creators made the game the way out and my husband and I really enjoyed that one too!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I thoroughly recommend Battleblock Theatre as a fun co-op game that I haven't seen anyone else mention yet. 

Sounds like you now have lots of suggestions for more fun co-op games you can play with her in future. She will treasure the memories I'm sure!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Now you should play that developers other game with your daughter: “A Way Out”
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Quick, download portal 2 and play coop with her OP"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,This is when you start training her to duo lane with you in League of Legends! /s
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,If you're on PlayStation a great game to play is Little Big Planet. It was always a childhood favourite of mine. And when you're done with the story. You have a whole bunch of community created content.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Yoy get to swap roles now and she can do the stuff your character did and you can do the stuff she did
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Try Terraria. But be aware that you need the console version for split screen multiplayer, otherwise you need two screens. I got a ton of age agnostic multiplayer mileage out of this one. Doesn't have an end, either."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Oh wow. The end of the game was kinda an end with the fun she had with you. Your next step is to try and speed run it. Every time you finish, it isn't the end because next week you're going for the next record. Keep a chart of the runs and let her record and be in charge record keeping. In the meantime, between visits, you either look up tricks, tips, or a different activity to do together."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Let her know it can be replayed. She's 9, I promise she won't mind doing the same activity twice"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Now you gotta find the next game you two can team up for duh!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I LOVED that game and the story!! It was alot of fun to play!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I'm playing this game now with my 14 year old son.

She might be a little young, but you could always play Portal 2 together next.  The Lego games are really good for 2p Co-Op as well."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I feel this frequently when I finish a game with a story that sucks me in. An odd feeling of, ""that was too easy"" and ""it's over?"" 

Side note, how does she react to other accomplishments? You may want to have her checked out for depression. There's this thing where I don't feel stimulated by accomplishments and everything feels like anticlimax. Hopefully it's nothing but it might also be a red flag for high functioning depression."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,This was me when I recently finished the Portal 2 multiplayer with my mate.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Play it again, switch characters."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"My favorite coop game so far has been Luigis Mansion 3 for the Nintendo Switch. My 5 year old daughter and I played through the whole thing together and it was a blast. Similar to it takes two in that you both get to play a fully capable character, but you have to help each other to solve the games puzzles. Highly recommend if you have a switch."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Replay it, this time you both will be better from the start."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I didn't read all the responses, so maybe this has already been said.

I'm willing to bet she's seeing the end of the fun time with YOU. It's not about the game."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,wow that crazy
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Like this blunt, all good things must come to an end
-lil Wayne"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,What's the next game ? :)
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Maybe in a few weeks try again but let her play as Cody
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Nintendo still makes some great couch co-op games, in particular Mario games. Super Mario 3D World is excellent and long! 

It’s difficult to find multiplayer couch co-op games these days like It Takes Two. That was something special."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,This happened when my youngest was 6 with Mario 64. It was the first game we played together and she didn’t realize there would be many more!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime and Unraveled are both good fun!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"That's pure. We humans like the pursuit of a goal, not the goal itself."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I beat it with my daughter as well who is the same age as yours.  She was ok (aside from the elephant part, what the heck..) but I do recall myself when I was a child playing Final Fantasy 2 on Snes and the feeling of overwhelming sadness when I beat it realizing it was over.  I get what she is going through.  If you are on PS5, they added a couch coop category to their library for PS Plus if you got that we've just been going through that.  Highly recommend children of Morta and Spiritfarer.  We've moved on to those two.

edit: also played Trine 2 and 4 with both my daughters, those are great as well couch coop."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Time for Grounded!!!!!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Thanks EA
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Unravel is another good coop game.  Also Broforce and Cuphead.  Just keep the routine and the games coming.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Tried to play with my ex but we obviously broke up before we could finish. Now trying to play with my kids too lol it’s a great game
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I beat it with my daughter who is around the same age.  You can always switch roles and do it again.  The two characters have different enough powers and stuff they have to complete that it could still pretty fresh on a second run.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I did the same with my 9 year old daughter a couple months ago. After we beat the game there was only 1 logical thing to do. Switch characters and beat it again. They play completely differently and is a nice new experience
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,The game was so good I had the same reaction as your daughter.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Time whip out portal?
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I'm sure she really enjoyed the game, but it sounds like to me the emotion comes from not having that part of the routine anymore because probably cared more about the actual act of playing something with you. It isn't like she thinks that you suddenly won't spend time with her, its just it sounds like she REALLY looked forward specifically to that activity. I'm sure there are other coop games that you guys can continue to enjoy together, and its cool you found an activity you both are into"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Child therapist here, chances are what she enjoyed most was spending time with you. Maybe find a new game with her that she can get excited about."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Get her into MMOs. She'll be playing forever and will never be tempted by drugs.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I knew there would be tons of recommendations for other games to play, but IMO there is no need to rush it to fill the void or try to fake excitement for something else. Sometimes it's fine to just feel the loss and acknowledge that makes you feel sad.

As a dad, you get to be for that part of her life and she knows you'll be there for the sad moments too.

Great work dad, you do the rest of us proud."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,As an autistic adult I can totally relate. I feel the same when a game or a book ends (or a long-running show). Incidentally my gf and I are playing It takes two as well and I dread it coming to an end.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I’m sure it is a great little game, but she wasn’t sad because her time with the **game** was ending. She was worried that this special Dad & Daughter Game Time tradition was ending because you finished the game that started it. It shows how much she loved spending this time with you. The best way to reassure her is take her with you to the game store and pick out a new one together so she knows that you two will always do this, and it wasn’t a one-time thing that ended once you beat the game."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,She’s not the only one with tears welling. Great story!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Thank you for sharing your story. Your daughter is on the right path to being a great woman, and she will cherish these moments forever."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"100% same experience with my 8 yr old. FANTIASTIC GAME. We just switched characters and played it thru a 2nd time, just as fun!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Find a new game that the two of you can enjoy together. Trust me—it wasn’t about the game—it was about the time *with you*. Once she learns that there are other games and activities that you can share with each other, she’ll turn around. 

Good luck, from one dad to another!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Play Minecraft with her!

It never ends!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Mario games are great as co-op if you want more games to play.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I’ve been incredibly sad at the end of games too. So I feel this. You don’t want it to end.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,This is a lovely story I'm glad you both had such a good time. In terms of recommendations I haven't seen elsewhere on this thread I'd say maybe check out Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime? You have to work together to pilot a cute little spaceship around...space and complete objectives
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"""I had to explain that games don't go on forever""

*cries in RuneScape*"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Castle Crashers
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"What do you mean, over? You’ve only played half the game. Time to switch characters and do it all again!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I bet she doesn’t know it quite yet given her age but she loved the experience of playing the game with her dad than the game itself.  Maybe to her with the game e ding so too would the dad daughter time
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Look into these games:

Unravel 1 and 2

Little Big Planet series (and Sackboy's Adventure)"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Maybe it wasn't that the game ended.  Maybe she really liked the time you spent together and she's worried that it's over as well.  Find another game to get into and play together.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I'm old and I put off finishing games all the time because  I don't want them to end.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Play it again, switch characters"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,You can always play it again but swap roles. Each player's game experience is fairly different.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,My daughter used to set on my lap when she was little and we would play Fireboy and Watergirl. We had so much fun with that game.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Play it again!

Honestly one of the best things about being a 9 year old is your brain's ability to enjoy the same media over and over again. Once you get older, that kind of repetition starts to get stale. But for now, she'd probably love going right back into the same thing again!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I played this game with my son and we had lots of fun. We beat it in a few days. 

On a different note, this game is about divorce and parents drifting away but getting back together in the end. Are you sure it didn't strike a cord with her?

Another good one that me and my son loved is Unravel 2. You should give it a go 👌"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,">I had to explain that games don't go on forever. 

Tell her the next game you'll be playing is called Desert Bus."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Little big planet or the Lego games would also be some really fun bonding time. Me and my dad would play the Lego games together.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I have games where I am at the end, but just haven't finished them because I don't want to. They are mostly non linear games where you can keep playing after you beat it, like base building and resource collection, but I know once I beat it, I will probably put it down forever, so I keep avoiding that final battle and keep playing the game."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"it takes two is one of those games that I don't think we are going to see again for a very long time. I did my playthrough with my aunt, whenever I was over, and it's just one of those things that, Yeah it is meant to be played for two people, and you can play it again with someone, but it only hits right on that first run with someone, esp family."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I’ve been there before. When I beat kingdom hearts 2 I didn’t even know what to do when they started to roll the credits after the final cut scene. It’s a moment I’ve been searching for ever since. A game has never left me feeling like that. Sometimes you’re just so into it you forget that the story has to end.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"People heavily undervalue what a game like this can do to strengthen and build a relationship.

My fiance and I were having some relationship issues last year that I won't go into detail about but we spent virtually no time together, and when we did we weren't actually spending time ""together"".

One of us suggested we play ""it takes two"" together and it didn't take long for it to become a regular part of our routine. Like OP, between working and having a toddler at home, we only were able to play for an hour or two once a week. We looked so forward to  those times and would even pre-load the game for each other before the other person got home from work.

Figuring out how to complete the challenges and puzzles together in the game helped us figure out how to complete some of the challenges in our relationship as well. 

After about a month and a half, we finished the game. I too thought we would be excited and joyous when the credits began rolling across the screen. We weren't. Both of us sat silently and watched the credits while figuring out what we would do now and how we could spend meaningful time together. 

It has been about a year, and we still haven't found anything that brought us as close together as that game did."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"This is how I feel after finishing a good book.  
Man why's it gotta end... I just want to be in that world forever."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Gaming time with my son has become one of our main activities together, and one he really cherishes. We beat It Takes Two when he was 5! He's 7 now, and today we played through a Mario Maker campaign he's been working on. We play Mario Kart, tried some co-op Vampire Survivors, various fighting games, all sorts of fun stuff. Let your daughter know that It Takes Two may be over but there are tons more games to play!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"My 4yo son shared the same sentiment when he and I finished Starfox Adventures on GameCube earlier this year.  ""Aw. But now I'm sad. Now we're going to have to do the game all over again,"" he said."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,This is a very heartwarming story for me since I have a daughter. She is almost 3 but still a little too young for video games. I might try this out with her when she is old enough and see how she reacts when it ends. But she has been interested in video games in the past when she was very young and always wanted to hold my PlayStation controller lol
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"the game is long enough to really get you invested, but fear not cause there are plenty of cute games like this. unravel 2 has a couch coop, grounded is a good cute game but a little intensive if you play it on harder difficulties. Ive got more if you need suggestions cause ive been playing cutesy games with my friends for a while"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06," Very moving story, reminds of when I was a kid, playing final fantasy 1 with my dad, best FF game ever."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Had a moment like that with my son... I had gotten Gran Turismo 3 and he was about 6 years old. He would sit and watch me race for hours and hours and we would talk about the cars and stuff.  One day I finished a race that apparently triggered the ending credits and he just burst out crying and for a few we couldn't figure out what was wrong then we realized he thought the game was over and he would never get to watch me race again...
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Now you can switch characters and play the game all over again.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Next play some Diablo with her. That shit is both 1) great couch co-op, and 2) never-ending."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"It’s great you guys enjoyed the game so much. Me and my gf did too! Some of the best games I’ve played with my gf who’s new to gaming if you need a new game:
- Kitaria Fables
- Minecraft
- Untitled Goose Game

Some other ones we tried but your mileage may vary:
- Portal 2 (let her play through the story and I would watch/help occasionally, we never made it to co-op which is kinda post-game content)
- Don’t Starve Together (challenging game though)
- Death Squared (I did mute the narrator at times though)"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"It's probably not about the game as much as it is the fulfillment she received from the routine and bonding with you. When the game ends, so did the commitment to play together and the excitement in between looking forward to the next session."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Me and sister played that game about a year ago it was really fun, we would gather every night or wait till the weekend (cuz I’m in school) to play it, we both figured it out together and helped each other through. We learned why it takes two. 😉😉"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Haven't seen it mentioned(maybe it has and didn't see it) start a Rayman Legends playthrough with her. Wife and I love this game for it's co-op, fun gameplay, cool visuals, and girl characters to choose. We got half way through Unraveled 2 which is also kinda fun but you die a lot and it can get pretty frustrating. Borderlands is always fun co-op for when she gets older, obviously."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,You should see if she would be interested in playing any 1 player games together! Even of she can't handle the controls yet you can let her make the choices and girls love roleplay heavy games! (In my personal experience of being a little girl that grew up watching my brothers play games.)
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"That's such a beautiful memory and I HIGHLY recommend finding another game for you two to play STAT! <3 She LOVES spending time with her special daddy and while her little 9yro heart couldn't properly understand that it ending was a normal positive thing, I think helping her understand that you can find something NEW to do together will go a long way. 

&#x200B;

Good job Dad!!!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,As a kid I'd never finish the last few chapters of any book because reading them would mean the book was over
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I loved playing games with my mom growing up. We didn't play many co-op games and instead took turns playing single player games, taking turns at each level, stopping and swapping every so often on a character death or losing at a boss fight or working together to solve puzzles in point and click adventure games. It's a lot of fond memories for me and hopefully will be the same for your daughter too."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"My daughter (7) and I did the exact same and we absolutely loved it.

Check out Unraveled 2, she'll love it ☺️"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"This is a beautiful story. And if she’s like me, I never finished any rpg game I played, I usually stopped before the final bosses, sometimes it’s due to the repetitiveness I lost my interest, sometimes my interests changed, and sometimes I just don’t want the story to end so there’s still part of stories left to my imagination, also I wouldn’t experience the emptiness afterwards. It’s the slither of hope I can hold onto."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"If you haven't already, maybe you guys should play stardew valley together. That game never ends."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Awesome! My son 15, and I just finished it a few weeks ago. We had a blast. I realised I am now very unco at console games.
Maybe give human fall flat a go with her, not story based but puzzles to solve."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I beat that with my 10 year old daughter a few months ago. Try Unravel 2 next if you haven’t already, pretty fun game."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Okay, this is really sweet. She loved that game so much and loved playing it with you so much, it genuinely upset her when it ended. Absolutely find some more games that you can play together! And maybe revisit this one again in the future 😊"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,My daughter is seven and I’ve had the same experience with games ending. We like to play Stardew as well which never ends and gives her a sense of purpose beyond “completion.”
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Very glad to start my day with such a cute story, just because this game is done little miss, doesn't mean you won't be at more with dad."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Sounds like she’ll love Animal Crossing
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,for some people its about the journey not the destination. there are more open ended things to play. some people dont like closed loop experiences.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"This reminded me of a short story.  Written in the early 90s I believe, it’s about a father & son playing a fantasy rpg.  However, the leveling is reversed. 

You begin the game as an op savior, with complete gear.  As you progressed through the game you lost more and more gear and became weaker.  The story engrosses the father & son, and they play over a week, discussing the game more and more as they near its end.  By the last level, the player is naked & has no abilities.  The final boss is a worm, a level 1 enemy they easily killed at the start.  There’s nothing to do, but die to the worm.  The game congratulates them on beating the game, then deletes itself from their computer."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I'm also playing with my 9 year old, such a great game to play togheter 👍"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Everything ends but there are always other games you guys can play. It’s a good thing she looked forward to playing with you so much it made her sad it was over. Just grab a new game that’s 2 player you got this!!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Play Minecraft it never ends.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Alright now play a way out
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,You’re an amazing dad 🥹 LEGO Star Wars 2 is something I always loved playing with my brothers. It’s the only time we got along. Fond memories.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"My question is how did she take the stuff elephant scene?? But in all seriousness, look for more co-op games for you both to play together 🥺 I'm sure she would love the time with you! Something like unravel 2 would probably be so good!!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Me and my 9yo daughter beat it takes two last week, and now she can't wait to play The Way Out (a coop game from the same developer). Hazelight guys are amazing, and they are already working on their next coop game. Oh, and Amazon picked up It Takes Two as a movie! Just thought I'd share the news."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Next game, unravel. Amazing. Just amazing."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"> I had to explain that games don't go on forever.

I hope she never hears about Everquest."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,If you guys only stuck to one character you could replay the game and switch roles. Its almost a new experience. My other recommendation is Rayman Legends. I used to play this with my niece but she's a few year older than your daughter. It may be a bit challenging for her. Nintendo also usually has some child friendly co-op games you could look into.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Start Stray with her! My daughter her age loved playing it together!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Why didn't you play with your wife?
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,this is why i still don't finish games
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,this is why my steam library is full of games i haven't finished
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Could play a never ending game like minecraft
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,You seem like a much better parent than the parents in that game who were giddy to make their daughter cry... Horrible parents
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Just wait until she learns that Kirby's Return to Dreamland Deluxe is co-op 😄
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Ok now show her factorio and you'll have a genius in no time
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Reassure her your guys gaming time isn't coming to an end even tho the game is over I can almost guarantee that's what she's worried about, she doesn't want to lose the routine"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,But you can play it again and again. The great games are worth replaying.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I get it though. I sort of feel the same after finishing a great game, book or TV series. There's an empty feeling of ""what now?"""
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Maybe in a few years give A Way Out a go. It’s the fire game by Hazelight (who made it takes two). It’s more mature but has the same fun coop mechanics
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,My wife and I played it through.  We were in tears both of us when it ended (even though we pushed through the last levels to just end it lol).
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"A few years ago I worked through Wandersong with my then-5-to-6-yr-old. It wasn't really multiplayer but we played on switch. I gave her the joycon that controlled singing and I took the one that controlled movement. We made it a pseudo-2-player game. We played so infrequently (because we limit their screen time) that it took us over a year to finish it. 

She was engaged in the story. Every chapter lead us to a brief conversation about what happened and why some characters acted the way they did. I think the dev did a beautiful job of making an engaging story where the main character refuses to use violence to solve his problems, even though everyone else around him does. 

I cannot recommend that game enough, even though it's single player. 

The same dev released a game called Chicory recently-ish. It's a pseudo 2p game that has a similar journey of self discovery and deals with some heavy feelings, but my kids are enjoying going through that story, too. The 2p there is that they get a paintbrush and can paint things, too, but they're really just along for the ride (like Cappy in Super Mario Odyssey)"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Divinity: Original Sin 2, Baldurs Gate 3 if you don't mind a little raunchy."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,You are a great parent
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Now go find a new game or something to do together as a routine!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Sounds like she just doesn't want the close one on one time with you to end.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"There are games that don't end as well if you want to go that route, 9 is old enough for minecraft, terraria, don't starve, animal crossing just to name a couple if you wanted to start something that doesn't end. If you want to take the learning experience, this could be a great time to teach that this ending now opens up opportunity for something else to begin."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I felt the same sadness when that game was over. What an awesome game!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Was it portal, or portal 2? If not, check those out next. My daughter and I played them. They're awesome."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Play human fall flat!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Buddy I remember this feeling like it was yesterday.  I was 10 years old; I took forever playing Ocarina of Time.  That game was like my whole life for a while, and when I finally beat it, I sat there staring at the end screen for several minutes, tears rolling down my face.  Men in Black had come out just one year before.  I wished so badly for one of those little things to erase my memory so I could experience the game for the first time again.  I didn't want it to be over."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"You might wanna ask if she's sad because the game is over, or if she's sad because she thinks you guys are done playing games together."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Play another game where the end of the main story is NOT the end of the game. Idk of any two player ones but you can definitely both still enjoy the game if its just her or you playing. My wife loves to sit and help me play games like Horizon or Skyrim. Im sure there is something more age appropriate like that. You finish the story and there is still SO MUCH content to play. 😊
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I'm not crying, you're crying!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Great time to introduce her to Halo and start playing through the whole campaign together
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Is she sad the game ended, or sad that her fun thing she did with her dad ended?  Start a new game!  Or pick another thing to start diving into!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I feel this. Sometimes I think back to games I played in my teens with buddies. Brings a tear to my eye every once in a while when I remember the feeling I had playing with the boys back in the day. Good times.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I've got my Wii U dug out and am playing through some older games with my daughter.

She's 7 which is great for Kirby's Epic Yarn."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Now play broforce, iv'e played it it with my sister far to many times, and you can do it on one keyboard"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,That's how I felt when Sons of Anarchy was over
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,[deleted]
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Lol my dad was the OG playing resident evil on the PS1 while he was supposed to be watching me. I still have zombie nightmares (the zombie dog scared the shit out of me) every now and then.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I'm 26 and I think I had the same reaction as your daughter. 

I did just kinda end, and I was like... aw damn what it's over?!?!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Set up Minecraft Server for a separate father/child server. 

Portal 2 co-op, Terraria, overcooked, whatever recommendations others throw out here."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Sorry if this has been suggested already, but since she likes Minecraft, maybe give Terraria a try.   My son and I played through that a couple times and love it (once a few years back and again with the updates last year-ish)"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I'm sure its already been said but Lovers in a dangerous space time is a great coop game. Very colorful and challenging.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Play portal 2
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,May I suggest Stardew Valley? Potentially endless and easy coop.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Man, I am kind of like this girl here. If I really love a game I avoid trying to finish it and start a new run or just move on without finishing it :("
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I get my son on weekends, and we spend most of the time gaming. Fortnite is big with us, and Minecraft.

He has his computer, I have mine. I treasure my weekends with him.

BRAG MODE: He wins Solo-Duos in Fortnite. The kid is cracked."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Such a great game. 

And in fairness to her, there are very few like it these days so her reaction is more valid than she knows!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,You better find another kid friendly co-op fast! Take her to the store and maybe show her some games suitable for her. Might even find one of a show she likes or something.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"SUPRALAND! 

Seriously, start with the first one. I was super skeptical at first but my son and I fell in love with it. It's sadly only one player but it's a puzzle solver that your 9 yr old could most likely do, and if they get stuck, Dad's the hero who can solve anything. It's got a fun story to follow along with as well which keeps things moving."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"As someone who went through this exact thing with my daughter, she wasn't sad the game ended, it was symbolic of her special alone game time with you was over.

It is by far the best adventure co-op life learning game ever.  So many unique games in one.  Play again, but switch sides.

Unraveled 2 is very well done.

Raymond Legends

Guacamole"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,And this is why they invented heaven and the afterlife
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Just play it again and switch the characters :D
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"When I get very into a book, I sometimes gets sad once I finish it. I’m a full grown adult man as well. She enjoyed it so much she is sad it’s over, she’ll still remember it positively."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"And now you and those reading this post know why so many people become addicted to games. 

Especially those intentionally designed to have no end.

I saw it in the 70s and 80s at arcades. Back then, hardly any games were winnable. You just played for higher and higher scores. Me, I just didn’t get it.  But my brain isn’t wired that way.  I don’t have to win or be the best.  

But so many of my friends, my classmates, people in my neighborhood, they got sucked in deep because they could just keep playing."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Aw, that’s so precious. Good job dad!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Don't worry. Just start up A Way Out. /s

Definitely start a new game though!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Beat this game with my 7 year old. We both loved it.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"A divorced parent taking her daughter through the rollercoaster of a story of two divorced parents who are going to separate but get it fixed thanks to their shared love for their daughter.

Yeah, I don't know if you hand picked the game knowing what it was about, but it's a little bit on the nose and bound to make her emotional, OP."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I had the same experience but i was the one tearing up because it ended. I had such a great time with my son playing this.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"The game is good, but I am reasonably sure the time with you was as big or a bigger part of it."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Play Minecraft with her lol. That *will* go on forever.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"That's awesome. That's also a beautiful game. 

You should definitely have another one in the chamber though, so that this can be a habitual thing and way to spend time with her. As long as what she takes away from this is that the game won't always be there but her daddy will then she'll be ok."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Think she might’ve thought your bonding time was over instead. Find another game. A+ dad btw
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Well my gf cannot jump in that game to save her life 😂. We gave it a shot. Glad you two had fun
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"As someone who was raised by gamers, plz continue to game on.  Watch my dad play games,watch my mom and dad beat games together, and when he passed I played games with my mom. We beat Mario a few times and she also now plays with my kiddo. Who kicks ass at games for such a young age. I always sucked but kept playing😂"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I remember games that Emotionally Kicked my ass when I beat them especially when I was a Kid. Beating Pokemon FireRed still holds a place in my heart
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"My wife did a 9 month internship in Napa (far from home where I was), when she returned we started playing this together. It was kind of our first time seriously playing a coop game, but we both have other games we play off-and-on. We seriously loved it, it was such a well-done game and it was really great to have something to chill and do together after work. I imagine she and I will probably play this or something like it when we have kids, and we're looking forward to it!

We still play co-op/puzzle games, whatever we can find cheap on steam, and usually we'll have a weed gummy beforehand. We just yell and laugh at each other because we suck at the simplest puzzles if we're a little stoned, but it's a great bonding and wind-down activity before bed. 

We like overcooked 1 and 2, pico park, Biped, humans fall flat, heavenly bodies (and not just hers 😉), don't starve together, braid, castle crashers, etc. Open to suggestions if anyone has them!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I took a while to go through it with my 7 yo, like on and off since March.
We finished the game last week and he turns to me and said ""its over already? I want to start over again"" lol"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Actually playing through with my daughter right now.  Would recommend Unravel 2 which is the one we played preceding. Coop puzzle play, emotionally compelling story line."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"'Little big planet' is a good recommendation, super creative, good story, crazy characters and is challenging in a fun way"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,This is where you introduce her to any% speedrunning
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I thought for sure this post would be about the story of the game being her life (minus the ""happy ending"" 😬). Even as an adult man who played this game with his best friend, I thought the game was pretty emotional towards the end and it definitely made me think about my parents a lot."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Try sackboy a big adventure. Should be perfect for you two :)
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Now teach her about speed running
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,An important lesson. All good things must end.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"When I was a kid my dad and I used to play the lucas arts game Full Throttle. It felt like it took us forever to finish it, funny because I replayed it recently and finished it in an afternoon. 
It was the first game I ever finished, with his help. I had the same reaction as your daughter and was very upset that we couldn't play together anymore. Im 32 now and he has been dead two years now.  Your post brought back a lot of nice memories"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Gonna have to send this to Hazelight Studios and get them to make a sequel asap!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,This happened to me exactly. Same age and sentiment. We started it over and played it through 2 more times and now we just bounce around the levels. It buys time.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Love this! My daughter and I play Unraveled Two. Take a look into it! If you have Xbox it’s included on game pass
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Niw it's time to load up Borderlands!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Could always start at couch co-op of Baldurs Gate 3 now. That should take a while.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Sounds like she's ready for some roguelike!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"In a few month you can switch the roles and play the game again. I did this with my daughter and it was a lot of fun, too. We found new mini-games we didn’t on the first run."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,You can play through again and swap who was Cody and May. There is a lot of the game with significant differences in them and well worth it. Hopefully it won't hurt just as bad finishing it again.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I played it takes two with my son last year. Such a fun experience for the both of us.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"My daughter loved playing Halo with me. She has since she was about 8 or 9. Just campaign co-op and blast some grunts. 

Of course I’m fully aware my daughter is more “gamer” than most girls her age so that may not apply to your daughter. 

We also play super mario 3D world together."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,ask her what her favorite mini game was and get that game archetype to try together. maybe it's gonna be SF6 lol
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,The regular playtime you've had with her over the last few months has created a routine. Use that routine to find some more games you can play and enjoy together.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,If you have a Switch then Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze was a fun co-op with my wife that was newer to gaming.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I had a similar experience completing halo 3 co op and portal 2 co op with my brother! Loved gaming as a kid.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Thanks for sharing, it was Wind Waker for me and my son back about twenty years ago or so, exact same feelings, still my favourite game ever."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I see myself in your daughter's behaviour. I hate endings, I hate change. Sometimes I never finished a book because I wanted it to last forever. I think as someone else said you should start a new game with your daughter, it's a good lesson. She enjoyed the game but especially your time together so much that she couldn't accept its end. Your daughter is such a sweetheart, take care of her :)"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I'm a father of 3 boys. They are all grown now, but all the fun we have had playing all types of games was a blast. We still play every so often. But they got their lives that they need to live. I miss it a lot, but to all things, there is an end. Keep testing different games. There are so many good memories to make. I bet you and her will find another game to play soon."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Swap who is who and play again! The puzzles feel so different with the other person's abilities!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"We have all been there. It's the most tragically beautiful pinnacle of gaming. Where you become so invested in a game. Where the experience is so great that when it ends, you have a feeling of loss and emptiness. You don't know what to do now. What even happens now? You can't move on, you cannot just play another game.... Nothing will ever be the same... After a bit of time, she will be able to accept the loss, and the memories that remain will be fond. The time with her father and the great game they played together. 

Its a heavy life lesson for a 9 year old. But a good one, I think."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"When she was a similar age, I got my niece to go through some games. I didn't really have any couch co-op games on my computer, so mostly she played and I encouraged her. For some reason she didn't seem to react much to finishing any of them. But she did replay Papo & Yo about five times."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Mann, this was me as a kid, I actually think its a reason i stopped reading and dont love movies. I always get so sad when something ends. A book, a movie, a vacation, a semester, you get the picture. Idk why but it has made me lean towards games without end (competitive games)"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,how did you play that Elephant part?
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,It really does feel like that game will never end. Its brilliant and so much content
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I strongly recommend Lego games. They are pretty easy and fun to play especially on couch coop.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I’m not a gamer but I saw this on r/all and I appreciate you sharing the story.

As a father of a 10 year old girl, any recommendations for similar games to play with my daughter on the Switch?"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Unravel is a great two player game similar to this. I played it with my daughter.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I'm sure she really liked going through the process with you. What else can you work on together?
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,cheerful test mindless depend run languid familiar joke unwritten shocking
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Just be sure to continue to spend time with her.  It goes quick.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I have a similar experience with good books, shows (Community, Scrubs), games, etc.. When I love it so much, I don't want the good times to end. Last time I put off reading the last book in a series (The Expanse) because once it was done it was done. It's such a bitter-sweet moment. Definitely a learning experience with young-uns."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,This is almost exactly what my daughter did when we completed it. She was 10 at the time.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,now get her into CS:GO and tell her it never ends.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,You think it’s okay to make me cry ? Smh.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I'd recommend the Trine games.  They are cooperative multiplayer and very storybookesque, and there are 5 of them.  

https://youtu.be/usu0j68kk9E

When she's old enough to watch rated R stuff, you can play it takes two's predecessor, ""A way out""  Same sort of gameplay loop but a much more realistic art design and heavier story.

Also, you could play some nice visual novel games and point and click adventure games that she could participate in, things like professor layton, ace attorney, monkey island, dropsy ( possibly too scary of a clown but does nothing but nice things for people ), kings quest, the longest journey, and broken sword.  I'll imagine that part of the charm of ""it takes two"" is that she got to actively help you solve problems that you couldn't do yourself, and that can easily translate to story based games with weird puzzles."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I used to replay games so many times as a kid without ever getting bored of them. People are here talking about other games, which is also a good idea, but also maybe just keep playing it."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I'm betting that some dev will find this post and absolutely cry their eyes out.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,You're a great dad. Play another game with her
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"time for you two to join a WOW guild or Eve Online corp, those shits never end"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"My daughter loved the game as well, there were tears and frustrations but overall a fantastic game that I cand recommend enough.. When we finished, we gave it a little time and then swapped characters and did a 2nd run :)

Its like a new game, as your skills as different and even though your know the story and the tricks now, your are doing a different thing, so its still quite exciting.  


We are on our 3rd run now, trying our best to find all the mini games."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Have you introduced her to roblox?

Never ending gameplay perfect for her agegroup that you can coop for free."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I feel that. I mostly play CDDA now. It never ends. I always die. Sometimes I get far and restart
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,The read I get out of that is she loves to spend that time with you.  So just make sure to pick something new up and keep it going!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I’m not a gamer. Ok, correction, I *wasn’t* a gamer. Over covid I pulled out my classic NES and my PS1. Fast forward 3 years and I’m sitting on a PS3 with a library of 33 games and a PS4 in a box in the closet with a hard drive of unknown treasures. 

I can’t say I know how this little girl felt considering she hadn’t even considered the concept of a game ending but I can understand the sadness of finishing something you genuinely enjoyed. In some ways it’s like a relationship ending. Add to that the time with her dad and it’s literally a part of a relationship ending. 

Obviously developers create sequels to cash in on popularity as businesses exist to make money but passion and desire are always close behind when something resonates so organically. Imagine how the passionate individuals who work on these titles feel when it’s all over…

Obviously some relief and satisfaction but I bet some cry like that little girl did. I’m convinced this drives sequels as well as profits.

I just finished the first God of War on a remastered version for PS3 and a friend said I have no idea what’s to come. Hopefully that little girl will soon see the joy of what’s to come."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Unravel 2 is a good coop experience. Pikmin 3 deluxe if you want something very addictive and a bit more challenging
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Now so the co-op prison break game by the same studio:D
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,My 10 year old son and I played it together. Truly a special game.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Oo I think she would love playing Portal 2 with you!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"You have to....collllaboraaaaate!

Jesting aside, this will be a positive core memory in the long run. Her initial reaction of shock/loss will give way to long term memories of the fun you had, it may take you finding the next adventure together to kick start that.

If I could humbly suggest Unravel 2. Shorter, but really interesting co op mechanics"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Show her Stardew Valley. Literally never ends.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I am playing with my girl. She's younger than yours and I am skipping parts of the story (given the theme of this story, I didn't want to bring any feelings for her) but I marvel at her ability of solving quite a few complex puzzles this game brings. Makes me extremely proud. So I can definitely relate to you!

I thought I was grown out of games, so many of them nowadays makes me extremely bored, which is why I end playing retro games more. But when you play stuff like this then you realise that it is all about creativity and talent. They made a very special game here."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I get it. I play games right up until the end and then never finish. I've been doing that for decades. I just can't will myself to finish them. I'll even start new playthroughs instead of finishing. I'm on my 4th playthrough of Cyberpunk 2077. Even games where you're supposed to play through multiple times like Eldenring I just won't finish.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I had the same thing happen with my son, but with one of the Mario games - Super Mario Bros. 3, I believe. His little heart was broken like he'd lost a pet."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I never finished reading my favourite series of books, i know it'll be over soon. Guess i never grew up? Or are children simply smarter and realize there's no point to finishing a story??"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Sweetest thing ever, she loves spending time with you"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I played that game with my daughter too! It was great!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Restart the game and switch characters. Boom.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Tell her that you guys can still play games together, and this is the point of a game. My son and I game almost every night for years now, I too hope it will never end. It makes me sad to think it one day will."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I love this game
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Now she just needs to play an MMORPG.   Ooo the hours wasted on EverQuest.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Portal 2 has great co-op.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Try the Little Big Planet series next pops!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I was hoping her reaction would be more like:

""Father, my back hurts from carrying you through the entire game."""
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,It Takes Two also offers unique game play as either the husband or wife. You can always replay it switching roles.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"What she likes is the closeness with \*you\*. That, you can continue."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,It why some of us never finish games.  It is just too much. If we never finish it never has to end.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Time for some Fortnite !
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Play sack boy adventures if you’re on PS5 she’ll love it

16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Unless you guys found absolutely everything then there are plenty of opportunities to go back and find all the extra areas.... More importantly swap characters and try it again. Completely different experience with a lot of familiarities to it. Also gets her more familiar with the controls with something she already knows well. Also a bit of a sad story for a 9 year old.... A game about divorce ... 😂

Unraveled 2 is a great one. Any and all of the Lego games are good opportunities (harry potter as she is just coming up to the age of 11 and the ideal time to start reading the first book)"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"This is why I became heavily addicted to MMOs. I hated the empty feelings left at the end of a good game. So I played games that didn't end. 

Not saying this is the right thing to do because I lost alooooot of time to them."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Making this comment just to say whoever runs this sub is a huge nerd and a scumbag.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Look up Raft. I think it would be an amazing game to play with her together.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Find new games too play with her
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Try playing a couple more co-op games with definitive openings and endings, but also have an ongoing run on a game without that like Minecraft. She has the consistent never-ending experience along with a rotating door of other experiences. Can always replay It Takes Two at some point too!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Play World of Warcraft with her till the end
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Pick up Unravel and Unravel 2. The first is single player, but the second is couch co-op. They’re beautiful games with really lovely art style, music and sound. 

My daughter and I played through both. First just handing off the controller and splitting time in the first, but then she would just play and I would help her with the hard parts."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Seems odd a 9 year old doesn't know a game has an ending.

Maybe like a 4-5 year old, but not 9.

16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,PLAY RAYMAN LEGENDS WITH HER! My daughters loved playing this game and we played Unraveled right after. Rayman is an awesome game for adults and kids. Best co op around
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Time to introduce Minecraft Java Edition
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Awwwww. So cute.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Well, you were there through her existential crisis. I'm positive that will be part of the core memory."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"This game still holds as the greatest gaming experience with my 8 year old as well. We’ve played through now 2 times. The first he was so disappointed it ended. I was too! It was the first game I’ve ever played where the cooperation was so integral to moving forward. I am a gamer, and we had already played other games together, but this game really had us on edge, happy, sad, annoyed, and satisfied; experiencing so many emotions together. He keeps asking if there’s another game we can play together to experience that again, and nothing holds up to this game. This game was brilliant, beginning to end."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"My 8 year old had the opposite reaction to a few games this year. She managed to beat both ratchet & clank games, psychonauts and Mario 3D land on 3DS and she ran through the house yelling victory like it was another notch on her belt.

For her, beating a game means a new experience awaits.  We don’t let her graze across lots of games at the same time. She’s only allowed 1 at a time."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"My partner and me were playing this game and were also sad when it was over because it was such an amazing game. We kept talking about it so we did one thing that you could do with your daughter too: play the game but as the opposite Player. Even when you already know the game it's something ""new"" because you are having different powers than in the first time."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Time for the next co-op game!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Currently doing the same with my 10 year old. We are  a few good hours away from beating Earthbound after plugging away for a couple hours here and there over the summer. I'm kinda worried about a similar reaction but hey, all good things gotta end some time. Just planning on having another in the pipeline"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"This is simultaneously beautiful af and just so fuckin depressing. I hope you get many more hours of game time with your daughter, OP!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"This is so much more wholesome than my dad showing me at 9 how to carjack police cars on GTA 3…. 

She’ll remember that forever, as an FYI. As someone who’s dad took time to play video games and laugh together, I remember it in vivid detail. She’ll always cherish it❤️"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Man... I thought the elephant part would have been the worst of it
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Fall guys is a great game to try as well
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I can feel her pain...The 1st time through a game is something special that can never be felt with another playthrough. I bet without realizing it she will miss the two of you playing the game together also, time to pick up another."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I have greatly enjoyed playing Roblox with my kiddo. Some of the games are complex, some are easy, some are just beyond my old parent skills.

But the beauty of Roblox is that most of the games don’t “end”, you can usually keep on going as long as you want or you can just pick another game in the app. Downside is there aren’t as detailed stories available, but some of the games are really well done and well made"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I think maybe your daughter wasn't crying about the game at all. Maybe she was thinking that it was the end of her special time with you...fighting through difficulties together.
You said you only have her 50% of the time. Forgive me for asking, as in custody wise?
Reassure her it isn't the end of time with you. Find another incredible 2 player game for her to lose herself in with you. Maybe Unravel as some have suggested.
Good luck sir."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Pick a new game together!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I’m a grown ass man and I still feel this way when a good games ends. Well, not inconsolable but such a bittersweet realization that i have to move on from something that brought me so much joy. I still wouldn’t trade anything for the joy I had and the memories that slowly become the legends of my life. Especially when I share those memories with another I love and reminisce about it for the rest of our lives. Give her some time to process and I think her perspective will change. I mean you wouldn’t cry over something if you don’t cherish it. Also when she is ready.. on to the next great chapter of the gaming saga you are creating! This chapter ended but the story has just begun."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Forgot about Unravel2, we started that after beating It Takes 2 with my at the time 9yr old.  He plays a lot of Fifa atm trying to finish up some seasons before the next game comes out.  


Fall Guys was something we would do for a quick stint. Overcooked series is fun, and even the wife would try that sometimes."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"This is the wholesome take.

Find another game. (Maybe Grounded? I don't play much co-op) and show her the end of something isn't cause for worry."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I’m going to keep this when my daughter is old enough to play games. And now I know what game to introduce her to when she’s the age of OPs daughter.

16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I still remember being 11 and finishing the His Dark Materials books and just crying for the whole weekend, being sad there was no more books to read.

A month or so later someone introduced me to Harry Potter.  I read the books that were already out in a flash and then was desperately awaiting the next book to be released.  When 7 finally finished I was much older, but still sad.  I cried a little, not all weekend.  Finishing Harry Potter was like finishing my childhood off and saying goodbye to it.  I was in college at the time and cried in my tiny little bedroom, grieving what I saw as the final nail in my childhood coffin.  I had finished everything I started when I was a kid.  I was an adult.  I'd had adult issues.  Boyfriends and jobs.  Ethical and moral dilemmas.  But I had Harry Potter whenever I wanted to feel childhood again.  An escape.  It ending was the ending of my escape back into childhood innocence. 

I'm not much of a gamer (this topic is on the front page of Popular) but I know this loss and grief deeply."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,This is the exact reaction my then 6 year old girl had when we beat little big world years ago. She was so sad it was over. This is good advice to go onto another game. For what its worth we did mario 3d world after that and had no tears at the end. We've went onto many other games since then.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Respectfully disagree. Life is chock full of change and disappointment. The fact that you only get to see her 50% of the time is proof positive.

If that’s what she enjoys, start over with the goal of beating your last time, and continue to find joy together."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"""Sorry honey we can't play this game anymore. I want to teach you a lesson about loss."" LOL get out of here."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,How tf is replaying a game you loved a poorer choice. Replaying the game is one of the best parts of a favorite game.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Lol... she wasn't happy about it and desperately tried to find a way not to do it. But there wasn't one. 

So she gritted her teeth and got the job done."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I still never understood why they made us hurt her :( 
And you never even got to see if she was okay in the end."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I'm a grown ass man and I almost cried from having to do that scene
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"The newest installment, Sackboy’s Big Adventure is much more polished. UX on older games doesn’t hold up super well if you’ve played newer games imo"

I've never seen a kid be literally inconsolable from beating a game."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,You and your team really made something incredible with that game. I've walked three friends through it from start to finish and it left a hole in the center of each of them when we finished. Thank you so much.

16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,I played it with my husband!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"This is one of my favorite games that I'll never play again. The Cutie scene... You guys managed to make a grown ass adult cry and beg not to have to continue. That takes a lot, a special kinda thing. Very powerful art. I don't regret playing it, but I also don't wanna play through that a second time. It's a game that will stand out from anything I've played for a long while. Bravo."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"I just finished this with my 8 year old son. He didn't have the same emotional reaction as OP's daughter, but I gotta say that it was one of my favorite games to play with my kid. Your team did an INCREDIBLE job, there was so much heart behind it, such clever levels (our favorite was the space levels) and mechanics. Kudos to your and your team for really nailing it. I loved the homage to diablo as well. Well done!!!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"My partner and I are both gamers and don’t usually play together, but omg it takes two was the most fun, creative and amazing game we have experienced together. Thank you!! You guys did an amazing job! 

The first time the mechanics completely changed, it blew our minds. We were so excited to start new levels. Some levels we replayed on weekends just for fun and to enjoy the graphics 🍄. Really top notch, fun game!!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,I loved the game so much! Played it with my husband aswell!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"I feel like all of us have also gone through the same thing, in different circumstances. I remember bawling my eyes out (it's my first emotional memory) after one of the Land Before Time movies ended when I was like 4 or 5. I remember feeling such loss... and my mom asked me why I was crying, and I answered ""Because it's over"". I don't even know if that is genuinely why I was crying, but my answer was the gist of the feeling. 

OP's daughter will remember this moment fondly, I'm sure of it."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,This is such an excellent suggestion.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,This. My wife and I played the game twice through to do just this.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"We've tried a few of these and they just don't click with her. Which is so odd because we both love Lego. She has thousands of dollars worth of Lego. And so do I!

But it was the story aspect that really made her fall in love with it takes two."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I'm looking into tiny Tina's wonderland. We're looking for a new game to delve into. 

But the bar was set pretty freaking high with it takes two. The story really connected with her. And the gameplay was just so good and fluid. It's such a unique game... it's gonna be hard to find another.

And I've been reading to her since she was a baby.... but she's a bit past that now. I still read to her occasionally. But she's well into reading chapter books herself now :) 

I read to her more because I miss it than her needing it lol"

16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Or portal two since it does have a co-op mode.  I think you have to play through the main story first to unlock it, but im not totally sure on that."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Terraria!  I played this with my sons when they were pretty young and just learning how to use a computer,  and we would play it off and on over the years.   Last Christmas when my now-grown sons were home,  they came home and were like ""Let's start a new world on Terraria!""    Nothing could've made my mom-heart happier than destroying Santa zombies and exploring dungeons with my kids again.  Now they are better than me at every game,  and I love it."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I wish more games explored family and the willingness to save or sacrifice the world for your family the way Children of Morta did.

16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Exactly what I was thinking. She got her father's attention and affirmation while doing something fun. Of course she would fear losing that.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I'd recommend a game called [Crashlands](https://youtu.be/TNTlsNKMPAw?si=Aivuw0zUXli4YJ0y). The second player controls a robot sidekick that's effectively immortal, can't hinder game play in any way, and has very simple controls.   

My 4yo and 8yo daughters also enjoy playing these Disney games together: Universe, Rush, and Magic Kingdom Adventures."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Get a switch!

That's where our journey with gaming together started. There are so many titles that are accessible to kids that age. My daughter and I would have ""Mario parties"" every week... where wed play Mario party and pig out on snacks on Friday nights lol"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Holy shit, my son and I played stardew religiously for months... he's played everything and jumps around to different games quite often. So, when he finally wanted to move on because it was getting repetitive, I was a little heart-broken. This was over a year ago. We're doing orcs must die 2 at the moment... it's pretty good but we yell at each other a lot, lol."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I'm sure she would be fine.

But I'm terrified of that series. I don't got the skill for those kinds of games anymore. Or the time to learn them lol"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I so want to play this one with her! It seems perfect. 

But when I looked it up awhile back I found there was no couch co-op and no cross play between switch and PC. 

Has that changed? Please tell me it has. I'll buy it today! We only have a beefy gaming PC and a switch... so we'd need one of those to play together."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I must have played HFF all the way through with my kid a dozen times.  Love when they release a new level/dream.  And they have a ton of free, fan-made levels in the steam workshop.  A lot of the free ones are bad, but there are plenty of winners too.

They're also coming out with a Human Fall Flat 2!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"For sure.

Just a tip... prioritize time with your kid right away if you are going through a divorce. That's all that matters. Get as much time as you can. 

It's hard to get time taken away.... and hard to get it if you don't already have it. Courts work on the status quo. So make your status quo having a ton of time with your kid. None of that every other weekend crap. 

Give your ex whatever it takes to make that happen. Swallow your pride where you have to. Make it your only priority. Rearrange your work and life to make it happen if you have to. Whatever it takes. 

It will help you, your kid and your finances as well. When I left my ex when my kid was 3... I left my very expensive gun collection behind. She knew they were valuable and that I cared about them. 

And because they were there... whenever she was mad she used those to hold over my head and threaten to sell instead of using our daughter. And we settled on 50/50 custody. 

Best decision I've ever made."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Same, I'm 27 and sometimes when I get in my bed after beating one of those, I feel so empty I start imagining the story continuing or whatifs and it can take hours for me to finally fall asleep."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"> Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons

No!

I am now 50 years old and still choke up when I think about that game. Do you want to traumatize a 9 year old girl in the worst way? May I remind you how that is coop until it is not?"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Oh man. Me and my friend yelled at eachother so much during that lol
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Your five year old beat it? 

That's impressive. It's not an easy game and we struggled at a few parts. 

You got a real little gamer on your hands there lol"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Yeah, can't help but think maybe she thought the game held some answers for her own situation and she wound up disappointed with reality.

But that'll depend on her age and context that I don't have, so who knows."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Yeah it's wild to me that she didn't ask any questions like ""are you and mommy getting back together"" after seeing that ending."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"The bugs are less scary if you turn down the sounds for them. So scary, tho!!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Lol. That game almost caused a few divorces I bet too!  That one had my wife yelling at me for hours: I need chicken!! Wash those dishes!!! Put out that fire!!! Throw me some more damn chicken! Yea. I don’t care if they make an overcooked 3, the first two were more than plenty."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,Aww. I still have PTSD from selling all my NES games to GameStop in exchange for 1 dumb game.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,Hey are you my wife? I just said the same thing.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,yours reads like you have no kids or had shitty parents.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Most?
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Huh thats a thing. Never heard about it
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Because we are all little girls inside? 

I thought it was just my inability to focus on something and see it through"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Unless it's harmful, no one should be shamed away from sharing the human experience. You're wasting the chance of experiencing individuality on being a cunt."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,What's it like to be so dead inside that you need to find anything to be pretend offended by?
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,no one wants your shit
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I have her Wednesday, Thursday, Friday Saturday and every other Sunday. Plus she goes to school in my district so I see her on Mondays and Tuesdays as well. 

And my days with her are completely devoted to her. I'm lucky enough to spend more time with my daughter than most dad's who co-parent are able to."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"You have such a pessimistic, critical, negative method of phrasing and reacting to things."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,I’m sorry about your father
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Laser tennis could be its own little game lol
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Time for super marios 4
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,At 9… do you have any of the Lego games? Those are excellent multi player platformers.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"She's got one game down...

So let's be honest... 

It's time she plays Factorio."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Elden Ring.

You gotta take the gloves off at some point."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Unravel 2!!!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Grounded is so much fun! But very scary (chased by giant spiders...)
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,My 9 year old BEGGED me to play this and laughed at me everytime I yelled in surprise as I turn to see a giant spider in my face. Now we've almost beat it and she's a lot more interested in bugs and a lot less scared. The arachnophobia setting helped her ease into it though. Overall GREAT game and were having so much fun together.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I recommend portal 2. Played through the whole co OP with my 6 yo. She loved it, and it was a good amount of challenge for her"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"It Takes Two is a legitimately good game, even if you don't have kids."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Oh my god. Honestly, my first thought was that that game could be fun for that but I had totally forgotten some vital aspects of the game that would DEFINITELY make that problematic."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I’m 45 and still cry at the end of a really good book series. It’s like saying good bye to friends. The positive is that there are always new books to read 🥳
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"I started the Song of Ice and Fire series when I was a teenager so luckily I'll never have to leave my childhood behind.

(Actually the show probably killed it.  Damn)"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"HDM just ends so bitter sweetly, it’s a story ending done right. Don’t feel the same way about HP ending."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,[removed]
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"In the end credits, there’s a scene that pans over to her sitting next to a sewing kit, looking all patched up and with a bandaid on her head, so I took this as resolution that they gave her a happy ending. 

My girlfriend and I just finished the game last week and I was ADAMANT they had to have some sort of resolution with the elephant or I was going to be irrationally upset, so I was very happy to get that last little bit of closure when I saw it XD"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I think it’s because Cutie represents their kid so they think focusing on her will fix their partnership and that in the end there’s no way for the couple to split and divorce without hurting their kid
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,It literally makes no sense and the tone of the game shifts so drastically for that one particular moment. My friend and I were left scratching our heads wondering what the devs were going for with that one. Our best guess is they thought it was humorous? We were two men in our mid twenties so you'd think we'd be the demographic for that kind of thing but it went right over us lol
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I did. I walked away in tears. My husband had to take both controllers and grit through it himself. We don't speak about it..
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Big problem is that it doesn't give the players nearly the same level of creative expression the original games did. Imo that's what made them special, not the platforming (which the new one is better at, for sure)"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I heard it didn’t have a ton of content, but I couldn’t mistaken"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,does it have the creation tools for players to make their own maps? the original games were probably my all-time favorite platformer games just because the character-created maps were so clever and fun to play.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,LBP 1 was my life when I was a kid. It's so fun and so intuitive just the best way to let out creativity
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,One of my college buddies was a programmer/developer that helped make this game!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,You mean 2
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I'd argue LBP2 was the best. It had way better graphics and a better story. The power ups were so much fun and added so much variety to the gameplay. All of the lbp1 content carried over as well. It was probably my favorite game as a kid
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Unravel two? I was going to  suggest it, but it was a little hard for two 33 year olds. Granted we were trying to get gold on each level.

I think it’s like $4 on ps right now. Or was when I got it a few months ago."

16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"My wife and I played through 1 and 2 on the same screen countless times. I haven’t tried 3, but 1 and 2 are some of my favorite casual coop games."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,No clue on 2. Really enjoyed 3 like 6 or 7 years ago. Not sure if you are thinking about the one that came out within the last few years.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I'm sure that was part of it. The game had become a pretty significant part of our routine for a long time. And we both looked forward to it. 

But she knows she'll always have time with me. I've had exactly 50% custody of her since she was three. And I've never missed a single day of that time with her. 

I think spending that time together in that way with that game was something that really connected with her... and me as well. 

It's a special game that creates special memories."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I'm in my 30s and I still get sad whenever I finish a game, a book or a TV series. In some cases it took me years to work up the courage to finish my favorite ones. One is actually still around the 20 year mark and counting :P"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Do you all know what It Takes Two is about?  A couple on the verge of divorce.  I think there's a pretty clear reason why she's so affected by the game.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I mean, I was upset when my friend and I beat It Takes Two. I didn't cry but I was sad, because we had soooo much fun playing and now it was over, and we couldn't ever play it for the first time again. It was also the pandemic so I wasn't the most emotionally stable at the time. But being sad good stories are over is pretty normal. This happens to me when I finish a great book or show too."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,Idk I'm 32 and I felt like shit when I knew Outer Wilds was over. I think the kid knows what's up.  Games end and sometimes it's sad.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,It Takes Two Too!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"I hope so, or maybe it takes 3? The kid joins the fun? Just because me and my son finished the 1st one and my daughter is already 2. I want to play it with both of them, or else ill be the odd one. Ill only get to play if it gets too hard."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"My recommendation for a game that fills that It Takes Two hole for me was Unravel Two. 

Hope it does for you both too."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is by the same creator of It Takes Two, and I believe it has 2 player co-op on the Switch Version?

Also I could recommend Stardew Valley for local co-op!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I recommend you try Lego Jurassic World, it has a big map with 4 islands and a funny story, I played it on my Xbox a looong time ago and it was my first game. Beautiful game with amazing graphics and dinosaurs. After you finish the storyline you can also create custom dinosaurs with custom colors and it's pretty fun."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I recommend Unravel 2. I did almost the same as you with my daughter. She loved the game and got sorry when we finished it. Damn good game, anyway."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"If you have playstation, try sackboy a big adventure! Very fun coop 3d platforming with fluid mechanics, great visuals, and a cute story."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Portal, little big planet, lovers in a dangerous space time, overcooked, don’t starve together."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"My mother read to us every night until we turned 13. Sometimes when we're are just hanging, I'll ask her to read me some. I'm 32. Keep reading to her. Amp it up though. We used to do chapter books - a chapter a night. Stuff like Lord of the Rings or Little House on the Prarie series were absolute faves. We also did lots of CS Lewis, and when we're in the older range, sometimes a real heavy hitter - to kill a mockingbird, lord of the flies, uncle Tom's cabin. 

I will note here though that my mother is an English teacher, so the ""hard"" books came with lots of discussion and talking.

Edited to add, she read us foundation too lol. I think we were a little young to grasp anything past holograms and spaceships, but still fun. Also one time at 10 I asked her to read from Dune, which she did, the gom jabbar scene. I begged for more and we watched Lynch's 1984 Dune. I was NOT ready lol"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I’ve been enjoying Knights & Bikes with my daughter.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I think Tina's wonderland is awesome, but it could be a little much for a nine year old. It has RPG aspects like class choices and weapon stats. Not to say that you two wouldn't enjoy the game but it might be a bit overwhelming, especially if she doesn't know the characters or the background of D&D as a whole.

Portal 2 might be a better fit. Lots of fun puzzles and a great story."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"We have a Switch as well and she does enjoy playing it. She tends to get frustrated sometimes with Mario Party or Mario Kart. She’s getting there and Peppa Pig is only the left stick and X button, so very easy to master for her. 

I still remember the first time playing River Raid on the 2600 with my dad. He never moved passed Atari, but I cherish those moments.

Definitely let me know if you can think of any other games for Switch/PS/XBox that you think she may like. I would love suggestions."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Scrolling farther down and still haven't seen it, **Trine** series hits those same feels as It takes two. Fun and fairly simple!"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,I wouldnt recommend a 9 year old play dark souls
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Lol, yeah, he’s a pretty sharp kid. I was genuinely impressed by his problem-solving skills along the way. There were quite a few times where I had to help him, or we had to switch controllers completely, but for the most part he could handle himself. It was a really fun experience."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,Lol that downvote confirmed it
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I'm just saying this reads as her being scared of losing time with her dad rather than rather than a specific game thing, atleast to me."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I felt I was fairly objective. How would you explain the difference in reaction?
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,Sorry about your wife’s boyfriend.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I actually have a lot of Lego games. And we both have a ton of actual Legos since we both love them. You don't want to know how much I've spent on them for my daughter and I lol. 

But the Lego games just don't click with her for some reason. I think it's the heartfelt story of it takes two that really made her love the game."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,That will bring about a different type of crying😂😂
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"It will teach her a valuable lesson...

16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Can also be played in coop lmao
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"How dare you even suggest Factorio, might as well give the girl crack. like Jesus dude you should be ashamed. Do you want OP to find his daughter hunched over the key board like a goblin at 3am mumbling about through put while she drops a war crimes worth of artillery shells on a biter colony?"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,That game will never end. The factory must always grow...
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Why not dwarf fortress?
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,if I had factorio when I was 9 I would have grown up with like akira powers.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Yeah, do not play grounded if you have any aversion to spiders. The arachnophobia slider was not helpful in my case, and I found turning it off ironically the last off-putting. It's also a LOT harder than it takes two."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"My gf and I just finally beat it and we enjoyed 99.9% of it together, it was a middle ground of our interests coming together"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"It's also designed to be a single player, I can't imagine that moment near the end hitting half as hard if you're bodging it to play it co-op."

16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,You want a 9-year-old trying to wrap their head around portal? She struggled with it takes two
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Lol, my girlfriend and I exchanged so many sad looks as we dragged that poor elephant to its death, haha.  

It Takes Two got us good, man. When we started it and found the first couple mini games, we were like, ""Uh. Okay, does this have anything to do with the game? Okay whatever let's just keep going.""  
Then by the end we were like, ""Honey, come to where I am, I found a curling minigame!!""  

The game design totally worked on us and made us just have fun together.  
We've decided to save another playthrough for if/when our relationship stagnates or we feel distant. It's a very special game for us."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"my friend and I couldn’t stop laughing, like it was so ridiculous (and unnecessary) that we found it hilarious. helped show too that the protags at that point still really were focused on themselves and not working on their relationship/why their daughter was hurting (infact, actively trying to hurt their daughter)"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I thought it was incredible. How the devs could make something that feels so violent and visceral while keeping it PG. At that point in the story the parents are doing anything they can to be turned back to normal and aren’t considering how it will affect the world around them
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I thought it was hilarious. Different strokes for different folks.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Haha, well, at least that means you have a heart."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"My gf was exactly the same, had to leave the room bawling. Of all the video games ive ever played and countless animated beings killed, that will forever be the most brutal thing i've done in gaming."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Also, the bombastic characters and narrorator! Theres some but man, LBP1-3 had such a charm about them that SackboyBA seems to lack."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Played it and loved it. There’s plenty of content. It’s not a 300 hr RPG, but it’s a very good platformer with a cute, straightforward story."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,It's roughly similar in length to ITT. And SBA has a lot of side content too.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Tell him thanks from teen me. I loved the whole franchise and even have the sackboy doll from the limited edition. Lbp1 is one of the game that i still think about from the ps3 era
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Man I can't tell you how many hours my mom, my brothers, and I all played LBP 1, 2, and 3, together for. Great games, and we were so ecstatic when Sackboy's Big Adventure came out. Truly incredible IP."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Do you have a Nintendo switch? Luigis mansion 3 on the switch is the only game that came close tot he same experience for my wife who is new to video games and I playing co op. There is a story, it is beautiful, can be done in 45 minute time chunks and is forgiving when there is a large skill difference in players'."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"This might be too personal of a question so feel free to ignore this, but how did she take the theme of the game? Two parents with a young kid about to divorce but get back together must be a trip for a kid her age who has divorced parents."

16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Please make sure she understands that you were celebrating the accomplishment of finishing the game and not that you don't have to play the game anymore.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I think the most interesting thing about this is that the game itself is about a 9 year old girl coping with loss and changing parental relationships. Your little girl is living the game.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Switch characters and play the game over again.

We made it an event. Snacks... a special drink. Maybe some character hats or jammies. And we didn't play Mario party. We had a Mario party lol. 

We still do it occasionally now. Even though she's 9 :)"
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,That’s a lot to read into it. She can be genuinely sad to have a special thing she and her dad do together come to an end even if she gets plenty of quality dad time otherwise.

Good point. This is the most convincing explanation I've heard so far.

They had a demo tent set up at a music festival I went to called All Points West. It was an awesome festival and all the bands were great! Radiohead, Duffy, Andrew Bird... anyway... I spent so much time in that Sony/LBP tent just playing that demo that was so unique to me. At the time, I kind of had a gaming lull, was more into music and films, and being creative; I didn't have any current gen game systems. That game pushed me to buy a PS3 and reignited my interest in video games. To me, it was like Mario Paint. It said, ""here are some tools, get creative"" and that was the perfect game for me at that moment on my life."

16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,My daughter and I had a ton of fun playing Unravel 2. A little stressful in a couple parts but definitely not too much for a 9 year old
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,I didn't realize you could co-op on Luigi's Mansion. Is it couch co-op only or can you play with friends via internet?
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,This was my thought as well! I cried like a baby when the game was over because the story itself was so powerful! Might be worth a chat with her about it.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,I was going to mention this. It's actually why I don't like how the game ends! >!The whole premise of the book and how its trying to repair their relationship is childish and immature. Which makes sense because its created by a child. I was hoping that the game would be a story of healing where the two realise their bitterness for each other was hurting their child and they needed to become friends and put their child first. I hope OP's kid doesn't get the wrong idea that she can repair her parents relationship now.!<
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"I've seen OP saying that they've been split since she was 3, so I'm guessing her parents being separated is just life as she knows it.

Thing is at 6 years old many parts of the game were beyond his ability, so we always sat together and I'd give him clues on what to do or take over entirely for some parts. It was a great experience together and he was really vested in getting that cat back home. So maybe if story is critical here maybe you guys can share a single player game in the same manner."

My friend loves platformers, and since some of them have puzzles and Portal is kind of a platformer I figured he would like it. I finally got him to play it once and he quit after about a half hour because it was too difficult for him, I guess he couldn't grasp the physics part of it. Being high whenever we played probably didn't help him either lol.

I've gone though story mode in both Portal and Portal 2 and I love them."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"I found Portal 2 to be a bit frustrating for me (as a seasoned gamer and decent puzzle solver) to play with my fiancee, who doesn't regularly play those kinds of games.  

She got through Portal 1 and 2 slowly, but loved them.  
However when we tried co-op we ran into the issue that I would solve the puzzles much faster than her, which either meant she didn't get to do anything or I sat around waiting for her to come to the same conclusion I already reached a while ago."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Stardew Valley was my first thought for another game. It makes me so happy.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Technically that game is single-player “co-op”. The hook for the game is that you control both brothers and have to control both at the same time. It isn’t meant to be played multiplayer. Though, if you do share a controller and find it fun that way, that works too. 

I would recommend A Way Out if they were looking for another cinematic co-op game in the same style. Definitely more adult themed though. Same developer though.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

*Edit* 

I’ve been made aware the Switch edition touts co-op, but after some research, I still feel the game itself is still designed for a single player. They just claim multiplayer on the Switch since the “controller” can be split in half."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Oh TIL, people were asking for it tbf and most of the game would work well in co-op."

16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"Seriously. When I was a kid my mom introduced me to Final Fantasy. (IV and VII initially. IV is the one with Cecil right?) Anyway, it wasn’t easy and I didn’t understand the mechanics of an rpg at the time being seven. But I figured it out over the course of a year and kept coming back. 

When I finally beat it I felt so accomplished because that wasn’t easy for me. And my parents weren’t playing with me. They offered advice but they left me to it for the most part. It’s good shit y’all. Kids can be persistent and really dig into a challenge."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"This right here. Kids are surprisingly brilliant, and if it ends up being too difficult you can always come back later and play something else.

16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"So my daughter will be 7 in a few weeks and loves playing games with me and her dad. Here's a rundown on what we've had success and failure with. She's beat Smash Bros story on easy with the exception of two fights and the boss and we actually just played a round with her. She's played Luigi's Mansion with her dad. She actually beat the new Kirby mostly solo, figuring out the puzzles mostly on her own and doing 100% of the controls herself. The only fight she didn't beat was the super boss after the game ended. The older Kirby games remade on Switch were much harder for her though. She likes playing sackboy with us too. Animal Crossing was really fun for her, since your daughter loves Minecraft you may look into that one. She got pretty dang good in Mario Kart and we play that together often. She played Mario Odyssey but it was a bit too hard for her at 6 and we helped a lot. She liked the Super Mario World 3d with Bowsers fury. And we've been enjoying some Pokemon Snap too. We take turns and help look for Pokemon in that one. We got her a few Lego games but those were never ones she really wanted to come back to, maybe they were too hard for her and need a few years. We are getting her Disney Illusion Island for her birthday so hoping that's a good 2 player game for her. She's been begging to play Zelda but I'm like noooo until you can read lol. I've made the mistake of starting games that need reading and stuck having to read text boxes constantly at the beginning (like Animal Crossing 👀). Oh man I feel like I've left some out but we've been playing games since she was 5. She's gotten pretty good, it's impressive what kids can do in games. Sounds like you got a fun bonding activity to share with your daughter. Congrats on leveling up as a dad, achievement first game beaten together achieved, hope you enjoy the next game just as much!"

OP, if you have an Xbox, try looking through the gamepass list. They have a lot of fun games that support co-op. A lot of them are made by indie studios too!

Just uh...be warned that when your daughter gets older, she's gonna slowly take over your account. You're either gonna have to share it or make a second one just for her (I should know, I'm that daughter lol)"

16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Stop talking to my daughters.

Edit: Also, thank you."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Ok, let me drop the humor and spit straight facts.

The Dark Souls series, Seikero, and Bloodborne have co-op elements are are extremely difficult.  I personally enjoy them as they take all of your hubris and lays them in front of you.  My Daughters tease with the phrase ""talk shit, get hit"" as I couldn't pass the minibusses in Seikero.

For context, I'm a Grandfather and my reflexes are not what they used to be.  My daughters are effective users of sarcastic humor as they were exposed to it their entire lives by me.

Now while these games are brutal the rush they have provided my household for the epic wins are, literally, unmatched rushes of pure joy 

TL;DR They are fun co-op but get prepared to get smacked around.

Edit: Forgot my daughters found this account ages ago, so to horrifying them further. I'm adding to the end of the TL;DR, ""I don't mind paying extra for it either because it's worth it.""

Daughters: I've started the timer to see how long until I get the next horrified (humerous) text about my posts.

Edit 2: A little under an hour, I received a text ""Why can't you be like other old people and hate technology.""

I love her so much."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I'm co-oping It Takes Two, along with Derailed, Keep Talking & Nobody Explodes, Super Mario Party mini-games, Smash Bros tournaments, & Mario Odyssey. We raced through Overcooked (try Plate-Up on PC). Stardew & Minecraft obviously. You can try free online games like Rocket League & Fortnite."
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"*From Software*'s games are no joke when it comes to difficulty. They're infuriatingly difficult. If you enjoy rage quitting and attempting the same 15 minute segment until you get through it, have at it!

I played *Dark Souls 3* for like a half hour years ago and hated it because it wasn't fun to me. When I saw that *Elden Ring* was coming out and they said it wasn't going to be like *Dark Souls* or their other games I bought it. I just checked Steam and I have 19.9 hours logged in it since launch. I can't get past the first area. Literally as soon as you start the game (maybe 5 minutes in) there's a mini-boss that's going to whoop your ass. I beat it after like five tries and about an hour or two of play time (they say you can skip these mini-bosses by running past them, but I wanted to attempt to up my skills). I didn't even know that there was a tutorial in the beginning of the game because you have to *jump off a ledge to find it*. There's nothing that makes you go through the tutorial, or even tells you that it exists! I found out about it a few hours after the fact *from Reddit*.

IMO the games are annoying because they're entirely about being extremely precise with your timing of things. Parried 0.5 seconds too late? You're getting hit! Brought your shield up 0.5 seconds too late? Too bad! There aren't any (good) ranged weapons in the game (at least that I found) so you're forced into melee combat all the time, you have magic at your disposal but it's very limited. It's not like Skyrim or another game where you have a specific Magicka meter that restores over time, it's a single-use itemized thing (at least with the character builds I tried and IIRC I chose the magic heavy ones). While heading up this castle that was part of a quest you have to get by like 10-12 roaming guards. About 6 or 7 are easy enough to kill, but the real pain in the ass ones are the ones that have the long shields and block like 80% of your hits. You have to dodge/roll around them and hit them where their shield isn't protecting, that of course takes stamina IIRC. They also have long spears or halberts so they can attack you while they're guarding *but you can't attack them while guarding* AFAIK. There's like 2 or 3 of them in that area, and they'll usually call in about 2 or 3 of the easy guards when you're fighting them, unless you've killed them all already. You'll most likely be low or empty on health potions and these guys are gonna kick your ass, repeatedly. I would get down to just one of the shield guys left, and have like 50% health left with no potions, get him down to like 10 or 20% health...then the fucker would kill me. You can only save at specific areas too, to make it even more *fun*, so reloading a save means taking a minute to two to run back to that area *and then fighting off all those guards again*. Also I forgot, there's about 2-3 attack dogs in addition to these guards!

I like a bit of a challenge, I've played multiple RPG and FPS games on hard after I've beaten them on normal, or if I felt normal was too easy, but when it's on easy or normal difficulty *and you can't get past the first main area after a few hours and multiple attempts* that's just flat out annoying IMO and completely sucks the fun out of the game.

/end rant

tl;dr the game is super annoying and isn't what I'd consider enjoyable unless you love games that require tight timing tolerances in order to avoid damage, love melee combat, and give literally zero help on anything. There is zero ""hand holding"" it's more like ""kick you in the nuts and run away laughing""."

16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-07,"As an old gamer, I agree. Do not underestimate what a kid will learn to have fun. 

When I was 9 my favorite games were:

Castlevania, Metroid, and Legend of Zelda.

The next year I got:

Dragon Warrior, Final Fantasy (one), and my new favorite Starlight. (Took me a few years to master Starlight, that game was epic for it's day)

I just needed a Nintendo power issue to help with the hard parts. But I beat all those games on my own, by pure persistence.

16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,Wow this just unlocked a memory for me! My dad played BG1 and BG2 all the time when I was a kid. I asked him if I could try but he only let me play his character for a few minutes before he suggested that I make my own character instead because he didn’t want me accidentally saving over his saves. I’m 36 now and feel the same about my BG3 character!
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,what about minecraft dungeons? i play it with my nephew alot (he was 7 when it released) - he too was a massive minecraft fan who was very protective of his worlds.
16brgts,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"I used to date a woman who had 5 kids and they all loved to play Minecraft. They also would get very territorial about playing in their worlds. To compromise we made a new world for all of us to play together in, and I also had an individual world with each of the kids separately. Each one had a different goal they wanted to accomplish, so it was great to play with each of them on their own world and I would help them with whatever their goal was.

When we all played together we had a world called “honeycomb kingdom”, where our entire goal was to make a kingdom purely out of honeycombs. Each one of them still had their individual things they liked to work on, but it all contributed to the overall kingdom. It became something we all looked forward to and we would talk about what we were gonna do next even when we were out. I highly suggest doing that with your daughter, I’m sure she would love it."

1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Witcher 3 in my opinion
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Breath of the wild when considering its overall impact on the industry and future games. For example, elden ring, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, sonic frontiers, and countless other games since then were  inspired by breath of the wild. When I view game of the year and especially game of the decade, a game’s legacy and impact on the industry as a whole matters as much as whether it’s a truly fun/great game. That’s why I wouldn’t consider games like BG3, dragon age, etc since the legacy and impact argument is much harder for those games to justify than BoTW. In the same vein, Witcher III is a close second to BoTW with this criteria in mind. The way I see it though, BoTW inspired a future game of the year winner — Elden Ring — which really does say it all."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Gotta go with Witcher 3.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Baldurs Gate or Elden Ring

1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Witcher 3 or Elden Ring I think
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"BG3, BotW, and Witcher 3 are your contenders."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,I haven't played most of these (have Xbox and Nintendo so God of War and Last of Us have been out of reach) . . . but of the ones I have played I'd choose Elden Ring. I feel like I should give Witcher 3 a go . . . I've heard so many great things about it.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Unreal tournament
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,I think it’s either Witcher 3 or Breath of the Wild. Studios have been trying so hard to make the perfect open world game since those two dropped and a game like Elden ring really shows the like culmination of the two.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"I would have to say BG3. Mostly due to it's replay ability and good story. Most of these games are 1 playthrough and done. With BG3 having SO many options, you kinda have to play it at 3 times to do everything and doesn't get old because you can do so much. 1 playthrough, you might be a good character and just be like a angelic healer, saving people and be a hippie. While the next playthrough, you are a murder hobo causing chaos, killing everything and everyone, in unique and horrifying ways"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Witcher 3 has to be the game of its own decade (2010-2019) while Elden Ring for me seems as the best contender for this decade (2020-2029) so far.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"I personally think its easily ER, but if ER werent in the mix, it would be a difficult choice... I think BotW had such an influence on games that came after it so Id choose that."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Probably BOTW.  Zelda is timeless and the first iteration of what they did it was just insane

Just like ocarina of time would’ve been its game of the decade.

Or ff7"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Breath of the Wild, Elden Ring, or Witcher 3."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,I am having such a amazing time with BG3. As someone who loves the Witcher 3 and Elden ring. I just think that the story telling of BG3 goes further beyond anything I have ever played. So Baldur’s gate is my GOTY!
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Skyrim without doubt.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,BotW or Elden Ring
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I played almost every one of the others listed but none hooked me like God of War. It's the first game since my childhood that I spent an obscene amount of hours in getting better and better and doing every single side thing I could do. I only looked things up online if I absolutely had to. It completely took me over, I was up until 4, 5am playing nightly and I couldn't stop. 

Zelda comes close, but after a certain point I just said screw it and rushed to the finish. Witcher 3 and several others I just couldn't get into. There just hasn't been an experience like God of War for me, including RDR2. Every single game I stop and put down, or quit entirely and never come back to. God of War was just it."

1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Of all the games on this list, I'd say Breath of the Wild was the only one to substantially move the needle in terms of game design, both for its own series and gaming as a whole. Many other games are doing the open world thing, but BotW did a really good job of making the world feel like it wasn't procedurally generated. They had a lot of different systems feeding into each other and altogether it was the complete package when it came to open world exploration.


Elden Ring would be my personal favorite from this list, but while it completely nailed the transition to an open world design, it didn't really do a whole lot to change the Dark Souls formula in the same way BotW is a completely different experience from its previous games which were also linear in nature.


All the other games on this list are great, but are more derivative in my opinion. It Takes Two is probably the only one I'd say which was carving out its own niche, but it didn't make a huge impact on the rest of the industry in the same way as some of the others."

1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"I think it's either Breath of the Wild or Elden Ring. I'd say of those two, even though I personally prefer Elden Ring, I think Breath of the Wild did more to push games forward"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,I don't care... I had far more fun with Overwatch than the rest of these games combined.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Gow or lozbotw because they were sort of revolutionary on their own.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,skyrim easily. every open world game is compared to it in some capacity. it's the goat.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,The witcher 3
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Witcher 3, choices mattered alot"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Skyrim
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"For me, it’d be The Last Of Us 2. But if I were to pick any game of the last ten years, it’d be RDR2 hands down."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,It's Witcher 3 imo
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"on this list, probably witcher 3,with botw a rly close 2nd"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Witcher 3 or god of war to me. Probably would give it to witcher but it's close between those 2.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Elden ring or Zelda. Both are brilliant examples of decades of compounding game design
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"I'll get disagreed with heavily, but Overwatch, before it became Overwatch 2 with battle pass and flat 5v5 gameplay, is probably in my top 10 games of all time. The amount of hours I put into that game and the amount of highs I felt popping off for a PotG or doing some sick counter play to enable my teammates to thrive is unmatched. 

People look at Overwatch now through a lens of why it's become and think it can't possibly contend with what's on that list, but Overwatch (1) was a fantastic game. Incredibly well balanced until around the time Brigitte was added to the mix. 

It felt so good as Winston to dive on a Genji harassing my supports and protecting them so they could heal the Soldier as he ulted with a Zarya bubble protecting etc. the level of team work and combos built solely into its mechanics was great and I loved playing it competitively. 

There is a reason why Overwatch won GotY and it's not because nothing else was released in 2016. Xcom 2, Stardew Valley, Dishonoured 2, Uncharted 4 and Titanfall 2 all came out that year amongst others.

BG3 is the real answer though simply for how much it's done to highlight the flaws in the industry and how it's possible to succeed without them. So in game and out of game, it's unmatched."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Botw for sure. It set an example for every open world game
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Looking at this list it's still absolutely crazy to me that GoW actually beat RDR2. I mean, GoW is a fantastic game but RDR2 is just something else entirely.


Out of the games listed it really depends on the category and the criteria used - this way you can make a strong case for more than half of them. Talking about the overall best game though... that'd be between BG3, ER and BotW for me. Witcher 3 has aged poorly imo, comparatively."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"I think when you're talking about game of the Decade you have to really look at why each of the games won and what their competition was.

while there are some truly amazing games on this list a lot of them are very genre specific and they don't have universal appeal. when they launched they were amazing but its because in a year we only see 4-5 really good titles.

This is why I think in a head to head battle there is only one clear winner and its It's takes two. The games only downfall and one of its strengths as well is it requires coop but the devs allow you to invite a friend to play so its not gouging consumers. soo many unique and varied play styles are stuffed in ITT that nothing ever overstays its welcome. as soon as you're tired of throwing nails and platforming the game turn into a 3rd person shooter where you have to work together to explode bugs then its a top down knight and wizard hack/slash game before turning into a coop battleship.

It doesn't require you to enjoy soulsbourne games, hack and slash RPGS, Third person or first person hero shooters to truly appreciate the game. as it gives you a bit of everything and its all well done with a great story that almost anyone will enjoy. When you're looking at game of the Decade I think the biggest category for who will win is who the game appeals to the most and ITT appeals to everyone pretty much."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"For me it’s solely between botw and elden ring. I played 8/10 of these games and enjoyed them all, as well."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,I could see helldivers 2 get GOTY if nothing else as well receptied comes out later this year
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Bloodborne

Wait..."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Witcher 3.

Other games are good, no doubt, but Witcher 3 is a masterpiece.

✅ Graphics, from 2015, smoke 90% of games today. 

✅ The game is so entertaining that there is no rush to even follow the story. Just exploring and side quests are the bees knees.

✅ Story is immersive and great. Entertaining.

✅ Awesome supporting cast and npcs.

✅ Gameplay is great. Different ways to play.

✅ Loot, loot, loot

✅ Tons of weapons, armors, potions, etc…

✅ Side quest galore. 

✅ Many different monsters to fight. All look awesome.

✅ Protagonist has top tier character lore and writing. 

✅ Voice actor 10/10

✅ Branching storylines where decisions matter.

✅ Multiple endings.

✅ Gwent. A full game, inside a game. Like Geometry Wars back in the day. (Project Gotham Racing)

✅ FREE dlcs that add many, many hours to the game and have more substance than a lot of full games nowadays.

✅ Official TV Show tie-in DLCs… Not great, but adding stuff to an old game is awesome."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,its elden ring for me. ive never seen a gaming community come together to appreciate a game for so long. it really felt like everyone was playing it or was watching someone play it for months.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Sekiro hands down
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Its gotta be Witcher 3, God of War or Elden Ring"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,GoW. I personally hated breath of the wild passionately
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"It's the witcher 3,  it was ahead of its time"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Witcher 3 or BG3
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,It's either BG3 or Witcher 3. They're the 2 games on this list that are all time great games.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Lots of awesome games in there, but yea, Elden ring."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Skyrim
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Elden Ring easily.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Elden Ring, quite easily."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"The only game I played and finished in this list is Witcher 3, so for me is The Witcher 3."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,No Man's Sky has done a lot for showing what an exploration game can be.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Baldurs Gate 3 or The Witcher 3 for me.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Going off list: Stardew Valley. It's not a game, it's a lifestyle at this point"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"As much as I don't like it, it's Elden Ring."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Let’s go back a bit farther

I think Fallout 3 was the best game of the 2000’s"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Super mario bros 2 baby
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Botw
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Eldin Ring
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Honestly I'd choose It Takes Two.  Love the co-op vibes and the old school splitscreen gameplay - seeing your partner's POV and figuring out easy traversal puzzles together.  So innovative and art-style is so refreshing.  I beat the game with my wife earlier this year and I imagine when my 8 y/o gets into games we can also play it in a few years and I'd still enjoy it the same.  Other games are amazing though!
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,On that list Elden Ring for me
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,It's either Elden Ring or Baldurs Gate 3 for me
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,elden ring
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Imo none of these. Rocket League is the only correct option.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"There is only Elden Ring and Baldur's Gate 3. Mainly, because the industry cannot deliver a game of that type and quality, except for the one studio that made these games. These studios may not make another series this decade of this quality."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Metroid Dread.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Sekiro is as close to perfect as games can be. ER wins tho.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Eldin Ring for sure.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"It absolutely blows my mind Red Dead Redemption 2 is not on this list, because it's easily the best game out of all of these."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Elden Ring because I have 3500 hours in it and still finding new things.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Baldur's Gate 3 has some issues still plaguing it like bad writing for Act 2 characters, a lackluster Act 3 and general issues with 5E.

If we are looking at the current state of a lot of these, God of War sadly just lacks much replayability or very deep gameplay.

The Last of Us Part 2 is a narrative game first and foremost and its story was leaked.

Breath of the Wild is a serious contender.

Dragon Age: Inquisition is not.

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a great game I have unfortunately not played.

Sekiro is a contender although I have not played it.

Honestly, it sucks that Cyberpunk didn't launch in the state it is in now or it could be a contender. But between Elden Ring, Breath of the Wild, Witcher 3 and Sekiro, I just gotta give it to Elden Ring. The lore is amazing, the gameplay is fantastic, the difficulty is stimulating, it has the best of multiple franchises leading up to it whereas God of War and Breath of the Wild cast off their franchises mechanics to do something new.

I gotta give it to Elden Ring. It is the refinement of a formula upon multiple decades by game developers who invented the genre and are masters of their craft. The story is literally perfect and save for a few reused bosses which most games on this list do, it is still an incredibly enjoyable game with a seriously deep setting and it even has multiplayer."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,I play video games my whole life and never played any of those games at all. There's a lot of bubbles in this world. 
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,How the fuck did overwatch win
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,All in favor of elden ring as the greatest game of all time say aye
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Elden Ring and it's not even close
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,RDR2 deserved Game of the Year not GOW
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-22,"Elden Ring IMO. It’s the type of game you dream about and then get sad you can never play, only this time it’s not a dream."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-06-03,"I think it's between elden ring, botw and Witcher 3, but if I had to choose, it would be elden ring."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"TLOU2 and I don't think it's that close. 
That game was an absolute masterpiece in every single way. Sadly, it's remembered as bad by a sect of people who didn't like the plot and / or are homophobic."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Last decades most award winning game was TLOU2. That would be game of the decade. As for this decade, currently its Elden Ring. Idk how many awards BG3 has, but its still winning awards."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"The last of us pt 2 is the greatest game of all time, so I’m gonna go with that one"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Controversial but TLOU2
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,elden ring
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,I feel old and out of touch. I haven't played any of these except OW and some of Botw before I lost my copy (hated the breaking mechanic tbh).
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Breath of the wild was incredible and still talked about
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Only contenders for me are:
- Elden Ring
- BotW
- Witcher 3"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,For me it's between Witcher 3 and BOTW. Both games influenced so many games that came afterwards and were stunning experiences from start to end. I think I would tie those 2.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Honestly I feel game of the decade should cover a fixed decade. So like 2000-2009, 2010-2019, 2020-2029, etc. 

We have some data for 2000-2009, full data for 2010-2019, and some current data for 2020-2029. 

Before it was called Game Awards, it was the Spike VGA/VGX, and these are the games there before 2014:


2003 - Madden NFL 2004

2004 - GTA San Andreas

2005 - Resident Evil 5

2006 - TES IV: Oblivion

2007 - Bioshock

2008 - Grand Theft Auto IV

2009 - Uncharted 2

2010 - Red Dead Redemption

2011 - TES V: Skyrim

2012 - The Walking Dead

2013 - Grand Theft Auto V


So it’s really tough to determine a GotD for the 2010s because there were so many games. Skyrim and GTA5 are already the biggest juggernauts of the 2010s even though they came in the early 2010s, and the later 2010s have Witcher 3, BotW, etc.  Not to mention the fromsoft games that dominated the 2010s. It’s near impossible to have a single GotD here.

For the 2000s, it’s also hard to find a single GotD there for opposite reasons. That is many of the games listed there don’t really stand out too much as juggernauts of the gaming sphere even if they were big on their release.

For the 2020s, there’s too little info atm but it seems so far that only really Elden Ring is a contender for GotD there, with maybe BG3 as a secondary. But again, hard to say. 

Also, these GotY lists are also missing a lot of influential games that were contenders for GotY but didn’t win, who I feel definitely deserve to be at the same level as these currently listed GotY.

IMO since the current list of GotY is already flawed and missing a lot of stellar games, a GotD is even more impossible to determine because it will most definitely be wrong no matter what you choose."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Witcher 3 just had it all.

Amazing graphics, fantastic story, superb side quests, fun mini-game, best DLC. It did what I thought was impossible at the time (huge open world + incredble story).

For me, Witcher 3 is Game of the Decade. Sure, the gameplay is a bit janky (even at the time it came out) but playable. None of the other games could pull off what Witcher 3 did though. Some have amazing open worlds (BotW, Elden Eing), some have incredible stories and characters (God of War, Baldur's Gate 3) but none of them had both like Witcher 3."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Elden Ring because it massively innovated on and popularized a once niche subgenre (soulslike).
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Elden Ring probably
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Nothing had as much an impact as the witcher 3.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,I feel like there's a lot of recency bias here. Especially since the 2021-2018 games are comparatively weaker. BOTW and Witcher 3 are more talked about now than Baldur's gate 3 will be in 5 years time.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Witcher 3 hands down. 
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"There are 5 games on here that have legitimate arguements for them, 5 that are great games but cant compare to the top 5, and then there’s Overwatch"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,BG3. There’s just something special about it.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Sekiros combat remains untouched, i have played it probably every year, just to jump in and mess around with different combat art and prosthetic combos on different bosses, its a thing of beauty."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Elden Ring
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"I'm surprised at the lack of Breath of the Wild being mentioned/upvoted.

A lot of Witcher 3 and Elden Ring being lauded as revolutionary, but BoTW was equally, if not more so (on much more limited hardware, no less).

The irony is that the answer is probably Red Dead 2, and that didn't even win GOTY, which is hilarious. As good as GOW was, it wasn't even close to RDR2."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Elden Ring
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Elden Ring takes it, hands down"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"God of War. The story, the combat, the writing, the acting, the animations, the art, the music... it's so succinct and yet so deep."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Elden Ring or Red Dead Redemption 2 (i.e. the true winner of 2018)
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Breath of the wild or it takes two for me. ITT was so unique and so many game genres all in one it blew my mind. We still play it all the time
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Red Dead Redemption 2 anyone?
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"RDR 2 tops every game in this list.

I'll never understand whats the hype around Witcher 3, played it, hoped for a decent story with some twists that never came, boring, combat is terrible.

Outside of a beautiful world there aint much left.

In what world does God of War win against RDR2, insanity"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,BG3 or Elden Ring. Easily. And I say that as someone who likes all the other ones.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,The 2018 GOTY winner RDR2.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Red Dead Redemtion 2
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Elder Scrolls V Skyrim and Fallout 4 would probably be the best for the previous decade as both seem to have staying power.

I think Witcher 3 has that same staying power for this decade. Witcher 3 also has the best dlc. Blood and Wine is a great example on how to do dlc."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,I feel like people not saying BG3 have not played BG3
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,It's a close one but I'd give it to Elden Ring. If Act 3 of BG3 was as good as Act 1/2 then it would've been my choice but Elden Ring was amazing from start to finish.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"I'm 42 years old and have been gaming since Atari. Elden Ring is the best game I've ever played. It's almost perfect relative to everything else. I don't think anything on the list even comes close, and I've played all of them (Except those that aren't on PC)."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"BG3 is an objectively impressive achievement, and I think it absolutely deserves it."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,The first few months of Overwatch was the most fun I had gaming since playing Halo 2/3 as a kid.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,For me: Zelda Breath of the Wild
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Years later and I’m still amazed tlou2 won goty
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Baldurs gate or Elden ring
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"No game released since 2021 qualifies due to the decade not being finished.

Of this list: The Witcher 3"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Sekiro solos
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,2014 must have been a slow year in gaming.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Fallout 3 GOTY edition. One of the best rpg games ever made and the best map and quests out of all the fallout games.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"I don't get the BG3 hype, crazy people think a turn based game is the best game of the last 10 years."

(Zelda)"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Damn.... that's a tough choice. I think I'd probably go with either Sekiro or Witcher 3
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"It would be between BOTW, BG3, and maybe TLOUII. Probably gonna be BG3, for some reason."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Skyrim, always Skyrim"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Fun question. For me it's BOTW all the way. Changed the landscape of what games could do. I hadn't felt that much wonder and such a strong urge to explore in a game. Now I play TOTK instead, but BOTW will always have that special place. Elden Ring is something like BOTW but the nightmare schizo version. It takes away the glider and puzzles and substitutes more sophisticated combat and enemies. Still great, but it doesn't give me the urge to come into its world and play for no reason. 

My second place on this list would be TLOU2. Moved the medium forward as a storytelling vehicle IMO more than any other game, not only by making us engage with Ellie from Abby's perspective, but also by having us participate in Ellie's devolution. Can't wait for the third one. Crossing my fingers for a happy or at least happyish ending to the saga. 

What a decade of games it has been!"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Skyrim. It released in 2011.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Red Dead should've won in 2018 and is the game of the decade.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"We all know that whichever one of these beats the others, Minecraft is the true game of the decade"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"If the metric is being ""So good that it changes the face of the industry"" then BOTW wins by a mile"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Peggle or Peggle 2!
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Elden Ring.  Best game with the widest appeal and overall player satisfaction.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Elden Ring. BG3 is inferior to DoS2.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Witcher 3 for sure. While those other games are excellent, no other game woke me up as much for how good games can be. The consistency of quality in this game is astonishing."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"There is no other game. 

There is only one game, 

and it is *The Game of the Decades…*


GTAV"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,BG3 for sure
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"RDR 2, no matter if it was o  this list or not. True GOAT."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Tough to chose but I would go with elden ring
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"2010s - Witcher 3: Wild Hunt/ God of War

2020s - The Last of Us: Part II"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,It's The Last of Us Part 2
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,God of War
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"GoW for me

When I was younger it probably would have been BG3 or Witcher...but as I get older and have less free time I place a higher premium on ""fun per minute"" which is the one area where some of those more expansive games can drag."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,The last of us 2
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Witcher 3, BOTW, and TLOU2

Would all medal I’m sure."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Definitely God of War
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,God of War
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Elden Ring had a long lasting effect of no other games really captivating me in the same way since. I've definitely felt this sort of thing before after a fantastic game experience, but never this severely.

I don't care for this list in general, though. It's missing three of my other favorite games in the last decade- Hollow Knight, Disco Elysium, and Hades. Any of these four games could compete for my personal game of the decade."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Elden ring for me easily
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"My top 5:

1. Elden Ring
2. Witcher 3
3. God of War
4. BG3
5. Zelda"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,I loved the 2018 GOW but Red Dead Redemption 2 is objectively the better game and must be in contention for game of the decade (and possibly ever)
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Elden ring easily . Best single pIayer game ive ever played. Other single player games on this list I didn't finish out of boredom.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,I'd have to imagine it would be Elden Ring. I've not played it but I know it pretty much dominated the entire year it came out.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"What is wrong with you people? Sekiro is easily the best game I’ve ever played, absolutely blew me away regarding its world and narrative. It won goty and sol millions of copies but I rarely come across people who actually played it. Did everyone just purchase it then not see it through? 

I need answers!!"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"BotW and it’s not even remotely close. The rest of the games are like other things before them, BotW is completely just new and amazing."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"GOTY isn't a title someone can bestow on a game. 


You can declare as game to be OTY and it has just as much meaning."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,BOTW
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Botw or elden ring
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,How did Inquisition win? That game was such a letdown 
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Witcher 3 or Elden ring. Probably Elden ring. Witcher 3’s combat is trash
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,BOTW is the best game on that list imho which means TOtK is the best game out of all and it’s not on the list lol.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"According to Metacritic this is the list ranked by score:

97 - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild

96 - Baldurs's Gate 3

96 - Elden Ring

94 - God of War

93 - The Last of Us Part 2

92 - The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt

91 - Overwatch

90 - Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice

88 - It takes Two

85 - Dragon Age: Inquisition"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Definitely breath of the wild for me out of those.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,2011 The Elder Scrolls Skyrim
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,I really wish I could get into games like Witcher 3 :(
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,I played BG3 the most out of this list but I think The Witcher 3 would probably win if there was a Game of the Decade category.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Probably Witcher 3, but I’ll say that if we were doing this in like four years we’ll see the full cultural impact of Elden Ring in gaming which could push it over the edge. But for now, The Witcher 3."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Feel likentgis is down to 4 options. BoTW, Witcher, Elden Ring, or BG3. Personally, I would go with Elden Ring, but all 4 are pretty solid choices"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,I really wasn't expecting much out of it takes two. It holy hell legitimately one of the best games I've ever played
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"So many good games literally impossible to choose, different games and so much quality its not fair to choose between Witcher3, BG3, Elden ring, gow etc."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"I won't speak to which one is the best, but I can tell you that realistically it's going to be a re-release of Skyrim."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"I have to go with Witcher 3 it has damn good DLC, good story, good mechanics, graphics, etc. Balders Gate is too new and is probably one of the best games in years but a lot of people probably will probably be put off with how the game plays being a top down. Hence why its sold 10 million copies over months. 

Elden Ring is a more accessible game compared to balders gate being open world. Also it sold 12 million copies in 3 weeks. The game's only grip is that the DLC is on the way. 

Witcher 3 I think is the game of the decade because its not as hard as Elden Ring and is just as long, has easier mechanics and isn't overly bloated not saying the the others are but it felt more spaced out. Also you get basically another game with the DLC's. It expands on so much and added so much. 

The only other one that I think is in the running is God of War but the problem with that is its not the full story as you need to play another game and no DLC which is fine it ended its story where it needed to. But it's not the full fleshed out story. Also its an exclusive game it harder to make it game of the decade cause if someone does not have a ps4/5 or PC then they have to buy one just to experience the game."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"I regularly referred to God of War as my GOTDecade for the 2010s, now I think BG3 is a strong early contender for GOTDecade for the 2020s."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,It’s crazy that Witcher 3 was release just a year after DAI. That’s not a bad game but the quality in story is staggering between the two.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Surprised nobody mentioned Ghost of Tsushima. 10/10 masterpiece. Nothing comes close to it.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,witcher 3
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,So many people saying Witcher 3 and i feel like the only person who couldnt get into the game and i love games like it. I also for some reason cant get into terraria or deep rock galactic. I know all 3 of these games are really fun and overall great games and i hate that i cant enjoy them like everyone else.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Game of the decade? If this had been in 2021, Skyrim won, because of the mods"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Witcher 3 or God of War for me
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Witcher 3. The storyline, open world and more adult side of the narrative really sold it to me. Elden Ring and BG3 would also be top notch choices. Honestly, these three would just be the top contenders from this list and I don’t think you can go wrong with any of them. Part of BG3 for me though may also be recency bias."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Breath of the Wild got me through a very hard period in my life, it was sort of a video game therapy or meditation for me, so that would be up there but I’m currently playing Sekiro for the first time and it is the best video game I have ever played, not only this decade but in my lifetime."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,I'd give it to witcher 3
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Someone scan all the answer and repot back in 2 days.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Witcher 3 for me, I've never been so engrossed and lost in a fantasy world

I love Larian, I've played their games since original Divine Divinity, both Original Sin 2 and BG3 are 10/10s for me. But the personal journey you go in Witcher 3, the characters, the world building, the sheer attention to detail CDPR put into that game was insane and something we hadn't seen (to that level of detail and scale) yet and the 2 master piece DLC's it got that were their owns games im their own right? For just £15??!! Legendary game

To be fair, I think Baldurs Gate 3 is also a legendary game, it's the new Wutcher 3 I  terms if it's innovation in a stagnant market, but Witcher 3 wins for me because I care more about the Witcher universe than I do Dungeons & Dragons and I actively dislike Wizards if the Coast"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,2016 must’ve been a really bad year for games lmao 
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Bit confused, wasn’t there a fallout 4 goty edition? Was that 2015 same as Witcher 3? We’re they just chosen by different publications?"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,I think it’s safe to say overwatch isn’t going to win anything
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Idk, I haven't played any of those."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Skyrim even tho it isn’t on this list
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Wait a minute. It takes two was 2021 GOTY?? 😂 like its great, but its not MINDBLOWING"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"To me, Game of the Decade would be more about which game had the biggest impact on the industry- and not the “Best” game. Recency bias seems like it’s playing a large part in people saying BG3 and Elden Ring- but both in my opinion didn’t have as big of an impact as something like BotW did. I could be wrong on that though and I’m sure someone could tell me why."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"I had way more fun on Elden Ring than on BoTW, haven't played the rest lol"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"It is actually unbelievable that a game as bad as Overwatch WON GOTY, that was the biggest slap in the face to every other actually good game that's ever been nominated"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,The Witcher 3
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Witcher 3, for the obvious reasons but also because we haven’t seen the end of it yet and the game is almost 10 years old. The update a couple years ago was massive, you play it today and it still compares to today’s games. Not just that, but they’re releasing a new “mod editor” and the potential seems endless. I’m not the most tech savvy but from my understanding the community will be able to create practically any content they can think of. New story lines, foursome with the crones of crookback bog, new challenges, etc. 

If it were a contest of just the game at release, I don’t think that W3 would win to be fair."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Gaming moves so fast that would be an unworkable category. It would go to the one of the most recent couple of games of the year, or to a close runner up if there was a lot of resentment. It would never go to a game that was actually 10 years old"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"The fact that Witcher 3 is a decade old and still regarded so highly says a lot, so that's a winner to me. And while I personally do not enjoy Elden Ring, it's high regard amongst fans and the influence it has in modern game design cannot be overstated either. It would have to be one of these two, for sure."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"As it is now, I would say CP77 is the best game released in the past 10 years."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"The Witcher 3, hands down"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"for me its down to BoTW, ER and the Witcher."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Engagement post
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Zelda BOTW or Red Dead Redemption
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,W3
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Breath of the Wild for me. It perfectly balanced the mundane, empty, quiet moments between epic adventure. Really subtle touch from Nintendo that I think a lot of games can learn from."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,It’s Elden Ring and only Sekiro and Witcher 3 are close. Also hilarious God of War won over RDR2.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Elden Ring for me, a few good options between breath of the wild and baldurs gate 3 but the addictive gameplay, unprecedented feeling of freedom and the incredible art style of Elden Ring push it over the top for me. Plus the others have things working against them. BG3 for example was incredible but I don’t think it was totally finished or evenly quality all the way through."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,My pick would be God of War. It is my favorite game series of all time so I am biased. Elden Ring would be a close second.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Out of all of these it goes to either Elden Ring or God of Waf
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Either elden ring or bg3 IMO. They're the peak of their genres. They both attracted people who've never been Into those games which is pretty special considering one is really difficult and the other turn based which are both harder to get into
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"I'd rather do these decades and have a discussion about which takes the year, and which takes the decade. 


2010-2019


2000-2009


1990-1999


1980-1989"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,I'm not sure what it says about me that the only game on this list I've played is Overwatch and I didnt play it very much. I preferred Team Fortress 2.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Witcher 3 or BOTW. I'm not a big Zelda guy but those games tend to get a lot of love from a broad audience. BG3 and Elden Ring might be superior games arguably but they have a narrower appeal, so they wouldn't likely win."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"I believe that-as much as I love Elden ring-the Witcher 3 deserves that title. It’s such a vast game in a thousand minute, tailored ways that continues to surprise even today."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,You guys sure it's not overwatch??
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"BG3, Witcher 3, Elden Ring

These 3 are the pinnacle of video games in this decade 

If these 3 fights for GOTD? Then we will have a long ass discussion 

If i really really need to pick one? Then Witcher 3. That game was revolutionary in 2014"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,TW3
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"each game on this list seems to redefine what we expect from their genres. zelda's open-world approach felt like a new chapter in gaming, much like a good book that's hard to put down. baldur's gate 3’s nod to classic rpg elements shows some things remain timeless in appeal."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Witcher 3 is glazed af. Elden ring wins too easily. It has actual good game play unlike god of war or Witcher
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Oh my god, It Takes Two won GOTY? It was somewhat fun but it’s nowhere near the caliber of the rest of this list, wtf???

Every other game on this list is so good."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,The Witcher 3
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Elden Ring is the one game on this list that I'd wish to experience with fresh eyes
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Bg3, zelda or elden ring"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Elden ring or BG3 probably take it
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Not to sound like a contrarian, but TW3 is probably the most overrated game of all time. It’s a solid game, but I have no idea how people can honestly say it’s the best game of all time. I’d I had to choose from the list it’d either go to BG3 or Elden ring though."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,It's Elden Ring and it isn't even THAT close let's be real.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Seeing Overwatch on this list is like seeing a spot of mold on some otherwise pristine bread. 

As for my answer, I didn’t even play past the first quarter if W3, but is hard to argue with the impact it’s had."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Elden ring
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"It’s crazy that the game I think might actually be the best game of the last decade, RDR2, isn’t on here. That being said, probably Elden Ring, it’s insanely good"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Toss a GOTD'y to your witcher...
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,tender punch price edge innate doll consist ossified desert sparkle
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,For me BOTW or Witcher 3
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Probably witcher 3 for the decade you have posted. For the one before it would be between skyrim, minecraft, or gta 5 probably."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Witcher 3
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,It'd come down to the wire between Elden Ring and BG3.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Not Overwatch thats for sure
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Witcher 3
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"It’d be down to BG3 and Elden Ring. I think God of War and Witcher 3 would also be there, but I’m not sure if they would win. 

My personal favorite game of all time is Sekiro, but BG3 and ER have a way bigger impact that I feel is necessary to win something like this"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,It Takes Two? There weren’t any better games that year??
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,2016 must have been a rough year for Overwatch to win💀 Dark Souls 3 clears it by a landslide
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"I can honestly say, I have only played BOTW from this whole list. But from all that I've read here and other gaming subs, BG3 and the Witcher 3 would dominate."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Love it takes two. Masterpiece.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,The only game on this list that won every single game of the year award.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,There’s a ton of games on here I would not push back against. But it should be Breath of the Wild. It changed what we knew was possible with open worlds. Most games at the time were doing open world because it was the hit new thing. Nintendo pushed open worlds to a new level. I think it says A LOT when a game has as many imitators as BotW.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Witcher 3 or Baldurs gate 3, most of the games on this list didn't revolutionise much, but they mostly perfected them. 

Witcher 3 and Baldurs gate pushed the limits of what we thought was possible in gaming at those times. 

Much love for elden ring, GOW and dragon age, platted all of these games, but they pale in comparison to the effects felt in gaming by those two."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Overwatch. It was truly a game changer when it released. But Overwatch as it was when it won. Not as it’s now.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,How TF did overwatch make that list.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,2021 must have beem a slow year for games.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Elden Ring. 

It’s truly baffling how people hold botw so high. It copied the same decades old open world formula and managed to make it worse.  The massive world is nothing but seeds and shrines. It is boring. No dungeons. All repetitive shrines. And that awesome weapon durability system! So fun. 

I guess maybe it was the first open world game for a lot of people."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Gonna have to go older and say fallout 3
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Halo 2. 
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Elden Ring for me is the best game in this list. I’ve never been able to experience Witcher 3 since my steam version refuses to work and BG3 is great but doesn’t beat Elden Ring. Also, Overwatch? What?"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,It's Baldurs Gate 3 and Elden Ring and i don't think anyone else is that close. Witcher 3 is 3rd I think but there's a gap. Both ER and BG3 changed the game.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"2014 to 2024 is a weird decade marker but okay. From that list... well first you have to decide on what makes something a ""Game of the Decade."" I would say it's a game that has an impact on the medium, something that inspires other games, for good or ill, and becomes a point of reference for gaming culture as a whole. More importantly, one that stands the test of time. 

First thing is cut the last three games. It takes a minute for impact to be felt, and they need to shimmer a while longer. Though I do except Elden Ring and Balder's Gate 3 to cement themselves as masterpieces. They remain defining games of the current generation, and have elevated story, characters, boss fights, combat,  acting, and just everything they do as a whole.

But anyway from that list the answer is Breath of the Wild and it's not close. I am not saying Breath of the Wild is the best game on that list. But it had a cataclysmic impact on gaming. It changed open world games. Probably forever. And it is a point of comparison to everything even a little like it since. It propelled the Switch to blockbuster status (the Switch actually had an amazing first year but Zelda was the system seller, the other games just keep the hype going). We are still discussing it right now. Even after Tears of the Kingdom. Breath of the Wild isn't for everyone, and even a lot of people in this thread are down on it, but that's also important and helps make it great. No great game as universal appeal and go game with universal appeal is great (or exists even...)."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Borderlands 2
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Did not play all of those so I don’t feel completely qualified… but Elden Ring was hands down the most incredible adventure I’ve ever played. Gorgeous. Challenging. Mysterious. So epic. So id have to pick that
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,I don’t love the game personally but realistically I think the winner would be The Witcher 3.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,It's between Elden Ring and BG3 for me
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Hot take, but I think 2016 era Overwatch might be my pick here. It truly was the best multiplayer experience I’ve ever had. If we’re including OW2, then no fucking way, and my vote would probably go to BG3."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Honestly I would say that would be between BoTW or BG3. They both really did change gaming. Well I at least want BG3 to change gaming.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Botw easily. Best game of all time
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"As a game it'd have to be Elden ring or Baldurs gate depending on if you prefer gameplay or storytelling, but I have to give major respect to Breath of the wild, it was a magical experience and truly influenced a new era of open world games, even if it got destroyed in pretty much every single aspect I can think of by Tears of the Kingdom"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Skyrim
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,I think Elden Ring is the one I would vote for
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"The Witcher 3 made CDPR the giant that it is today. Cyberpunk was such an emotional rollercoaster from release to its expansion because of how high the expectations have been set for them. The Witcher show exists because of CDPR. Other RPG games have tried to copy their formula for success - namely the Assassin’s Creed games starting with Origin. Of all the games in the past decade, TW3 is the one with the most influence on its genre, and it’s the one that holds up the best today in terms of content and quality for how much money it costs (you can get the GOTY edition for like $15 on Steam for like half of any given year). Absolutely my pick.

Next would probably be Baldur’s Gate 3. They set a new high standard for games similarly to TW3. I don’t know if it will necessarily be as influential in terms of gameplay (the D&D format is quite particular and unique) but it set a high bar for the next decade like TW3 did for the past decade."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Elden Ring usurped BotW for my personal best of all time….so those 2 for sure. BG3 had me for a few hundred hours, and then likely Sekiro."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"I just love The Witcher 3. Its world was painful and bleak, ppl living there had a terrible life, but most importantly I felt it. How many games can make you care about secondary missions?"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"As much as I'd like to say Elden Ring, Witcher 3 has actually held up for the majority of the decade, truly an excellent game. My answers changing to Elden Ring after the DLC drops"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Breath pf the wild
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,It's funny that overwatch is an option
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Elden Ring.

BG3, Witcher 3, BOTW, GOW and Sekiro is also absolutely fantastic.

But Elden Ring is THE fantasy game. It is what I have always dream of in my childhood. This vast, big and magical world that I can explore. 

I doubt anything could surpassed Elden Ring for me."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Top 5 for me is easily Elden Ring,BG3,GOW,Breath Of The Wild,and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. Not in that particular order. Those 5 games are in a league of their own and are almost unmatchable. It really comes down to personal preference which one you like better."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"It’s Witcher 3 without a doubt.  I don’t know how to explain it but we haven’t completely felt the impact of a few of those games, but the Witcher 3 has had such an impact since it came out.  Look what it spawned, the new fans it brought to the books, etc.  a couple of the other games have potential to win who’s down the road, but right now, game of the decade, Witcher 3."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,I haven’t played a few of the games here including Witcher 3 but I would probably have to say Elden ring with God of war and Bg3 close behind
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Bloodborne.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Has to be the Witcher for me.

I can feel myself building up to a 3rd play through."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Elden Ring >Zelda >BG3 for me
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Breath of the Wild is genuinely one of my favourite games of all time, you can play it for 5 minutes and accidentally have 5 hours pass

Also, within the last 10 years I think it’s definitely been *the* most influential game for the industry as a whole"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Witcher 3 for me. It's so good you can make an argument that the Blood and Wine DLC could be GOTY when that was released.

As for the other heavy hitters BG3 last act let it down and for me Elden Ring outstayed it's welcome. 

Would Witcher 3 contend for the reverse game of the decade from 2005-2015?"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"If I'm being objective as possible, it should be Breath of the Wild. Every other game on this list is essentially an interation on an established genre. Good genres and good executions of those genres, but BotW *revolutionized* the open world format."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,So many amazing games in that list but Elden Ring is best followed by Witcher 3 then BG3 in third.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Games that impacted the most would be The Legend of Zelda, God of War, and Baldurs Gate 3

World Building and map in the legend of zelda, the ""freedom"" it gives you towards advancing in the game, god of war for the story and the way is told the one shot camera in the whole game, and Baldurs Gate for the hummongous amount of ways and personalization towards the way a player can react not only in gameplay but in story.

I dont put From Software games because i think each one of them has keep getting better since Dark Souls

and i Think from the decade of the 2000s Dark Souls, would be a stronger contestant."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Whichever one has the largest voting fanbase.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Witcher 3 is my game of the decade at least,"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Reading this list reminded me of the time Overwatch was the undisputed king. How the mighty have fallen.

That being said, Elden Ring or The Witcher 3. I didn’t find BG3 fun but can respect it being a well put together game."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Oooh, man, that's a noodle scratcher! Trying to think objectively (very hard) about these entries, it's still a toss up for me between God of War, BotW, and The Witcher 3. Each one has very strong points going for it and, in my opinion, each game stands out as a turning point of some kind for either the studio that produced it or the platform it was on, or both.

The Witcher 3 vaulted CDProjekt into the main stream and gave them a reputation.

God of War was an irrefutable masterpiece of storytelling, music composition, and graphical leaps for the Playstation.

Breath of the Wild was Nintendo's conquered mountain, both managing to reinvent a legendary franchise without pissing off the fanbase.

How do you pick?!"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Sekiro is my pick for story games and it’s not even close, the only other story game on there that I enjoyed even half as much is It Takes Two and while it was good, it definitely wasn’t game of the decade.

  Overwatch definitely got the most hours out of me, but it’s hard to compare a competitive pvp game with a single player story. I think overwatch might win just on innovation and popularity mixed together. Sekiro, it takes two, overwatch and breath of the wild are the only games in the list that don’t just follow their established formula but do it slightly better."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Still can’t believe Starfield didn’t win last year /s
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Elden ring and if DLC delivers really well it will achieve Legendary status across history
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,witcher 3
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Mmmm in my opinion BG3 and Witcher, maybe zelda even if i did not play it. I should play dragon age of speak bout it."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"All of these games are great, but witcher 3 is the only one I could imagine playing again.   Maybe just because enough time has passed, even the idea of a replay of elden ring, for example, makes me feel tired."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Breath of the wild, pretty easily."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Bg3 or Witcher
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"“Game of the Decade” would have to be 2010-2019 though and then 2020-2029

So for me 2010-2019 Botw
So far 2020-2029 Elden Ring"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"None. GotY is nothing but a meaningless, giant advertisement."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Elden Ring. Not even remotely close.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Breath of the Wild
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Witcher 3
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"It sounds like it's a three way split between TW3, ER and BG3. As someone who is a diehard fromsoft fan since the days of Demons Souls, even I have to admit that BG3 is the single best game I've ever played. Never have I ever felt like a developer did everything in their power to deliver the best experience ever."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Close between bg3 and Elden ring
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"My personal pick would probably be BotW. But knowing the industry, I would guess that they'd go with The Last of Us Part 2, and this sub would be *livid* about it"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,BG3 or Witcher 3
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Sekiro.

The clinking of swords stays with you long after you finish the game. It changes you."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Left4Dead. Easy.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"For me BG3. 

I've played most but only finished that and TLou2.

 Elden ring was the first FS i played and didn't complete, the linearity of the game apparently makes a difference to me in the formula, I ended up preferring Lies of P in design."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Based on sheer popularity it would probably be BG3 or Elden Ring. And as much as I'd like to say it's BG3 I'm thinking Elden Ring takes it.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Ghost of Tsushima was robbed. But Elden Ring and BG3 would be walking hand in hand for game of the decade.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"You see this is a tricky for me there's games that are pure complete packages games that far exceed in what they deliver for those I'd have to choose either The Witcher 3 or Baldurs gate 3 

But then there's games that took Gamers and the internet by storm, games that literally everyone was talking about even non gamers and for that I have to pick either Overwatch or Breath of the wild 

So it is really difficult to pick but overall I think I probably would have to say Baldurs gate 3 the sheer ammount of GAME you get for the price is just so incredible I'm so excited to see what Larian studios cook up next"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Elden Ring
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"The Witcher 3,  however i still have to do BG3 and Elden ring."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"When I think about lasting impact, BotW really stands out to me on this list."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Im surprised most people don't mention Botw. Most mention BG3 but I feel like there is still too much recency Bias. I feel like Botw is atleast in the Top 3 of this list gameplay wise but it also had a huge influence on the whole gaming Industry and the gaming landscape would be different nowadays with botw. The other games on this list didnt have nearly a similar impact
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,The one with the largest fanbase.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Never played it, but Witcher 3, I have not heard anything but good things about it. Sounds like it set a high standard quite early."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Is it bad i’ve only ever played sekiro? and i just bought it the other day… I want to play all these games now, i haven’t heard of most of them 👀"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,I'd vote Witcher 3
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"How on earth Witcher 3 gets *this* much love, it’s beyond my comprehension."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,BG3
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Elder Ring.

it’s contender for Game of the Century."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Probably Breath of the Wild, easily. 

I don't even like it. But it's formula for open world design and systems has been copied into the ground, through the Earth, and into China where we also get waifu gacha trash modeled after it."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"My personal choice is Sekiro because its gameplay is something I can't get from other games and it always makes me come back.

  
But it'd probably be either Elden Ring or BOTW. I haven't played BG3 so I can't speak for its quality but I enjoyed playing both of these open world games. I think BOTW would be my choice since it was the game that influenced Elden Ring, giving it more of a presence."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"lets be real, It's Baldurs gate, it has something for literally every conceivable person that plays it given enough time."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,BotW for me. I couldn’t really tell why but the combat felt really tedious with Witcher and I ended up avoiding any fights if I can and started to mow down main quests towards the end.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"It says something about the diversity of the medium that I've been a PC gamer for all of those years, yet I've only played one game on the lost, Witcher 3, and hated it. And I mean I've played for 500+ hours every year.

I know I'll play BG3 eventually, just haven't gotten around to it yet. And the original Dragon Age was amazing, but the sequel kinda sucked, so I skipped Inquisition."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"for my money, it's gotta be elden ring.

I had attempted a souls style game once in my life and kinda hated it. my expectations were incredibly low.

it felt like I spent a WEEK or two in that game before even scratching the surface of what I was doing -- and not in a bad way at all. 

breath of the wild is close,  but simply doesn't have the replayability factor of elden ring imo.

witcher 3 is third for me simply because I wasn't able to put a ton of time into it. the time I did spend in it was incredibly fun."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I'm going to cause controversy for saying this but BotW was not that good...

Yes it was exceptional for a Zelda game but what let it down was the lack of any developed story. It was the same OMG SAVE PRINCESS PLSSSS from the 1980s and 1990s that Nintendo did for their older titles. It was otherwise beautiful, amazing presentation, slick gameplay but the under cooked story and lack of modern additions like full voice acting really damped my experience. 

I did however play it for the first time only a few months ago and I know it was developed for the Wii U which may not have been able to handle a full cinematic experience but for the budget it had I found the old school text lazy rather than quaint.

It's why BotW falls below games like Red Dead 2, Witcher 3 and GTA V which are it's open world peers."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Elden Ring for me. It got me back into gaming, same for a lot of my friends. Haven’t been so into a game in at least a decade"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Bg3 no contest
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Well overwatch isn’t even a game anymore
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Elden ring and witcher 3 kinda fry everything else
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,It would have to be baldurs gate 3
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Between It Takes Two and Baldurs Gate 3 in my opinion.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Imagine it WOULD be BotW, but SHOULD be The Witcher 3."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Witcher 3
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,BotW or Witcher 3. Absolute masterpieces.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Seeing overwatch in this list is wild in today's context lol

I'd say it would have to go to either BG3 or elden ring, and I don't honestly believe there's a close third (as much as I enjoyed pretty much all of these games)."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,It’s still insane to me that Overwatch won GOTY over Dark Souls 3
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,BG3 or Elden Ring. Theyre in their own league
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Either BoTW or Witcher 3, I'm leaning towards the Witcher though because it's impact is more felt than BoTW even now"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Elden ring baby
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,#BG3 easily
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I really need to get on BG3. If I can make myself stop playing ER. 
Lots of heavy hitters in your list, tbh. I think DA:I, while a good game, doesn’t compete well with others, at least for me. By the time I reached hissing wastes, I was really just forcing myself to complete the game."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I’m gonna be the devil’s advocate and say Overwatch. Yes I know, I get it and understand their major flaws over the years, but recently it’s picking up again, and no multiplayer shooter hits quite like it. Give it a try"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Regarding Indie Games, for me it’s Stardew, Hades, Hollow Knight and Rimworld."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Baldur’s Gate 3
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Easily the witcher 3, it was the first witcher thing I saw. I didn't like the trailers initially, I thought the magic looked weird.

But completely on a whim I decided to try the 1st witcher game and though it is very different from 2 and 3, I enjoyed it. Quickly moved through 2 then 3 released and I was in awe of how great it was, and how amazing CDprojektRed treated that game. 
It was the first time I'd seen side quests so well entwined with the main story and how some of the side quests could have been other games main mission. Not even to mention the amazing DLCs that captured the world of the witcher which by the time they came out I had read through all of the books.

Finally, they are also now updating it nearly 10 years after it came out, to improve modding."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"BG3
It Takes Two"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Damn, not seeing Morrowind here ages me tangibly."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Botw
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Top 4 are BG3, Zelda, Witcher, and Elden Ring. That one is easy for me, even though I could never get into the Witcher.

But #1? Fuck, I don't know. Either BG3 or Elden Ring. 

I think I have to give it to Elden Ring."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Of that list, Sekiro is my personal favourite. That said I don't think it should be 'game of the decade' when compared to some on this list.  
The only ones whose impact was grand and tangible enough to be felt across the gaming landscape would be The Witcher 3, Elden Ring and Baldur's Gate 3, the last of which I'm still not sure to what extent it's impact will be felt.  
The Witcher 3 was Skyrim-esque in the way it rolled over the larger gaming community's conscious. Elden Ring benefited greatly from a wave meme culture that hyped the game up so much that it became global news and reached many that it would never otherwise have reached. It also came at a time when gaming as a hobby was spiking during the pandemic. Baldur's Gate 3 is a triumph of game development, especially for non 'AAA' companies. It has raised the bar on what gaming can be and people hope, has elevated what gaming is as a whole."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,First off that’s now how we do decades. 100% game of the decade for the 2010s is Minecraft.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Breath of the wild or Witcher 3. You cannot pick a game to be “game of the decade” when it’s less than 2 years old (looking at you BG3 and Elden ring). Let’s see in 2 years time if these games still hold up.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I would say the competition will be between Baldur's Gate 3, Elden Ring and LoZ: Breath of the Wild. 

Witcher 3 and Sekiro are strong contenders too but if we're looking at the overall package, those 3 are definitely above the others."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Winner: dark souls
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"2000-2009: Halo CE, it walked where other shooters would run. A lot of the features introduced  here are still used in the fps genre today; add on that it is still a fantastic game today that has held up in terms of playability and performance 

2010-2019: Breath of the Wild, this game defined the Switch, to the point people forget it also released on Wii-U, this is definitely a generation defining game

2020-Present: Baldur's Gate 3, a journey back to when games were complete upon release, an epic story, and immersive gameplay. Need I say more?"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Witcher 3 or Botw
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Witcher 3 is the game of the 2010s and likely baldurs gate 3 could be the game of the 2020s. I personally would say baldurs gate on this list, but it’s undeniable that the legs Witcher 3 had. Still a good game today"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Witcher 3, It Takes 2, I really feel like I'm forgetting about a good one. 

Deus Ex and Skyrim would get my vote for the last two decades though."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Probably Elden ring, the impact that has is unmatched. I think Witcher 3 is the best on the list though."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Not that this game wasn't a success, but I feel like Kingdom Come: Deliverance is wildly underrated and deserved GOTY if not GOTD."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I'd give it to Sekiro, no questions asked. Combat in that game feels like a culmination of all action games before it. It doesn't need the mayhem, it's just you and another virtual dude, locking swords. Then it expands this concept to bigger and bigger challenges. Gawd is that game something else."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Controversially: Inquisition.  I don’t find the rest of the list all that enjoyable and Inquisition is my favourite game ever.  

Though, if you had included Control for 2019 instead of Sekiro, I would have at least had to give Control a brief thought.  That game was a treat.  "
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Elden Ring for me, but these are all fantastic games"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Okay but how was fallout 4 beaten by whicher 3? They were on Crack in 2015
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,I feel like BG3 would be the winner here.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I think it's BOTW, and it's not even close."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Fucking hell except a few it feels like choosing your favorite child.

To me it would be BOTW. Taking a 30 year old legendary series and revamping it that deep takes guts. And they landed it completely.

Other side of the coin, the easy to take off are DA and OW. DA was good, but left no legacy it feels like, nobody is talking about it 10 years later... And overwatch is trashed by the mess it became."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,GOT
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"BG3, Witcher 3, BotW are the only competitors there. 

Imo probably Witcher 3, but BG3 could win it on recency bias."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"With the GotY, I like to think that the winners tend to be games we still discuss months, even years after they're picked. It's hard to think in terms of years with recent games, but we still talk about stuff like Elden Ring even now.

Starting from the oldest, no one really talks about Dragon age anymore, but Witcher 3? It's always on people's minds."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"1. The Witcher 3
2. GoW
3. Baldur’s Gate 3
4. BotW 

I’m not sure the others even make my Top 10 games of the decade, but Elden Ring is probably close."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Realistically, RDR2 and cyberpunk are the most likely winners, just judging by the number of copies sold. This is if you don’t count gta5 in, then it’s definitely game of the decade"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Witcher 3 clears

**super smash bros announcer voice**:  NO CONTEST!"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I'd like to nominate rock, paper, scissors."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Dragon age was AMAZING at the time of release. But compared to BG3… arg.  Still dragon age franchise for the win!
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Overwatch was awesome when it first came out. A completely free shooter with all the characters unlocked. It looked simplistic because of the Disney esq charm and bright color palette, but it's depth was surprising."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Breath of the Wild

Wait, what would win or what would I pick?

I think Elden Ring would win, but I would pick Breath of the Wild."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Witcher 3 IMO, It really pushed the genre for what to expect out of meaningful side quests and excellent writing and storytelling. Some of the side quests were more memorable then the actual main story. Combat was fun. Upgrades and diversity felt impactful. Had to approach monsters with some thought and prep work instead of a mindless hack and slash. The voice acting was superb. To this day Witcher 3 has yet to have a true contender. Not to mention the DLC were arguably better then the base game."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,It takes two won game of the year? That piece of shit game? Wow.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,The Witcher. It beat fallout 4 and fallout 4 would probably be GOTY over any other winners except maybe dragon age or bg3. Not to mention there are a few winners on here that shouldn’t even been GOTY yet still are
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,BG3 would win because it's the most recent
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"BG3 won pretty much every single game of the year award out there. The only one I think really competes and had somewhat as big of an impact is the Witcher 3. Sooo yeah probably BG3, but Witcher 3 is possible."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,I think the Witcher 3 would win probably because of its influence in the industry
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"It never got GOTY, but Cyberpunk 2077 in its current state is the best game of the decade"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,This looks like a pure RPG list but my favorite non multiplayer game for that decade would have to be XCOM 2: WoTC Edition. I have over 1000 hours put into 2
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Elden Ring and it’s not close.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Baldurs Gate comfortably.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,WTF is It Takes Two? Was I asleep that year?
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I'm seeing almost no mentions of It Takes Two, which tracks.. I don't know if I've seen gameplay of it, let alone heard anything about it. What was it against that it got GOTY?"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,I don't think we'll see anything as huge as Elden Ring in a long time.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,BG3 and Elden Ring are the only two that would be a tight race for winning that title. The rest are good but there are levels to this shit.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,BotW just barely edging out Elden Ring
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Dragon Age inquisition does not deserve to be on that list lol
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Baldur’s Gate 3 hands down. Runner up to CDPR, despite being a bit rough around the edges with Witcher 3. There’s just so much that Larian did right with BG3, they really made a passion project for the fans!"

1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Bg3 absolutely wins
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Witcher 3 was 2015? Fuck me
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I have played all these games (except Dragon Age), and for me it is Elden Ring by a mile."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,hades was my favorite of that time
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I've only played a few of these games but based on what friends say and online it's between BG3, BOTW, and Elden Ring"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"They would give it to BotW because it always has to be a Zelda. Is rather see BG3, pc games rarely get the recognition."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Of your list, so far in the 20s, I say BG3 or ER. In the 10s, maybe GoW."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Gotta say, the Witcher 3 is hands down the winner here. What other game has inspired so many gamers?"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Elden Ring or BotW.

I think BG3 is objectively the best but I don't think being the best is necessarily what wins you game of the decade. ER and BotW were grander experiences, I guess."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Personally Sekiro is my favorite of them, but probably Elden Ring or BotW"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Witcher
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,The witcher 3
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Fuck, I've never played any of them.

I do at least own two of them though."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,no offense but why isn’t skyrim on the op list? 🥺🥺
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Sekiro
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Bg3 Witcher 3 or botw
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"TIL BoTW fans actually believe that the game ""redefined"" the open world genre."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"""Which GOTY winner would win 'Game of the Decade' and why is it The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt."""
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Elden ring. BG3 is too niche of a title imo
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Game of the

80s Pac Man

90s Doom

00s Civilization 

10s Minecraft 

20s Cyberpunk"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Elden ring without a doubt for me.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Baldur's Gate 3. In what has been called one of the best years in gaming ever, BG3 dominated every single award ceremony and became the first game to win all major GOTY awards in history. The level of passion, work and quality that this game has is nothing short of incredible. BG3 has been called game of the decade by many since it released because it raised the bar for the whole video game industry like no game before it. The cultural impact that this game has had outshines any other without question."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Monster Hunter World Iceborne was truly the game of the year of the decade of all time imo
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"So in theory, this would be two categories. The 2010 decade and the 2020 decade.

The 2020 one has another 6 winners yet to show, but BG3 is a tough act to follow.

The 2010 category seems like Breath of the Wild as a solid choice, but there's 4 years of games unaccounted for, so the actual winner could be from there."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,BOTW or BG3 probably
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Witcher 3. It took me 4 or 5 times to get into it. When I finally ""clicked"" I couldn't stop playing it, and I played it on Switch.
It really says something when a game almost a decade old still does things better than most."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"For me, it's Elden Ring. No real contest.

Baldur's Gate is very good, but I don't think I can grind it all out myself. I got it to play with friends and by the end of it we started getting tired of it.

Witcher 3 is good, but I don't know how invested in the world I am. I played it because it was new to me, but once I beat it I wasn't driven to play again.

Breath of the Wild is a fantastic open world with basically none of the things that make Zelda, Zelda. Zelda is my favorite franchise, but I don't like botw due to how much they changed the formula."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Witcher three or botw I think
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,A lot of these are very good for their time but I don't think any can hold up to Baldur's Gate or Elden Ring. It's between those two for me.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Gta5 wins 2010s
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"As much as I want to say it takes 2, Elden ring or Bg3. both were phenomenal and absolute game changers in the industry, more so than anything else here in my opinion."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Witcher 3 no contest.  

Would have said Elden Ring if I hadn’t already played through like every single souls game a billion times over, kinda made ER feel more like playing a rhythm game. Map is beautiful though. "
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I think Skyrim has proven to be the most played game, period. And since it came out over a decade ago, it is fair to say it fits the criteria well."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Witcher 3 for me, and I have played it so far 40 hours. Aiming for much, much more."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Good to see Witcher 3 getting plenty of love.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"For me 00-09 is Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, 10-19 is probably The Witcher 3"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Seeing these games and their release years is doing something crazy to my sense of time, Covid was fucking crazy"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I had a feeling that it would be Baldurs Gate 3.

I haven't even played it yet, but it's the first thing that comes to mind when I read ""Game of the Decade"""
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Botw would be Witcher in the finals and Elden ring would beat bg3 but it would be closer.

Botw would probably win in a 7 games series against Elden ring but every game would go to overtime"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Elden Ring and it’s a really close call with BG3 but I don’t think BG3 was as impactful as Elden Ring. Especially if the DLC is a hit (and at this point it we all probably know it is).

Alan Wake 2 deserves a spot there, it’s next level in it’s genre."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,I love a lot of these games but I haven't yet experienced another game like the witcher 3. I rank it next to Oot/MM. I feel like baulders gate 3 got really close so I doubt the witcher 3 will hold the throne forever for me. Gotta give it to the witcher 3 with BG3 in second place.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Baldur's Gate 3 is probably the best of this list, crunchy technical combat meshed with dating sim Role playing, and a great story.  

Dragons' Age: Inquisition is the worst.  I loved Dragon Age 1, even liked Dragon Age 2, but 3 is a mess."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"God man. It just has to be elden ring.

I HATE souls games and generally find them really dull and repetitive.

But oh my God elden rings hype was so large it felt like a mountain was on my back until I gave in and played it.

It was a pure masterpiece in open world adventure and action. 

The feeling of just going wherever I wanted and finding treasures and loot all over and new wonderful and horrifying enemies and places was just unmatched. 

It was also so palatable. Every game has things that won't appeal to a large portion of people. 

But elden ring was just easy enough that you could grind and explore to make up the gap and just hard enough that it kept the best players invested. 

The pvp is still going to this day.

The clips and moments are legendary. 

It's genuinely hard to not like elden ring even for the biggest critics. Like baldurs gate being turn based was a major turn off to people combined with being a crpg made it so niche that it's a miracle it was as loved as it was and most of that was the sheer budget and effort put into it. 

But elden ring was in the hands of literally everyone I knew that could buy it. And not liking it was NOT understandable. You were basically a heretic if you didn't keep playing. 

It's just gotta be elden ring. In pure scale and majesty and sheer impressive feats and moments. Nothing has ever gotten me as hyped in gaming as walking into the erd tree finally and that music coming on."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Breath of the Wild, The Witcher 3, and It Takes Two each did such unique things for gameplay and story that I think are uncontestable.

I have yet to play BG3, I hope to soon"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Probably Elden Ring, Witcher 3, or BG3. I'd go Elden Ring personally."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I feel like Zelda generated the most clones/Botw looking games, so I’d go with it as having the biggest effect"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Elden Ring and I don't think it's close.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"BG3 no contest. Elden Ring would have been my answer before I played BG3.


BotW and TotK were over-rated IMO. Good, and easily the best Zelda games I've ever played. But still Zelda, and honestly if it weren't for the legacy and the name recognition those games would not be treated like they were. If you took that exact same game and named the main characters something other than Link, Zelda, and Ganon, nobody would have cared about the games."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"If there was such an award, I imagine the criteria would be something along the lines of “what defined this decade? Was game shows off how far the medium has come?” For that reason it’s GoW for its story telling and gameplay, or BG3 for the acting, scale, and player choice."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"BG3 or Elden Ring for me but I would lean BG3 because it pretty much revolutionized CRPGs in modern gaming.

Damn I missed BOTW down there lol… I would put that up there as well because I think it really brought the whole sandbox experience to the mainstream."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"On balance, it has to go to Witcher 3."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Baldurs Gate 3 would clear the list. Put 90 hours into that game and tell me it’s not better than all the others. And I’ve played all of them. While all these games are phenomenal…none of these games have the sheer depth, options, and storylines that BG3 has. The game is different every time you play it depending on what you do…and it’s not hard to make the game completely different."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Witcher 3 I guess...
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I feel like Elden ring is a hot take, but Elden ring is my vote"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Baldurs Gate 3
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I’d say elden ring. Now it was the souls series that basically spawned a new genre, yes, but this is the peak of that genre, full stop. FromSoft deserves their flowers imo. Elden ring took the souls formula and turned it up to 11 in the fantastical sense of the world and exploration while retaining all the qualities souls vets love, even though this is the easiest souls like fromsoft game by a mile, it pleases old fans while making the game accessible to newcomers."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Botw was the most pure gaming fun I’ve had in my adult life
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Bg3. Most fun game I have ever played tbh
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,ITT: People like games with sex.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Cyberpunk 2077. 

I never really had the issues a lot of others did, and I fell in love with the characters. The main plot is a short sprint, not a long slog, but it's the experience of exploring the world and making yourself felt that pulls you in. 

I felt it was a masterclass on feeling like I was part of a larger world, seeing how my actions changed things."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Zelda, elden ring, or baldurs gate 3. Witcher 3 is probably up there for a lot of people, but I never got the hype"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Skyrim
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Objectively, I have to say Witcher 3."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Of this list I will only go with the games I have played

1) It Takes 2

2) Sekiro

3) Elden Ring

4) God of War

5) Witcher 3

6) Overwatch

It takes 2 is one of my favourite experiences in gaming ever. It just does things so differently and playing together with someone on this wild adventure where things are constantly changing up in the gameplay department is incredible. It was a perfect game to me. Sekiro is great, one of the best melee combat systems of any game ever. I loved the final boss. Elden Ring is about as good as Sekiro to me. The open world exploration is fantastic and the boss designs are excellent. Both of these games aren't perfect though. God of War comes after and I loved the story of this game, but found some of the combat elements to be repetitive or stupidly difficult on higher difficulties. The balance of the game was a little all over the place. Witcher 3 is probably one of the greatest games I'll never finish. I've picked it up 4 times now, loved every moment, put it down to play something else and by the time I come back I start again. While I love the storytelling in this game, I don't necessarily love the world or combat as much so that might be it. I also find the size of the world very intimidating. Overwatch is a brilliant multiplayer game, but it didn't quite have enough content in the gameplay department and it's level of monetization always made it more to a free to play game in terms of how it felt."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"As good as a lot of those other games are, The Witcher 3 takes the cake for me."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,For me it's Baldurs Gate and it isn't even close.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Baldurs gate 3 easily. At least for me I’m a goblin ass gamer who loves their fighting games and shooters and rogue likes and I sat down for 2 months to play bg3 no breaks. Elden ring was fun but I’m not the biggest souls guy and even then I think sekiro is a better more concentrated experience. God of war was fun but it’s a first party Sony game, to me they’ve become the marvel of video games like oh wow another story about family/personal trauma and healing how original and surprising."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Elden Ring for me. I appreciate the improvements and polish from over a decade of souls games. It is like DS, bloodborne and sekiro were building blocks for making Elden Ring."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"If we were closer to when BG3 first released, I would say that hands down. I was convinced that it was going to set new expectations for what is acceptable from a major title, but the AAA devs are insistent on acting like BG3 was an anomaly and isn't something realistically attainable. I'm hoping that Larian proves them wrong with their next projects, but even then big devs will try to sweep it under the rug like it's not a big deal."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Given how big overwatchs launch was I think it would be that.

Not that current ow is good but numbers dont lie"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,No GTAV? Are you stupid?
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Sekiro is the cleanest game on here, period. The best game I’ve ever played. It’s not the grandest, it’s not the most expansive, but godamn if it isn’t the best gaming experience of my life."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"BOTW

If Bloodborne won over W3 i would have a different answer."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Witcher 3 was one of the best gaming experiences I’ve ever had. Misery, comedy, hard choices, fun combat and a feeling of earning my achievements. I think it’s one of the Crown Jewels of “games are art”"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"In my opinion, I think Witcher 3. That game defined what an RPG could be, and still today it remains the standard to which I hold other games. Even the DLC itself could be considered entire games, and each are able to provide a standard of quality that many games since then have failed to meet."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Of this particular list, baldurs gate 3. Not even a contest for #1 slot there. 

Now, if we are discussing ranks 2 thru 5, im gonna start waffling and debating with myself on who, what, why..."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Rdr2 but if I'm to choose from the list then witcher 3.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"My bias is I like games with swords, but Sekiro wins"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Elden Ring.  Easily.  I've played everything else on this list except for TLoU 2 and Elden Ring is easily the best game.  Not saying the other ones aren't good, but Elden Ring is its own realm.  And I never played more than 6 or 7 hours combined of other Soulsbornes and Elden Ring is my most played game on Steam.  BG3 is second in my opinion.  


God of War shouldn't be on this list.  I don't know how people like it besides the incredible production value and acting.  Just not great at being an actual game.  I would get so hyped to do combat, it would last two seconds and then it was more walking and talking, ad nauseum.  And it recycled so many sub bosses.  After eighteen hours I gave up."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I know that there’s a lot of people who have strong feelings either way on BG3, but I think it has to win. It is an experience that just felt so engaging and creative and collaborative (and challenging, but in a good way. It defined what a casual TTRPG experience could feel like, it had so many of my non-gamer friends just immersed and able to understand the magic that us nerds have enjoyed for decades. It felt like it had the love and depth and effort of games of old, games of a past time. But it had the modern usability and legibility required to help casual gamers really understand what was going on, and how they could experiment with the world, their characters, and the scenarios that would emerge along the way."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Breath of the Wild or Elden ring.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"BG3 I've enjoyed every playthrough, I've done it about 8 times. Most RPGs I play only once BG3 is just so fucking good it's ruined other RPGs for me."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Baldurs, hands down"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Baldurs Gate 3 for so many reasons. An insanely great story, extremely talented voice acting, numerous story decisions and paths, an extremely interactive world, dialed into the community, and a complete game at launch with no dlc or bs. They really just raised the bar in every regard when the industry has been lowering it constantly."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"What would win? Probably BotW or Witcher 3. They've aged well and probably do more to define the last generation of gaming than anything else on this list. 

For me though, it's Sekiro, no contest. It beats everything else on this list by at least a full point on a 10 point scale. Easily From's magnum opus and one of my favorite games of all time."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Elden Ring or Sekiro, for sure"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Can someone here PLEASE explain to me what was so great about BOTW? I say this as someone who’s all time favorite game is ocarina of time ever since I was a kid. I literally bought the switch just for BOTW and then returned it all after about 3 hours of gameplay. I found it extremely boring, didn’t love the mechanics, and couldn’t get into it at all. Felt like it doesn’t even come close to some others on this list or even other games like RDR2"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,I know it’s not super popular but DA Inquisition is super high on this list for me. So much great worldbuilding and hours of fun content. Not a dull moment imo. Great for its time and honestly it’s aged well. And the DLC adds great lore to the world without feeling superfluous or too long. Honestly a hugely underrated gem to me that doesn’t get nearly enough credit mostly because it’s in the EA BioWare era
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"BotW would win, mostly because games like Elden Ring exist because of it and tons of people would be hard pressed to not pick Elden ring as a contender. It's really hard to choose a of decade though because genres can be so wildly different. Like,  BG3 is what I want to think of as the winner but it's so specific of a game it doesn't compare to an action game or fps."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Seeing how far back Witcher 3 came out and it still holds up... I say Witcher.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"My god, has it really been a decade since we got a Dragon Age sequel? 🥺"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Most of these are great games, but I feel like the only two that are transcendent are Elden ring and BotW for two completely different reasons.  BotW completely reinvigorated an already GOAT game franchise that was over 30 years old and Elden Ring was the perfect culmination of a franchise 13 years in the making. BG3 and Witcher 3 would probably be 3rd and 4th respectively, but BG3 arguably doesn’t even surpass BG2 and I may be crucified for saying this, but the Witcher 3’s combat/gameplay just fall short of the other 3 (still great, but not at their level).  

Personally, I would give the nod to Elden Ring, but objectively would probably have to say BotW both because it appealed to far more players and you could argue it partially inspired aspects of Elden Ring."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Haven't played all. Just finshed BG3, and are replaying Witcher 3 right now with a new top-of-the-line gaming PC and Raytraving enabled.

Unfortunately i can't give it to Witcher 3, because the game still has some issues with occasional crashes etc. That's annoying. Prob gonna be BG3 for me. Tried Elden Ring but didn't like it. Dragon Age: Inquisition was good, but not really outstanding."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Witcher 3 for sure
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Elden Ring: no other game's dominated a whole year like that since Skyrim. 


No game's had that quality of gameplay + story + art direction + etc. etc. since Borderlands 2."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,I feel like it’s BG3
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,BOTW
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Elden Ring
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Brought to a vote, Elden Ring would probably win.

I'd say BotW would have a really good chance though. It did some real groundbreaking work, and inspired a lot of games that came after it. Plus it's a tremendously good game itself.

BG3 and Witcher 3 are also huge contenders for me. I wish Witcher 3 combat held up better in 2024, but everything else about it is still amazing."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,BG3 easy. Only game to ever win EVERY major game of the year award. Well deserved too.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,i feel like Balder’s Gate and BOTW because the series has already had a long running great history. These two games blew what we knew about these titles out of the water. If you really think about it these two games would be the ones to stick out the most not only because they are master pieces but they also already have long standing fans that will continue to stand with them for years to come. i rest my case. but the others definitely deserve all the credit they get! all are amazing but these two are on a whole other level.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Breath of the Wild IMO. I’ve beaten all of these.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Those are some good right there but to me,  the cream of the crop is Elden Ring.  It is the most amazing game I have ever played."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Elden ring is a game where this old lady has all these little boys in a room and they can’t walk bc she broke their legs and no one batted an eye. 

No one even really mentioned it. 

Everyone was too preoccupied with the tales of incest and how hard it was and the transgendered and the guy who eats shit.

Elden ring wins. 

No seriously."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Baldurs gate it ain’t even close IMO
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,It takes two? 2021 must have sucked
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Well, accounting for the fact that it would be winner *in its decade*:

I think Witcher 3 clearly takes this one.

Yeah ER and BG3 were giant hits that really marked a massive change for the respective studios and Zelda pretty put Switch on the market, but Witcher 3 was/is basically another Skyrim in terms of impact and lasting power.

That game revolutionized the open world and rpg landscape and it’s still played and bought by players today all the time. It also was the thing that created the tipping point for the show which revitalized interest in itself again.

And that’s all on top of how it was such a massive evolution on the series from the studio. How they really showed love for the fans with the DLC and next gen updates and so on.

I’m not a Witcher fan nor have I ever been able to get into the games, but even I can see it should clearly win “Game of the Decade”"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Witcher 3 for sure
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I think Cyberpunk 2077 in its current state absolutely deserves to be on this list, and I think it’s top 5 at least."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"IMO BG3, Zelda, or Elden Ring. Maybe in that order."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Elden Ring, easily"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Elden Ring, with Witcher 3 and BG3 tied for second place"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Well, The Witcher 3, I don't know a person who would not like this title and would say after playing ""Meh"" Outstanding universe and outstanding books on the basis of which an outstanding game was created.
As long as Baldurs Gate is an extremely good game, in my opinion it has second place. The rest of the titles don't even approach the two."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Witcher 3 im playing through now. I admit it's not my favorite single player game, but it's certainly withstood the test of time"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"If you take Witcher 3 with all its DLC, i would consider to give it the win. It's simply such an outstanding game as an overall experience 

It pains me though because elden ring (and sekiro) combat is so much better

And bg3 writing and voice acting is superb, and above w3

I have a hard time deciding between these 4 games

I give it to elden ring"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Breath of the Wild and Baldur’s Gate 3 are my top two.  Elden Ring is close behind though.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Not overwatch that's for fuckin sure
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,BG3 for sure.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"3way tie for me
Witcher 3 - becaus its a popculture
Bg3 - brcaus bringen a legendary rpg series to the next level two decades later and still the one D&D videogame that realy works
Eldenring - personal favorite for sure"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Hard to say anything other than BG3 for me. This is coming from a guy with 2 Witcher tats.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I dunno who would win but I'd say BG3, Elden Ring and Witcher 3 would be the top 3."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"For me it's really just down to Baldur's Gate, Elden Ring, and Witcher 3.

And of those I think Baldur's Gate is my favorite by far, it's probably my favorite or second-favorite cRPG of all time, and that's my favorite genre. I do have to respect how huge and ambitious Elden Ring was too. Witcher 3 as well. Elden Ring was actually the first time I've ever played a game and felt ""This is one of the best I've played in a decade."" And then Baldur's Gate 3 came out the next year, giving me the same feeling.

For the rest of the games... DA:I was really mediocre in retrospect. Overwatch, I think Blizzard has pretty  much tarnished that game's legacy. God of War is good but it never felt like... ""best ever"" to me. Sekiro is too niche -- fromsoft games are already niche, and this is niche of the niche. TLoU2 is too controversial. It Takes Two is too small of a game. And Breath of the Wild? It seems like it was basically made obsolete by Tears of the Kingdom, but even pre-Tears I always thought it was middling. Beautiful and atmospheric world, with almost nothing to do in it."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Elden ring cleara
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Skyrim or BGII or Breath of the wild
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Sekiro for sure
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"People are going to strongly disagree, but botw was my favorite out of all of these.  I haven't felt like that playing a video game since I was a kid."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"My top 5 in order are: Sekiro, Overwatch, Dragon Age, It Takes Two and Elden Ring. 
    
Haven’t played BG3 and played but don’t care for the rest. BOTW is my least favorite Zelda game(second favorite game series), not a bad game but never touched it again. God of War was great but preferred Red Dead that year. Hated the combat in Witcher 3 and do not care for the Last of Us series."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Oddly enough, I haven't played a single game on this list. I guess Baldurs Gate III appeals to me the most out of that list."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"No one asked for this but here’s what I would nominate per decade

90s: Ocarina of Time

00s: Half-Life 2

10s: Witcher 3

20s: BG3 (For now)"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"BG3 has the honour of now being the only game to take out all 5 of the major GOTY awards. Elden Ring and Zelda took out 4 but missed a 5th. All of them have different voting juries and methods, so it managed to hit all the spectrum."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Seems odd to vote on a ""Game of the Decade"" from a list that spans part of 2 decades.  This is more ""Best Game of the Last 10 Years Randomly Put Up For Voting in the Middle of the Current Decade for Some Reason"""
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"BG3 for me. 

There is *so* much you get from that game, it's insane. I've clocked in over 700 hours, still finding new shit in new playthroughs. There are several developers who would've added stuff like the House of Hope, the Necromancy of Thay, and all the hag stuff behind DLC or preorder paywalls. Instead, we get *so* much of a game. It has more content than most any other game being released today. Plus, it's clearly very modder-friendly, only adding to its longevity, and that's to say nothing of the replayability of it regarding both character builds and character choices."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I would say either Baldur’s Gate 3, Elden Ring, or The Witcher 3"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Either BG3 or It Takes Two. 
Because how they have helped introduce gaming to a wider audience.
I feel like that has been the challenge for the hobby for a good while."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Elden ring imo. BOTW was such an iconic game and is a close second but elden ring is just more for me
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Zelda. Nintendo games are a drug for gaming award judges.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"RDR2, it won GOTY but the system was rigged."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Holy shit, I keep scrolling but see no mention of fallout 3.

For me it would be fallout 3 any day. That first playthrough in 2008 was like mental sex for the first time"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,BG3 
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Elden ring
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Breath of the Wild because Zelda games get an absurd amount of love. They’re great games, but they and other mainline Nintendo games are grossly over represented in best of lists. Every other Mario or Zelda game isn’t a 10. "
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I think it's between Witcher 3 and Baldur's Gate 3. Although all of those games are great for their niche. TW3 completely changed the way action RPGs have been designed since. While BG3 proved that turn-based isometric RPGs can appeal to a general audience and not just a niche.

So those 2 games are at the top for the impact they had beyond their target audience and on overall game design."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Seeing ow here means the list is probably paid for
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Game of the decade would probably be a tossup between BG3 and ER and i havent even played BG3 and i think it would take GOTD
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"There’s so many damn excellent fantasy open world games. I love it. BG3, ER, SSDR, BOTW and W3 would be my top 5 because they achieve such amazing things in gaming (and all councdentailly share a lot of genre tropes)

Out of all of those I guess I’d pick BOTW but they all would deserve an award 😭"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,We all know
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"A game of the decade would have to be determined by how it has shaped the gaming industry in the decade that followed it's release.

So looking at that list, none, honestly."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,The witcher 3 is an obvious answer behind it there is elden ring
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Elden ringgggg
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Witcher 3 was only in 2015 AND 2015 was 9 years ago both hit me at the same time. 
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"This but for me, BoTW was also in there. 

Lol funny enough Dragon Age was probably my personally most anticipated one at the time and I think it’s the weakest one of this list by far. I could not get myself to enjoy this game fully…felt very grindy."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Id include sekiro even if people wont agree, by far my favorite game ever and the only game i beat once found out theres more bosses so i beat it again, actually i messed a step up so i reset and beat it practically 3 times.

I still havent beat elden ring"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,The Witcher 3 is the game of the 2010’s with all due respect to GTA V
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"God of War didn’t even deserve game of the year in my opinion, RDR2 is much better"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"It’s funny how I can admit that these are all great games…

… but none of them are my favourites. 

It shows the weird disconnect between what is a GOTY and what is a game I would personally put as my favourite."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Dragon Age Inquisition is a fine story but *really* tedious gameplay. Combat is just ""hold right trigger, mash a button every couple seconds until the fight ends."""
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,My wife hates video games. She played about 100 hours of gwent
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"You know a mini game is good when they make a full game out of it.

You also know a game is good when a dlc is better than most full games. Blood and Wine is excellent and a great example of how to do dlc."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Agree. I beat the main game and took a long break and returned for the DLC Hearts of Stone recently. With the recent patches and improvements they’ve made, it plays wonderfully (although the combat, while better, still feels flighty). The graphics are stunning, but the story and writing is absolutely top-tier and keeps me interested and coming back for more."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Also its DLCs are also the size of most full games.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,The combat alone brings this down like 4 points. I cant play a game that focuses so much on combat when the combat is so shit.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,history relieved voracious narrow smile adjoining license dependent cheerful ink
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,I just wish the movement wasn't absolute ass. Both the original and alternative.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Combat in Witcher 3 unfortunately sucks so definitely not winning that battle.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Saints SWEEP
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Now that the hate seems to have died out, that game is a lot of fun. Played from the second one to Gat out of Hell and all of them were great mindless fun"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"The Witcher is 9 years old

How the fuck its impact hasnt been truly felt yet"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Eh what did Elden ring do that the souls series didn’t?
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,I say GOW and Elden Ring. GOW isn’t necessarily ground breaking but it had a story and the game itself was more like a cinematic masterpiece rather than a game. And Elden Ring should be self explanatory. It’s an amazing game that is as wide as it is deep.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,I think Zelda accomplished the most. It made the Switch a success on launch and pushed gaming into mainstream non-gamer audiences the most. Especially if you’re willing to look forward 3 years into Covid. Baldurs Gate and Elden Ring were also pioneers of new gaming experiences.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,BotW can also be said to have done this
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,What won that year?
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Who is even the sole body that is the definitive authority in that? Seems like a bunch of different people all pick goty
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,RDR2 deserved GOTY entirely.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Hot take: GoW is a much better game than RDR2.

RDR2 has a fantastic story but terrible mission structure and boring gameplay, I am sorry but GoW is a more complete game"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,What GOTY award do we use exactly? There are dozens of GOTY awards and I'm sure RDR2 won one.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"You guys are acting like RDR2 was the only good game that year, GOW was just as deserving of it."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I got it on PS4, graphics and detail were beyond anything else, but man... playing it wasn't that fun."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,absolute travesty that RD2 is considered goty material
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Not really
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,The moment Kratos gets back home to get the chaos blades and face his past trample anything RDR2 tried to provide. It's a magical moment with over 20 years of building up! Made me feel like I never thought a video game is capable of making me feel that way
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Probably because 80% of the game play is mashing A/X
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,[deleted]
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Hesitation is defeat. Words to live by
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"I love Sekiro, on my fourth or fifth play thru right now. The most underrated from game (somehow even w a GOTY nod) with the best, most engrossing world. 

I hope FROM does another more linear game like Sekiro"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I just bought the game the other day cause it was on sale and man, that shit is hard! I’ve already started playing slower and i’m starting to get my timing right."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Sekiro is so fucking good. It has something about it that no other game has done for me in 30+ years.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Sekiro's gameplay and learning curve are absolutely perfect.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,I gave up after literal hours fighting the ape off and on over weeks. I just can’t beat it. Had no issues with any other bosses (beat lightning guy on try 4) but can’t get that damn thing past half way during 2nd phase.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I don’t think it’s the GOAT, but it’s the one I look back to the most fondly. It’s funny, I was a dark souls fanboy from day 1. I remember booting up Skyrim on 11/11/11 and being massively disappointed, after having sunk my teeth into dark souls first.

But goddamn, Sekiro just nailed it. It did the dark souls thing, but better in nearly every way."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Ocarina of time is my OG favorite game but Sekiro is my adult gamer favorite. There’s life before and after you’ve played Sekiro lol. Truly the best combat I’ve ever experienced in a game and now I feel like I’m just trying to find something to fill that void.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Sekiro is by far my favorite of these.  I'm very tempted to say it's the best crafted game in that list as well, I think its relatively small scope allows every inch of it to shine that much brighter.  It would never win in a vote because of the high barrier to entry, but god damn I adore Sekiro so much.  It's tied with Dishonored for my personal favorite game ever (and that's another one that easily deserves a GOTY title)"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Sekiro just surpassed every other games combat by a mile. It has actually made playing other games dull
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I still have PTSD from Sekiro, in my 38 years on this planet playing too many games to count I have never been so hard stuck on a boss like I was with Sword Saint Isshin, that guy kicked the ever living shit out of me for 3 days and had me so close to giving up."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,So you learned how to deflect your problems?
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I’m sat here struggling to rule out Sekiro for similar reasons. Bloodborne was my “literally change your life” game, because I played it first, but Sekiro has the best gameplay of all the Fromsoft titles."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,10 years is a long time in gaming. Says a lot that it’s getting this much love as one of the older titles on the list. 
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Toss up with Elden Ring for me. Witcher has the narrative component, but Elden Ring has more freedom in play style. 

Both games 10/10 though 😮‍💨"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"I love Baldur's Gate 3, I love Larion studios and I love that everyone thanked Sven for being an awesome boss so he's actually genuine.

But Witcher 3 just has some gravitas at times that just can't easily be captured in a (somewhat) standalone title. BG3 is mostly new characters and plotlines, whilst Witcher 3 is the culmination of the entire Witcher saga. 

Somewhat unfair, but such is life; So, yeah, Witcher 3 should probably have it."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,I actually did like the first season of the show. But uh. Yeah that was it. Books were good though
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"These are from The Game Awards hosted by Geoff Keighley which is pretty much the standard since the majority of people are more aware of this event when compared to others. Not really a fan of all the rankings though. While God of War is a good game, I still feel like RDR2 was completely robbed of the title."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Yeah in term of how groundbreaking they were and their impacts on the industry, it has to be one of those. The Witcher is still revered as one of the best action RPG, with lots of others trying to copy it. Zelda changed the open world formula forever. While Elden ring is more recent I would say it's the only time since Zelda that I saw an open world interesting and that made me wanted to explore every single detail. BG3 hasn't shown how it will influence the industry but there's no doubt it will , as it basically turned a niche gameplay into a mainstream one overnight."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Obviously it’s not up there, but I can see an argument for why it should be. It reinvigorated an entire genre of games (even some bigger studios took elements from it.) Not to mention the impact it’s had on the indie gaming world. To see that ***ONE GUY*** can make his dream game and have millions fall in love with it…who isn’t inspired by that? It’s right up there with Undertale in that respect."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Now we're talking. If this is about influence then stardew valley wins hands down
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"I think it's apples to oranges because the games play completely differently and it comes down to what gives you the most fun out of video games.

It is close though. BG3 is like my first ever turn based game and I loved it after initially not being interested. Choices mattering has been promised in many games over many years but I feel like this is the first real game that delivers on that.

Elden Ring though in terms of combat and action, as well as music, art style, and the size of the world, is just amazing for souls fans, plus it was one of the most hyped games ever (not counting GTA 6), and it delivered. The DLC(s?) on the way will only make the game more beloved than it already is. 

Honorable mention to Sekiro. The game created a fresh mechanic with its parry system, which I think would make for an amazing star wars game. I've always wanted a fast paced star wars game that felt like you were a Jedi fighting at high speeds like in the prequels and I think the sekiro style of combat really enables that but no one has tried it yet (jedi survivor / fallen order come close, but it's more of a souls lite).

&#x200B;

Witcher 3 is amazing but I feel like the game shows some age, and newer games have the benefit of having all the latest technology and optimized design choices."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Yeah definitely between these two. Personally not really into crpgs so I prefer Elden Ring but BG3 was an absolute behemoth of a game that brought in so many people who were new to the genre and had so many people talking.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,u forgot to mention genshin impact and all the other clones lol
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"The Legend of Zelda series has constantly refined what gaming is. Going back to the NES gold cartridge, it moved gaming from single session score based games to narratives with save states. I would say The Legend of Zelda as a series is the most important piece of video game media that has existed."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I think Overwatch also had a huge impact on the industry, it's just that all the games inspired by Overwatch shut down a year later XD"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"I’m surprised I had to scroll so far for this take- I completely agree. I enjoyed Elden Ring way, way more, but I don’t think it would have been as stellar as it was without BotW paving the way. Just my opinion of course, and there’s no way to truly know or not, but you can’t deny that in terms of impact, BotW was huge."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,May I ask how BoTW paved the way for these games?
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Agreed. Two all-timers. I get why some people think that the industry is in a bad place, but amongst all the crap, the highs are incredibly high."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Same. I'd rate this list:

1. Elden Ring

2. Baldur's Gate 3

3. Witcher 3

4. BoTW

5. Sekiro

6. God of War

7. Overwatch

8. It Takes Two

**I'm a huge fan of Fromsoft games. Also, never played Dragon Age nor Last of Us. If I was going to guess based off others opinions, Last of us probably cracks top 5."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"For the sake of this list, let's take Overwatch at its very peak. As far as I'm concerned, it's a masterclass in game design. The best devs and artists the industry had at the time came together and made something where the hype and player sentiment was off the wall. All the characters are memorable, distinct, and look great (as we all know...). It played and looked like a dream.  Loads of fun and easy to sink into it.

If you played Overwatch back in '16-'19, the energy was unreal. It was a great thing to be a part of.

Does this make it game of the decade? Probably not. The competition is very strong. But it absolutely deserves its place as one of the best games of the decade (at its peak)."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Ima try to defend overwatch a little, sure it sucks now but in the first 2 years I think I got close to 2k hours in, my friends were playing it and to me and many others it was the best shooter out there. I’ve played a few of the other games on the list and none of them gave me the same amount of hours of fun as overwatch. Not even close. The stories were great but in terms of fun time overwatch came on top for me. It’s the whole “die a hero or see yourself become the villain” thing. I haven’t played in like 3 months but it was great. I rest my case lol"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"It was so good those first few years though.

I'm still pissed at how they ruined that game."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"It could have been, though. At its height and with its potential it really could have gone the distance.


I'm not bitter at all at what Blizzard did with it."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,All day.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Yeah, The Witcher 3 is one of those games that, if you like video games, you should probably experience lol."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Lets get you to bed grandpa
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,The writing in this game alone is enough for it to be one of the best games of the decade
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,The fact that it did a full sweep of GOTY for all the major awards shows says all we need to know
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"I'm going to get hate here, but the replayability of BG3 is not nearly as enjoyable as the hype surrounding it suggests. It's the same sequence of events more or less along a linear storyline. The game would have been much better with a dlc, but unfortunately, that's not going to happen."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"You can't really compare the two...

Because Elden Ring is a very niche game, while the witcher is easily accessible for everyone without even playing a video game before.

Soul games should be outside of your casual games."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I've never played BOTW but it's my vote too, none of the other games here sold an entire console."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,I really wish I could love elden ring. I just can't. The story doesn't make sense to me and the combat is way too hard. Is there some trick I'm missing or some way of looking at it I'm missing or is it just one of those all time great games I'm doomed to not click with?
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Watch the witcher 4 being released in 2029 to win two decades
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Don't say it like that you will make me feel old lol. But yea for the 2010's I would say W3. For 20's I say Elden Ring.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Literally my favorite gaming experience.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Had to scroll a bit too much to find someone say this. I know people don't understand how good the story was but even then. 

Sadly the OP didn't take tlou1 that won GOTY in 2013 into consideration. I feel like it would be mentioned a lot more

From this list, I think tlou2 is _the_ game."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,“You can’t stop this”
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I’d just like to say that I did so much scrolling and you are the first I found to say Last Of Us 2. It’s my favorite game of all time and it has my vote as well. The attention to detail in that game is absolutely absurd. And I’m not just talking about graphically, but the attention to detail in the combat is what blew me away the most. I have yet to play a game that has made me feel as blown away and awestruck as TLOU2."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Agree. Commentors below apparently think that without Witcher 3 you still would have had a Witcher TV show with Henry Cavill copying game Geralt's voice. I wanted to love BG3 (and played both BG1 and 2 on release), but I think I've moved past party-based RPGs and find managing a whole party of characters as a single player to be a tad tedious these days. Everything else seems awesome, but it just feels like a lot of work to play."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Criminal
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Witcher 3 was massive when it came out. Like unbelievably massive with a world full of voice acted conversations, quests, random encounters etc. 

Of course they have honed it over the years and going back to the original would probably be different than what we remember but a lot of people, at the time, labeled it ""first truly open world RPG"" so in that sense it was ground braking. 

And the graphics were next level, we could say - computer breaking. Even though they were slightly criticized by some nerds as they did not fully achieve every aspect shown in some pre-release videos. 

And of course the story, interactions with all characters, amount of content, all that was kind of ground braking even if it would have had loading screens and not an open world."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,I was going through my record collection and happen to play the vinyl for GoT last night and immediately I started reminiscing how great the game was from the music alone. Really makes want go back and play the DLC someday. Such a gem of a game!
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,I'm sorry... You're calling the Witcher 3 and Breath of the Wild less mainstream than Baldurs Gate 3? It's more popular by virtue of it being the best game
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Lmao yeah BG3 is more mainstream than fkn Zelda. Get out of here
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Bg3 is recency bias
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"BOTW, and likely Witcher 3 - but im not as confident there - but especially BOTW, was more mainstream than BG3"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"The combat for me, felt so addictive. Also love/hate the puzzles in a healthy way. The entire game felt like the right combination of new but classic aspects of gaming."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,I’ve played it for 72 hours and it’s good but not even in my top 50 games ever. I’m still in Act 3 and cannot for the life of me find a reason to keep playing it. And I LOVED DOS 1/2.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Subjectively ?
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Does BG3 really show any flaw in the industry? It was a large project with a big budget and it succeeded. I don't see how it redefines anything when it comes how the industry works. Elden Ring came out just a year before that with a huge budget and was also a huge success.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"What did BoTW do that wasn't already done by any elder scrolls game (Skyrim), Witcher 3, fallout, horizon, etc?

It only got all that praise because it was the first Zelda open world game."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"It really didn't... It's not that it wasn't influential, I can think of a couple of games that did steal a lot from it. But, uh, pray tell how much it actually affected Cyberpunk? RDR2? Elden Ring?

People already have the examples for every open world game from long time ago. BOTW isn't going to influence Bethesda's or Ubisoft's or CDPRs next open world games much, not GTA6 or whatever else becomes the biggest open world game of next few years.

Just getting copied by Genshin and Palworld isn't quite industry shattering impact yet, yknow"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Rdr2 can get extremely boring 

I know i was bored going from point a to point b

The game can tell an amazing Story,but has to be fun to play"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"This one for me as well.

* Pinnacle of open world combat
* Pinnacle of open world sandbox
* Pinnacle of open world writing"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Had it all except good gameplay, but is game of the decade.."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Have you... played and beaten all the games on that list? Or is this a classic example of someone giving a stupid opinion with no backing? Rd2 100% is a better game than GoW, but GoW is 100% a great game, and is better to people who aren't about the cowboy and old west shit. Its a story that can be enjoyed by anyone. Rd2 isn't going to be enjoyed by everyone, and if you haven't played rd1, there's alot of things you'll miss. That's just my opinion. As someone who has played extensively most of the titles on that list and has at least played the garbage that was tlou2 and overwatch"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,I'm 39 and I say witcher 3. Although I've never played elden ring as I never had interest in souls like games
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"At the time of it's release, it was actually the most awarded game of all time. Now Elden Ring holds that title."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Fittingly sums up the year 2020. An anomaly.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Imo still a FANTASTIC game and gets my vote for oldest, best game within the past 10 years"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,2015 was 4 years ago - whatchu talking about?
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,The fact the game is 9 years old now is honestly insane. It still holds up extremely well
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I  feel like it's from 2010 or so. Definitely a lifetime ago for me. 27yo, stable job, 3 floor house, a wife and plans for kids. 


Back in 2015 I was fresh out of high school, failed college, got depressed, was sick all the time, And still a virgin, and upset about still being a virgin for some reason"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,The trick to this game is stubbornly refusing to acknowledge all the types of collectibles. The rewards for finding them aren't really game-changing but freeing yourself from chasing them down is
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Dragon Age was great but only if you ignored like 75% of the game and beelined the main story and major side narratives (ex. companion quests). One of those weird games where the more you played it the worse it got.

I’m not sure I would’ve had as good a time if I hadn’t recognized that, playing Far Cry (or maybe it was Ghost Recon) not long beforehand trained me to enjoy it in that peculiar way.

It’s worth a revisit if you never finished it. The major narratives are fantastic, it’s just hard to see past all the collectible side quest crud."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Botw is a odd one for me. It has no story and no memorable music, the dialogue doesn't exist and the world is largely empty.

How on earth did it win goty with so many and bad flaws?"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"I'd replace GoW with Breath of the Wild. GoW was an incredible journey, but it was just a video game with a great story. Breath of the Wild was definitely something special especially for the time it came out."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"BoTW wasn't anything special imo. It only got so much praise for being a sandbox / open world Zelda game, but everything it did had already been done better and before by other games and other franchises."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Elden Ring gave me what I wanted from BoTW. BoTW felt like it punished me for exploring. I'd like to explore that hut over there but my weapons are low on durability. And if I find something awesome, it's not like I get to keep it anyway."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,In what aspect is BoTW better than Witcher 3 or Elden ring? Never understood the hype about BoTW. It's so mid.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,What's BoTW?
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Open world games got popular now everyone is trying to make games with massive open maps, but don't want to bother actually making content to fill it. Inquisition is a good example of this. They would have been better off with smaller maps with more focused direction than these big maps only lightly sprinkled with content.

Edit: oddly enough it was the exact opposite of the problem with DA 2. DA2 had too much content and too little world. Inquisition had too much world for too little content."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Man I thoroughly enjoyed inquisition. Did you play the the text game on the website? You know what I'm talkin bout? With the green knight? Can't remember whats it called
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"All dragon age had to do was stick with Origins gameplay and improve it.  But alas, reinvent the wheel and move your franchise to mediocre territory. DA2 was bad and I can’t enjoy inquisition at all"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,To me the worst on this list is overwatch. But i guess its tinted by what it became.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"If we’re talking Dragon Age 3 I actually managed to play the game multiple runs with different builds and characters. At first I used to get overwhelmed by the first big map that I had trouble finishing the game even once. I think it’s better if you take breaks in between main quest/sidequest to visit the other areas.

Like after reaching the little town where you fight templars and mages, do the side quests there, then go and get your other companions from storm coast and the city. Then come back to do more side quest and the first main quest."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,If I remember correctly Sekiro had four different endings. You got one more completion to go!
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Sekiro definitely has the most satisfying combat mechanics. Elden Ring is basically open world dark souls and I would rank both Bloodborne and Sekiro over it.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"I enjoyed Sekiro more than ER, so I'd replace that in the short list.  

I'd say BG3 or Witcher 3 overall, but they both have different strengths and weaknesses, so hard to make that final call."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Lmfao
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Its a crime RDR2 didnt win GOTY. 

Even though it didnt, itd still probably be my game of the decade"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"My sister, who very rarely was interested in video games would watch me play Witcher 3 just to see the outfits after seeing me play the Toussant area."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,How did they make a card game that simple so good and infinitely replayable. So many other games tried that and failed
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Blood and Wine was so good it won RPG of the year for 2016, beating out full games like Dark Souls 3 lol"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I will die on the hill that the hearts of stone antagonist is one of, if not the best, villain in gaming. Gaunter O'Dimm is menacing as fuck."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Blood of wine is obviously a far more complete dlc/expansion, but Hearts of Stone is the best storyline of any game I've ever played."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I have had the game of the year edition sitting in my library for months. I am hoping I forget enough of it so that I can get a good replay out of it. Unfortunately, that game was so good It’s hard to forget and I haven’t even played the DLC yet"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Blood and Wine could literally be Witcher 4 lol
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I don’t think TW3 did anything revolutionary mechanically and feature-wise that other games did and could not have done. What makes it really stand out is the super rich writing, world building, and characters that made the game feel more complete and lived in than any other rpgs. It spoiled side quests for me in other games as I now see their potential as not fillers, but real pieces to complete arcs and worlds. Most studios including cdpr themselves in cyberpunk never gave it the love to detail they did in every corner like they did in TW3"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Warhorse devs are highly inspired by Witcher 3 while making Kingdom Come Deliverance, mainly because of the dialogue choices that actually matters, they have a lot of obvious W3 references too in that game. Witcher 3 at least set a new standard to the choice matters games, another example that I can think of is AC Odyssey, implementing dialogue choices in their conversations because it's so popular at that time because of The Witcher 3, and my main reason too to play that game and managed to finish it."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Yeah this guy's a tad hyperbolic. 

""Beyond revlolutionary"" lol"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"It sounds dumb when you point out how long its been, but to be honest I dont think they are wrong. BG3 felt like the first game ive played where the writing was close to W3. Witcher 3 showed a masterclass in game writing."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I'd argue that the three listed, it's the weakest. Excellent story, shit combat. More folks have bounced off The Witcher 3 than the other two."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,redditors say stupid shit for upvotes
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20," My brain still translates ""GOW"" to Gears Of War..  Was wondering how the hell that would be up there with Elden Ring."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"One thing that I really enjoy about BotW is that it gives me a sense of discovery and exploration that other open world games don't. Somehow movement is just...fun? It really shouldn't be as fun as it is, but something about paragliding and climbing, looking for little environmental puzzles and spotting the next thing to do, is just fun. In most open world games traversing the actual open world is the worst part of it. The world is simply a container for the rest of the game to happen in.

Plus the lack of map markers really helps this. I remember the first time I played the tutorial section, when you're told to climb to the tower to look for shrines I expected to get to the top and have the shrines marked on my map. But no, it meant climb to the top and get your binoculars and literally look for them. Mark them down on your map manually and figure out how to get to them. 

Imagine if they took the Ubisoft approach and made it to where every single shrine, korok sees, enemy camp, boss spawn, and etc was just marked on the map. The game would be significantly less enjoyable. It's a small thing but it makes a huge difference in game feel 

Anyways, I would pick BotW as potential game of the decade for that reason. I generally like open world games, but no other one I've played gives me the same sense of exploration that BotW does. The only thing that really comes close is Morrowind."

1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,I know. The Game Awards has somehow convinced people that it's the definitive award and it definitely should not be seen as such.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,They are acting like rdr2 deserved game of the year. It did. I loved God of war. But I don't still have it downloaded and play it regularly. Rdr2 on the other hand I can fire up and enjoy anytime.

1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Hesitation is Defeat.

In all seriousness though. It's easy to dismiss media we consume as idle time wasters but, the books, movies and games we read, watch and play can impact us emotionally, sometimes lastingly. You are molded by your experiences and the messages or themes in the media you see are part of those experiences."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"It might sound silly but the way that Wolf gets stronger by reflecting on intense past experiences kinda helped reshape how I would handle trauma. My first instinct used to be to push those thoughts away, then I eventually sat and reflected on them."

1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Sekiro is the definition of punishing you when you half ass it but reward you if you take your time to learn it. Once you figure it out, it becomes one of the easier soulsborne games."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"It’s not underrated, go on the from sub and it’s very highly rated, probably only behind bloodborne"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,I have great news! Armored core 6 is my favorite game right now. Linear mech battles with the backdrop of a From software narrative. 
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,The stealth mechanic is also extremely important. You should ideally play it as a stealth game one shotting people one by one and only fighting the bosses square on.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"You have to be patient early on and learn to parry consistently. Once you get good at that, everything clicks and the game feels fantastic. And the game is made so that if you don't, some early bosses will be really difficult."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I had way more difficulty with Genichiro than you, but didnt struggle with ape. Ape felt more like Elden Ring to me."

1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"I just started playing Cyberpunk a few weeks ago and it really reminded me of why The Witcher 3 was so damn good.

They're not huge games, they're just really densely filled with quality content. Everything feels so handcrafted. Each quest actually tells a story and has a special area custom made for it. You are not repeating quests to gain resources, you're doing quests because they're genuinely interesting to play."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"This is true. It's a toss up between gameplay or story. I kinda felt disappointed with how so many people value story more than gameplay. To me, gameplay is the most important thing for games since.. it's a game."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"God of War won almost 100 GOTY more than RDR2 that year, so either it got robbed a lot of times or rockstar just has the biggest fanbase and critics see it differently."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"That was an insane lineup. Monster Hunter World was nominated too but it wasn’t as popular as it is now. There was also Spider-Man. Rdr2 and god of war were the clear nominees to get the win tho, honestly I’m suprised rdr2 didn’t win but GoW was an amazing game too"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Undertale also came out in the last decade by the way.

Stardew Valley, Undertale, Disco Elysium, Rimworld, Factorio, Hollow Knight, Baba is You, Celeste, Outer Wilds, Kerbal Space Program, Hades, Slay the Spire, probably a couple of others that I'm forgetting right now.

I'd say (almost) every one of these is a better game than (almost) every one of the games listed at the top.  But only AAA games are invited to the fancy parties.

I'd give my personal game of the decade award to either Disco Elysium or Elden Ring though."

1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Overwatch was arguably the starting point for the live service model we see so often in games now, though it was Fortnite that really blew the model out of the water. Like how PUBG was the kick-off point for BRs in the mainstream, only for Fortnite to standardize it (again)

Honestly... Fortnite might be game of the century lmao, if we're going by impact on the industry. For better or worse, it enacted *a lot* of change."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,This sub is heavily PC focused and somewhat Playstation.  Nintendo games are rarely given praise.  So only a few people would appreciate a Nintendo exclusive on this sub.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Miyazaki said Breath of the Wild was one of the inspirations for Elden Ring and having played both I did see some similarities in open world design. My answer to the question is probably Elden Ring though.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Because Nintendo provided the industry with a lesson in organic open word design.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"BoTW demonstrated the value of a vast, open world with a nonlinear story where exploration and discovery were themselves just as rewarding as whatever was being explored/discovered. It’s hardly the first game to have these elements, but it modernized and really perfected many of them. The reaction was substantial, with gamers realizing they wanted more of it and developers wanting to take their shot at it. 

It’s hard to say what would and would not be made if BotW never existed, but it’s very clear to see its influence on games from that point forward. In addition to OP’s list, I’d add Pokemon: Arceus as a game that almost certainly wouldn’t have been created without BotW, as it’s basically just pokemon go in a limited BotW engine."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,First open world game they played
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,Gaming and games aren’t even bad right now lol people just like to hate on anything that’s new
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"It's because most of the bad or mediocre games of the past have been forgotten, so we only remember the great games.  The bad and mediocre games of the present are still in our minds, so we mistakenly believe gaming's gotten worse."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Being a huge fan of Fromsoft is why I couldn't put it on top personally. They sacrificed a lot of their design philosophy in the pivot to open world. The best example I can think of at the moment is the change in duo boss design. They used to carefully craft duo fights, but in elden ring they just slap random enemies together and hope it has the same impact as Ornstein and Smough."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"I would say that Overwatch gets dinged by the absolute shitfest that was its fallout. But man, that game is the first I had picked up in probably 6 years (not called Skyrim) where I just couldn’t put it down."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Like Elden Ring and Baldur's Gate 3, it's a game that went beyond its genre's core audience and became a cultural phenomenon.


So many ""normie"" friends of mine played it, including many women, which is quite special for a competitive shooter."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"""Sure it sucks now""...how exactly? I know that's a common take over here but as a core game it's still the same old Overwatch but with so much more content. Sure paying for cosmetics sucks but that's fully optional and doesn't make the core game any worse."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"If a boss is too hard, you're supposed to go off an explore instead and come back when you're stronger.

You can *easily* sink 100+ hours into a single non-100% playthrough of core + expansions, (and that's without even *touching* Gwent.)  The sheer diversity of experiences while playing through the content of the game is mind-boggling.  We see this with proven again in Cyberpunk 2077 -- CDPR does a *phenomenal* job of making 'M for Mature' not *just* mean there's violence, drinking, swearing, and tits, but that those things are *also* within a larger backdrop that is a complex and realistic (and therefore mature) portrayal of the world it's building... And then their quest and narrative designers just start *running with it.*  Apparently they're all world-class ultra-marathon runners or some shit.

And the graphics still hold up.

Wind's howling."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,BG3 is popular right now because it's the most recent.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Yeah it's even right combination of open world and linear path.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,The game is the Bible of Reddit. It was Witcher 3 for a while and now it’s BG3.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,In conclusion a good open world game is the formula for success.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"2015 didn't happen yet, it's 2007 and nothing hurts"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"That’s because all games that came out in 2015 or later are recent enough to hold up really well. It’s only when you go back further than that where it gets bad, increasingly so every 2-3 years"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,This is solid advice for many games but feels near impossible for me.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Definitely the two biggest changes I made in my gaming style were ignoring ""collectibles for the sake of collectibles"" and not metagaming if it doesn't matter.

1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Exactly. The urge to 100% is strong, but the game simply isn't designed around that. If you want to see more of them, starting a new playthrough and taking different routes will help you find all kinds of new stuff. Same design philosophy in Odyssey but to a lesser degree"

1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Not many people would agree, and sure it had its problems, but AC Odyssey is one of my favourite games of all time. I spent way too long on that game, played it to 100% (including dlc) 3 times, that's like over 500 hours..."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Horizon zero dawn was clearly inspired by the witcher 3 with its side quests and dialogue choices 

I think the main thing that the witcher 3 inspired is that side quests should actually be the same quality as the main quests in terms of writing. In so many pre witcher 3 open world games like mass effect , dragon age inquisition, Skyrim, ubisoft games, a lot of the side content in these games was just there to increase the run time without any character development or expanding the lore . After the witcher 3 released a lot of games started to put effort in the side content just look at games like ac odyssey or ghost of tsushima. I'm not saying these games have the same quality of content as the witcher 3, but the developers are at least trying, and they are better than the side content in something like AC2 or Infamous 2. Even a game as legendary as rdr2, there is more dialogue and stories in the side content than there is in rdr1 and that's probably because of the witcher 3."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,I mean.. mass effect set the stage for choices mattering way before the Witcher
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Wait until you play rpgs from the 90s...
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Huh, yeah. God of War was really good, but Red Dead felt like a much grander experience, and a much more memorable one when looking back."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"RDR2 is probably my favorite game of all time and I tried GOW 2018 for the first time a few weeks ago. I played for like 30 hours or so and then stopped. The story wasn’t super interesting to me and the game is so much fighting, which is fine, but the fighting was not fun at all to me. I genuinely don’t understand how RDR2 lost"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"GOW won because it shattered expectations and proved that well-known and long running franchises can overhaul themselves and become something fresh and unique even after existing for decades. I don’t think anyone that watched the reveal in 2016 expected it to be such a well-written, memorable, and emotional game. 

RDR2 is an incredible game but it wasn’t necessarily groundbreaking compared to RDR1. The controls also leave something to be desired."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Rdr2 for all its detail was brought down by its godawful movement and shooting system. It’s quite literally GTAV movement and aim assist reliant shooting that was transported into this beautiful new next gen world, hard game to want to replay due to that."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"RDR 2 loses in the Gameplay category vs. God of War, they’re neck and neck in story, characters, world, etc. though RDR has the more immersive world while God of War had the more interesting world. 

But gameplay? Not even close. RDR 2 gets smoked.

God awful dated GTA gameplay mechanics."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,I played RDR2 and thought it was completely overrated. Good characters in a story with a mediocre plot in a game with god-awful clunky/boring gameplay and a beautiful incredibly detailed world. Point is you liking RDR2 doesn’t make it the better game lmao.

1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"My first play thru in 2018, i remember spending literal days on Genichiro, days on Owl, on Ape, and on O’rin. This playthrough, even tho it’s been years, i am just breezing by everyone and it feels so good"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Honestly it is probably the easiest from game to do a not hit run.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Also, once you learn it, you can't unlearn it. I didn't play sekiro for like 4 years until a few months ago and it still clicked instantly once I started playing it"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"yeah i’ve been stuck on the ogre for the past day lol He’s so annoying to kill and i don’t have enough for potions, i’m trying to get a first strike stealth hit but it’s so hard 🥲 I’m having fun though i’m loving the game"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"What comes close? IMO only Mass Effect, BG3, Fallout or Elder Scrolls can compete"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I knew when they made a side quest about a missing frying pan more interesting than 90% of other games main quests, I was in for something special"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Cyberpunk has a smaller file size than Fo4, I don't understand how, and I adore Fo4 (and 3 and to a lesser extent NV) but Cyberpunk crams so much into such a dense world which feels exactly right for the setting.

I was also one of the lucky ones that played it with no bugs or crashes on release so I realise I have a different opinion of it to most people."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,its so sad people forgot how good witcher 3 was and was even trashing the game when cyberpunk came out because of its disastrous launch.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"To preface; Both are important, and there are cases where I do value one over the other. I just can tolerate bad gameplay with good story more than the other way around, but totally understand the inverse

 The way i see it is that gameplay is just the means by which I experience the world of a game; Great gameplay is fun, but the narrative/stories is what keeps me around and interested. Like a game with 10/10 gameplay but say 5/10 (like a true 5/10, not game score 5/10) wont leave me with much of an impression than ""that was fun to swing around for a bit"" (Elden Ring falls into that for me. was fun but...unmemorable?). Where I'll still think about a 10/10 Story 5/10 gameplay years later and how it made me feel (Nier Replicant/Gestalt).

But It's all personal pref and i def think there are more than enough games that cater to one or the other (or both!)"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"They aged differently. Many of us look back and see RDR2 hasn’t been surpassed in many ways by any game yet. It’s a masterpiece but doesn’t have the best pacing, weird controls, and sometimes annoying survival mechanics that are a chore. Still, no game is perfect."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I think it's unfair to say that the game awards ignore indie games, especially lately. Disco Elysium, Celeste and Hades all got a fair amount of praise, especially Disco Elysium, which kept Baba is You, Outer Wilds and Slay the Spire from getting the same amount of attention. Furthermore some of the other games on your list had to go up against games like Rocket League, Inside and Cuphead, which at the time had a bigger impact in the gaming scene (though long term you could argue that a game like Stardew is definitely more impactful than Inside). The game of the year is not an award for the 'best' game, more the game that was one of the best, but also incredibly successful. 

Besides that I think it's unfair to discredit games like BG3, GoW, BOTW and the Witcher 3 while each of them were massive events in gaming when they released and are all great games. We should stop with the whole AAA vs Indie war, both camps make incredible games and we're lucky that we live in a time where we're spoiled with so many great games each year."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"The scale of these listed indie titles just aren't on the same level of some of these juggernauts at the top. I think they are incredible games and absolutely are gonna be GOAT contenders for some folks but for the industry as a whole, which is what these generalised awards are for, they don't do enough compared to OP's list. I will say this doesn't necessarily apply to every year however and I think games like Hollow Knight, Hades and Stardew Valley smoke Overwatch but on the whole, the rule holds well"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,There is. It's called Jedi fallen order.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"If you wanna break it down to a lower, more interesting level:

Warcraft 3 had the DotA 1 mod, which splintered into both League of Legends and Dota 2. League of Legends popularized free to play gaming, while Dota introduced battle passes to gaming.

And the success of both of them spawned games like Honor of Kings and Mobile Legends, which aren’t talked about much in western gaming circles here, but are basically the most popular games in the world player number wise."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Us Xbox fans are universally hated.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I think it's most noticeable in that they share the exploration drive of 'Hey, see that cool looking thing over there? Go get it'. In both games if you just stopped and looked somewhere to the horizon there'd always be some objective of exploration that you could go and see what it is 'cause it looks interesting. The drive to explore was intrinsic and you weren't constantly following quest markers/objectives when  working towards the overall goal of beating the game.

Also in how the critical paths are layed out. In BotW you can technically just go straight to Ganon after the great plateau and be done with the game. Or you can do any number of the guardian beasts in any order you like, though there is certainly a vaguely intended order to them. Elden Ring is much the same. A lot is optional, with only 2 Great Runes being required for entry to the capital, though the typical playthrough will probably see you gather much more."

1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Been gaming since 1988. There's been some incredible eras in gaming over that timespan, but to say modern gaming these days sucks is so out of touch lol"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"I agree. I'm 41 and been playing since og mario brothers in 89. We have an embarrassment of riches in games the last 20 years. If the industry just stopped making games right now I'd have enough to play my backlog for 5 years, and I play quite a bit. When I hear people talk about how shitty the industry is, they usually focus on the devs like ubisoft or EA, but there is so much out there to play. To me we are in a golden age and nobody wants to admit it."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,For all the good there are plenty of stinkers though. I feel like we used to get a lot more 6-8/10 games now we get trash or gold.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Gaming practices are getting worse, and some studios are becoming increasingly lazy and greedy with their work (Ubisoft, blizzard, EA), but indie games are getting exponentially better, and there are always several exceptional games released each year"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I’m not sure if that’s a fair ding given it’s the only game up there that had to try to sustain a multiplayer community (an esports one at that) and character balance over its entire life span. If it didn’t have to evolve, it wouldn’t have had the fallout. Overwatch 2 on the other hand was downhill from the start."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"This here.

It's not often you see a game manage to reach both the ""gamer"" and ""casual"" fanbase on a scale that Overwatch did. 

Overwatch gets a lot of flak for what it became. But those first couple years it was undoubtedly the biggest and one of the best games out there."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"The truth is it doesn’t suck now. The game is still extremely fun play wise.

It gets a lot of hate for turning into a f2p live service monetization fest that I feel it wouldn’t have gotten had it been like that from the start- it’s just so hard to take a game you paid for and had and then turn into into this model. In reality the prices for things are on par with any other similar game and while I *hate* that games are this way now it’s understandable why a company would be enticed by it.

The hate received for how they basically abandoned OW1 because of all the PvE stuff they were working on for OW2, and then that being scrapped in the end however is not overstated. It is infuriating how badly the whole thing was managed and it’s painful to think about what could’ve or should’ve been instead.

So tl;dr the game is still fun but the management decisions are the reason for the hate. It’s still one of my favorite games just due to the enjoyment I get from playing and watching it (don’t get me started on the esports scene)."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"It doesn’t, it just ruined its legacy by having no new content between 2019-2022 and not delivering on any of its promises plus all the scandals. If they never tried to make Overwatch 2 then it would be looked at as one of if not the best in the Genre."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,I think I just said that without thinking. I do like it but none of my friends play it anymore :/
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"It doesn’t suck lol. I’ve played since 2017 and tbh the core gameplay and game state feels better than it ever has, and has pretty much been consistently getting better with the occasional bad patch mixed in (which they’ve been faster than ever at responding to).

That doesn’t fit the circlejerk narrative this sub has about it though"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,DON'T GIVE ME HOPE AND THEN SMASH IT
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,All those AND the next 2 projects Larian is reportedly working on.

1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"If this list had included 2013, I would have added the first “The Last of Us” as a contender. It wasn’t open world and didn’t need to be but the story, gameplay, emotions, etc. all make it a very memorable experience and that’s that I based my contenders on. “Which games were the most memorable to me?”"

1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Dragon Age 3 was the first game I realized that trying to meta game things made them boring and it’s better to just blindly run around and test things out yourself
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Pretty much. I never 100% games and never put effort towards collectibles. I understand that those experiences are created towards other types of people
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Yeah, I'm playing through Pokémon Sword for the first time, and I'm just playing like I'm a kid again. It makes it way more fun."

1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,I felt the same way gave BoTW a try cause everyone was gushing but it felt like just another empty open world game with the worst weapon maintenance system ever 
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,I love the LOZ series and can't stand BotW and ToTK because they seemed to find a way to remove all the things I loved about the Zelda series. They're fun games but they aren't nearly as engaging as pretty much every other installment in the series.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I can definitely understand why people don't like it and will mostly agree with the criticisms of it, but something about the game with the visuals, sounds, atmosphere, music, etc just sucked me in like no other game. 

I was playing on a WII U with the default WII U gamepad and was still absolutely absorbed start to finish. It felt like so much more than the sum of its parts and I have not played many games that make me feel the same way.

It reminds me of Skyrim in that sense where people will have a million complaints about the game and talk about what it does wrong but it clearly had and has something special to it that sold 10s of millions of copies and got people to put 100s of hours into it."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Same here. I bought BoTW and put about 25 hours into it and realized I just was not having a good time. Returned the game to the store the next day.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Have to agree with this. Although I really wish I could find the amazing parts of BoTW/ToTK that people talk about. Tried to get into them a few times but I fell off after about 10 hours in, where it simply gets too repetitive for me. The gameplay itself is not interesting enough to hook me, nor is there a story I feel compelled to see to completion. 

I like that the world is not filed with Ubisoft checklist of open world things to do region after region. But I think I fall off the games when I realize the world is just a bit boring, and sense of exploration is really the main thing making me keep playing at first. 

For me Elden ring is kind of a grim BOTW game. It just does every aspect a lot better."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Bow have, something really special, and imersivo the bokolins have a Life... They ARE not there to kill you... 


They Hunt, they sings, sleeps, talk each other... Everything made with AI organically, (NOT scripted)... Bow was my best game experience in the Last 20 years... I Just loved walking with no gol... Just to Chili... 




But i can understand who dons't like.... 


But Bow was for me a relax and beautyfull experience"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"The Pocket Card Jockey series is available on 3DS, IOS, and Switch if you want more of that Solitaire gaming itch, it's from the creators of Pokemon and quite frankly probably their best product in the last decade.


I also like Zachtronics Solitaire a lot and recently started playing A Solitaire Mystery from the creator of Baba is You but kinda still on the fence on that one but those are much more traditional Solitaire games.


Dicey Dungeons is also kinda similar to Solitarica Aesthetically although it eschews solitaire for Yahtzee esque mechanics.


Lots of good deck builders to try if honestly, most of them just have an annoyingly high barrier to entry unlike Solitarica. (Only other easy one to get people into is Inscryption IMO)"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Good guy CD Projekt Red
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I never even thought of G.O.D., that’s interesting as hell. I do agree with the scenery though. The first time you trot along and see the full scenery of the city it’s just crazy beautiful"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Same, especially to those who loves the Greek mythology & architecture, exploring the ancient Greek islands in this game is such a bliss, I spend around 200 hours myself in that game with the DLCs, I really love Kassandra as the main character rather than Alexios because she got the charm of a main character more than him."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Sadly I'm really disappointed with HZD's dialogue choices as I think it just feels like a dialogue skip in disguise, I've tried to get into it twice, but I just can't, so I never finished that game."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,And KotoR before ME and other games before that. It's not a new thing by any means. It's just rarely done so well because of the complexity it adds to games.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"It's moresso that it had better narrative presentation, with fairly substantive choices, in an open-world environment. You could argue that BG3 doesn't necessarily have extraordinarily deep choices relative to other CRPGs, but as a CRPG It's hands-down the best technically presented CRPG to date."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Or Disco Elysium.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"I think something that slips by a lot of people is that the game is a “1-er” (if you don’t save and load the entire game is depicted as one take).

That was a bold play and quite an artistic achievement."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"God of War was good, but I honestly had more fun with God of War 3. RDR2 is a game I still want to play."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Much as I hate to say it, I think the actual gameplay of Rd2 let it down.

Like most rockstar games the weakest bit was the shooting, which felt like moving an iron bar with a gun on it.

I enjoyed most of the rest of the game same with gtaV, but a cowboy game with such poor shooting can't win goty."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,The difference being that God of War is actually fun to play. RDR2 just isn’t fun. It created a cool immersive world but man it was slow and just a chore to play for me.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Yeah having played both I think RDR2 shoulda won. It was a much more ambitious title.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Not to mention a lot of the game comes down to a shooting gallery for 30 hours. Then the stark contrast of the railroad of a main story and the 180 of an open world. I can’t think of anything wrong with God Of War 2018.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Also Cory Barlog is an industry treasure, and Rockstar at the time was faced with backlash over crunching its employees."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Ironically, while you're coming out in defense of the GoW win, you've underscored the very reason why RDR2 didn't win: Everyone expected it to be great, and apparently that's not good enough to beat a game that was great out of left field."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Yeah rdr2 is one of the best games I have ever played, as someone previously mentioned, it's a journey and an awesome world to get lost in. But the controls straight up suck, having to spam X to run was an outdated game mechanic +15 years ago, movement ingame feeling like you're walking through knee high snow more often than not and as you mentioned the shooting feels bad.

I'd also like to mention that having that huge 2nd desert area unlock with almost nothing to do in it was kind of a letdown. It would've been a huge undertaking, but imagine if that had been used to remake rdr1 in a dlc or something, I would have thrown bags of money at rockstar, that's for sure"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,RDR2 and GTAV have worse controls than most early 3d ps1 games. No idea how they manage to make these billion dollar games but somehow can’t make better controls.  Rockstar games with Last Of Us quality controls would make the games 10x better
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"This might be very controversial to some people but RDR1 was a much better game than RDR2 both in terms of story and definitely in terms of gameplay. RDR2 had a fantastic story though but wow, the sluggish ""realistic"" gameplay was just too much."

1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Mass Effect 2 is among the top 3 most memorable games I’ve ever played. I played it on my ps3 and as soon as the remastered version came out I played it again. Unreal game.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,It rewards git gud so much you dont even need to drain the hp to kill the boss. It prevents drawn out fights as long as you know your shit.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"It took me a week of hard effort to beat sword saint on my first play through, played it again this year, 5 years later, and it felt effortless. Sekiro is something else."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,That dropkick hurts real bad.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,If you haven't been already go to the hirata estate there is an item that will help you with him (also listen to the guards in front of the ogre they will give you a hint which item that is). Also there are some candies that make you invisible so you can backstab any enemy I forgot where you get those though
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I didn't play Mass Effect yet (I will soon), the games I thought of were BG3, Cyberpunk, Fallout NV, Yakuza, ES Oblivion, Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines. Some of them have many great quests, some just a few but they're REALLY good.

What makes Witcher 3 the king imo is not only does it have the highest peaks with something like the Bloody Baron, but the sheer amount and average quality they have is insane."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,I wouldn't even say the Bethesda games could compete with the Witcher 3. The witcher's worst quests are still better written than Bethesda's best.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"It's just because, in Bethesda games, every item in their games  actually exist as ""physical"" objects in the game, and that's just more data overall."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Well it's cool to see the perspective of players that value story over gameplay. 

Just wanted to say regarding Elden Ring, you can take the npc quests as story just without cutscenes although they're so easy to miss."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"For sure, I've played 8 of the AAA games listed up top, and loved 6.5 of them. It's just a shame how effectively their enormous marketing budgets drown out the little guys

I know there's more to it than that - AAAs are all designed for mainstream mass appeal, while most of the Indies I listed are very niche, I just can't help but wonder what would happen if something like Obra Dinn got superbowl ads."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,I'd argue that's more classic souls styled than Sekiro if anything.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,I've played both of those games. The combat doesn't even come close to Sekiro. Much more akin to dark souls.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Interesting analysis. I loved Elden Ring but couldn't get into BOtW due to the weapon break mechanics. This makes me want to give it another go.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Seeing something in the horizon which you can walk to was done by Bethesda way before BOTW came out.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Lol, I was actually going to use Skyrim as an example of a game that did this before BotW, and then demonstrate how the latter capitalized and improved on many of these elements, but it felt too long and unnecessary."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Botw influenced Skyrim even though it came out afterwards
 That's how great it was"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"I don't know, I feel like we still get plenty in the middle. I think the sheer number of games releasing has increased, so you can pretty much exclusively play amazing games without ever ""settling"" for the more average ones. And people in general only talk about the biggest highs and lows, so you won't hear as much about the middle."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"+1. Yep, OW esports is probably the most underrated aspect of this game. It's a bit harder to get into than most other esport games because so much is going on all the time and you need so much understanding of micro, macro, team comps, counters, metas, strategies, etc. But once you get into it there's no game quite like it. It holds a special place in my heart. I started watching during the last Apex tournament. Then OWL happened and it was absolutely amazing. Especially two first seasons. While OWL happened I kept up with most EMEA Contenders game as well and I've watched most OWWC games throughout the history. Now OWCS is a thing and I'm still in the scene but it's not quite as engaging as before mentioned."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,">the prices for things are on par with any other similar game

Tbh they’re cheaper than most. The prices of skins in apex and valorant are egregious"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Hit... too... hard...
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,oh no I'm so sorry :( \*hugs\*
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I stopped playing Far Cry 4 because of all the crap everywhere.  I like to do side quests and such but there was just way too much stuff on the map.  Couldn't figure out what was important and what wasn't, so I just stopped."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Spending 5 hours reading forums to get the best build to play an hour of a video game is a great way to annihilate any joy to be found. Min maxing in WoW where it's relevant, I enjoy. 

Getting an extra 1% damage out when I am running rings around the boss in a single player game on medium difficulty was crazy."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"If they include an easy to access restat. It's horrible testing things to realise that you now cant afford the cool fireball move because a week ago you were like.. I need more healing.

Imo its elden rings biggest downfall. They throw 100s of weapons/playstyles at you and then make it hard for you to switch between them too many of them until near the end of the game."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,">long enough to be epic


Well, except when you abuse the fuck out of artificer, but that's a different sort of epic altogether."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Yeah, if you can't convince yourself ""I'll find another one of these soon enough, just use it"" and get stuck in a psychosis of pearl-clutching and bag-organizing more than fighting enemies, it's an annoying system.

I think the devs intended for you to ""Improvise. Adapt. Overcome."" and simply roll with the punches with what you have on-hand at the time. Clearly a lot of the players didn't feel the same though."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"It didn't have npcs running around but it was lovingly crafted in such a way that there's always something that you can see to do. There's little secrets to find along the way that make the exploration feel rewarding. If you're the sort of person who needs interaction with another character then this game would obviously be a miss, but for those who enjoy exploring and getting swept away in the sense of discovery this was an amazing game."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I second this.  It was my thoughts exactly.  The only reason I played it for a number of hours was because it was a Zelda game. 

One of the few Zelda game I never played to completion. I absolutely detested the weapon system in the game"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I had a difficult time finishing the first one.  Enjoyed the game play and the plot/setting immensely.  But something about the way they made Aloy so monotonous and unfeeling in her tone just doesn't sit well with me.  And I doubt it was the VA Ashley Burch, as I've seen her in some dnd one shots and she did the voice of Tiny Tina in Borderlands."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I actually really, really loved that aspect of it. Some games are constantly showing you different point of views that make it difficult to understand the story. In God of War, you're just Kratos and you just see what's going on around you. No showing what's going on back in the villain's lair or whatever."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Red Dead 2 is a journey, man. It may be a slow burn at the start, but the story just keeps getting juicier as you go. And even without the story missons, it's easy to just get sucked into the beautiful open world.

God of War 3 is one I want to revisit some time. It's been too long, and I never even finished it."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Agreed. RDR2 probably is the game of the decade for me. Crazy that it didn't win GOTY.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,I definitely prefer the old GoW to the new ones
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I played both. I still enjoy playing RDR2 years later. 

I quit GoW a little after the fight with Thor’s sons and never bothered picking it up again. Not my flavor, not my taste. Combat was fun at times and tedious at others. Story was pretty good but pales in comparison to Red Dead given I had played it right before starting GoW. Graphics were beautiful and the characters were great, but the game eventually left me bored and I just couldn’t with it anymore."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,It’s funny because that’s how I feel about GoW
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"> I can’t think of anything wrong with God Of War 2018.

The gearing mechanics were weak. Stats and bonuses were essentially irrelevant because the level scaling was so ridiculous that all that mattered was whether or not an item caused your overall level to go up. If an enemy was your level +X all of its attacks would one-shot you.

Great game. But no game's perfect."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,They really missed out on a boatload of cash by not having some kind of RDR port on that map. Id have bought it twice.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Dude that is the dream. Tlou style movement and shooting in rockstars incredible sandbox world building
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,When's the last time you played a PS1 game. That is an immense exaggeration.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,It can get behind RDR1 gameplay feeling better but Arthur journey is more emotional that jhon
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Yeah i managed to get him down, now to spend the next day fighting this dude on a horse"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,You’re in for a real treat with ME 1-3. One of the greatest stories in gaming.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I never understood the aversion to BOTW weapon breaking mechanics. There’s weapons littered everywhere, and you learn the spots that respawn with the blood moon. It’s fairly easy to end up with an inventory full of the top 10-5 strongest weapons in the game on accident more than anything (weapons 5-1 require some hunting and you generally won’t stumble across them in large quantities without specifically looking for them). Plus throwing a nearly broken weapon to get that crit explosion is great fun. Although, if we are being honest here, just play TOTK. It’s just the better version of BOTW, there’s almost no point to playing the original when the sequel has everything plus and incredible amount of density and actual dungeons, which BOTW is sorely lacking."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Best way to get over weapon breakage, is stop seeing weapons as a Skyrim weapon, and start treating them like Halo weapons. No one gets upset when their rocket launcher in Halo runs out ammo, no?

Weapons in botw aren't really weapons, they're ammo. If you can wrap your head around that, it becomes a lot easier to get over it."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Yeah, Botw influenced skyrim and yet somehow the devs of botw cited skyrim as a large influence, weird how that works.

https://nintendosoup.com/skyrim-influenced-legend-zelda-breath-wilds-development/"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"OWL also birthed some of the best casters in the industry (some of which now do other games)

Uber, Bren, and Sideshow are all S tier talent in the industry"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"You’re right, I don’t really play those other games so I wasn’t going to make a claim I didn’t know for sure but I had heard this was the case. The devs have also been listening to the complaints and this season adding the mythic shards is a huge QoL for the consumer. People still see that you *could* just buy the shards and get a full mythic skin for $70 and freaked out. That is STILL on the cheaper end and you can just complete the $10 battle pass and get a full mythic. Like yeah this type of monetization sucks and shouldn’t exist at all but here we are."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Oh yeah all the hours I spent minmaxing for mmos I should have gotten a phd in it.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I think because in a MMO min maxing is usually quite important . If you can squeeze a little bit of extra health out of a build or atk it can sometimes mean wipe or no wipe and a lot of times you don’t get a 2nd chance  at least on the day or for a few hours 

In a single player game there’s checkpoints everywhere in a lot of them so it either costs you a little time if you die or if the build is not min max  "
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Funny. I love reading forums. After hours of gameplay. Usually in down time when I can’t game for more than 30 minutes . 

That 1% drove me nuts in MMOs."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Idk about that, like I enjoy exploring Morrowind was great. Botw seemed to punish me for wanting to play more. I got this awesome weapon and I can't use it cause it's gonna break if I do. It just made me not want to play. The shrines where the first time I felt like a game was just map editor. Sure they had some cool ones but the puzzles felt very repetitive and boring several where just memorization puzzles which felt grindy at best. Like did I enjoy just chilling sure, but shadow of collosus did that way better."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,See that’s the thing I love Metroidvanias I love that sense of exploring I think it just comes down to the down time between stuff in BoTW caused me to lose focus and get bored compared to say something like hollow knight 
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Those secrets always turned out to be korok seeds for me
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"It's definitely the way they wrote Aloy. She's just not a likeable or compelling character. Abrasive by default, with limited opportunities to roleplay otherwise."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Even with the sequel they did such a great job of switching from kratos to atreus to make it feel seamless. 

The cinematic direction for those games was absolutely amazing"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"My favorite story ever in any game. Hell, it might be my favorite story ever. In books, TV or movies lol. 

I fucking cried man. I'm a ""traditionally masculine"" dude. I was shocked to feel the tears over a video game. I was going through an emotional rollercoaster in life though. My daughter's mom had left me to go date another dude after having cheated on me. 

I sat in an empty house taking care of my 8 month old daughter. Alone. Feeling the betrayal hard. I turned on the game to really escape life since I was basically suddenly a single father and couldn't turn to harmful vices. 

Oddly enough I'm loyal as a fucking dog so to see all the betrayal and absence of loyalty really got me in my feels lol.

Fucking great game."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"I’ve got to humbly this agree with you on this one, RDR2 is completely undermined by its terrible mission structure. The slow burn is phenomenal, but (for me) there is hardly memorable mission, everything I remember was outside of the core gameplay (journeying around, talking at the camp, getting a haircut etc). Rockstar dropped the ball by forcing players to only play ‘their way’ with no room for creativity. 

Whilst GoW lacks that grandness and deep systems that RDR2 has, it’s a complete a package with no weak spots."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,You’ve gotta finish GoW. Some of the best (and hardest) fights occur after you beat the main story.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"It's quite insane lol I play PS1 games often, and it's a flat-out wrong comparison. 

He should go play Tomb Raider 1, or any 3D ps1 game with fixed camera angles, back before twin-stick analog controls were a thing."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"That boss is what made me fall in love with the game. By the end of him, I knew for a fact that the only way I was going to get through this game was by mastering every single move from every single boss, and anything short of that would be my death. There are no accidental wins, and that means every boss feels absolutely fantastic to beat."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Ironically, unless you are role-playing as a warmonger, you won't find yourself empty of weapons. After spending hours to max my pouch, I ended up beating Ganon with just a savage lynel bow and the master sword."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"> I got this awesome weapon and I can't use it cause it's gonna break if I do.

This is one instance where I feel like Nintendo's devs made a terrible call, but believed they knew better, and so stuck to their guns.  I replayed _BotW_ recently with a hack that eliminated weapon wear and it made the whole thing ***vastly*** more fun.  That really says it _all._

_BotW_ had quite a number of missteps that pushed me away, though.  I strongly disliked how even though there were treasure chests hidden away in every corner, _and_ they didn't stupidly respawn after a while, literally none of them had anything unique so it was fairly pointless to find them... a point underscored resoundingly by the facts that 1) the game doesn't maintain any kind of tally, and 2) some chests are bugged and literally unreachable.  If Nintendo doesn't care, how am I expected to care?"
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Botw is clearly not a metroidvania. The exploration is less focused on having to do something and more focused on curiosity and rewarding that sense of curiosity with something - acave, a korok seed, a shrine. Those things aren't always useful and hardly ever required but make it seem like you found something. Comparing that sense of exploration to a metroidvania where your exploration is rewarded with upgrades that make you more combat efficient, well, yeah, you're going to feel like the exploration is useless when you're not getting a tangible benefit. You're not exploring for the sake of exploring in that style of game."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"I love how it also makes it feel like a greek play in parts, with how as the audience you see everything ""Live"" in front of you and will never cut away to see something important.

It also helps in ragnarok make it seem like a tragedy, as Kratos heads towards his death not being able to change it, only the throw you off that he actually does change his fate and avoid the tragedy."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21, I cried too. That game took over my consciousness. And when he thanked his fucking horse...it almost broke me.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Hard disagree. I mean who doesn't remember 4/5 of the gang walking up to the plantation house looking for John's boy? Or fighting your way out of Valentine after Cornwall confronted Dutch? Or trying to rob the bank in Saint Denis and it all going so disastrously wrong? I mean,  tons of missions in RDR2 are cinematic masterpieces in their own right."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"Most people seem to agree that GoW deserves the game of the year spot, so definitely don’t blame you. I just realllllly vibed with RDR2, and it’s probably one of the best games I’ve ever played. It’s all personal preference! I’m glad they both exist, and I was able to play both."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"Seconded.  That moment when your gang all surrounded the plantation is one of the most memorable things I've ever done in a video game.  Even some of the minor missions, like when you get sent to check on Micah (Fuck Micah), and end up shooting up half of Strawberry. I adored RDR2 in a way I have with no other game.

I've played Witcher 3 three times, and it's my game from the list provided.  But RDR2 is the best game I've played in the last 20 years.    God of War winning GotY over it feels a bit like Forest Gump over the Shawshank Redemption to me.  I liked Forest Gump, and I've seen it more than once....but Shawshank is on a whole other level.  Same situation."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Most especially Arthur riding back to Shady Belle to Unshaken. Or Marston going on his mountain rampage on the way to a bit of revenge with a nice electric guitar accompaniment. There are so many moments in that game that I still think about.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,[deleted]
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,It’s crazy that God of War is rightfully in contention for game of the decade but also simultaneously there’s a real argument it shouldn’t have won game of the year. Two all time great games in 2018.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-20,"RDR2 is way more memorable. I don't remember anything from GoW that stands out, other than being bored by the combat."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,Fuck Micah. Snake ass bitch.
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,"My friend and I were talking about this last night, how the epilogue was basically a second game with 10 hours of story. He was like, “i guess you could say that, but you could probably skip the epilogue and not miss much,” and I said, “but you have to kill Micah!” He made a face and was like, “oh yeah, you have to kill fucking Micah.”

Such a great and memorable antagonist when you still absolutely hate the man six years later."
1c8zg2t,2024-04-20,2024-04-21,I wish I could do it all again for the first time.

18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"> Shame we can't get a new game before they start selling a sloghtly updated old game.

SONY has released 13 original titles since TLOU2 came out in 2020. The idea that they are just releasing remasters and remakes is so patently false, you have to wonder what the point of a thread like this is.

. . .other than to demonstrate that folks don't understand ""demand drives bidness"" of course."
18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"I don’t understand why people are so annoyed by this. Ghost of Tsushima did this at the launch of the PS5, when it was less than a year old. So did lots of games. Spider-Man, Death Stranding, FF 7 Remake… the list is really long actually. If anything I’m just annoyed it took this long.

Hell, Atlus have already done this 3x with Persona 5 and they make you buy the full game each time."

18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,People are being so fucking stupid about this. It’s about creating parity and having native PS5 versions of both games. Wanna bet Part III will be on PS5 as well?
18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"When I got a PS4 in 2018, when God of War came out I had a gigantic number of exclusives to play. It was 2 years of amazing gaming.

I want to get a PS5 on the same idea. But so far, I have absolutely no reason to get a PS5 apart from 1 or 2 exclusives, and I think the fact will remain until 2015... or later? I don't know."

18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"If you keep buying this, you will keep getting this.

I hear every here and then that people demand remasters, remakes, reboots of old games. Then wonder you get this for the same price of a new release."

You’re just being upset because of the name « remaster ». Your brain can’t process the fact that it’s not really a remaster. It’s a next-gen patch with some added content."

It was cut for length and ""poor taste,"" but I think it is a better demonstration of the catalyst that turns Ellie into a murderous, bloodthirsty psychopath who brutally massacres all those who crosses her path of gory rampage.  

Seeing Joel only sort of, kinda get bludgeoned to death doesn't feel commensurate with the death and pain Ellie inflicts afterwards. Creates that pervasive _ludo-narrative dissonance_ plaguing many of Naughty Dog® games."

If it wasn’t for remakes, ND (and other studios like it) would fire half their staff while their next one is in preproduction. It gives people at ND a steady job where they don’t have to worry that they’ll lose their jobs as soon as a game gets shipped."

It's one thing to cancel a game but it's a whole other thing to brag about a game, tease a game, and whisper cute little nothings about a game on social media for years and to then just cancel a game because they're worried about it requiring work.

It's the stringing along that sucks."

18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,Fans feel like it's a money grab when you re-release a game that isn't that old and still looks pretty good even though it was released on a previous gen.
18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"The most words added to a street fighter game that isnt anniversary edition are 4 and thats a whole different game. The rest are 2 words extra and most are just 1 extra prefix. So it confuses me that you some how think theres a street fighter title thats is that extreme. Seems like bias to me but its more fun watching people get pressed about sony titles than anything else.

Btw the title for that 4 extra word street fighter is Ultra Street Fighter II: The Final Challengers and is a completely reblanced version of a 20+ year old game. Again most other are 1-3 and most have edition which is pretty ubiquitous with stuff like goty and complete and anniversary."
18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,Well said

18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"Honestly the canned multiplayer is probably the greatest indication the studio might actually make something new.

They made a clear choice to stop going down the live-service route they had been pushed down. It's pretty obvious there was a mandate for them to ride TLoU into the ground from its popularity, and they may finally be breaking out of that.

One can hope, anyway."

18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"I'm sick of remasters. I already bought and completed the game. It's tiring and boring and lazy. The monthly PS games have sucked recently, and they increased the price ridiculously. It's not just TLOU2, but this is a first party Sony game, you know, the reason why I have a PS5. Not really much to look forward to on that front."

18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,Because Sony have to make up for the fact they have nothing first party to announce for awhile. Why people didn't catch that
18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,I felt like the true reason why it was cancelled because TLOU Part II didn't perform well enough to guarantee Faction 2's success.
18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,It’s not like they planned to cancel it 💀💀
18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,And you are a problem for doing it. Imagine pre ordering a digital product.

Tbf to the street fighter games at least their rereleases are different enough to warrant an actual release. Tlou and skyrim have literally just been releasing the same game for the past 8 or so years. Its like sony got a ton of praise for a few of their games and are milking those ip’s  until they trip into another one to then bleed.
18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,You forget about gta v dude
18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"How many times has TLOUp2 actually been rereleased though? I've tried to google it but can just find the original release, the special edition release, and one announced upcoming remaster."
18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"I loved one and two, probably my favourite games ever. My annoyance is the fact effort is being wasted on remastering a very complete and beautiful game. My annoyance is the fact that years after the ps5 released there’s very few good big games for it, and studios seem to be putting more effort into rereleasing old games than coming up with good new ones."
18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,Why? Nobody has to buy it.
18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,It only costs $10 if you already have the original version. I think that’s different from asking people to buy it full price again.
18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,I don't feel like it's a money grab when the upgrade costs me 10 bucks which is also just how much more games cost now

18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,You think?
18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,It was. They did an official statement. Basically “we wanted this to be live service but if we did that we wouldn’t have time and resources for our single player games”
18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-20,"No way in hell they are not making Part 3, specially how well received the HBO show was."
18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"They have stated several times recently that they are working on multiple unannounced games. I’m hoping for TLOU3 and a new IP, personally."
18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"That’s not how that works. 

Basically departments like Q&A don’t have anything to do in the early stages of development so that’s why they would always fire that whole department during that stage. 

So you can either do one full scale game and a smaller scale one to keep that department busy or you can somehow fund two full scale games at the same time. That second one isn’t possible in the slightest way when you know how huge the dev team and budget is for a full scale game. TLoU2 had a reported budget of $220m so they’d have to basically double their team to a cost of nearly $500m. 

It’s not possible and it’s just something a person on reddit can type in without any accountability. Current gen games (let alone PS6 etc games) take so much manpower to make that it’s either the B team works on remasters (a la ND) or DLC (a la Guerrilla games and Studio Santa Monica). Or the B team gets fired. 

A $10 TLoU2 remaster seems like a pretty harmless compromise all things considered."
18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"This is literally just gonna be a next gen upgrade, and all of the other ones are either free or cost ten bucks to upgrade, and the new mode is pretty much a dlc.

18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"I think it was Jason Schreier that said the reason there’s so many remakes is cause that’s what the other half of the studio can work on while the A team is making the next proper title. 

If it wasn’t for remakes, ND (and other studios like it) would fire half their staff while their next one is in preproduction like video game studios always do. It gives people at ND a steady job where they don’t have to worry that they’ll lose their jobs as soon as a game gets shipped."
18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"Did people ask for the over hundred other games that got upgrades?

18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,If no one asked for it how are they squeezing out money? Clearly people must want the remasters or no one would be buying them. People don't buy things they don't want.
18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"So? **Lots of people don’t buy every generation of console.** Lots of people have never played these games. Also, the games that get remakes and remasters are generally the best of their generation—lots of people are happy to have even graphical updates to their favorite games that take advantage of more advanced hardware than was available at the time of the original release. Lots of people weren’t old enough to play these games when they were first released. There is obviously a market for this stuff and the fact that *you* don’t understand it is *your* problem.

Nobody is forcing you to buy anything. Nobody is forcing you to buy a PS5 if you don’t think the catalog is worth it. Nobody is forcing you to play remakes or remasters. There are tons of other games to play

For instance, the last console I owned was as PS3. I’ve always been predominantly a PC gamer and as of that generation, when the vast majority of  AAA titles became a multiplatorm releases (much to many PC gamers’ dismay, by the way) I felt like there wasn’t much value in owning a console. The only selling point was a handful of exclusives like The Last of Us or Bloodborne that I missed. I was very happy to play The Last of Us and Spider-Man remastered on PC. And, having recently purchased a PS5, I’m excited for remakes and remasters of other amazing titles I missed."
18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"Dude, you misunderstood something terribly... 
Remakes and remasters are two different things, and I think remakes are good, while remasters are lazy. TLOU1 is a remake, not bad, but too soon, while TLOU2 is just a remaster for only 10$ for those who have the base game."
18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"GOW Ragnarok has sold 15 million copies. With a VERY positive reception
Valhalla costed a lot of money to make, since it includes a lot of new stuff, from voice acting, mechanics, a weapon, new boss fights, new enemies, new music etc.
They couldve sold it for $10 or even $20, make their money back, and still make dozens of millions in profit if even just 10-20% of the 15 million players bought it.

Do you really think they would pass on such a profit just to look good because they dont have anything huge coming soon?
This was more of a slap to the face of a greedy industry. This DLC just made MW3, TLOU2 Remastered and even short-ish games like Spider-man 2 look like greedy cashgrabs tbh, and I hope lots of studios realize what an image boost something like this can be."

TLOU2 released in 2020 and is getting its remaster in 2024."
18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"If you want good games for the PS5 you should be happy we're getting Remasters of last gen games. Games on that level take 5+ years to develop and cost millions of dollars. If we weren't getting these, there's be even fewer PS5 titles."
18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"Nobody really wanted it either. The game came out just a few years ago, and it's still looks great. It looks better, but it could've been a single patch. It just isn't worth 70$ price tag. Sony has a lot of cool games that desperately NEED ANYTHING done with them, like Bloodborne. So it is a very weird choice of game to remaster."
18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"because time, money and resources could be spent at doing something else, I dunno, like a new game or something?"
18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"That's true. But if you don't have the game you'd have to spend 70 dollars for a copy for a title that isn't actually new. 

I feel like even with the visual upgrade it should be 40-50 dollars for someone picking it up for the first time."
18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,Well yeah it'd have to go first person. The 3rd person vr games are typically platformers with some hack n slash elements. And it's more of a top down view than over the shoulder.
18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,Except Naught Dog has actually done that before. Uncharted 3 and The Last Of Us were in development at the same time.

>It’s not possible and it’s just something a person on reddit can type in without any accountability. 

They do, and what an silly statement. 

Studios often have multiple teams capable of working independently on different titles.

That we can agree on."
18lpyms,2023-12-19,2023-12-19,"this shows a huge misunderstanding of how development works though, QA aren't developers, they can't ""develop"" a small game lol"

You don’t represent every use case. To say “nobody” wants is is objectively false. Lots of people want it, and lots of people will buy it. If you don’t, you don’t have to.

That’s when they usually fire that crew until that side of production ramps up later in development. ND and studios like it give them work on a remaster or things like that so they can keep them on the team perpetually. 

What you’re referring to is a B studio. That used to be feasible back in the PS3/360 generation but it’s becoming more rare since developing a game takes so much longer and is so much more expensive and takes so much more manpower. 

We’re talking adding hundreds of extra devs to get ND to make two full scale games at the same time. We always criticize devs for biting off way more than they can choose and ND is taking smart steps to keep themselves contained to just one major project at a time + one remaster or DLC or maybe patches (like that TLoU2 60fps patch from last year)."

I agree. My question is more if TLOU2 stands out as particularly egregious in this regard. The reason Skyrim gets poked fun at for it is just *how* much it's been released - original in 2011, then rereleases in '13, '16, twice in '17, then '18, and '21; seven times in a 10 year period, compared to TLOU1's four times.

Also, 'every 4 years' is a weird framing when the sample size of 4-year intervals is ***1***. A game doesn't need a rerelease *after* 4 years seems like a more reasonable framing, that I still agree with."

18uncj6,2023-12-30,2023-12-30,Yea and those ps3 mechanics are still better than cods. Are you forgetting cod is still using the core mechanics from their ps3 games?

18uncj6,2023-12-30,2023-12-31,"That was the remaster made in 2014, basically a ps3 game. The one in the post is a remake, they made the game from scratch."
18uncj6,2023-12-30,2023-12-30,"In the future i think i will, but might be around the time they eventually put part 2 on pc and do a run-through of both. Might be able to upgrade the pc by then and make it look much nicer. Either way as long as it's better now thats always a good thing."
18uncj6,2023-12-30,2023-12-31,"It's playable now, sure, but far from flawless."
18uncj6,2023-12-30,2023-12-30,Only thing similar is uncharted In my opinion. It's difficult to describe it similarly to other games. It's very story intense and has a lot of quiet moments interspersed with fun gameplay. Guns feel good and like you're shooting something powerful. Enemy ai is decent for the most part. I play it on grounded which gets rid of listening mode but it's incredibly difficult but very rewarding. I'd say easily a game worth trying. Especially as you can get it relatively cheap.
18uncj6,2023-12-30,2023-12-31,"I have 10 GB VRAM. It definitely struggled. It's not like I was trying to do 4K.

I cried a little when I had to go for the refund."
18uncj6,2023-12-30,2023-12-30,"To be fair I didn’t run into many of them either, I think Ellie glitched through the map at one point but apart from that it was DLSS’s fault. Mainly the performance was dogshit. Game looked crisp though."
18uncj6,2023-12-30,2023-12-31,It's definitely not under rated. Its got very high ratings from critics but a ton of fans however hated it.
18uncj6,2023-12-30,2023-12-30,I wish they’d kept the original intro
18uncj6,2023-12-30,2023-12-30,Arguably a lot of genres have regressed from that point
18uncj6,2023-12-30,2023-12-30,Um the levels I guess.
18uncj6,2023-12-30,2023-12-30,CS is using the mechanics from 20 years ago. Not sure what you'd change about mp shooters which would be innovative. Remember when they tried doing something new in CoD? Didn’t go too well for them.
18uncj6,2023-12-30,2023-12-31,Not according to Steam reviews.
18uncj6,2023-12-30,2023-12-31,"When i say high i mean 16gb haha, the game just chews vram at higher resolutions and settings"
18uncj6,2023-12-30,2023-12-31,"That’s what I mean though. I really didn’t make that clear, admittedly.  Most people I know that’s it. Only issue I took with it was the epilogue was completely unnecessary. Felt like filler in a game that definitely didn’t need any filler."
18uncj6,2023-12-30,2023-12-31,"ehhh no not really, CS2 plays so different from 1.6 it's a bit crazy. Every CS iteration actually, they are known for changing ""too much"""
18uncj6,2023-12-30,2023-12-31,">Remember when they tried doing something new in CoD? Didn’t go too well for them.

Advanced Warfare, Black Ops 3 and Infinite Warfare were the #1 best selling games of 2014, 2015 and 2016 (at least in the US).

Black Ops 4 was #2, and that's only because that was the year Red Dead Redemption 2 released.

The shift in gameplay focus went fine for them. None of them were flops like Ghosts was, which *didn't* really try anything new."
18uncj6,2023-12-30,2023-12-31,">They fixed it.

I can say it's fixed as someone playing it right now and recent reviews are very positive on Steam."
18uncj6,2023-12-30,2023-12-31,I think I have 5 lol I can’t use the HD graphics option in Far Cry New Dawn because it goes over the VRAM limit. I’ll probably need to upgrade all of my hardware in a year or so. Might even just look at forming out for a proper gaming PC instead of buying parts like I did last time.
18uncj6,2023-12-30,2023-12-31,"I guess you're right. The thing with CS is that the changes aren’t even that big, but slight differences in movement, economy etc. can have major impact on how the game is played."
18uncj6,2023-12-30,2023-12-31,Alright I might give it a go. Can always refund if it turns out to be a doozy.
18uncj6,2023-12-30,2023-12-31,"For the record, check the new FSR3 mod replacing DLSS 3. It actually saved many players with mid hardware like you and works on everything. Let's say you get 30 fps, it literally doubles your fps and  makes game playable."
18uncj6,2023-12-30,2023-12-31,"It’s still playable, I just couldn’t use the new retexture. I can play most games, just not at peak, modern graphics.

I had a look at some builds earlier. To get a relatively current one with 16gb of vram, I’m looking at a 4080 and associated hardware. Which runs at around $4k. I can afford it. I just can’t bring myself to justify actually spending that much."

epopmo,2020-01-16,2020-01-18,Your welcome
epopmo,2020-01-16,2020-01-18,"So what your saying is that because you see some giraffes alive, that must mean none are being killed for food?"
epopmo,2020-01-16,2020-01-18,"I made no such absolute generalization about giraffes. Don't be daft.

First off, the 1 giraffe you interact with in the game has obviously never seen humans pose any kind of threat to itself or its kind. Go try and pet a whitetail deer once to see how it'd react otherwise.

Second, look at the ""meat ledger"" artifact you find in the game. That shows they almost certainly never hunted a single giraffe. Why you ask? The months with under 800-1000lbs of meat means whatever the source was, it was too small to be an adult giraffe.Those giraffes would've been the easiest prey available with the greatest payout per kill. Anyone with a hunting rifle could have and anyone with a brain *definitely would have* picked them off 1 by 1 before resorting to eating people, something they clearly were already doing."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Brilliant review, think I agree with virtually everything you said.

In a lot of ways, Outlaws reminds me of Assassin's Creed 1 in that the game has a lot of potential to be brilliant and even sets a mostly great foundation, and for those first few hours is incredibly fun and immersive - but then you get over the novelty of existing in this world and realize the game itself isn't all that great, it struggles to establish it's identity, there's quite a few broken systems, mechanics don't feel fine tuned, and the world feels quite barren. 

I'd love to see a sequel, I think now a foundation has been set of what a Ubisoft open world Star Wars game plays like, they can put their entire focus into making a great game - but I feel like for the gameplay loop they're going for, they should focus less on Uncharted kr Red Dead and maybe look at something like Deus Ex: Human Revolution or Hitman 2016 for inspiration on how to handle stealth"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"I agree with pretty much everything you said, OP. Tatooine stuck out to me when I was in Mos Eisley at how lifeless it felt. There were NPCs but you didn't get the sense they were living their lives, they were all just standing in place like theme park animatronics. It was so strange I've never experienced anything like that before. It felt like an abandoned town."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Man, remember when reviews were completely honest like this, and were written to give an unbiased opinion & impression on a game for anyone out there to read.

Thanks a lot for taking the time to post this, OP!"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,I just always have to thunk of MGS V when it comes to a stealth game like this and that was like what 10 years ago? How comes ubisoft didn't manage to make anything even close to that in terms of gameplay. So much wasted potential.
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"I agree. The more you play, the more the core gameplay is just kind of boring...it's decent, it has it's moments (esp during story missions) but almost all the side stuff is so routine. The Ubisoft genes really show themselves here. Story is also not super exciting, probably because of the all the distractions. I might have a different opinion if I just played the main story, but you'd be at a serious disadvantage.

I think I may just stop playing. Tried it on Ubisoft+ and got a good 15 hours in it. Really don't think I'll be missing out on much. Def not as fun as the Jedi games, IMO. their gameplay loop was much better."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"> these are two of the game’s four planets and they feel like single biomes (really, all the planets were, I came to realize)

Every planet in Star Wars is a single biome for some reason. It’s tradition. 

Personally I’ve been loving it. The stealth can be pretty challenging at times but the AI hasn’t seemed broken to me. You just have to be careful about sight lines and the sounds you make while moving. Exploring every planet has felt immersive and more like I’m in the Star Wars universe than any other SW game I’ve played. Personally I’ve been enjoying it a ton."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,I agree mostly with everything but I don’t get your take that everything has to be ‘beautiful’. It just doesn’t.
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"I'm about 10 hours in, and I've enjoyed it so far. I'll mimic what you said, but I'm still a fan. The biggest glaring frustration is getting to a place on the map. The cliffs make it such a chore to go anywhere."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Very good review! I was hoping to hear a good spoiler free opinion on this before I tried it, and this has convinced me to wait until its discounted. Loved the Jedi games, but I generally think that Respawn is a better developer than Ubisoft anyway. Sad to hear it suffers from some of the same chronic flaws as the Assassin's Creed games, but I'm glad to have been forewarned. 


My only complaint was going to be that for a Starwars fan, you seem pretty consistent in your unforgivable insistence that Starwars is two words. That said, I looked it up and discovered that in fact I was the one who is wrong, and thus my entire worldview is irrevocably shattered and I have you to blame. 9/10 review. One point removed for forcing me to feel shame and disgust."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"I think that’s my issue as to why I haven’t bought the game myself.

I was a fan of Ubisoft for years dating back to the days of splinter cell. Assassins creed and Far Cry were major games that really brought something new to the community but I started to notice a pattern that every time Ubisoft find a formula that works they just stick with it. Assassin creed games all feel the same as well as far cry now. I skipped on avatar because I knew it would just be a reskin of far cry and reading the reviews I wasn’t completely wrong. 

Looking at this Star Wars game I really wanted to be wrong and believe it was going to be something new but it just feels like all the other Ubisoft games. If you really peel back the face of Star Wars and see it as a neutral entity it’s really no different to their other stuff, it’s because it’s Star Wars we feel that wanting/connection to it. 

I could honestly have a game thrown in front of me and know it was a Ubisoft game simply by how it played."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,I just got to the blandness recently and read this comment. Good on you for sticking with it. Very helpful review!
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,">But these are two of the game’s four planets and they feel like single biomes (really, all the planets were, I came to realize)

This is a feature of Star Wars in general. Most of the planets seen throughout all the media are single biome worlds: a city planet, an ocean planet, a forest planet, a desert planet, a rocky planet, a swamp planet, an ice planet. There's even a cloud planet.

One of the few notable exceptions is Naboo, where we get to see verdant plains, a forest and an ocean."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Before I get mass downvoted, please forgive my lack of game development knowledge or graphics is general.

When I play ubi games I am very shocked at the detail and poor character models. I played 
Mirage and the cutscenes, NPCs and other characters apart from basim were very very crap.

GTA V has been out for a long time but that game is somehow a better looking game? 

Can someone help explain how that is possible. Are the mechanics in mirage, outlaws that exist that take up valuable resources that gta doesn’t have so they can dedicate that to better character rendering? 

Additionally if we take a very high quality game like RDR2 or Horizon FW or Cyberpunk and combine them to make a hybrid perfect open world game will there be a time in the future that even the worse hardware available will run the game and still look very good? 

Is that how graphics and GPU can eventually develop?"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"While I appreciated the world and the design of being more sneaky than combat, the stealth felt boring."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"It’s okay, in the words of the Zanman. Sometimes you have to play the 6s so the 10s hit harder."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,It has a few issues but other than that I have had a lot of fun with Star Wars Outlaws and I'm looking forward to the DLC.
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,">but that fun withered and I was very ready to put it down by the end

Unfortunately my experience with nearly every Ubi game in the last 10 years."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Hell of a review, thank you"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,It would be interesting if they took the license and made games in the different genres that Ubisoft makes games in like make a Far Cry version or the crew version for example
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Very much agreeing with your review so far, haven’t gotten to Akiva yet, but it seems pretty spot on.

One point about the biomes is that it sticks to the source material.

In Star Wars every planet is one biome. It’s dumb I know but that’s how it works 🤷‍♂️"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Kijimi is easily the weakest location in the game, and the fact that you can't leave the one small section of the city makes it even more so.

I really wish they hadn't felt the need to include Tattooine, but I get that they had to have Jabba, so there wasn't much of a way around that. Akira was interesting, but would have been better served if they had allowed us to traverse the jungle more, instead of just the established paths (more like Endor, I guess). I think there was definitely room to give us more in terms of locations, and I'm hoping we get more in the dlc, but we'll have to wait and see.

Gameplay seems solid, if a little shallow, and I feel the story makes up for some of the weaker design elements. Overall, I'm thoroughly enjoying it and I'm glad to see more of some of the lesser explored elements of Star Wars."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Man, this review is honest and that's what makes it stand out. Honestly better than other reviews that have to do with the main character's appearance as if it were the most important thing."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,Idk man. I’m not spending 35 hours in a 5.5 rated game
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,Review more games please.
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"TLDR: If you could still rent games, that's all this would be"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-15,When I saw reviews of the main character punching Storm trooper with helmets on along with stupid AI.  I just can’t play this game.  We are in 2024 I expect better.
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"I have noticed over the years that it feels like each segment is made by a different team of varying competence and quality. One section can be quite good, while others are atrocious"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Why has no one mentioned the cinematic black bars? My dude, removing them does NOT cut off the sides. Instead, it shows more of the top and bottom. It FEELS like the sides get cut off, because it's an effective visual trick, but the cinematic bars just show less info on the top and bottom, and doesn't show more on the sides."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"This subreddit has already made their minds up based on which opinions they upvote and which ones they silence or accuse of being paid accounts. Personally Outlaws was a flawed but nevertheless exciting entry that made me hopeful for a sequel. Nothing mindblowing, but still a good step forward for Ubisoft open-world design in how it organically encouraged exploration. 7/10"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"I think that's Ubisoft to a 'T.' To quote Hedberg: ""they're like pancakes; excited at the start but half-way through you're sick of 'em."""
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,I'm probably just going to wait for it to be on sale and hopefully by then it won't have so many issues
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"So basically your average Ubisoft game again.

Just as expected. Good review though, better than most game journalists 👍"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,I was excited for this game until I saw Ubisoft. Why do their games always look great in the previews but end up being so disappointing?
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"So I'm about 12 hours in with 12 days of + left and I feel almost exactly as you described. Maybe it's because I'm playing Astrobot where everything you do is satisfying and has fanfare but there's just no feeling of excitement or accomplishment. I feel like I accidentally completed the missions. Combat is like the same battle every time. 

Bummer, I had this pre downloaded and was hyped even though I shouldn't have been. And as you said, I don't really care about the characters or the story. Oh no I have a mark on my head and whine about nearly everything."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,So another classic Ubisoft game. 5/10 on release. 7/10 when it's fully fixed & on sale
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Thanks for the review 

I had it vaguely on a radar as someone who isn't much of a Star wars fan so it's probably not for me haha"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,In your opinion when this goes on sale what price point do you think would make it worth it?
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"My problem with the game was that they took ideas from different Ubisoft titles and threw them into a game with a Star Wars look. I think it is cool that something like this has happened as a Star Wars game, but the fact it took so long to make this game paired with how bare bones it is brings it down. Squadrons was similar; they had really cool ideas but were made at the basic level and never really progressed from there. The game is fun and immersive and all that, but I can't play for more than a couple of hours at a time."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"I enjoyed your review and thought it was fairly accurate to my experience. I was surprised you said you were enjoying the first couple of hours, though. To me, Outlaws has one of the weakest openings of a game I have ever played. It takes like two hours just to get to anything fun and they teach you about things you don't even do until hours later."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,Maybe one day for 10€.
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"“and they feel like single biomes”

Well, yes. That’s Star Wars."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,Definitely good to know as I’ve been considering getting this title
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,Парни зайдите ко мне в профиль помогите найти игру пожалуйста!!
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"I'm playing it though Ubi+ and I'm glad I didn't spend $70 on it. As far as I'm concerned, it's been a nice digital rental and nothing else. I wish there was more to it than ""Arrive in enemy territory, sneak around questionable AI, go loud when you're caught and dealing with average shooting mechanics, rinse and repeat"" though."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"I've unlocked the endgame but haven't started it but so far your review feels very spot on. The game is fine, not amazing. And I generally tend to turn my brain off and enjoy the Ubisoft open world design but here I just can't. At this point I'll do the side missions to get some of the gear but that's it. Definitely felt a drop off after Toshara."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,Sounds like a wait for gamepass. Cheers
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"This game screamed wait for a discount to me, not terrible but also not worth more than 30-40 EUR."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"I concur to this review, felt exactly the same way."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Basically my thoughts on the game without the excitement part of the beginning. The game had amor of potential to be pretty interesting. Made a video on it but the fact they didn’t give you faction abilities depending on which one you choose was a missed opportunity. Hell even making your own faction, in the beginning of the game you steal some identification cards and could of been used to set up a figure head to an organization you build through the game taking territory and buildings from other factions while also working for them as Kay Vess. Not being able have your own load out and gear sucked and just relied on your blaster and whatever you picked up along way was cool but odd. Your blaster has unlimited ammo but…this didn’t? Odd, I do feel like the maps could have been better and yeah you could eat with nix, gamble and enjoy the scenery but that’s really it. Your not an outlaw, your just a survivor who happens to do some illegal stuff to survive. You aren’t a bad person at heart and even though towards the end of the game Kay grows up a little, we all know if it wasn’t for plot she would be dead in the underworld. ND or MD I’d say which means major disappointment, was just a generic character that could be replaced with anyone. No one really had my interest and everything was bland and continues to be so as I played the game. Nothing epic happened nothing great, things just happened without any real build up or incredible displays to elevate anything"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"It's crazy to me how they could have just given us a literal Assassins Creed game with a Star Wars skin and chose not to, same thing with Black Flag and that other pirate game they just tried to release. Just reskin AC games at this point, it's a good skeleton. Set it in Coruscant, Templars are the Empire, Assassins are Rebels or Jedi in hiding, horses are speeders, lightsaber hidden blade, force jumping across rooftops, it fucking writes itself."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Agree with every word of this review, especially after playing the Jedi games. 

The worlds in Jedi are so much better, the action sequences are crazy, and while outlaws is fun it just falls flat in comparison. 

Way to much sneaking around, and that even feels arbitrary"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,Damn. I tapped out after 5 hours. Couldn’t do another minute.   Bravo sticking this junk out.
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,You didn't mention that AI in this game feels horrible. Why?
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,For someone planning to play this game in a year or so... Anyone know if the devs are gonna add more content to it?
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,That is a lot of effort to say it's the only thing that could've come out of the profane collab of Disney and Ubisoft.
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,This review reads like the game plays.
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"i guessed the ending during the first story mission lol. playing this game was such a fucking chore, it looks like shit and plays like it too. i have serious buyer's remorse, worst 80e i've ever spent."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-15,I got a free copy of it.  Been playing it a bit here and there.  All I can say is I'm glad it was free....
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-15,Vent crawling simulator. I hated the forced stealth sections when I would accidentally fuck up I couldn’t understand why I wasn’t able to just pull out the blaster.
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-15,Anybody else with there were more Sabac games with higher stakes? Loved the Lando one but I feel like any other table wasnt worth it after a while because of how little credits you win. Would have loved to take on someone at the Canto casino.
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-15,So you play a dirty outlaw but the only crimes you can commit are pickpocketing the evil police officers? Wow how brave
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-15,"ND-5 is the broest bro who’s ever broed in a galaxy far far away.

No apologies. Only gratitude."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-16,"Buy Ubisoft games, expect Ubisoft gameplay and writing. *Barren and bland, like a bone dry piece of unseasoned chicken* only difference is I’d get far more out of the chicken, as I don’t need video games to sustain myself being alive."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-17,I really do not understand the backlash against this game.
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-25,I'm only a few hours in. Got the space ship and a few missions past. This has the same feeling as the newest assassin's creed game (forget the name right now). I enjoy it so far and I like the underpowered feel of both games. I know with that AC game it eventually just feels like you're running around as a ghost in a city where everybody wanders around aimlessly
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-11-06,"It is a good read, good to keep in the back of ones mind.  
simultaneously, I'm also unphased about looking into still geting it.  
I've seen/read this review, some footage from a lets-play sort of channel and I like what I see so far. As someone who hasn't basically ever played anything particularly Ubisoft (hell, I don't even know what comes from them really) I can't speak to the ""commonalities"" with other ubi-games and therefore also wont be bogged down by them. I suppose in a way it could be refreshing for me."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2025-01-11,"I really really really want to love this game but it’s just so underwhelming. I’ve made it 14 hours in and every time I try to go back to play, I’d rather just play something else. I hope they maybe come out with some gigantic update in a couple of years and make this game more playable, but I’m not having fun and it feels stale."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"I mean, I've put about 30 hours into the game and just got started on the 3rd planet. To rush the whole game in 32 hours makes me think you didn't do any side content. There's a ton of nooks and crannies to get into that are only accessible during side missions.

It's a perfectly fun game, no masterpiece or anything but the absolute drought of decent Star Wars games during the EA ownership period left a lot to be desired. Sure the main character is one dimensional, the era that the game takes place in has been done a bunch of times, the gameplay is simple, but not every game has to be an absolute masterpiece.

They have a good formula to work with for sequels.  This wasnt just a Star Wars skinned Assassin's Creed, and I appreciate that the maps aren't full with a ton of bloat and I actually like doing the side missions."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Heartily disagree with most of this. The game is great, not perfect, but absolutely definitely not a fucking 5. To me this is more of an 8.5

The game has had so much unnecessary criticism... Because it's both star wars and Ubisoft it's over criticised.

The game is fucking great."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,Love star wars sort of game I'll pick up on sale for a fiver
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"The game looks as mediocre as you can get.

Plus star wars sucks now. No thank you"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"IMO, this review seems to tell me that it this game was made for ""when it hits steam, gives just enough gameplay to fulfill past the 2 hr no return policy""."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,Ubislop
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"'Open world' is a marketing tool. 
Nothing more."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Very refreshing in depth review, and honestly you kinda mirror my feelings about the game.

The first impression for me was good, and the world was very interesting to look at as a star wars fan, but the more I played, the more I saw that everything gameplay related is just meh. Everything. And what you look at becomes less and less impressive.

I agree with your final score of 5.5, honestly very refreshing to see an actual thoughout review of a videogame that regardless of taste on it, it takes effort trying to discern what it did right and what it did wrong as objectively as possible.

I personally truly thanked Ubisoft + this time, because for 10 bucks I got to play the game and realized that I would have been way more bummed put if I had paid 70-80 bucks, since I dont think there is anything in this game to justify the price."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"I agree with a lot here. It took me about 50 hours or so to roll credits, and by the final series of missions I was ready for it to be over.

I had a great time playing, but there are definitely things that hold this game back. Some technical that can be fixed, but others are by design.

Knowing this was made by Massive, I expected the gunplay to feel like The Division. But the gunplay in Outlaws was one of its weakest parts IMO.

Again, I really had fun playing, but this game could have been so much better. I’d rate it a solid 7/10."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Thank you for this honest review. I am very picky on video games when I play them and have a lot of buyers regret when they come out. I love the last Jedi game but was hesitant on this one due to reviews. I won’t be buying it now after reading this.

Astro Bot it is."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"I haven’t played it yet but have played a ton of Ubisoft games and not to sound like an instant “Ubisoft bad” person but this sounds exactly like how some of their other recent releases have played out for me. I’ve finished the main stories of AC Origins and Odyssey + their DLCs, Avatar, and the three most recent Far Crys. Everything you said about it being kind of novel and even pretty great for the first while before realizing it’s just the same over and over with some new bells and whistles and things show their cracks further in rings true for me and it’s a shame to hear it’s the same here."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,I seem to have had a more positive experience with the game and enjoyed it more than you but you’ve explained your thoughts very well. Everyone is different and don’t like the same things but it’s how you say it rather than just pile on hate etc so fair play
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"You nailed it, and why I stopped playing. I haven't even flown the ship yet. The jumping and attempt to climb terrain is awful. The voice acting and animation are even off, which is ridiculous for a supposed AAA title in 2024. It was made with love sure, but just not well. It's just frustrating and bland."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"This was a great review! 

I really appreciated how into the Star Wars universe the game got you pulled in.

For me though, your sections about the gameplay are probably enough for me to skip this one personally. And for how much discussion there is about Ubisoft formula. I tend to agree, they start out pretty fun.

But once the formula becomes really apparent, then it takes you out of the world and feels like a checklist, great review!"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,Repetitive and limited with little to no excitement? Yes you are describing an Ubisoft open world game.
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,Seven word review: Ubisoft red flag. Wait for discount bin.
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,Im shocked that the Ubisoft game had 0 depth and shitty gameplay…
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Mauler breaking and laughing his ass off at what happens at the end really sold me on this game.


I'm about 5 hours in. That AI is atrocious, but I quite like the mindless loop of looting treasure and building rep. I'm sure I'll finish it."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,I believe Angry Joe scores 5's as average and 6's as slightly above average. Would you say that's accurate to your review? It's just average?
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Didn't call it best game ever, obviously a woman hater."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,[removed]
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Really appreciate the write up, well done, too. Thanks. 

Not really unexpected though, Ubisoft isn’t exactly known for pushing boundaries or anything these days. Same tired formula, year after year. I’m honestly surprised to hear that this game is as deep as it was with the factions and such, but beyond that, seems par for the course for Ubisoft. They haven’t evolved much since the heyday of Assassin’s Creed, imo."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Game is an 8/10 for $18 Ubisoft+ 1 month. There is zero replayability and unless they do something absolutely insane with the DLCs, those won't be worth coming back for, at least for those that went the $18 Ubisoft+ route. It's easy to be more forgiving when playing a game for such a cheap price but if I would've paid for the $129.99 price tag for the Ultimate Edition I would not have been very forgiving at all."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,Thanks for this.  I loved Uncharted.  It sounds like the passion/leadership faded in the development of the game.
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,I haven't tried the game and won't even tried it simply because I see a footage of a girl can knock out a full armored stormtrooper with a single punch and the enemies became suddenly blind when we hide in a bushes directly in front of them. It's just so stupid lol
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,Just another Ubisoft game.
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"It sounds like you have played Ubisoft's other mediocre games. Out of curiosity, why did you pay full price for this game and expect it to be any different? "
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"The general vibe that I’ve been getting is that the game is decent. It’s playable, it is possible to have fun, and I’m sure Star Wars super fans would enjoy it. However, it has glaring issues, and looks like an $20 Xbox 360 game. Is it worth $70? Probably not. Could it have been so much better? Absolutely. if it goes on sale and you need a new random game, give it a shot"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Yup, I agree with everything you've said here. It was more like a puzzle than an open world map. The only part I didn't like about the jedi games was the excessive climbing to navigate the map, and this was pretty much that the whole time.

Edit: and would it be the end of the world to make Kay a little force sensitive. I'd love to do some double jumps"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,I played for about 30 minutes before I got super bored with it and moved it to my USB drive.
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,All we want is a Witcher 3/Horizon ZD/RDR2/Ac Odyssey type thing but Star Wars. It’s unbelievable that nobody has done it yet.
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Great review. I just wish a company would bring back Star Wars Galaxies. What a fantastic and fun concept we had in 2000. 32 Professions you can choose from, master one and be an apprentice in another. There were 9 different worlds you could freely travel to. You could jump on a speeder and go across the entire planet in about 30 minutes. You could get to a spaceport and fly from planet to planet, space combat, and you could do it all with friends in the ship. Every week, resources and where they were found rotated from planet to planet with and the quality of resource changed. You actually could go to a planet, put down a harvestor, fuel it up, letting collect resources. Those resources and quality of resources were used in components to build clothing, guns, armor, medical buffs etc. Depending on the quality of resources, you would have weapons and armor with better stats which you could then sell on your own vendor that you hosted in your own house in a player run city on the planet you chose. Just fucking amazing idea and concept that just doesn't get produced in todays industry. 

I felt like Ubisoft had such a great opprotunity to do it with there open worlds being so fantastic looking."

1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"I’m kind of sick of seeing daily posts from the sw outlaws sub (that I don’t subscribe to, or view), that say people are sooo wrong about this game, it’s amazing."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,I have to ask cuz I have not gotten a goddamn straight answer . So I remember reading in interview them talking about the wanted system and at max level you’d get something that is just as bad or worse than death troopers… is any of that true ?
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"32 hours for a game currently sitting at 90$ cad,  that doesn't feel great to me. I try to stick to the 1$ / hour (or close to it) and thats far from being close.

Might pick it up whenever it drops under 50%."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Definitely a 6/10 game for me. Felt like it could have used another year or two of polishing. But even then, it just felt kind of soulless and trying to appeal to everyone."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"every ubislop game is the same , starts very strong only to get very meh after"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"I enjoyed reading your review, but I guess I still don't understand how people can expect something different from Ubisoft. You said it yourself: you were a defender at first, but why? It turned out as everybody expected. Save your money next time. "
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Your experience mirrors mine perfectly apart from the fact that once I saw all 4 planets I bailed. The fact you didnt mention the space sections at all is extremely telling. 

Still a decent game, fun in bursts for sure but absolutely not worth the full price."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,Yet another ubislop? Color me shocked
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Awesome review! I've quit in Tattooine because of the factors you pointed out. I mean, in way less detail, I simply got bored. I also thought this would be the game that would carry me until GoW released, but nah...

At least I just paid a single month of ubicrap monthly, so it lessens the financial harm."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"“the end” … you rushed the story. I’m at 25 hours, on second planet and tons left to do on first."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"It's your opinion and i respect it, but come on, the gun play feels amazing. It feels like it has impact, when a blaster bolt hits an enemy you kinda feel it not just see it if that makes sense.

EDIT: hahaha the circlejerk in full force UbIsOfT bAd m i rite guis?"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Seems like trademark Ubishit, make several hours of good fun content and then just re-skin and recycle that same content until it feels like a chore to finish the game.  And recycle/reskin for more games.  It’s almost like all they care about is getting their customers to play the game just long enough they can’t refund."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,Do people still buy and play games from ubi???lol
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-15,"Garbage ""honest"" review.  

This game much like many others will never get a fair shake because the internet decided it was going to farm it for hate engagement months before release. Such a shamful shitshow that gamers put on these days."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,I firmly believe that Ubisoft should be boycotted. I don’t understand how people keep buying and supporting their bullshit games. Their ENTIRE catalog is the exact same game/mechanics just in a slightly different setting. Stop buying their games
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Thanks for adding on. Looks like I’ll wait for a sale. 

The funny thing is that the advertisements didn’t lie at all. They sold it as “generic open world formula with Star Wars theme” yet I still am somehow disappointed to learn, “oh it’s just the generic open world formula…”

I guess it’s bc Star Wars is such an iconic and grandiose license, I subconsciously expected something novelty/groundbreaking. 

Looks fun though for Star Wars fans though."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"I think this is part of the issue once you pair it to cost. I remember getting the og assassin's creed game in a completely different gaming world that had a different set of expectations and paying price of a comparable game for it.

But in today's world there is way more competition. So when Ubisoft is coming out and offering the game for 100 dollars or whatever, it is going to open itself up to far deeper scrutiny when games like God Of War Ragnarok are getting put out for less money with free dlc.

At that point the market is figuring out what a 10 out of 10 game is. If God of War, Elden Ring, Black Myth Wukong are 10 out of 10 games? It shouldn't surprise anyone when a game that is more objectively more flawed is coming out with a higher price point comes at a lower review/score when the value to cost just isn't there."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Sounds like what people called «tech demo games» back in the day. Though, this game doesnt have any tech.. to demo.."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"I played Assassin’s Creed 1 and while it was great for a time, it was so bland by the end that it completely turned me off from playing any other Assassin’s Creed games (even though I’m sure they got better). 

So the fact you compared Star Wars Outlaws to it, I think has solidified that I won’t be touching it unless it’s free or on a severe discount (which is likely since it’s Ubisoft)."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Sadly it tanked especially with alot of the negativity surrounding the preview so most people won't see the beauty in this game or ever get to see the potential it had to grow. 


So far I'm loving it but I'm pretty early in it too. "
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-15,"Thanks for the review.  I was very interested in this game at first but passed on full price because (of all things) lack of character customization- just one of my weird hangups these days.  However, the more I’ve learned the more I feel like this is a ‘wait for a sale and maybe some mods’ game anyway."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Honestly, that review sounds a lot like Division to me.   Beautiful world but eventually feels empty.   Bland story and characters.   Fun gameplay loop but gets repetitive."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,Why would you expect Ubisoft to put their focus into making a great game… they make the same sloppy game copy and pasted over and over
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"The thing is, I don’t trust these reviews because this sub also bitched about Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, which fixes all these “flaws.”"

1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Lifeless animatronics is such a good description of the NPCs. They are decorative, not truly part of the game world."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"It's insane how many games do this, though. It was one of my biggest complaints with Cyberpunk including Phantom Liberty. The world doesn't feel lived in at all, it's just there waiting for you to interact with it."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Funnily enough with the Star Wars shows, many of the background extras feel the same way because of that stupid Volume they use for everything"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Reviews, by their VERY NATURE, are biased. It's what one person thinks of a game. Just because you don't agree with something doesn't mean it's biased.



That being said, this is a very well-written review."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"“Game is mid” this review is honest
“Game is good” this review is clearly lying and they are being paid to say the games good
Just because you don’t agree with a review, that doesn’t make it biased"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Yes, everything was better before. 

There isn't anything good anymore. And no, I won't look for the good ones, just keep getting mad at the bad ones."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,That’s… that’s still reviews my guy
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,Perhaps you need to find better sources for your reviews.
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"No, I don’t. Video game reviewers have never been honest."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"They put all their effort making Act 1 as polished and varied as they can manage, and then ban reviewers from talking about anything after Act 1."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-15,"First MGS 5 stealth isn’t realistic, it’s all about freedom of opportunity, you can fuck with the same group of enemies in multiple different ways and that’s the main reason it’s fun.

Ghost recon already offers that type of gameplay (less arcadey), but it still limits itself to a certain point of believability. 

Splinter cell straight up had better stealth.

Casual open world games like a Star Wars game doesn’t need mgs level stealth, it just needs to be fun to use."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Can you progress without doing a lot of side missions or are a lot of gear, upgrade skill, XP needed for leveling, etc hidden in those missions?"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Naboo has multiple. Probably the most of any Star Wars planet . boggy forest, lush fields, royal city with waterfalls, Even some underwater locations!

But really even in real life most planets and moons (that we know of) have a single biome."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"In Survivor, Koboh had multiple biomes though. But you’re mainly right, it’s mostly single biomes."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"so, they have single biomes, but can have multiple \*sub\*biomes, and that's where you can squeeze the variety out. take kashyyk, it's basically a giant tree forest planet right? you can split that down further, you can have a beach biome (like in episode 3) where the forest gives way to ocean, you have the upper areas of the trees where the wookies live and such, and you have the shadowlands at the bottom of the forest where the sun doesn't reach. Things like that, that's what outlaws failed at.

Toshara is \*just\* savana, akiva is \*just\* jungle. ironically tatooine has the most variety because they have the jundland wastes and a \*little\* bit of the dune sea and salt flats in it at least"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"It doesn’t *have* to, which I even said. But, I recently played God of War 2018 and was consistently in awe at the art design world they built. It enhanced the experience. Ghost of Tsushima is perhaps the most beautiful game I ever played, and that’s part of what made it so incredible to me. Even Jedi Survivor had me struck at times. To me, it can enhance a game greatly."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,Don’t they! I wish there was a more flexible climbing system. Or at the very least more rope spots or climbing paths or something.
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-12-23,"I agree. I can see making a chore to get up to a spot the first time, but then lowering a rope or something g when you get there…like the Jedi games!"

1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"I’m honestly curious as to what made you think it was one word. IIRC even the opening title sequence has the words on separate lines, and any title that also shows the subtitle(?) like the logo for empire strikes back, has the star and the wars above and below."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,In what world is Star Wars one word lol
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Lol sorry to burst your bubble. I’ve said it so often I can see how the words can roll together to become one word 😂

I’m glad you enjoyed the review! It’s definitely worth a look if you’re a Star Wars fan. I have Ubisoft plus so I am happy with it but I would not be happy if I spent a full 70$ on this."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Respawn being a better developer than Ubisoft is an understatement.


Also, thanks for showing me I'm not alone in reading (and even pronouncing) things completely different and being oblívious to it.


&nbsp;


It's interesting that it often was translated in pronounciation when localized (I vividly remember the letters being narrated) and you end up with a word in middle similar to ""Wars in the Stars"". Which looks interesting in English."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Outlaws isn't developed by Ubisoft, they published it. Just like EA published the Jedi games, but they were developed by Respawn. Outlaws was made by Massive Entertainment."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"No usually Star Wars fans write it as two words. I’ve been making a Star Wars fan film full of vfx with a bunch of cosplayers for 3 years, so I’m likely right?

Edit: Oh, I read the rest lmao. Props to you for looking it up."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"I think Ubisoft is afraid to take chances nowadays. This was a very by the books, inoffensive Star Wars game (even though you’re a scoundrel). Typical (still fun) Ubisoft stealth with decent gunplay. Very underwhelming platforming."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,I’m with you here 100%. It also just rubbed me wrong that the devs for this kept saying “it’s not like other Ubi games” but then show stuff that was kinda the same as other Ubi games…
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"I don't play Ubisoft games and I can tell.


I'm not talking about the feel of a game, that often shows the studio behind it, but as you've said it just feels like the same game with a different coat of paint (which I believe is how selling the same car yearly was popularized)."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"I've played all the major ubisoft games but I still mostly enjoy them. I buy them when they're on sale at minimum a few months later. But I do acknowledge they have a real problem with their games being too bloated. I actually am playing avatar right now. The first 10 to 20 hours were amazing. The world is beautiful, the gameplay is initially fun. But there's so many damn map points that are just copy and pasted. Ubisoft cannot keep doing this forever. I'm honestly not that excited for an assassins creed game. I was excited for all the previous ones even. Valhalla finally got to me i think"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-15,"Not just a Star Wars thing either, just very common in sci-fi in general hah.  
  
Star Wars seems to be slowly trying to move away from it tho... more Earth-like multi biome planets have been slowly introduced (or retconned in) since *The Clone Wars* started in 2008.  
  
One huge example is Ryloth, which was tidal-locked pre-retcon and therefore only really had two biomes (lava and fire facing the star, constantly frozen facing away from it, thin band between them where everyone lived) and has now been retconned into just being a warmer version of Earth.  
  
Kashyyyk was retconned even before TCW, with *Revenge of the Sith* adding oceans and coasts, and later materials adding the frozen poles, large open areas where the ground is accessible, swamp areas, lakes and rivers, etc... while it used to be covered in 100% super tall wroshyr trees, with the Wookiees only living in the treetops, and the lower levels of the forest being incredibly dangerous."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"This is inaccurate. You see a wider view on 21:9 by a large margin. At least on my 55"" tv on 3840x2160 resolution. Literally loaded up to test it before posting this. I set the border of Fill Screen against something. Then switched to 21:9 and that something was a good 8 inches away from the edge of the screen.

Edit: this is PC from Ubisofts launcher version."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,How do you remove the black bars without zooming? On PC all there is is the fill to screen option.
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Yeah, I feel the same. Completed the game within about a week. It's not perfect, and has some problems that hold it back (not a fan of some of the forced stealth or awkward traversal). But it's a pretty solid game, one well worth playing if you get a chance. Id give it about a 7 as well, and if I were a Star Wars fan (I'm not particularly), I'd probably score it higher. 

I mentioned it to some friends, and told them I was enjoying it. They said not to bother because the game was bad. When I asked them why. It turned out they hadn't actually played it. Or seen any footage of it. It was just that 'Ubisoft is bad'. Sometimes the jokes/memes online make people's minds up before they even try something. Which in this case is a shame, because it's a decent game with a lot of things going for it. (Big up Sabacc)"

1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"This one looks like a solid ""Buy it at $20 during the summer sale next year"" to me."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-17,"Spot on for me, I do enjoy the game for what it is, but keep catching myself thinking ""that's really all they could come up with for a Star Wars open world game?"" while playing. Not exactly the sign of a great game unfortunately.

 Good time filler, good eye candy, but that's about as far as I could praise it compared to all other games I played :/"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-15,I mean you can kill a whole lot of people.
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-17,"People are really down on Ubisoft these days, insisting their games are formulaic and bloated. Ubisoft has released the same or similar game three times now in AC Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla, and Far Cry 3-6 are all similar to each other, as well as Avatar. Watch Dogs offered similar action stealth and I don’t know about The Division. But Star Wars Outlaws is in a unique world and has trimmed the fat greatly so to speak, with a much more reasonably paced length if you stick to the main quest as well as lots of additional gameplay should you choose to pursue it. It’s still got its flaws, such as a very poor story and characters and being just too limited in exploring and interacting with the world. It also has a number of technical issues such as crashes or being transported randomly and issues with poor AI, that can detect you even if you’re not seen and can miss you right in front of them. I enjoyed the game despite its flaws, and you can see in my updated review I gave it a 6.5. I don’t think it’s a bad game by any means, but it had too many flaws for me to consider it a good one. 

It has a lot of haters though that haven’t or have barely played the game and just hate everything Ubisoft these days. It’s become quite popular to hate on which is unfortunate because it really does have a lot of positive qualities."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-11-06,"It’s a fun game. It’s open world with hints of Uncharted x Assassins Creed in a scifi universe. Doesn’t move the barrel but there’s a lot of enjoyment to be had, despite its flaws. If you like what you see so far, give it a go. I’ve seen the PC version go for ~30-35$ on gg.deals. Or, you can buy a month of Ubisoft Connect for 17.99 that gives you full access to Outlaws and its DLCs (once they come out), as well as Ubisoft’s other games."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"I agree, not every game needs to be a masterpiece. I definitely enjoyed this one, that just waned over time. I definitely could’ve spent more time on side content, and as I said in the review I just might.

Also, I loved the Jedi games. They’re some of my favorite games of all time, not just Star Wars games. Right up there with KoTOR and Battlefront for me."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,I wish we had Star War sword of games that weren't Star Wars.

It is remarkable how it shaped the industry. You can see Uncharted clues in games as if they were left there by the game itself."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"I went into this really hoping for an Uncharted like Star Wars game. The gunplay was close, but nowhere near the same platforming and there were practically no set pieces in this one (which is one of my favorite features of Uncharted)."

1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"> looks like an $20 Xbox 360 game

Can people stop saying this dumb shit?"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,For me playing as Kay meant I didn't particularly feel immersed or attached to the character.  Which for a single player games made it a slog to try and get through. I realised a couple of hours in that I just didn't want to play as her anymore. Put the game down and haven't picked it back up.
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,The worst I’ve gotten is the death troopers.
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,It’s not $90.
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,I spent twelve hours on Toshara when I’ve read in other reviews they spent “only a few.” If I rushed it it’s because I was ready to finish it.

1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"I liked it a lot at first but it didn’t feel like anything special to me by the end. I definitely didn’t feel that impact like you are talking about, besides with the explosive barrel, though I mostly used the repeater which I think had less impact than the default single shot gun. Which was also a lot more “Han Solo”-like. Which is why I ended up switching back to the single shot for the final mission, even though I was having a much easier time with the repeater.

And just to be clear I didn’t dislike the gunplay. It just wasn’t enough to offset the game’s larger flaws."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Also the guy says the gameplay doesnt evolve? It adds new blaster types and new people to learn skills from, as well as speeder and ship upgrades. For the stealth, I mean it's stealth, you don't get seen and do stealth takedowns. There are also stealth gameplay settings to tweak the difficulty to your liking and skills you can learn as the game progresses (like nix distracting multiple people), you also have a stun blaster ability."

1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-15,"I really liked the game at first, and even posted my initial positive thoughts to Reddit somewhere. I didn’t let the reviews discourage me and did my best not to let them sway my opinion. But over time, what I consider the games weaker aspects became clearer and I just didn’t feel the positives of the game were enough to fully compensate for them. I’m sorry you didn’t like the review."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-12-16,Not sure how you could read that and not think it’s an honest review.
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"idk, my issue is it doesn't even at least feel like the generic open world formula for Ubisoft. if it was far cry style or assassin's creed style even I feel like I would have had more fun with it still. my constant reaction going to any location in outlaws that wasnt an imperial base was constantly ""...that's it?"" Hell, bringing up far cry, what is with it and planets having barely \*any\* wildlife?

and god if I don't know how to place my finger on it, but for some reason it always feels...off. like I'm not really playing a star wars game save for if there's imperials onscreen. before anyone tried to say it, no it ain't the no Jedi lol. it's just so much feels constantly just \*slightly\* off. like the music is star warsy but feels like it misses the mark still, same with blaster sounds effects, the speeder you're stuck riding, the fact the only alien language you hear is hutese, even rodians just constantly speak basic, etc. It's really weird cause I've never really felt this in a star wars game before where it can feel so authentic and yet somehow so cheap at the same time"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"""Star Wars is such an iconic and grandiose license"" I bet Ubisoft thought the same thing while developing the game which is why the game lacks any innovation and has barely any interaction with the world. The open world is just there to get you from point A to B."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Yeah, I get what you mean - with it being Star Wars, you kind of have this near infinite world of possibilities, you want to be able to go and participate in the Boonta Eve podracing on Tatooine, get a bounty put on your head only to notice Slave One tailing you, accidentally come across a skirmish between the Rebellion and the Empire, fly over the ruins of Mandalore, etc - so when it's just a few planets you can drive over and visit the cantina on you suddenly feel very limited."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"you could just do one month of ubi plus, itll get you the deluxe version too"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Yeah, I think that's definitely one of the aspects that brings it down.

Assassin's Creed 1, for example, you had incredible graphics for the time, dense crowds populating the streets, the parkour system bringing verticality to the open world, multiple open world zones rather than a single city to explore, and some very fluid animations/combat (for 2007) - so even though the game was average the tech demo aspect kept it feeling impressive and made people talk about it.

Whereas with Star Wars Outlaws, you've just got this 6/10, 7/10 where you can see what they were going for, and enjoy a playthrough, but nothing about it ever feels impressive - I mean with it being a current-gen exclusive and SSD's meaning games can load impressively fast they could have really made you feel how fast Speeder Bikes are, or finally do the seamless ground to air gameplay Free Radical wanted to do for Battlefront 3 back in the day - and these would have both been impressive tech moments."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Actually it kinda does. It runs on the snowdrop engine and uses raytracing for global illumination and reflections, even on consoles. It's one of less than 10 games to do that if I had to guess a number. I can name 4 off the top of my head, but that's about it. It's the same tech that Massive used for last year's Avatar game, and that one was one of the most beautiful games of the year. Outlaws has a lot of very atmospheric lighting, especially in the cantinas and the rt reflections in the Empire's bases do a lot for the presentation because there are shiny floors everywhere. On the other hand, as with Avatar, that's all a bit too much for the consoles. The 30fps mode has good image quality, but it's only 30fps, the 60 mode runs fine but looks very muddy because of the low internal resolution. I'm playing the 40fps mode because it's the best compromise, but that one requires a TV with 120Hz support which not every TV offers. It's unfortunate because seeing the game run at max settings on a high end PC (https://youtu.be/g3irLCjQTOA?si=NQUGfCZMPK1xtZQq), it's a really handsome game overall. But Ubisoft chose to show low Bitrate footage ahead of launch and in all the trailers and it makes the game look worse than it actually is."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"I'd personally disagree - Ubisoft can be incredibly formulaic when it comes to Assassin's Creed, Watch_Dogs, Far Cry, and Ghost Recon but they've also made some great games over the last decade: South Park: The Stick of Truth/The Fractured But Whole are two of the best licenced games out there, the Mario/Rabbid games had a suprising amount of depth for what should have been a cheap crossover, The Division 2 was a massive step up from the original, Siege remains one of the most played multiplayer shooters a decade later, For Honour is one of the better attempts at a AAA multiplayer game capturing the feeling of a sword fight, PoP: The Lost Crown was an incredibly pleasant surprise,  and even the jump between AC: Syndicate to AC: Origins was pretty major back in the day.

They're never going to be a company I like, but they do have it in them to make great games when the passion is there - and from the early reveals, it felt like the passion might have been there for Outlaws."

1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"I had the same issue with Cyberpunk: even after the fixes/updates, it still feels shallow. 

Rows of identical vending machines selling things you never need.

Noodle stands open 24/7 selling the same food you never need.

The most pessimistic NPC pedestrians imaginable, either corpos irritated on their way to work, or people tweaking on “future meth” or whatever that I still have no lore explanation of within the game itself.

I can’t tell any of the factions apart. They all have the same feeling guns and worthless drops that I lost interest in NCPD missions after the first 10 or so.

Like, Skyrim and Oblivion figured even basic things out a decade ago: have shop owners with their own homes, and actual hours where they go to work and back. 

Random people approaching you in the street to tell you a secret.

Weird side quests that took you to other dimensions or realities for more than a cutscene.

I would rather have a smaller world with depth than a larger world full of pretty assets that is as dynamic as a snow globe."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"A review that strictly talks about performance (which can be objectively measured) and flaws like glitches/crashes, etc, anything that’s objective and measurable would not be a biased review. 

Not saying OP’s review is that, but just noting that it is possible for unbiased reviews to exist"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"I don't agree, I don't understand this recent feeling of nothing is possible to analyze objectively anymore.

You may or may not like something, but you could see the actual quality of said something.

Is the soundtrack of Interstellar not great objectively speaking? Doesnt matter your taste.

Is the book The Lord of The Rings not a masterpiece objectively speaking? Doesnt matter your taste.

Are the RPG systems, both combat and narrative wise, of Baldurs Gate 2 not great objectively speaking? Doesnt matter you taste.

And you could tell me, ""In my opinion, even tho I know it is great, I dont like Interstellar OST, I dont like The Lord of The Rings, I dont like Baldurs Gate 2"" 

And that would be perfectly fine.

However, if you were to say: ""Interstellar's OST is one of the worst of all time, The Lord of The Rings is a copy of so many books nowadays, Baldurs Gate 2 isnt a great RPG""

And you would be wrong.

Language exists to communicate, and using the right words can make a huge difference.

Case on point: 

I love Anthem the videogame. Love it completely and utterly, yet I think the game is shit.

I enjoyed my time with The Witcher 3, and I recognize it as one of the best games I have ever played objectively, yet it is not close to being one of my favourites."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"No, reviews are not biased by nature.  
  
It's all semantics. You can have completely unbiased sections of reviews. Factual statements about the things are unbiased, and are not all about tech either as someone else stated. So no, a review is not all bias no more than it is all unbiased. 

A good, ""unbiased"" review states the facts of the game, how it works, the gameplay loop, numbers and things that CAN be quantified like number of quests, may even provide comparisons to other contemporary works, all unbiased, and then gives thoughts at the end. For example, stating a game has 2 main quests and Skyrim has 25 is not a biased statement, it is fact, and is only for comparison. What YOU get from that statement is YOUR bias."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Yeah I really enjoyed the game and could give an equally detailed review about why I consider it an 8/10, but I'd just be told I was paid by ubisoft. "

but just the sheer amount of resources and money required for things means you need to do extra stuff. it's not all terrible, just run of the mill, like all Ubisoft stuff. seen it once, you're bound to see it again."

1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-15,"> Toshara is *just* savana, akiva is *just* jungle. ironically tatooine has the most variety because they have the jundland wastes and a *little* bit of the dune sea and salt flats in it at least  
  
I wouldn't say Tatooine has more variety in subbiomes?  
  
Toshara doesn't have much, sure... mainly just the open savannah vs more rocky and mountainous areas.  
  
However, Akiva has the tight mountain areas, the far more open flat areas, swampy river areas near Myrra, and a huge lake with islands in the west."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,Try the last 2 Tomb Raider games. Tsushima has nothing on those.

1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"I have no excuse. In my efforts to alleviate my shame I have searched for a source upon which to place my blame and have found no precedent. I have enjoyed Star Wars all my life and can say with reasonable conviction that The Empire Strikes Back is my most viewed film. I am the worst kind of nerd and have brought shame upon my family and all who associate with me. My bloodline is weak and deserving of no more regard than the attention required to cull it to prevent any propagation. My only hope is now to die and pass from memory quickly, that the dishonor I have brought may have the smallest possible impact in the grand turning of the stars. If I must be remembered let it be as a warning to those that follow. Never trust thine own weak and fallible mind, for it is bound by flesh and flesh holds no promise but that it will eventually fail and rot. Hold nothing true unless it is verified absolutely, lest hubris trap you as it has trapped me in this fate worse than that of simple pure death."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,Literally this lol. It fucking opens up as a giant title that is literally 2 words lolol.

I, who hold the truth in regard above all else am the worst kind of flawed. Unending will be my shame and let my name ring from all throats for eternity as the example to which mistakes are compared."

1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"You now made me realize how every ubisoft game seems to aim for stealth.


You enter a zone and you're always supposed to go hidden and there's a bunch of guys on set positions.


Maybe they should try a game like the old times where stealth wasn't a mechanic but rather a side thing that couldn't be developed into the game."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,It feels like for the past few years all Ubisofts big games have become homogenized. All their games look like they're just assassins cry 90. It seems like greed and an unwillingness to deviate from the formula is really starting to drag their games down.
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,I wonder if Ubisoft even has any of the same people from the early days. It has indeed been a minute.
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-15,Last time they took a chance was Watch Dogs Legion
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Whoa, now... that's not Ubisoft doing that. It's Disney doing that. Ubisoft isn't afraid to take chances and do edgy things if they think it will pay, but Disney viciously protects their IP and absolutely refuses to let anything sully it. Regardless of game dev studio, working with a Disney IP always comes with very heavy shackles that restrict innovation."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Hmmm, great on you for confirming that. I wonder why the discrepancy on platforms? I wonder if just cranking fov to 110 provides the wider view with more vertical?"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Yes, it is that. The fill screen gives you MORE information. It doesn't zoom at all, it's just a bigger picture.

1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Some of that's true, but it's also a result of Ubisoft's practices. They've tarnished their reputation.

Unlike Fallen Order, Outlaws isn't good enough to generate word of mouth necessary to overcome its publisher's deservedly poor reputation (based on what you're describing).

When EA put out Fallen Order, that was a hard pass. Then I heard great things and gave it a shot. Outlaws, not as much. Seems like an okay game that is worth a discounted price. $20 is fair. $40 at the high end."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,More like enjoy it in 2 max

1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2025-01-11,"It’s too guided and not big enough. You can’t even return to Cantonica if you want. When I heard “open world Star Wars game,” I thought something similar to Starfield where you can travel anywhere any time you want."

That's a real problem with RT right now, devs got so good at other fake rendering techniques that have dramatically better performance that the boost from RT just doesn't feel as dramatic as it should in a lot of situations."

1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Lmao you listed their 4 biggest franchises first and admit they are formulaic. Watch dogs has never had a quality entry and the others have all been ass for a decade+

I don’t get why this shitty company gets a pass, they make the worst AAA games"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,But that's not really reviewing the game is it? It's just reviewing the tech behind it.
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Yeah, absolutely! Definitely true. Most critic's work isn't necessarily like that, but it's totally possible."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Whether or not something is great is a matter of opinion. Two people can define greatness in different ways. There are plenty of things that can be evaluated objectively. Art is not one of them.

I find it interesting you picked Lord of the Rings as an example, because I don't find it to be a masterpiece at all.

""Interstellar's OST is one of the worst of all time, The Lord of The Rings is a copy of so many books nowadays, Baldurs Gate 2 isnt a great RPG""

These are all opinions. Reviews are opinions. That's the point of a review. You're getting the opinion of someone who is (supposed to be) educated on a subject.  


The comment about LotR being a copy isn't an opinion. That's an incorrect statement. But something be the worst or not being great IS an opinion."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,If you want objective then just stick to Digital Foundry (though even they clearly have their own biases).

1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,I will! I’m on the first one but took a break from it to play Outlaws. Those are high up on the list.

1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-15,Last time a Ubisoft open world action game had poor stealth was Far Cry 2.
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,I'm assuming tight deadlines and being able to use 90% of the Ubisoft legacy codebase would do this. Why reinvent the wheel if you already have tried and tested mechanics?
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-15,The lead behind Splinter cell and far cry 2 is working on the next AC game
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,It goes to 115 on PC and the effect is still the same. Probably a console limitation or oversight/bug.
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,I think the PS5 version's Fill to screen is different. Which doesn't make sense to me
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Maybe to some, and that's fair enough. But, whilst I know it's not popular to admit on here, I generally like Ubisoft games. Even with their shortcomings, I tend to get my money's worth out of them. 

Each to their own, and I have nothing against people not enjoying the games. They won't be for everyone, but my issue is more when people don't even give a game a chance to begin with. Ubisoft or otherwise."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Sure, except Ubisoft also released one of the best Metroidvanias this year with Prince of Persia and also shadow dropped a very competent remaster of Beyond Good and Evil. There is a legitimate complaint about Ubisoft's samey design (which feels halfway addressed in Outlaws) but there's also a Gamergate circlejerk against the publisher born out of misinformation and not so veiled sexism and racism.

I don't think Ubisoft has righted the ship, but I also can't ignore the cumulative effect of their efforts this year."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,Thanks!

1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"I agree when it comes to the reflections. In Avatar and Outlaws, the resolution of the rt reflections is so low that SSR would've been my preferred method. The RTGI on the other hand makes a real difference and looks very good."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Yeah, I agreed that their four biggest franchises are formulaic and I'll even admit I've not enjoyed a single AC/FC/WD/GR since 2017, but my point is they are making great games outside of those IP's and Ubisoft still have the talent that when they put the effort in they can normally make something that's at the very least enjoyable.

I'd also say I don't think Ubisoft get a pass, in the lead-up to Outlaws releasing there was a lot of have for Ubisoft and their business practices going around, and a lot of people (Including myself) condemning the likes of Yves Guillemot for what was going on behind closed doors at Ubisoft."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,I guess? The point of an objective unbiased review would literally be just to report facts about the game and that’s it. You make up your own opinion based off that
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Words like “good” or “great” are value judgments, and different people and cultures value different things. To use a non-gaming example, British humor might be funny to Brits, but bring that over to Japan and it’d probably fall flat for almost everyone. Same thing with Japanese humor and Western audiences."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"So basically it is impossible for some people to get their head out of their asses and try to discern the quality of a product without their tastes on it. 

We live in such an egocentric world nowadays, especially western culture of consumerism.

If I dont like something, it must mean it is bad, because how can I have bad taste right? 

I prefer to stick with deciding wether I like a product regardless of the actualy quality of it, but recognizing at the same time the quality of the product as a separate thing.

So reviews of wether a building is structurally sound, or wether the technique of a painting was executed properly, or wether someone knows how to compose music, all of the opinions completely dependant on taste?"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"I hate the /s thing on Reddit , it’s obviously sarcastic asf after all the controversies. It always feels like the author assumes the reader is too stupid to figure it out themselves but looking at the downvotes a lot of them probably are"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Honestly I think LoTR is a better film series as well. George Lucas frankly isnt that great, and is propped up by stellar work of John Williams, Industrial Light & Magic, the set and prop designers and associated visionaries at Lucasfilms, not to mention the myriad authors and writers who built the supporting work. Don't get me wrong, the work of Weta Workshop and Howard Shore et all are virtually peerless, but as I understand Star Wars birthed many of the principles that they would eventually build upon. 

  
George Lucas must be given credit for the creation of the Star Wars universe and by extension all of the Science Fantasy genre in the same way that Lord of the Rings and the Fantasy genre was birthed from the mind of J. R. R. Tolkien. Both were amazing world builders but mediocre writers upon who's backs all of modern nerddom now stands."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,That wheel will only carry you so far through the years
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"To my knowledge, it's the same. it's also worth mentioning though that you can change the FOV, and lens effects. Could be I changed mine in such a way that it negates this, or that you changed yours in such a way that it emphasized it."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-15,"To your point, yeah, there are some guys out there who are pissy about the protagonist. It gets so messy when people like that hide their criticism amongst the legitimate complaints. I thought the protagonist looked cool. Facial animations seem weak, but that is an Ubisoft staple."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"It does look better, but it's not as dramatic as you would hope for the heavy impact on performance, unfortunately."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,Your argument makes no sense. The safety of a building can be judged through an objective series of tests. It's built on principals of science. Unchanging science. That's completely different from a book or movie or game.
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"You’re comparing Science and Engineering, a realm governed by empirical evidences, to Art, which is ultimately defined by self-expression and is much more personal, even if it has its own rules. Objectivity in art all comes down to a set of agreed upon criteria determined by experts in a particular field — a consensus. But some genius writer in the future might very well upend the status quo with a work that goes against the consensus, and that’ll be considered the new “great”."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-15,I agree with you on that.
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,Until it comes off they'll keep using it
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"What? Are you seriously telling me that scientific knowledge hasnt changed throughout the years as humans have discovered more and more? 

And yet, it wouldnt make sense for us to critizise by todays standards the actual structure of a building 1000 years ago, because they didnt have enough knowledge, it has to be analyzed wether it was good or not for its time.

Would you critizise and say that it was a ""badly built"" building that crumbled down after 500 years because it didnt account for a possible earthquake? Yet nowadays they would have been prepared for it

Granted books and movies and games are products nowadays, so maybe the building comparison is not the best; however if anything, products are even easier to analyze, and the three of them are products nowadays.

Things can be analyzed nowadays, products can be analyzed nowadays, pretending they cant is just making sure that you are right and others are wrong. 

If books, films and movies wouldnt have a set of analyzable metrics, there wouldnt be globally recognizable great books, movies and videogames.

If they converge at one product or another, it means that the product HAS to have something of quality, wether you like it or not."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Not everything inside a videogame nor a film nor a book is Art, each of those can be separated into different things that most can be analyze in the exact same way you would Engineering, like software or hardware engineer.

When I am developing an API or a desktop app, it can be objectively stated by the end of it wether the API is good or not, wether I have followed hexagonal structure (especially if its or has backend) or not, wether the code is clean and easily understandable or not, wether I have divided the responsability correctly or not, wether my models are good or not.

In the exact same way, I can take a videogame and analyze wether the combat system is good or not, wether the gameplay loop is good and engaging for the duration of the game or not, wether the soundtrack is good or not, wether the graphics are good or not. 

Both obviously will depend on when they were released, and should be analyzed accordingly. An API that I developed 7 years ago is kinda shit by today's standards (and me myself can say that without problem because I did revise one recently), yet it wasnt as bad 7 years ago.

And not analyzing them depending on when they were released into the world is an utter mistake. Which doesnt equal as them not being relevant any longer, they perfectly can be, but saying that something old is instantly bad because nowadays standards are higher is another symptom of the exact same egocentric view of the world so many people seem to have nowadays.

And while I understand your feeling of Art as being more of an abstract, the world has changed quite a bit, and books, films and videogames are first and foremost products now, and that is a fact, non-subjective. If they weren't, they wouldnt move near as much money in today's capitalist world. 

They are products, are they Art products? Probably, but products nonetheless. People tend to forget it, you are paying to consume a product."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"... yes, just because a building was built 500 years ago does not mean it miraculously becomes a well built building. What are you even saying? It didn't account for physics back then, it doesn't matter if they knew or not.



And again, art is subjective. Something is ""globally recognized"". Okay, cool. It's been subjectively judged by a lot of people to be good. It can still be subjectively judged by others to not be. Nothing you're saying is making sense.



By your argument, your words have been objectively judged to be bad, based on the upvote to downvote ratio. Come on."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"You used the word “engaging” to describe gameplay loop, but that’s highly subjective. Death Stranding is game where people either loved the gameplay loop or hated it. Outside of graphical fidelity and performance, nothing in a game is objective in the same way science is objective."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Exactly lol, so the building can be analyzed wether it was good or badly built AT that time, you are agreeing with me 😅

And again, I am saying they are not just art nowadays. They are products.

And a product can be analyzed, the same way you would analyze food to be of quality or not. The same way you sould analyze if a movie is good or not. The same way you would analyze if a car is good or not.

But nonetheless, we agree to disagree, your mind is set in regarding a videogame/movie/book as something literally completely subjective, and mine is set in regarding some components of a videogame/book/movie as analyzable (albeit not all of them)

We are writting way too much in the thread of such a game 😂"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"You are confusing things.

A gameplay loop can be objectively analyzed, BUT you cannot say it is either good or bad because some players like it and others dont.

Lets use your example, Death Stranding's gameplay loop is about exploring the land, walking, riding, crossing, traversing the land with the objects you need to deliver to its destination. You build roads, you create connections not only on land, but also with people/NPCs.

If we analyze this gameplay loop to what Death Stranding is trying to archieve, the gameplay loop is objectively great.

Now, I personally hate it, because it is not what I want kn a videogame, it is not entertaining enough FOR me. 

This doesnt make it less engaging, I am simoly not the target of this product, ans that is ok, the game is still great."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"You're still not making any sense. If you can't see the difference between a car and a work of literature, then I don't know what to tell you.



Whether or not you're classifying a creative piece as ""art"" or ""product"" (and how do you even make that determination...?) changes nothing about the creative piece. It's still the same thing. And it can only be judged subjectively."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"If Death Stranding's gameplay loop is boring to someone, then no, it is not ""objectively"" great. Engagement is a highly subjective, personal thing, and you can't divorce that from the player experience. Just because a game achieves what it sets out to do does not make it objectively engaging."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"So again I have the same opinion about you not understanding that you can analyze wether an engine is good or not; in the exact same way you analyze wether the prose of a work of literature is good or not.

Examples:

Brandon Sanderson has a just good enough prose in his books.

Patrick Rothfuss has one of the best prose in recent years.

And this are analyzable, because writting is a skill. A skill subdivided in many different skills. One of them, is prose. Hence, you can differentiate between good and bad prose. And I am not even going to put taste in this regard.

It is not an opinion that the prose in The Wise Man's Fear is better than the prose in any book Sanderson has written. Yet I enjoy more Sanderson, because he does have other strengths that align more with my tastes. But the prose is clearly and easily analyzeable.

Like how can you even think that writting is some kind of nebulosa where there is no telling wether something is good or bad is beyond me.

I cannot imagine me as a software engineer finishing an API with code structure and sintax of 10 years ago nowadays and saying to my bosses: ""Hey, you cannot say this is bad, because it is subjective"".

I would be fired within the day."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"""A product for everyone is a product for no one"".

Products have target audiences. Videogames are products and have target audiences. If the game achieves what it sets out to do, and the system for what it sets out to do is good, it will be well received by target audiences. 

Death Stranding was well received by their audience. So, the gameplay loop is good. 

Its really not that hard, its like I start saying that all platformers are awful because I personally hate platformers, I am terrible at them.

I hated the platforming of Ori and the Blind Forest is the game bad? Nope, it is recognized as a great game with great platformer systems because it is, but I am not the target audience."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Oh good we're talking about prose.



I am a Literature teacher. I've spent my life analyzing prose.


And you're wrong. You can't objectively analyze prose. That's because it's art.



It is in fact an opinion that Sanderson's prose is worse than Rothfuss. That's the definition of an opinion. Because it's art. What works for one person may not work for another.



I don't understand how you're comparing coding to writing. Two completely different skills. There's absolutely no correlation there."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"You're just agreeing with me that everything outside of performance and graphics is subjective. I never said that Death Stranding was objectively bad or good. One man's trash is another man's treasure and all that. Player engagement is, by its very nature, subjective, because it all depends on who's playing the game. The fact that people have constant disagreements and arguments over what constitutes fun in a game already makes it not objective."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Funny that the literature posting didnt appear until I specifically said prose even tho we have been talking about books for a whole freaking hour 😂

In fact, which is kinda funny, you do know that videogames are code right? Is the code of videogame art, but the rest of the code isnt?

Or is the code of the videogames completely separate from the videogame for you, and if it is, why would that be? 

Why isnt coding art by your standards? You understand that coding is writting right? And that coding has different language you can write it on? You understand that coding has a syntax, that there are standards as to how go write code, that there are standards as to how you structure your code. It is quite literally like telling a story to a machine, even if that story is mostly logic.

Is there literally nothing on this on literature? So you can write whatever and since it is art, it might be good for some and bad for others? If its a story, it is inherently art that doesnt have any quality or any differentiation between its components?"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"I quite literally didnt say anything supporting your opinion.

I will just say that if there is a certain common agreement about a specific system within a game as being great, that system HAS to have objective quality within it.

The same way that so many QoL are so common between games and genres nowadays is because there are certain things in videogame that are objectively good.

Following your opinion, since I dislike platformers, Ori is not a good game, because it is a completely and utterly subjective product that cannot be attributed any objective qualities in any of its systems no? 

Sorry but I would absolutely hate myself if I were to have that mindset.

Lets just agree to disagree"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"1) Yes,  video games are code. But again, if you can't see the difference between making the interactive experience of a game and the utilitarian nature of computer coding, then I don't know what to tell you. That's a ridiculous statement.




2) Coding isn't art for the same reason science isn't art. It works one way. It's objective. It either works or it doesn't. Surely you understand this.


3) ""Is there literally nothing on this on literature? So you can write whatever and since it is art, it might be good for some and bad for others?""


Finally, you're understanding it. Yes. Exactly. Personal example: I adore the English versions of The Witcher novels. Many people share my opinion. Many people also completely disagree and state that the English translation is terrible and dry. Personally, it moved me to tears when I read it. For others, it was unbearably bad.



I love Murakami's writing. I think he's brilliant. Many people agree. Many people also completely disagree and think he's a bizarre hack. Both of these are valid opinions.




""But what about grammar and  the conventions of writing? Surely that's objective.""

No. It's not. Case in point: McCarthy. Poetry in general."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"“Ori is not a good game” is a subjective statement, not a fact. It’s easy to understand that unless you’re the narcissistic type who thinks their own subjective opinion trumps everyone else’s opinion.


“I didn’t have fun playing Ori” is not the same as “Ori is objectively bad because I think it’s bad”. As I said, engagement and fun are inseparable, and that’s a matter of personal taste."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Okay I will jump first into the coding, but the writting afterwards might be a better conversation. 

But you understand that the stealth system is coding, the combat system is coding, the clothing system is coding.

So the coding in itself is objective, but the visual representation isnt? The visual representation, which directly links with the functionality and logic of the code, isnt? That is art? 

Because that sounds to me like a completely biased thing to say. The code and what you are playing are the same. The logic, the functionality, they are the same. Sure you can analyze code in even more ways as to the code in itself, but this function is also analyzable.

And as for the books you mention:

It is in fact a great example, because I actually didnt like the books of him that were recommended to me (which I believe were the famous one Norrwegian Wood and Kafka on the Shore).

But I do state that Murakami's writting is phenomenal, maybe amongst the best I have read (it is a translation but there has to be that quality of the actual original script there). Yet I didnt like the books. Those are not exclusive, that is what I mean with all of this.

But I still thought the prose was superb, the pacing was great, characters are interesting and with depth. And if you ask me, so then why didnt you like it? Because I didnt like the story. Not because I thought it was bad, I just didnt like it.

So cannot Murakami be recognized as a great writter?"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Okay now you are trolling me.

That is quite literally my statement in my first comment.

Now you are agreeing with me 😂

You are saying that language is important, and that saying something based on your opinion is not the same as making an statement, which I absolutely agree.

So, you cannot say that a game is bad or good as an statement just because you like it or not. That is literally the core of my opinion.

I even put examples, and I will put the exact same examples here for you:

I love Anthem, I absolutely love it. Yet, the game is objectively bad. 

And the opposite:

I enjoyed The Witcher 3, I think it is one of the best games I have ever played in my life objectively, yet I didnt like it as much and its not one of my favourite games.

There are worse games that I have played that I like more than The Witcher 3.

I think that Anthem is objectively worse, much worse, than The Witcher 3, yet I like waaaaaaaaay more the former."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Everything you said about Murakami is an opinion. You happened to think his prose is great. Lots of people don't.  Hence, opinion.



You completely misunderstood my point about coding. I comparing, for example, database coding to video game design. One is essentially a science. You need database to do something. You code it. It either works or doesn't. You design a new feature for an operating system. It either works or doesn't. It either bugs out or doesn't. Has a memory leak or doesn't. 



Games are much more subjective. I love Death Stranding. I think it's brilliant. Riveting, engaging. Plenty of people disagree. Plenty of people agree. Opinion.




I'm not narcissistic enough to believe that I can just decide what art is good or not."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"So in your world the code stops at either of it compiles or dont, and then afterwards the functionality and logic that applies the behaviours that you see in game that directly comes from the code it is based on is a new completely subjective thing.

Just out of curiosity I will ask my co workers what they think about that on monday morning 😅 but I can tell you that you wouldnt last long in software engineering with that mindset. You cannot separate the two. And the same thing happens in movies where when the cinematography is great, you can see it is.

Not narcissistic enough to believe that you can just decide what art is good or not but narcissistic enough to devoid what you decide to call art of any responsabilities to fulfill the set of skills that are required to create said art

If there is one thing I really dont like, is disregarding the effort that one needs to improve on their skills as having the outcome be recognized as completely subjective. Or maybe in this reality the skills are also completely apart from the craft? 

Its like comparing the recent kong game made in 1 week using public assets by a student as a prototype that he sold as a game (because why not honestly) with Baldurs Gate 3 or Elden Ring."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"I mean you can keep purposefully misconstruing what I'm saying, I guess. That's fine too. Doesn't change the fact that ultimately, art is subjective."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Its more like you set a wall in you mind separating what is needed to make art from the actual ""artpiece"" in your head. Not just in videogame with coding, and concept artists, and devops etc etc But with movies and cinematography, and storyboards, and makeup, and characterization, and scripting, and narrative; all of this skills arent subjective but the product of them are? 

But I guess you would actually need to have those skills in order to understand what it takes to have and improve upon them and that the quality of the result can be clearly seen"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"All of those skills are subjective. What one person deems good cinematography is not the same as a other. Same with makeup, scripting, and so on. You keep getting so close to understanding it."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,I will just say that I would definetely keep on teaching and not creating with that mindset
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,I'm also a writer. So your unsolicited advice will be ignored.
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Obviously an information that has been relevant for hours just now appears suddenly, you definetely need work on your narrative skills

Wait no, no need to improve upon them, for how can you, and why would you, improve into something that is subjective?

Specially when you decide which skills are subjective and which arent. Makeup? Subjective. Frontend development? Objective. Databases? Objective. Cinematography? Subjective. Prose? Subjective. Backend development? Objective, nearly scientific 😂"
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"I'm not in the habit of bragging about my career. What I do for a living isn't relevant to the conversation. Until you decided to make it relevant. You can believe me or not, it makes no difference to me.



You finally understood my point, by the way. Nice work."
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,A deep bow to your patience. I read your entire conversation and I’m impressed. I would have exploded from irritation several times. It seems that working with children and interacting with unique personalities on the internet aren’t much different.
1fgh0ga,2024-09-14,2024-09-14,"Finally, yay me! 

Not narcissitic at all believing that you decide what is art and what isnt, and that curiously enough your field is huh 😂

7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"The battle tactics (or lack thereof) you're describing remind me a lot of the naval war between Germany and England in WWI. Both sides had so much invested into their capitol ships that they rarely, if ever, actually engaged in head to head combat. Kaiser Wilhelm actually had a standing order to not let his dreadnaughts leave their safe harbors, which pushed the German Navy to start relying on submarine warfare to carry out their primary mission of breaking England's shit. 

There were only one or two battles that could be called decisive, but they were nothing like the naval battles of the Napoleonic wars that everyone was hoping for. 

I'm interested to see how this plays out. Hopefully you get the war you're all hoping for."

7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"Here's an FAQ for those of you reading this who don't play/haven't tried playing EVE.

**Is this kind of thing the norm for most EVE Online players?**

No. Massive battles like this happen very rarely

**Are these massive battles any fun?**

No. The game slows down time to 10% of normal time so everything is very slow and laggy and it takes forever. This is done so the servers can handle the thousands of inputs per second without overloading.

**I've heard that EVE is known as the ""spreadsheet simulator."" That sounds very boring.**

Hell yeah spreadsheets are boring. Fuck spreadsheets. You never need to make or use a single spreadsheet to play this game. But if you want to become a hardcore industrialist or run the markets and join the 1% of the 1% in-game, yeah you need spreadsheets. Turns out that doing complicated financial shit requires lots of math. If you're the kind of player that plays WoW just so you can play the auction house and hit the gold cap, then you'll love the god damn spreadsheets. But if you're a sane individual who just likes blowing shit up on the regular, you don't ever need to look at a spreadsheet.

**Do I need to pay for this game or can I earn enough money as a free to play player to start paying for a subscription with in-game currency?**

No, you don't need to pay for the game. And you can earn enough money as a free to play player to start paying for a subscription. But that shit is fucking boring as hell. Who wants to sit next to a rock for literally fucking days just so they can one day get to the actual fun part of the game? Fucking lunatics, that's who. Don't be a fucking lunatic. It's one hour of work in real life to pay for a subscription (2 hours if you make minimum wage). Go mow the neighbor's lawn for fuck's sake. Take an hour out of your month to earn $15 dollars so you don't have to be a nutjob shooting fucking rocks all day, and instead be a nutjob shooting other players all day. That's the fun shit. Do that.

**This massive battle sounds super boring. Why would I want to join EVE and be a part of that?**

You don't want to be a part of that. It's actually hell. The real fun is jumping in some ships with 0-100 of your alliance buddies and blowing the fuck out of another alliance's ships, or getting your shit blown up by their alliance and laughing about it on voice comms while possibly making fun of your fleet commander in the process.

**If my ship gets blown up, is it gone forever?**

Yes. Quit crying and buy a new one. If you can't afford a new one, then you just learned the first lesson in the game: don't fly shit you can't afford to lose. Then practice, get good, and find that cunt who killed your shit and blow up every fucking ship they undock for the next month to teach them a lesson about fucking with you. Then get some friends and have a party shooting fireworks around a pile of that poor bastard's corpses, right outside the station he lives in.

**Is the Titan really the best ship in the game?**

Fuck no. Titans are god damn boring. It's fun for like 20 minutes when you sit in this big fucking thing and say ""ooooh look how big my dick is now."" Then you log off that character because it will only be used 3-4 times a year, if you're lucky.

The best ship in the game is whatever you like to fly. Get in it, and fly it. It's really simple. Get into a corporation with people you like and blow shit up with them in whatever the hell you like to blow shit up in. There's no best ship in the game. Fly whatever the fuck you want.

**But seriously, is there a best ship in the game though?**

Yeah, it's the Friendship. Get online. Get in a corp with people who aren't dickheads, and fly some shit together with them. Bullshit about memes or whether or not a hot dog is a sandwich or whatever the fuck you like to talk about while you're on voice chat with them. Save their asses when they get grabbed by some enemy bastard, and thank them when they save yours because you forgot not to be an idiot. 

This game doesn't hold your hand and say ""here's something for you to do."" You have to be an adult and look at this sandbox and think ""hmm what do I want to make with all this sand today?"" If you want to kill some shit, go and kill some shit. If you want to sit in the station and talk to your friends on voice chat for hours, go for it. If you're a god damn lunatic and want to sit next to rocks and shoot them with lasers for hours, be my guest. Just don't be surprised when someone else decides to build their own sand castle and blows your mining ship to pieces then collects your frozen corpse to do unsightly things with later.

7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"Why is there a time scheduled for the fight? Doesn't a battle generally begin when someone decides to attack? Shouldn't that happen at any moment and not one being advertised to the defenders and the rest of the galaxy?

And why would there be a potential for nothing to happen? A fight on this scale would surely require a significant amount of coordination, so why would anyone go through all the trouble of planning an attack/defense and mobilize forces just to do nothing? It is a game, after all. Go out and have fun with it. 

e: thanks for the responses, the station defense mechanic does make a lot of sense from a game balance perspective. "

He would make it his mission to spend months infiltrating groups, gaining trust and access to resources, and then spectacularly destroying them all. 

He and I are very different types of gamers. But it was still interesting to hear about. He ran a 7 month long ""mission"" in Eve that ended in an epic blaze. "

7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"Imagine if the in game currency they were using had been switched to a cryptocurrency. With this recent rise in prices the stakes of this battle could be in the hundreds of millions or even billions and CCP would be a billion dollar company. Not saying that raising the stakes like that would make the gameplay or experience any better for the players (and if CCP was worried about lawsuits then they definitely do not have the appetite for this type of thing) - it would just create this whole other world of potential economic and human scenarios - Wall Street bank rolling guilds, Google and Apple fighting EVE proxy wars, professional accountants quitting their day job to become EVE accountants (i.e. play EVE) etc etc. Probably would be really fun to watch.  "
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,This is high-effort bait. It is definitely part of either of the sides' efforts to goad the other into taking a risky move.

7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,The irony is that immediately after writing this article the author took his own fleet to try and do the same thing (destroy the biggest station in the game) and had twice the numbers as his enemy but as soon as he encountered any resistance he took his capital fleet to the 'safe zone' and didn't engage in a proper fight.

7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"> The Mittani will hype his people up for hours, and the Moneybadger people will do the same. Then their fleet commanders will get their fleets onto the field of battle and place them into their “safe zones” that they’ve setup for themselves (it’s a dumb new game mechanic). Then, they will stare at each other for literally hours, and send out NPC drones that they barely control that mostly do nothing, while leaving all of their Titans in complete safety. They will then each make up a bunch of excuses, declare the other side as “cowardly” for not directly charging into their defensive position, and tell everyone to log off from the game.

Sounds like actual warfare tbh, like cold war or those medieval war/ancient warfare between country, where they try to avoid clash and hopefully one will give in and sign a truce. If they want war they will probably just invade, like Japanese invasion in 2nd worldwar or Dark Souls. Barking at each other and give out battle invitation sounds like they don't wanna risk having casualty to their own force, but just to prove that they can rally up a huge force if they want to, to make sure they don't mess with each other. It's a legit war strategy, just like North Korea's nuke testing."

The feeling of panic when you see the enemy fleet is targeting you and the shakes kick in as you try to broadcast for shield reps.  The shakes are too bad and you miss the button, the enemy volley lands and blasts you off the field.  You are sitting in your escape pod feeling absolutely defeated and terrible.

7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"Ah, Eve Online.  The worst awesome game ever made.

I got deep into it around 2005.  Made billions upon billions of ISK.  Traversed Null Sec space on my own, killing people, dodging gate camps, and farming NPCs.  Joined up with a big group of players and valiantly fought against the kings of the game at the time, BoB.  Was just about to finish training up to fly a Titan near the end of 2007, IIRC.

Then the news came out that employees of CCP had been giving T2 blueprints to BoB and basically ensuring they were always going to be ahead.  The punishment for this?  Not a thing.  Just a whoops, get over it.  Bailed then and there and never looked back.

Plus, seriously, who enjoys jumping through a gate, waiting 30 minutes for the game to load, only to find yourself in a clone back in a station?  And their solution to the server lag after all these years is to just lag everyone out all the time when server load gets heavy.  What a joke."

7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,">The purpose of this post is to point out that the fleet commanders on both sides of this battle are nothing but complete cowards.

>I’ll tell you exactly what’s going to happen. The Mittani will hype his people up for hours, and the Moneybadger people will do the same. Then their fleet commanders will get their fleets onto the field of battle and place them into their “safe zones” that they’ve setup for themselves (it’s a dumb new game mechanic). Then, they will stare at each other for literally hours, and send out NPC drones that they barely control that mostly do nothing, while leaving all of their Titans in complete safety. They will then each make up a bunch of excuses, declare the other side as “cowardly” for not directly charging into their defensive position, and tell everyone to log off from the game.

I'm kind of curious about the involved game mechanics here. It kind of reads like the post is saying the leaders on both sides are cowards, but also implying that it wouldn't actually be sensible to charge straight into a defensive position (which is to say: not being the first to engage isn't so much cowardly as logical). Am I missing something here about how EVE battles work or what?"

Blatantly incorrect. One of the greatest strengths of EVE *is* the fact that different ships can be fitted in millions of different ways to be optimal for a variety of situations. For the vast majority of players, Titans are shit."

That might convince me to play.

7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"The post you linked referenced ""goons"" which I assume is Something Awful related, yet you didn't mention them at all. Which side of the alliance is SA on?"
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"To give a bit of perspective here, the Caldari Leviathan is 18km long. *18km.* Here is a lovely [bit] (https://m.imgur.com/gallery/jwTdt) done to show the scale of ships in the game. It also worth noting that every Titan has a Doomsday weapon. These insane weapons are typically high-damage, long cooldown weapons that leave its user paralyzed after being fired. These weapons are capable of absolutely annihilating an entire armada of ships, or disintegrate even the toughest of Warships, be it by the purifying light of the massive Amarr laser, or by an absolute *clusterfuck* of missles. 

No matter what, I can safely say that Titans are insane. 

But they are also tactical, being some of the most useful ships in the game. They can act as mobile bases with clone bays to act as a respawn point, holding ships to be immediately redeployed. Incredibly tanky, these ships are capable of withstanding unnerving amounts of damage. 

EVE uses a very in interesting combat mechanic, called ECM, or Electronic Countermeasures. Designed to disable or seriously impair the functions of other ships, these awesome puppet masters tend to stay behind and deal very little actual damage, but rather make enemy ships as vulnerable as they can be. Titans can be fitted with specialized ECM equipment which can disable an entire fleet at will. 

And finally, lets talk about what actually goes into a titan. To build one you need at minimum 8 weeks. You also need a ridiculous amount of resources that are mined, gathered, transported, and sold/bought by actual players. EVE's entire economy is based around the players. There are various primary trading hubs, namely Jita, the most popular. EVE online is so incomprehensibly complex because it is actually built by the players. CCP makes content, mechanics, and upholds the servers, but the players create the world as if it was real. 
*It might as well be.*

Here is a nice little [trailer] 
(https://youtu.be/AdfFnTt2UT0) showing off EVE. Just a bit of warning, contains strong language, just in case you were around other people. 

And remember, just about anything goes. 
Good Luck. o7"

I’ll tell you my story of eve I think it’s an alright one...so I was a long time WOW player, an officer in my raiding guild for quite some time...my best friend in real life who I’d worked with had introduced me to eve online just as a side hobby. The next day I mentioned it before raid and a fellow officer (long story short) gave me his eve toon of 62mil SP so long as I paid the transfer fee, gladly. I had no idea what I was doing so I just went into wormhole space got with a nobody Corp and did some sites got bored and joined a bigger Corp. MTCU, awesome group of guys had a lot of good times. Still was essentially a noob the whole time though. During that time iwantisk became a big deal I tried it out turned 5bil isk I had saved into 50bil isk, lost it back down to around 9bil isk found a glitch in the loading screen on the gambling site where you could refresh to increase your win chance. Made around 250bil isk in the end. Bought a 120mil sp toon, a few other alts gave half to my best friend and then we both got bored as fuck and quit playing like a month later. 


Tl;dr: I went from never having played eve online one day to  having 250bil isk, 120m sp toon, 3: 60mil sp alts in a couple of months from the gambling thing

Edit: detail"
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"I used to fly with Mittani back when he ran Goonfleet. Even then EVE was more fascinating as a concept than as a game, especially before they fixed big fleet battles. I remember doing a little FC'ing during one of the first truly huge fleet battles that crashed a few servers. I was super dissapoined, as I'd cleared my schedule and was super psyched for a legit 1000 v 1000 ship space battle that ended up being a 1-frame-per-minute slideshow (apparently they did a lot to fix this, which all happened riiight after I ~~got a girlfriend~~ quit). Every few months I still think about playing, and then I remember how freaking boring 80% of the game is, and since I only have a few hours here and there to play video games I pop in something more reliable.

But damn if that 20% isn't worth the payoff if you've got the time."
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,I think we the people should organize a kamikaze battalion to weaken the defenses of who ever deserves to loose.  
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"God damn, the potential in this game is fucking awesome.. too bad a have a life. I mean that in the absolute least condescending way possible. My life is boring, but I’m way too committed. I would honestly way fucking rather sit hunkered down in my basement, grab some snack food, throw on my sweats, and ball out on EVE.. wouldn’t have a fucking clue where to start though lol. "
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"So wait, how's is tomorrow a decisive day in the battle if lots going to be hours of them throwing NPCs at each trash talking?

7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"After reading this it seems that Eve is the game that “no one wants to play and *no one* wants to read about.”


A cool game, unfortunately it doesn’t appeal to the masses. 

Also it’s funny that OP made it a college thing...as if it’s only 2 years of your life that’s required. Don’t  let him fool you, it’s a never ending game that has responsibilities comparable to owning a dog or caring for a Bengal tiger, or starting a family (where you intend to send your child to college, ^any ^asshole ^can ^start ^a ^family.)"

While Pandemic Legion, the leader of the defending team, has by far the best supercapital fleet commanders and most experience with supercapitals, Goonswam, currently located in Delve, is the leading industrial powerhouse as seen in the picture. While I'm biased being in Pandemic legion myself, I'm certain Pandemic Legion would win if they wanted, but they can't do so without losses. Goonswarm could just keep repeatedly attacking until Pandemic Legion exhausted their stockpile of supercapitals, at which point Goonswarm would win due to their industrial backbone. The war is likely not sustainable for Goonswarm either, though. Pandemic Legion and players in general are going on the offense in in the now undefended Delve, attacking industrial ships on sight while the Delve defensive fleet is deployed regions away for the war. Goonswarm's industrial players would be very unhappy if this became a long term offensive conflict which they have to pay for with blood, so i expect Goonswarm to retreat after killing the objective."

You are spot on about willingness to commit and I really like your thoughts about the main players over the period. 

When I used to play, I've always had a lot of respect for how Mitanni could mobilise and organise, even if I've always been on the opposite faction. Sounds like interesting times are again upon the player base after a long period of stagnation.

Go, go, go spreadsheets online and a call out to the Aussie TZ players on both sides. I'd love to touch base with quite a lot of you if you remember me (I'm sure you can infer from my reddit name who I am - PM me bitches I miss you all!)

7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"Eve has covert-style ships that fly around invisible until they're properly positioned for a ""bombing run,"" at which point they decloak to fire area-of-effect bombs at clustered fleets of much-more-powerful enemies; carriers that launch squads of fighters to do their combat at great distances from the actual ship; dreadnaughts with enormous guns and limited mobility, etc.

Wars have happened in Eve in the last few years where players didn't attempt to invade a region of space until after sending in light attackers to degrade the infrastructures of the region and starve the locals of ships/money to stay in the fight long once an actual invasion happened.

Opposing corporations/alliances are constantly on the look out for each others' espionage and sabotage attempts, since the more dedicated players can always create a new account and sneak it into an opponent's group to gather insider intelligence or turn on them at an important moment.

Propaganda is even a widely-used tool.

7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"Played for years, and like all open ended games its what you make it. If you just sit and mine for hours on end, yeah it gets boring (unless you're a crazy person and enjoy mining), but you can pretty much do what you want. If you only want to fly around and pvp, you can- though you'll probably want to also do something to make money until you are good enough to not die every single time.

The learning curve is a bit steep, but no where near as bad as it once was. Generally if you stick to some pve to make money while you raise you skill points, you'll probably be in a decent place to afford to pvp in frigates a bit. To be good in pvp you first have to get rid of panic about destroying your ship, that and have a good idea of game mechanics, just assume you're going to die and have fun. "
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-22,"Full disclosure, eve fights can be very tedious to watch, as the game has a mechanic called time dilation (TiDi) which slows all inputs, depending on the scale of the fight, down to 10% normal time. This allows the servers to process all of the inputs from thousands of users, but causes fights to take hours. Don't let a twitch stream put you off the game because 10% TiDi fights only occur over major events."

You're half right. If a ship gets destroyed, that's it. It's gone. For good. The golden rule of EVE is ""Never fly a ship you can't afford to lose"", or in this case, replace. You can always buy or manufacture another copy of that ship, however.

>How long does it take to build a Titan?

8 weeks for a single Titan (give or take, depending on the character's skills). Granted, you can have up to 11 of these jobs running at once, per character. Usually Titans are less time restraints, and more resource restraints. They are INCREDIBLY expensive to build."
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"Over a month, though I think with max bonuses it's like 25 days now.  And yeah, once it's dead, it's dead."

7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"it's not nothing will happen, It's nothing COULD happen.  We need to band together to encourage the fleet commanders involved.  There is fear in their hearts, but if we show them de way, they will find the courage to fight."
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"As an EVE Online ""fleet commander"" myself, I can explain why nothing will happen, and why this post is all hype and no substance. The person posting the thread is from TEST Alliance Please Ignore. They have not moved any supercarriers or Titans, the most expensive ships in the game, to the fight. 


The people who are actually fighting are The Imperium, and Northern Coalition plus the Pandemic Family (which encompasses Pandemic Horde, who own the asset, and Pandemic Legion, who have most of the Supercarriers/Titans.) Both groups have citadels in place, which give people around them absolute safety. The asset they are fighting over is in a bad spot which makes it not that strategically valuable for either side. Furthermore, the asset they are fighting over is roughly the cost of five Titans. Should there be a fight, both groups stand to lose over a hundred Titans.  


So basically, there's no impetus for the fight. The asset can be easily replaced, and neither side will want to engage in a bloodbath that will cost thousands and thousands of dollars in damage. The previous fights of this scale happened accidentally - someone forgot to pay a bill in one, and someone accidentally jumped into the enemy system for the other (B-R and Asakai, respectively). In this situation, both sides know exactly what the other side will bring.  

So maybe the asset (a Keepstar) will be saved with some tactics/cheese strategy that allow the defenders to not commit. And maybe it will die because the group attacking (The Imperium) has a ton of force. But either way, the huge fight this guy is promising isn't going to happen. This is furthered by the fact that The Imperium has the strongest industrial complex in EVE, producing more ore (used to build Titans/Supers) than the next five largest groups in game. As a result, they can afford to lose these ships much more willy-nilly than the defenders.


tl;dr - the thing is easy to replace, and neither side wants to go into a full on blood bath, so this guy's hyping up something that will never happen."
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"This post from Progodlegend is actually another way of playing EVE. His idea is quite probably to put leaders of both sides on the spotlight , so they either have to fight or be marked as cowards. 

Additionally, Progodlegend is a main fleet commander of TEST, which was already fighting against The North and therefore he might be aligned with one side of the fight tomorrow. So this post is basically a propaganda and he indeed has another goals in mind."
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"This is EvE. OP is a master baiter.

Honestly my favorite part of the post. Wouldn't be classic EvE if you weren't trying to get into people's heads.

Edit: If it's anything like the EvE I remember, OP is at least a little affiliated (or maybe just has a grudge or ten) with one side. Maybe even knows that one side has a few extra tricks up their sleeve that the other side doesn't know about. Or doesn't think the other side knows about.

Back then Mittani seemed to be super popular because he was writing those war reports and almost everybody wanted to see BoB finally fall.

7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"The Imperium is attacking the largest player made structure in the game which requires it to go through three separate timers. The defenders get to choose what time the structure becomes vulnerable to attack.

The Imperium have gone through two timers already and the final timer comes out of reinforcement tomorrow and becomes vulnerable tomorrow. Staging for the fight will likely occur several hours before the structure becomes vulnerable but we know when that time will occur, hence why we have a loose ""schedule"" of probable events."
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"Times are schedule to coordinate with in game timers when key structures are vulnerable. Additionally, it takes time for everyone to log on and get set up despite requirements and foreknowledge of the event.

Defenders know when and where they will be attacked. Both sides are going to be hesitant to commit since whoever commits may be at a disadvantage with very little to gain and a metric ton to lose. 

TLDR:No one wants to be the loser of the engagement since it will be remembered. Additionally, logistics of rebuilding everything will suck immensely.

7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"The map is vast, with thousands of star systems connected by gates to each other at fixed locations.  So you have constellations (several star systems), regions (several constellations), and many many regions.  Travel between one region and another can literally take hours, depending upon the distance, the route you intend to take, and the ship you are flying.

The thing that sets EVE apart from most games of any genre is that it exists on a single server (or cluster) with everyone in the world connecting to the same map, the same resources, the same markets -- there aren't East coast, West coast, European servers, etc. (with the exception of the Chinese server... but that's a story unto itself).  Anything you do affects everyone else in some small (or large) way, and people have long memories...

As for skill in PvP, that varies A LOT between players, the skills their pilots have learned, and the ships they have designed to counter the ships you have designed.  There isn't one ""tank type"" with a big gun and a ""DPS type"" with a smaller, but cheaper one.  There are all kinds, and thousands of ways to design ships so that they do what fits your skills as well as your budget.  Once you get past that, only actual experience flying the ships fighting other players gives you the ""skill"" to hold your own in PvP.

It's not thousands of people and hundreds of ships.  There is a one-to-one ratio between a logged-on character and the ship he can fly.  But, these big battles are like WoW/Everquest/InsertMMONameHere ""raids"" -- except that raids are typically scripted against predictable AI opponents and are limited to 40/60/80 (or whatever) people at a time.  EvE has no such limits.  Quite often the battles have +/- 250 people in a fleet, sometimes with many fleets on each side (and sometimes more than just two sides), no scripted AI -- so only other human intelligence and game limitations/time-dilation dictating what can and cannot happen.  The battle in question here could have 1000 or more people on a side with +/- 1500 people in the same star system shooting at each other at the same time and many more waiting in the wings for the opportunities to jump in and deal some damage.

Hope that helps!"

ISK is the in-game money for EVE. Like how gold is in most games. ISK can be gotten by simply selling items, trading with other players, or by killing NPC pirates with bounties on their heads. You can use this ISK to buy most anything you like, from ships, to space stations, and even owning entire sections of space (if you rent from the group that owns it, that is).

The ""end goal"" of EVE is extremely subjective and you'll get a different answer to that question depending on who you ask. EVE is truly a sandbox. The end goal of EVE, essentially, is to find something you enjoy, and have fun.

Some people like to relax and mine asteroids. Some people like to manufacture and supply alliances as they go to war. Some people play the market and buy low/sell high to amass a fortune. Some people play as a space trucker, and move low value assets to high value locations and re-sell them. Some people like to try and form an alliance, with hundreds (if not thousands) of people at their command. Some people like to explore the quiet corners of space for ancient, high-value relics that can be sold. Some people join large alliances as spies and funnel vital operation information to the enemy. And finally, some people just like watching explosions.

The end game of EVE is to find what you enjoy. :)"
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"Citadels (the space station described in the OP) function a bit differently than you'd expect in combat.

Everything in EVE has 3 health bars. One for shields, one for armor, and one for hull. Once your hull hits 0, you explode. The same is true for Citadels. However, Citadels are only vulnerable during specific periods of time. If the citadel is not attacked in that vulnerability window, it is completely invulnerable and cannot be attacked until that window comes again. That window is for a few hours, once a week (if I recall correctly. Perhaps it's a few hours a day? Unsure). This is to prevent timezone issues. If I own a citadel with my buddies and we all live in the US, a group of guys from Australia could come wipe us out while we sleep. 

Regardless: Once the shields of a Citadel have been destroyed, the Citadel enters reinforcement mode and cannot be attacked for several days. Both the attackers and defenders know when the citadel will be vulnerable again, which gives both sides time to prepare for the attack/defense. You then repeat this cycle for the hull of the citadel."

7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"They solve this with something called time dilation. TIDI. It slows the game so it runs ~10% of real time speed - specifically so the server can process all the events occurring wihtout it collapsing and crashing. The actual latency does suffer, but nowhere near as much as you might think with 4000+ players in system, many of whom are controlling multiple ships per player (drones and such like)."
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"You can now play for free as an alpha pilot; if you join the game join Pandemic Horde; we can get you free ships and everything while guiding you through the process of how to play, etc.  We're also the defenders in this big battle."
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"most battles in eve happen in a few ways:

you can attack a system that seems to lack defenders. you dont let your opponant know you will attack. you organize a few thousand people, they all quietly position ships and resources in starbases near the target for a few weeks and then on the secret day and time they all log in at once and rush the system.  useualy the attacker figures out what time zone there opponants live in and time there attack for when they are asleep.  

there opponents will try to orgonize thousands of players to rush to there PC and log in for the purpose of defense. They do this by haveing the guilds commanders call potentially hundreds of people on a call sheet, wakeing them up, and pulling them out of school or work.  the opponant may have spies pretending to be in the attackers guild, the opponants may be watching twitter or have snuck into the right discord server.  sometimes players use an alternate account and spend years positioning themselves in there opponant's ranks just so they can get early warning of an attack.

large wars often feature massive front lines and many disputed systems. the issue there becomes makeing sure that your forces are arranged so that your players can group for a large attack or defense without being so clumped up that your opponat can attack you where you are weak.

one of the biggest fights in eve featured a single player with a titan, accidently warping into the wrong system and getting trapped in an anti warp bubble.  over the next few hours thousands of players both allied to and hostile to the wayward titan logged on, and rushed across the galaxy to kill or save the couple thousand dollar ship.  the battle balloned from a few dozen ships to a few hundred before the defenders gave up and lost there titan as well as most of there ramshackle defense fleet.

Tommorows war seems like a waste because both sides know where and when the other side is supposedly attacking, neither side seems to have an advantage. so why actually fight?

but this is eve remember!  this very reddit post might be disinformation created by one side or the other to confuse there opponent.  remember we are talking about massive gaming guilds that can easily throw 20+ thousand upvotes on a reddit thread.   The mittani may be useing reddit to reduce the player turn out of his foe...

7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"I PVE only in ""high security"" space.  Can still get ganked but it's not all that common.

People will give people like me shit, but screw them.  I'm not wired for investing tons of time and effort and then putting it on the line to PVP.  IF I want PVP, I'll play something where the deck isn't stacked against me.

I play the game to relax, and security missions up to level 4 are pretty brainless work once you learn the basic systems of the game, for that you'll need to get into a battleship which you can now do on a free account.  

You're restricted on mining ships severely, and somewhat on industrial ships(haulers).  It's more that it's enough to gather up your junk and move it around, rather than to play a professional hauler, thoug there are Corporations that do just that, and there are hauling ""missions"", but they can send you into dangerous areas and don't offer great isk...iirc....but from what I gather some people do get into it....just seemed pointless to me.

There is what they call ""ratting"" which would amount to ""farming"" in other mmo's, you cruise around to various locations and just kill the present NPC's until they stop spawning, then find another location.  This is kind of popular though so you're often jockeying with other players to get the kills.  

If nothing else, as I said, it's free, a lot of content to be had to mess around with.  Maybe you'll even get into PVP, or using a cheap ship to go ""exploring"" in places where there's less PVP but still a risk, places you can make some serious bank if you find it and get away quick. (once you start to get used to using Frigates, if you want to get into exploration, you'll want to learn how to scan and figure out wormholes)  This is fairly popular because there's little to no investment/risk, once you build up enough capital, these small ships are practically disposable.  A couple lucky drops and you've paid for your ships for a long long time."

The guy who wants a book written about him is pretty much what happens when anyone gets a bunch of fame/power. In EVE, The Mittani (as he goes by) is one of, if not the most powerful player in the game, capable of calling on a small army (even by real world standards), wealthy (in the game) beyond reason, and without much else to do. It only makes sense that the power would go to their head."

7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"My reasons for not playing:

* Huge time sink - unless you have a empire in null-sec where you can just log on when you get a ping to action, it's a day job to have a space outside of high-sec.

* Lemming warfare - gone are the days of small gang fights. The big corps just ping their friends when they come up against small groups that know what they're doing and smother them to death.

* CCP nerfed w-space making anything less than a class 5/6 a wasteland. And that meant the small corp/gang warfare was dead because you need big corps to hold 5/6's. They nerfed T3's, the only w-space specific product thereby making most resources in w-space worthless. 

* The rebalancing - after spending a couple of years actually learning how to play the game well CCP made you learn it all over again. So, if you were worth your salt you needed to spend time on the test server testing out shit. It was like going to night school on top of your day job that is playing the game. "
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"Nobody paid 1000$ to get those ships. Every ship in Eve is made by players by getting minerals and making the ships in a factory. There are no ""micro transaction shops"" in-game where you can buy ships. The thing is, it's possible to get a dollar to ISK (the in-game currency) ratio because there are a couple of items you can buy for real money and sell for ISK (skins and a special item called PLEX, that gives you a subscription for a month).

Because of that, it's tempting to put a price on the ship, but pretty much all of those ships got acquired in-game with ISK, or by mining the astronomical of mineral to make one."
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"Nobody paid money for it. They created it with ingame materials which they acquired one way or another.

7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"Real money isn't paid. The values quoted here are a conversion from in-game cost to real money. I'm worth about 190 Billion ISK in game right now, which is (roughly) £1900 worth (based on the fact I can pay my subscription with real money - £15/month - or with in game currency - about 1.5Billion a month I think), but I've never actually put anywhere near that much real money into the game with my subscriptions."

When these structures are online and functional, they provide an effect called ""tethering"" to anyone friendly with the owners of it.  They are the replacements for POSes.  One can sit within docking range of the station and as long as they aren't being shot at and are not targeting anything, they become tethered.  The tether repairs ships and recharges capacitor.  They are virtually invunerable while tethered but can be bumped out of it."

never fought any real battles, all i do is sneak salvage from other's battles and small local fights

other than that all i do in the game is manufacture goods and transport it too low population areas where i can sell it higher, sometimes the demand is so high that i will buy it in large cities and sell it in low population areas for a profit of something double of what they cost elsewhere ( sometimes even more) do mind reselling the same goods elsewhere is not a quick cash solution, sometimes i wait 1-3 months of real life time to sell everything i bought in bulk to resell elsewhere"

in the lead up fight to this one, that happened last week 3 titans tried to Leroy and kill a bunch of ~~Battleships~~ Carriers, 2 died and one got away. Which was awesome! however it did not trigger an escalation as we had hoped. :-(

(edit, Carriers, also they did not kill the carriers because they were actually too close)

7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"Very common story back when corporation controls were very weak. Basically there were only a few tiers of 'settings' you could apply in-guild. 

So trusting someone was essentially absolute, even if you didn't really trust them.

Many players ran long cons that ended in stealing everything the corp had worked for, with the click of a button. This is in part because the most sensible way to structure most corps/guilds is like a commune. The miners mine, provide resource to the manufacturers, who provide resources to the combat pilots. The central pool for transferring each kind of resource is what the conners would target. They'd only had to drag and drop everything from 1 window to another.

I really want to emphasise that these guys wiped out months of work, hundreds or thousands of man hours. They spread utter ruin and distrust in a game where success and working as a group are the positives. 

I encourage this guy's brother to put his kickstarter out. I bet there are people who even 10 years after the fact would love to burn one of these fucker's houses down in retaliation.

Since it's a subscription-based game, that's a problem.

Though back when I played I was in a mining coalition that stayed out of conflict for the most part, and these big wars made mineral prices skyrocket. We'd sell our reserve ore and make a killing.

Though then we had to hire mercenary fleets to protect our mining operations. And they upped their rates knowing that the ore we had was worth more than they were getting paid.

I made sure to always have a constant stream of industrial ships offloading from my mining command ship to get as much of the ore as possible into stations out of system as quickly as possible.

Renting more servers won't work because all of the burden can only be on one server."
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,They already have the best Server set up in business. Its world class. Its goes way beyond just adding more server space

7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,It seems so fun until you play it
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"The game lives largely in the imagination - except for, you know, the part where real money is involved. "
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"They are impossible to play too. As a long time Eve player, I really don't like these big battles and don't like the hype they get inside and out of the community (especially out). They are just lag fests and far more frustrating than fun.

Small battles of a few players (5 or 6) up to a max of 100-200 players, are far more fun. Far more blood pumping and exciting. The ones with thousands like this, where a death is more along the lines of ""oh I tried to warp 10 minutes ago, but this guy shot me 5 minutes ago... I guess I'm dead? ok then"" or where a weapon reload that is supposed to take 10 seconds ends up taking 20 minutes, not so much. 

Maybe some people actually enjoy it. But, I think the hype far outweighs any enjoyment people get from these battles. If the game's servers could actually support these battles, then maybe they would be more fun.

Edit: yeah it's not ""lag"" you would see in other games. It's intentionally slowed down actions. It's bad, but it's a lot better than the legit lag  these battles used to have where stuff would happen then all catch up at once. Some others explained Time Dilation (TiDi) below. TiDi is a good solution without actually fixing the problem."

7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"I understand the scale of it is what makes it cool, but that sounds like a fucking boring way to spend 1,000,000 dollars."
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"Its a long time, but the logistics of moving all the materials required out to null to build it is super crazy too. Its a LOT of material to move with big slow ships and make great targets. My group built one titan before we said screw that and went back to shooting people and letting others build our supers for us."
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"What's worse is that they can only be constructed in deep space, so if someone finds out about it a week into the build, they might round up 500 of their friends and conduct a coathangar op to destroy it."
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,And cost a few thousand USD if you use the conversion rate for game subscriptions to ISK. In EVE you can buy extra game subscriptions and sell them to other players for the main game currency ISK. If you're really good and dedicated you could use the free trial to build up enough in game currency to buy a subscription so you never have to pay.
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"The insane part is that it takes a ton of logistics to run a Titan.

Most people will have both a character to actually fly their Titan, and an alt character to sit in their Titan. On top of this, they will normally have a few cyno alts that light beacons for their Titans to jump to and scouting alts to make sure people weren't hunting you.

A Titan pilot normally took a year to train directly into the required skills (Guns, Armor, Doomsday, Piloting skills, Jump Drive skills, etc., etc.). A Titan sitting alt takes a few months at least.  I'm not sure how current these times are, I stopped playing before skill injectors were a thing.

Being in a large alliance takes some of the stress off of piloting, but every Titan pilot I knew had the ability to do everything on their own if they needed to. 

Being a Titan pilot is also one of the most stressful things in the game, because there are other players whose end-game is Titan hunting. Titan hunters are stupid dedicated too, I know of a Titan that logged out in a system for months, and Titan hunters left an alt there for the entire time just on the off-chance the person didn't quit. They killed the Titan the first time it logged in after months of being offline."
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"And that's just to construct the hull, that isn't accounting for the time to train the character to build it and weapons, shields, etc it needs to be functional."
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"Well, a titan also costs about 100b isk to build and equip.  If you want to pay USD, that comes to about... 

100b / 3.25m (current ISK price of a microplex) * $100 (price for) / 2860 (microplex).  

$1,078.

Of course almost no one does this.  I'd say 99.something% of titans are made by earning money in game.

I currently pay about $300 a year in subscription fees into the game, and I've played since 2014 or so (maybe $1000 total.)  I could have a titan right now if I really wanted one, but I can't afford to lose it yet, so I wouldn't."
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"Thats 8 weeks if you have the stuff to actually make the Titan, which most players in EVE will never accumulate at one time. Titans sound cool, but they cannot be docked into stations, so you need a separate account from your main account just to effectively pilot it, and even then, you really only use it for creating jump bridges."
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,Can you fly covops? 
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"Sorry 'bout that. Still kind of new to EVE, and I play on and off since my computer isn't all that great."

7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"It's funny how this actually resembles how fighting happened during the middle ages in Europe. Rarely were there pitched battles (just like in this instance, the risk was too great), instead it was often skirmishes or one sided engagements. "
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"Doesn't that pretty much sum up ""The Art Of War""? Attack where the enemy is weak and Defend the unassailable."
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"Remember when Titans had a weapon that could singlehandedly destroy fleets?

Yeah, fun times. "
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"The thing is, if the attackers really commit their force, the smartest thing the defenders could do is withdraw.  There is a MASSIVE disparity in the resources available.  

The attackers (Goons, CFC, Imperium, Redswarm, whatever you want to call them these days) spun up an unparalleled military-industrial complex after losing the last great war.  

Someone ran stats a few weeks back on the ""known"" supercaps active in the last 3 months, and their force dwarfs all others.  It's roughly on par with every other coalition _combined_.  The defenders cannot afford to ""trade"" supercaps in a pitched brawl.  Even if they won the fight, if the losses are anywhere near parity, they effectively lose - the attackers have supercaps to spare, and the defenders don't.

The smart play would be to let this keepstar go.  Attacker turnout tends to fall off as people get tired of prosecuting wars, and the defenders have a far better chance of doing something other than uselessly wasting their supercap fleet if they wait until later in the war."
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"It will more then likely be streamed, I went to work in 2014 and came back and the players were still fighting. Just prepare for it to be very boring to watch, when large battles like this take place the server slows it self to compensate for the lag. So commands will take minutes, or even 45 minutes to process if i remember right. "

7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"The only downside is that these smaller corps are usually focused on 1 or 2 things, so they're not as flexible as big corporations that do everything.

Still, the time I had the most fun was when our 15 man corp tried to conquer our own little patch of Wormhole, before you could anchor citadels in space."
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"*Better to be destitute and die a legend than be wealthy and live a coward in my book.*

Besides, all of that million dollars is tied up as ship assets and by extension, ISK. There's no real way I believe to turn it back into liquid cash. A million dollars in your bank account is good for many things. A million dollars of virtual spaceships is really only good for blowing a ton of shit up."

7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"The game becomes deeply political and highly partisan. Coalitions use propaganda on public and private forums to boost their morale and reduce their enemies' (Reddit is a good example of this). Espionage is everywhere, and sides implement sophisticated counter-espionage (hint: if you copy and paste something from an EVE faction's forums, subtle changes have been made to its timestamps and characters to uniquely identify you).

We are kind of at the point where blueprints and builders could not keep up to demand were we to lose our fleet, but us losing our fleet means they lose theirs to a degree and in theory, we could rebuild faster. It's all a huge meta game and who knows what will happen. I for one hope we brawl and we just decimate our fleets then come back 45 days later with another fleet and we'll see what shows up to meet us.

7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"Old scan mechanic was suuuper annoying. I lived in null for a while before the change and to scan for sigs was a process for sure. 

Signatures could populate ~4au from planets, this means you had to drop probes to cover all the planets. Doesn't sound too bad, but the problem is, probes could only be dropped in place where you were and not moved and you could not have a probe active inside the bubble of another probe. 

For the distant planets this just meant a lot of warping around and dropping (consumed) probes, but the inner planets required a bit of finesse to find locations to drop probes properly. Usually you ended up needing to make bookmarks in midwarp between planets to come up with a good spot, and the lag involved and speeds of warp travel meant it usually required a few tries.

Once you got all the initial probes down with the largest coverage sizes, you scanned. This scan took a few minutes even with training the skills to reduce the time, oh and it wasn't a guaranteed chance to get the signature each scan, so you had to do it a few times. 

After all that, once you got a return of you long range probes (quest I think they were called), you then had a point of vague accuracy to work with. Now you got to do it all over again with slightly smaller probes with a smaller radius. Repeat that a few times and you got your signature nailed down. Fun times."

7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,That's because it's taken from an Interview during Worldwar Bee (which is what most eve players called the conflict between CFC and the MBC) of sapporo jones...he was interviewed by a female streamer about a battle that just happened.
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"Just to be clear, the post about them not recruiting often is, afaik, a joke. I haven't played Eve in a year or two, but back when I did I was in Dreddit and they would literally accept anyone capable of submitting an application and passing a basic background check.

Like what was said above, even a novice player can contribute to a fight like this. You won't be piloting a Titan or really making any decisions for yourself, but the corp will generally give you an outfitted ship as long as you have some basic skill prereqs and can follow orders. Funding is incredibly important in Eve, but so are pilots. Every ship needs one, and well organized novices in basic ships can meaningfully contribute to a battle. 

Dreddit and the Test Alliance are (last time I played) like the zerg. They field massive numbers of smaller ships and often will shoot each other down for laughs during downtime. Basically they take the game much less seriously than Imperium does, but still have a competent and functional fleet.

The best advice I can give you is to join Dreddit and volunteer for any combat duty they will give you. Since you'll be using a ship they provide and be lead by experienced players you can be involved in higher level combat and won't worry too much about losing your ship. This gets you right into the meat and potatoes of Eve without spending months doing the equivalent of space manual labor to save up for something nice."
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"No. I work with real world security systems. We don’t just hand the fucking keys over to a salaryman and walk away. We have monitoring, audits, security roles, police, background checks.

Does it make any goddamn sense that you could be a mid tier executive for apple and just move 1,000 iPhones into another section of the warehouse with the click of a button and no repercussions?

Does it make sense that a captain in charge of logistics in the us army could tell norad to shut off their radars, all naval bases to stop paying attention to their sonar etc with the click of one button?

Real spies face consequences. There is NO POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCE for sabotage/espionage in eve. Furthermore the ability to trade characters means it’s literally impossible to face consequences. The end result is that with the old tools in place you would see no further fleet battles or major corps in eve. 

CCP changed the rules precisely because so much of the “epic”  nature was a fiction. The greatest alliance in the game was ended principally for two reasons: 1 their choke was completely offlined in the small hours of the morning and therefore system taken without a fight (free station for them too and enormous wealth from the theft), 2: the titan ASCN had was killed while its pilot was unable to login due to server issues.

7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"If they did this in this fight it's going to be tedious to watch due to the fact CCP handles big fights with a ""Mechanic"" known as time Dilation, which slows down time to up to 10% of real time, meaning everything takes 10X as long. This makes it so the servers can process having several thousand players, ships, drones, and conversations all in one zone.

So if a fight would normally take 2 hours to resolve, a fight like this will take 20 hours, though the extended time does mean a smaller percentage is spent staring at eachother thinking and gathering intel.  

So in all likelyhood this will be a 10-14 hour brawl if things go as us line members hope.

The reason the fleet commanders likely don't want to go all out is because it will bankrupt the coalitions, both sides of which run ""SRP"", or ship replacement programs to keep pvp pilots out on the frontlines fighting and harassing the enemy.  This SRP is usually paid for by various taxes levied through out the empire, as well as the personal in game wealth of the leadership.

So as a line member, I hope it gets serious and we(The Goonswarm federation/The Imperium) take out the enemy Keepstar (Think Immobile deathstar for docking super's and titans, which are kind of like super weapons), and get some good fights doing it."

7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"Yeah, it gets a little nuts when you get into details about how everything works on alliance+ level scales. I was an officer in an alliance of about 4-5 thousand people and was part of the logistics team that managed our allaince's internal jump bridge network and stations (back when player owned stations required fuel). It was a lot of work to keep the amount of resources required flowing.

Freighters, the largest cargo transport ships, are really effective at moving large amounts of material but dear god are they slow, and very vulnerable to any attack as they are completely unarmed. 

You either planed out an escort fleet for them, or you had scouts in the surrounding systems and tried to move them quietly without anyone noticing.

Titans require about 60 million cubic meters of materials to build, and each freighter can hold just under 1 million."
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"It most certainly is, and we take pride in it, however crazy that may make us. ;)"
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"It is but there is often a lot of nothing happening too. The scale is unmatched by other games today though.

Like this fight tomorrow for example. I was in a large battle a fraction of the potential size of this on new year's day last year and I was at my computer for 8 hours. 2 hours of form up and traveling with my capital ship to the fight, 5 hours of time dilated fighting (server slows to 10% time to handle everything) and 1 hour of extracting. Had to move rest of way home the next day.

That wasn't nearly as much fun as an massive space battle for hours should be. But I've had hour long fights where reinforcement waves crash in and it's a tug of war back and forth to hold control of the battle that have been amazing fun and nothing else can even compare to in other games."
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"The real answer is yes. There is a chance for every item (except for 3, but insignificant) equipped to it (around 21 items) and *everything* in its cargohold (possibly many, many items) to drop.

Some of these items are quite large and would need other large ships to even pick them up off the wreck. In the heat of battle, it isn't uncommon to ""shoot wrecks"" which means to basically destroy everything that can't be picked up quickly...so you can get off field before their reinforcements show up and can possibly get back some of their dropped items.

...But most titan pilots don't really like to put it in harm's way and/or just load all their shit in it to make it easier to move when they need to get out of dodge quickly, so they load them up like a safe. Crack the safe open, and see what spills out. It's not uncommon for a titan to be holding items that double the base price of just the shell. The better the mods, ideally, the better it will do in battle. When you're talking about titans, there's no other ship better suited or more likely to be carrying the best of the best modules in the game.

There's levels of items in game that the price gets *exceptionally* more expensive with diminishing rewards. If you don't have those high end items, then you've got basically a ""shit fit"". Think an item that gives 25% boost might cost 10m isk (in game currency), a similar item gives 28% boost will cost 50m isk, an item that gives 31% boost will cost 500 million isk, and an item that gives 33% boost will cost 1-3 billion isk. There's several modules (that are used almost exclusively on titans just because of their rarity/cost) that are worth 10-15B isk. Most high end non-capital ships cost 100-300m for just the hull. A titan (at least back when I used to play) would run an easy 90-100B isk for only the hull and no equipment.

Edit: and for a little more info. Titans will almost always carry extra modules to fit, because you can't really expect them to retreat to a place to refit and come back to make it in their time of need (very rarely, but sure)...so they'll carry extras of all these expensive mods to fit for battle as well. They'll refit for battle just before they enter the field for how they want their resistances against damage to be (if it's known what type of damage the enemy is doing...which when you involve titans, there's *always* spies in teamspeak/discord listening to what ammo is being carried/shot.)

Titans are almost never the first ships to enter the battlefield. As illustrated by OP, they sit and wait at a location away from battle in the hopes that one day they'll be called in."

Even in later wars, like Vietnam, the the North Vietnamese/Viet Cong committed to an all out offensive (the Tet offensive) in an effort to push the Americans out. It was actually a spectacular tactical and strategic failure, but ended up being an incredible political victory.

7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"Last I was aware, the running price of a titan was about $4,000 USD (in ISK obvs). Since you can't fly more than one ship at a time, the most stake any one person will have in at a time is around that. Its entirely possible that some people may have more than one titan that they're able to bring into this battle and can rack up larger costs. The million dollar figure refers to the total assets that are potentially about to be destroyed. A lot of these assets I believe were funded by in-game player corporations, so those corporations and their leadership actually stand to lose substantial amounts of value."

They couldn't touch it without breaking shit, it was more undocumented than a Mar-a-Lago kitchen worker, and the guy who made the mess was gone.

They're ripping out POS functions one by one and replacing them with the new Upwell structures. We have Citadels, intended as player staging, which can even mount their own market hubs and clone bays. The biggest ones (the Keepstars, like the one being fought over tomorrow) can mount doomsday devices and dock titans. They've also got Engineering Complexes, which are industry-oriented structures that give bonuses to manufacturing, and Refineries, which replaced POS moon mining and took over all reprocessing and reactions. In the next year or two we're expecting something to replace jump bridges and some other similar functions. Sov nullsec outposts are also being ripped out soon and replaced with Citadels.

There's probably really good arguments for and against the tethering function, which is a native function of all of these structures and which pretty much covers the structure's rather generous docking radius. Personally I like it and feel like tethering should be a function of all stations now; it does eliminate several elements of gameplay, particularly undock camping and the need for instadock/instaundock bookmarks, but at the same time, I don't feel like those specific things are gameplay that is terribly interesting or deserving of being preserved. Carriers being able to fly fighters from tether is a big oversight, but as far as I'm aware it's the only offensive-type action a ship can really take from tether, and it's otherwise pretty well-implemented in that respect.

Right now I think the big furor is that the structures are too good at defending themselves. People generally got used to tethering as a mechanic.

7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"I think they mean “it has benefits, won’t necessarily be better if it gets “fixed” with a more powerful server (cluster) where there is no need to use time dilation.” Bug being the wrong word for the workaround to the server not being able to keep up."
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"From what I understand, Arena just had the illusion of an open-world map. Each town was actually isolated in its own infinite plane. If you tried walking from one town to another without fast traveling, you would never reach your destination.

Daggerfall, on the other hand, was genuinely open-world and its map weighed in at about 62 *THOUSAND* square miles. Ironically, it should have had the smallest map relative to the other games. [Whoops](https://i.imgur.com/B7rBN.jpg)."

7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"You are (nearly) completely safe in the starting areas. They are high security space and the NPC space police do not appreciate people attacking in high sec.

Its true you can be attacked and killed anywhere in the game, but in high sec the attacker will be killed by the NPC police, so its a suicide attack, and unless you are carrying expensive things, they probably wont bother.

If you stick to high sec, and dont get stupid by carrying hundreds of millions of isk (in game currency) of cargo in a shitty ship, you'll be fine.

Be wary of offers that are too good to be true, and when in doubt, dont trust anyone, scamming and theft are part of the game. You can join noob friendly groups, or just kinda hang out and learn on your own like I did.

It takes a long time to gain a complete understanding of all the game's mechanics and what all the ships can do, but don't let that scare you off. You can pick up the basics in the starting tutorial and build from there."
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"Eve is harsh, but not that harsh. While it's technically possible to gank new players in starter areas, ganking in starter areas is one of the few things that will get you banned, so there's little to worry about. And especially as a new player, it's unlikely anybody would attack you in high security space. It's simply not worth it. Attackers are guaranteed to lose their ships to the NPC police, and any ship that can kill even a newbie before the NPC police can react is almost certainly more expensive than your ship and cargo. Just don't haul super valuable stuff, especially if you don't know what you're doing. "
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"If you treat it like any other MMO, and sink time into it, it's not hard. I used to mine and sell and produce for like a week and a half, and that would pay for the month. Rest time I could do whatever. I don't know what the economy is like now though because that was years ago"

7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,">but that's just it: once things became desperate

Well not just desperate situations, the western offensive (Hitler invading France and the low countries) was also an all pitched battle. Hitler invading Russia was also an all out pitched battle. The battle of Midway was also an all out pitched battle. The Germans and Japanese committed to many more pitched battles later in the war, particularly when it was plainly inadvisable (Kursk, Ardennes offensive, battle of Philippine Sea), but they also made such commitments before. 

The allied invasion at D-Day was a pitched battle, the early counter offensives by the Soviet Union once they checked the German advance on Moscow were pitched as well. 

In all of the above cases, ignoring the later desperation battles, they were major commitments on one side against a capable opponent in which victory was far from guaranteed and the attacking side wasn't, in an absolute sense, being forced to commit to the battle. "
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"You aren't going to get one solo, that's for sure. You wouldn't want to take the damn thing out without an entourage anyways unless you like throwing money/time away and giving someone a great killmail (mail you get in game staying what you blew up and how it was equipped).

Titans are typically built by corporations (basically guilds) or alliances (groups of corps). They require a lot of resources, money, and manufacturing skills, and it's incredibly difficult to level up in all the different skills enough to acquire all you'd need. Mining, scavenging, combat, manufacturing, etc. Not to mention the in game (and real life) skills required to both outfit and pilot it without it getting blown up."
7sa25p,2018-01-22,2018-01-23,"I don't think the legal answer is clear, and I'm sure it varies by jurisdiction.

The only case I've found so far is Blizzard vs Peons4Hire, which Blizzard definitively won."

Sony doesnt even have to try, even without first party output the best selling best reviewed games of the year are still console exclusive(meaning on no other consoles) to Playstation: Black Myth, Astro Bot, Helldivers 2, FF7 Rebirth, Silent Hill 2. And if GTA 6 skips PC on launch it will sell playstations like hotcakes as the default console to play it on

Sony has such a strong market share and console-exclusive line up they can afford to coast and not have strong first party output for a year or 2 and will still sell a shit ton of consoles"

Just as an example, Last of Us 1 got a ""Remaster"" literally *a Year* after its original release when they made the PS4 Port.

Sony for some reason has this strange fascination with treating Ports of recent-ish games as full-on re-releases instead of *just* a Port, and people rather understandably think that's silly."
1hd2vmf,2024-12-13,2024-12-13,It’s called remaster. As far as I know God of War or Ghost of Tsushima or Horizon FW went with the same title. This probably means they will release remaster on PS5 as well
1hd2vmf,2024-12-13,2024-12-13,It was more an ad than a trailer. Like they didn’t hype it up that much.
1hd2vmf,2024-12-13,2024-12-13,"Thanks, I had thought it was already and that they were going full Todd Howard. Good for PC players I guess, but I’d have much rather seen a Last of Us 3."
1hd2vmf,2024-12-13,2024-12-13,I agree with all of that but the OP seemed to imply that this is a new re-remastered when it's not. Part 2 Remastered was released on PS5 this January and this is just a PC version of that.

18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-26,"First half of the game was really fucking good.

Second half of the game I did not enjoy the direction of the story. Without spoiling anything, the first half of the game conditioned me to feel one way, the second half goes against that. I know why they did it. I did not enjoy it."
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,The game itself was great. The direction they took the story was very questionable.
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,I think it's the best game ever made.
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,"You absolutely should if you enjoyed the first one. It’s an upgrade form the original in every way possible- Graphics, Story, gameplay, scope etc. Have fun :)"

Great gameplay, I’d say it’s Naughty Dog’s best. I find the online reception is a bit overblown. It’s neither the most incredible masterpiece nor is it the worst most disgraceful thing to have ever experienced. It’s fine. I quite like it. In some aspects more than 1."
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,"Big Yes. The game is flawless when it comes to gameplay and mechanics. The story is bitter and I hate to admit it but it suits the game’s world more. I got into the game without knowing any spoilers. First I didn’t liked the story direction, but that started to change during the game and after I finished it I had to think about it and its message for a few days. Now even though I still think it’s a bitter and depressing story I’m pretty much liking it because in my opinion it captures how us, humans would behave.

I’d say go for it."
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,"The only answer is yes. Even if you have mixed feelings on the story, the combat is so fun and satisfying"

I don’t agree with its pacing or overall narrative, but there’s just so damn much to appreciate in the game.  Also, it’s getting a PS5 upgrade for like 10 bucks at the end of January.  If you can wait, play it then, but it’s still a great experience either way."

The game has been out for a number of years. There are plenty of written and video reviews. On top of that, you also have played the first one. Do you not know ANYONE who you trust to give you an opinion on this game? If not, are ""random Redditors"" really going to know *you* well enough to answer your question?
 
I genuinely don't understand how these types of posts keep getting made, and even less why they aren't immediately removed/downvoted."
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,Yes. It’s absolutely amazing. One of the best games I’ve ever played.
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,"It’s a great game, tho I can completely understand somebody not liking the direction of the story if they were expecting more of the same of the first game, the writers clearly didn’t want to be safe with the sequal…their ideas mostly pay off…sometimes they don’t, but it’s definitely worth a playthrough if you loved the first game just for the experience, it’s a roller coaster for sure.

This is probably the best place to ask by the way, both LOU subs are cesspits for the most part, especially the TLOU2 sub"
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,"It's a fantastic game don't let people fool you it became popular to hate last of us when the story was leaked and the ""incident"" but the game is in my opinion an 8 or a 9 game and I don't see any score lower than a 6 being genuine.

When a game has this level of detail graphics immersion realistic gameplay sound design every aspect of the game is a 10 bar the story. 

Personally I also was spoiled on the games opening but I wasn't too fussed as I had thought it was going to happen back when the teaser for part 2 was released. A day or so later a Developer said something that basically confirmed it to me but anyways. 

The story is for the most part quite good has nice twists and gut wrenching moments. The game takes a toll on you physically and mentally like it does the characters in the game. My only gripe with the story actually was the order some events occure made it hard to make you like characters which the story wants you too.

If we got to know these characters BEFORE events happen the story would have been better and we would be more conflicted but the way they do it.....its hard to get over first impressions.

I've went on a long tangent but make no mistake this game was worthy of all the awards it won."
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,"I don't like the game, the gameplay itself is great, but there is not a single likeable character in the entire game, and you barely even face the infected, it's far more often human enemies you face."
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,If you want to be disappointed in how they ruined a good franchise go ahead
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,Personally I would say no because the writers really hate the fans of game 1
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,No just fuck Abby and the story of 2
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,"Bro just watch a review of this game, fanboys are overlooking most of the flaws of the story"
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,"The response is maybe within the reasons of _why_ did you become a huge fan of the first game. If those reasons are mostly resumed in how you get attached to the main characters, then the sequel might give you the same feelings it gave to me: emptyness, divagation, disgust (for the world they're all in), disappointment, pessimism, but as happens in everything, there's still hope and hope is one of the beautiful things that Part 2, at last, also gave me."
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,"I mean, yeah. You're probably better off waiting for the PS5 version next month though"
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,Yea it's really good. I don't think it deserved GOTY but it's still a great game
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,It’s actually insane to me how many people have opinions about stuff they’ve never experienced and ask if they should experience something before deciding whether or not they like it

18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,"Do you prefer fast paced action with smart enemies and complex combat mechanics? Then no. Do you like a more casual experience with silly swarms of easy enemies and some basic tactics that make any fight pretty easy? Then yes.  

Do you enjoy an intense narrative experience that hits hard and tries to force you to become emotionally invested through brute force? Then yes. Do you like well written characters without glaring problems with the plot and hate the assumption that the entire human race is only composed of worthless people with child-like ideals? Then no.  

Do you like visually pretty games with good sound design? Then yes. Do you like games that don't just look pretty but actually give you a world to ""meaningfully"" explore and doesn't put you on a set of rails? Then no.  

Do you like games where none of your choices or actions make a difference and you are living through the fantasy of a group of writers and seeing the story they want you to see? Then yes. Do you prefer some sort of active choice in a game and feel that outcomes shouldn't be set in stone if you can control the character? Then no.  

Do you think the writing of the Twilight movies was good? Then yes. Do you think writing of the Twilight movies is tolerable? Then you might be ok. Do you think the writing of the Twilight movies is so horrible it harms you on a spiritual level? Then no."
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,"I played it but because i had fun with the playstyle, liked the setting and i really enjoyed  part 1. I didnt like the story in part 2. It makes sense but i always struggle with the ""revenge""-topic. It never clicks for me and i dont seem to see this as a motivational term as others do. So i could not identify with the intentions of the main characters at all and therefore strongly disliked the story..."
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,You should do what makes you happy my friend.
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-30,I don't know anyone in real life who didn't like it. Only people on the Internet seem to think it's not a good game.
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,Also - if you play it on higher difficulties the enemy ai is straight up unmatched anywhere and the combat is just as demanding as the game makes it look
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,"I don’t think the 2nd part applies. The gameplay is an improvement over the first in many ways so even if the story doesn’t sit as well for someone, it’s still a fantastic game to play."
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,Lmao.....
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,"This is very accurate, too many people from the tlou2 sub don’t seem to understand that nobody in this game is supposed to be good/bad, they played Joel an the first game, therefore he is the hero/good guy, and anybody that opposes him should be met with disgust regardless of their very justifiable actions, in that world especially"
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,Lmao. “Good guys sometimes bad” rocked your universe xD
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-26,"This is hilarious, since the whole story is just ""revenge bad."" There's nothing challenging or complex about it.

The ending to the first one alone had more depth."
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,"the actual game mechanics, the combat, the world building, the voice acting, the graphics are all excellent. The story however will be subjective. I personally hated it and found that it ruined the first game for me. All the characters you've grown to care about in the first game are gone, or traumatized, damaged hollow shells of their former selves by the end. It's all very dire. I played the first game a few times to 100% it, but I only played the second one once and never felt the pull to return to it again. I was very disappointed overall. You might love it as many people seem to."
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,Because sequels are always so great…
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-26,">the second most awarded video game of all time

cap"
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-26,Or they're aware of how much the 2nd shat all over the story of the first.
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,lol! I hope you find happiness 🫶

18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-26,Better than the first in ever way

18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,Autobanned is more than a bit harsh.

18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,"I mean, you’re not wrong..but they all have their reasons for being desperate and miserable, Iv seen people criticise the writers because Ellie is too different from the first game? Like what 🤨 were you expecting her to be pulling out the joke book given what happens on the last few hours of the first game and the entirety of this one?"
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,What did you expect to happen? Trauma happens haha
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,"The second game went very ""diverse"", which by itself isn't bad, but in contrast to the first is very weird and unnecessary. It was definitely an artistic choice, since the show also took the same diverted route for season 1.

As for the second game, I for sure was disappointed in what was given to us like you said regarding the characters we knew. There were also a lot of very dumb choices made by characters in general, especially compared to Part 1.

That being said, I did enjoy the overall story, the themes, and experiences they created. If anything though, to me Part 1 ruined Part 2 and not the other way around."
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,TLOU2 is fucking incredible
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,"Part 1 is my favorite story across any medium. Part 2 doesn't even come close in terms of art storytelling, BUT imo it's still worth playing assuming you haven't read any spoilers.

If you get halfway through and hate it, so be it. But if you make it through, even if it isn't a masterpiece, I do think it has to be experienced."
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-26,"It was a weird turn. Still a great game, and we can all ultimately form our own opinions on the characters. Shame how they changed Ellie mind, Joel he died as he lived, Ellie became hard to like... difficult to connect the two characters."
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-26,Eat shit and die. Also merry Christmas.
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,Then they are not reviews.
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,"Just a dumb troll, huh?"

18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,not much of one
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,I got downvoted for this? Were they not? Or are those salty fuckboys from tlou2 Reddit here already?
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-26,"Unmatched as in hyper-realistic. The stealth isn’t game-y, the enemies will see you if you don’t hide properly and they go for your head when they try to shoot you. They flank very aggressively, too.

There are whole videos on YouTube explaining exactly how it works but there’s none of that knowing where the player is by magic."
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,Absolutely not
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,"I actually thought they were joking, i can never tell as the game is average at best and always oversold and valiantly defended by the rabid fanbase."
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,"Of course, my point is, everybody is doing what they can to survive or keep their loved ones safe, even if that means killing anybody in your way"
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-26,"Agreed, was just an example..nobody here is a hero/villain"
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,Elitism lol.
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-26,TLOU2 is fucking dogshit
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2024-01-09,"I'm sure the gameplay is great, but the story? Nah."
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,"I’d probably say it’s split even, 60-40 at most"
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2024-01-09,Sounds pretty par for the course to be honest. FEAR had the exact same gameplay.
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-26,Can you give an example of a game you consider “above average” and a game you consider “below average” so that the OP (and others) can get a sense of your tastes?  Everyone rates games subjectively so this is always good information to offer when giving an opinion you know is going to get a strong reaction.
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,Define average
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,That's applicable to Joel too. Joel fans out there don't forget that he also had/was forced to do terrible (terrible) things to survive.
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-26,Your post history is almost entirely octopath traveller and world of warships you absolute fucking shit-head

18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,"Even if that were true, which it definitely isn’t, 30 percent is still way more more than barely ever considering it’s a 20 hour story is it?"
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-26,"Thanks.  It’s understandable that you would place TLOU2 with Tomb Raider and Uncharted narratively, especially considering that Uncharted is stylistically inspired by the older Tomb Raiders, and cyclically, the new Tomb Raiders are styled on Uncharted’s skeleton.  Naughty Dog definitely has a way of presenting narrative that can get frustrating and tiresome after a while.  Personally I enjoyed TLOU2’s story despite the fact that I think it could have been delivered a lot better."
18qmz75,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,"That's assuming constant fighting, but a lot of this game is just walking simulator, where the characters just talk with no interference."

3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"I worked in disputes for a major credit card company for several years. I spent some time working on cases that got stuck between disputes and fraud that got F'd up every which way possible, by every person that touched the case in the credit card company. God, reading your case is going to give me nightmares, because it seemed like about one out of every four cases that got stuck between disputes and fraud was from a Sony Playstation account. 

Just to kind of explain the situation (believe me, when I worked for the credit card company, I wanted to pull my hair out just as much as you do, every time I came across a case like this), there is a difference between a fraudulent charge, and a disputed charge. Not even a lot of people at the credit card company know the difference (yes, I know, frustrating). As a rule of thumb, a fraudulent charge is one in which the person who made the charge, is someone who was not authorized to use the card. A disputed charge is one in which the charge was made by the cardholder, or someone the cardholder authorized to use the card, but the goods or services were either not delivered, or delivered in a manner not consistent with the terms agreed upon, at the time of purchase. 

Now, what has happened to you, is fraud. Someone that you did not authorize to use your card, accessed your card info (even though they didn't directly access your info, they went through a third party account which contained your card info, and used it to make unauthorized purchases). The fraud department at your credit card company should have handled this from the beginning, filed a lost stolen report, issued you a new credit card and covered your fraudulent charges, easy peasy. 

What actually happened, is that Sony, for reasons I will never fully comprehend, convinced you, the cardholder, who should NEVER have to learn all of the convoluted language involved in credit card disputes and fraud, to file a chargeback, meaning they wanted you to file a dispute. Now, by filing a dispute, what you're essentially saying is that the charge was valid, just that the services delivered were not what you expected. Sony is a huge company, so they have a dedicated chargeback department, that only responds to chargebacks. Without going into all the criteria, once the company receives the chargeback, they have to respond to the credit card company, proving that services were delivered and that they were delivered correctly. Well, when you filed a chargeback against Sony, they only had to prove that services were delivered, to win the dispute. The fact that they were fraudulent charges doesn't even enter into the equation, because it's a disputed charge, which inherently means that the charge was valid. 

Now, as far as getting your money back is concerned, your best bet would be to deal with the bank only, and convince them to get you to a fraud specialist (use my line from earlier about the person accessing your credit card info indirectly), so they can file a lost stolen report and get your charges covered. Now, if you're not worried about accessing your Sony account in the future, you will be done, but things get tricky, because Sony will ban accounts that have been charged back, and I know that a lot of people have games and such on there that they paid for. As far as regaining access to your Sony account, you'll have to deal with Sony, and I don't have any advice for doing that. "

The lesson I took away from this is to use an actual credit card here on out. I pay it off every month, so there's no interest. If there's fraud, it's a LOT easier to tell the bank ""Nope, I'm not paying that"" than it is to ask them ""Pleeeeeease give me my money back.""

I went through a similar case of debit card fraud when my number was stolen and my checking account drained.  I had to file chargebacks against all of the spending and luckily no one dicked me around on it.

My bank gave me this bit of advice - never use your debit card online, use a credit card.  The reason is that with debit, the fraudulent charges have already cleared and actual money was lost.  With credit, you can dispute the charges and not be out of that money.  

For what it's worth, I've decided to stick to the prepaid PSN cards. "
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-17,"This is why, if you can, get an American Express. If I issue a charge back request it's handled in 2-3 days and they don't ask questions if it's under 30k."

I've been the victim of corporate bullshit like this before. (Hey Sprint and Best Buy, I'm talking to you, you unethical, greedy pricks!) I'm hoping you get Sony as much negative rep as you can.

Remember, they were going to screw you out of that money until you made a huge stink about this and had you not stood up, you'd  never have gotten that refund. Don't be blinded by the false act of understanding they're giving you. It's not because they care, it's because you actually have them worried and their name is being tarnished."
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"The blatant problem here and with just about every ""cloud based"" gaming service, is the fact that they can and will ban your account the second you, the consumer, asks for a charge-back with your credit company. Guilty until proven innocent, the consumer is ALWAYS wrong. 

Putting my **TL;DR** here to save the majority from the following wall of text: Consumers really need more rights and protections when it comes to games and files in general saved on outside servers or on the cloud. There is no reason a consumer should have to fear losing their entire library when they've been wronged by the company or their accounts have been compromised. No one should have to worry about losing sometimes thousands of dollars in digital content because of a legitimate charge-back, sometimes as small as single dollar.

----

That said, if you want to read my story, here it is:

----

I was once very involved in a certain gaming community (I will never mention their name again because I refuse to ever give them any kind of attention again, positive or negative). I had literally spent $1000 in purchases for this game in less than a year just because A) at the time, I believed in the devs and thought I was helping the community and game that I enjoyed so much at the time and B) they weren't ""pay to win"" purchases but more along the lines of things like skins and extra storage space. 

However one day, I bought a ""key"" that unlocked a specific area of the game (actually, a common area, unless you want to play it alone and give yourself a slightly better chance at better loot) for **$1** and my connection timed out as I was waiting for that dungeon to load.

I proceeded to go through support and calmly ask for a replacement key, or at least my single dollar bill be refunded to me. Nope! I explained how I had been a loyal customer for 2 years and had spent over a thousand dollars on that game alone in the past year. Their response? They accuse me of trying to scam them out of a single dollar, after I had spent literally over $1k in the game in *less than a year*. So I did charge-back and of course, next thing I know, I'm banned from my account. By this point, I was so in shock and disgusted by the chain of events that had led to this point, I chalked it up as a lose and honestly, I'd have probably never played the game again anyways out of principle alone.

***NEVER EVER EVER PUT YOUR CREDIT CARD INFORMATION INTO YOUR PLAYSTATION. ***"
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"This will be buried, but I'll say my piece because I had some success.
I purchased a Vaio laptop to the tune of around $1150, including the extended warranty etc.
Around 2 months in, the case began to unglue, only unsightly, not a mechanical malfunction or anything (relavent). About 6 months later, an entire 2 columns of pixels died on the left side of the screen. I notified sony and brought the computer to an actual Sony store where I was told ""no problem, we will send the computer in and you'll have it back within 2 weeks.""
As the employee said, I received a call that their repair facility received it and estimated repair time of about 7 days. I was stoked regarding the expeditious service.
I waited for 2 weeks from the call without a word, then began calling about the repair status. Maybe they had to order extra parts, shipping took longer, sent it back to the store, etc. As a student, I was concerned.
Ultimately, after a week and a half, and probably 10-12 hours of phone-time, of working through Sony customer service, I found out that Sony never actually sent the claim to the warranty company (or the warranty company never responded... still don't know). Spent another week relaying the warranty info between the two departments.
I was contacted saying due to the glue loosening, it voided my entire warranty and it would cost extra to fix. I figured why not, I just needed my computer. I was told I would receive a call within 48 hours to explain and charge me if I decided to proceed, otherwise they would just send it back as-is. I never got a call, and the day I was supposed to be called, the computer arrived at my door via ups.
Upon opening the package, the computer was heavily damaged and parts of the case were cracked and there were plastic pieces in the UNDAMAGED and untampered ups box that were no longer attached (case entirely broken in places).
I called to file a claim and was told that since the computer was damaged when I sent it in for repairs, they couldn't complete the claim despite photos of before handing Sony the computer and after receiving it back.
After several more attempts, I called Sony USA corporate, office of the CEO. Spoke to his assistant and briefly explained the situation in about 30-45 seconds leaving out any interaction issues, using just facts. I received a call back from another executive, I believe it was the customer service exec, and gave him the same 30-45 second summary.
Was refunded the full price of the computer and was given an additional Sony gift card as a good - will gesture.

Tl;Dr
Call Sony usa corporate, office of the ceo and calmly (and without thereats etc) explain the facts in a 30-45 second elevator pitch. Answer any questions they have, provide any relavent info (leaving out any emotional issues or encounters with Sony staff). Leave contact information with them!

3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"You know, I agree with the lawyer's post.  If Sony is anything like Microsoft, you agree to the Terms of Service on purchasing an item.  Since you are not the person who purchased the items (its fraud) you could not have agreed to the Terms of Service in those cases and thus do not have to abide by the no arbitration clause and can sue."
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,Everyone should tweet Sony about this. I just sent a tweet to both @askplaystation and @sonysupportusa with the link to this thread.
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"Lesson learned I hope.  Go to your bank and report the transaction as fraudulent.   OP didn't not want to do this because he didn't want his Sony account to get changed.  This account was hacked, why wouldn't you want to resolve this?  The fraud charges to your card would have been credited to you and returned through the network.  Your card would also have been blocked and reissued with a new card number in order to prevent further unauthorized charges. 

The way this was handled by the back and forth with the bank caused the transaction to be returned as a non fraudulent charge back which the card holder has different rights to vs the charge back rights you have with fraud.  

Report fraud to your bank, always."
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"Why is the **billion-dollar** company so concerned about the $500.00? 

**What. the. fuck?**"
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"Based on your description, it sounds like you just filed a chargeback and they disputed the chargeback. All it takes for them to ""win"" that round is to say ""I want to dispute this chargeback."" I used to be a chargeback analyst and would have to file these disputes all day long. The coding that they spoke about is a chargeback reason code. Unauthorized charges gave different criteria than fraudulent charges. Either way, easy for the merchant to basically just say it was valid at this point.

The next stage is arbitration (without knowing what brand of card it is, this isn't absolutely true). Your bank can send a rebuttal back saying that they still dispute the charge. This causes the merchant to be notified and send their rebuttal. Then a arbitrator from the card company (Think Visa/Mastercard) makes a decision on the case. Visa has always been a little more card holder friendly so hopefully your card is with them.

Anyway, good luck.

3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"Credit Card Fraud Analyst here; and I've submitted chargebacks against Sony/PSN on behalf of customers all the time. I work for and Australian bank so usually against the Aussie branch of PSN, so not sure if US PSN process differently, but Visa Scheme rules for this type of transaction are pretty standard across the different Visa regions. 
I think you issue here is with the bank filing your chargeback incorrectly. Recurring/subscription type transactions always have chargeback rights. If filed as unauthorised; the merchant has to provide documentation or compelling evidence that indicates you participated in the transaction. This means a signature on a contract/invoice etc. If Sony's re presentment (reply to chargeback) doesn't include a signed document your bank can still press for pre-arbitration as they can indicate the rep-docs do not satisfy the chargeback requirements. 
If your bank did file the wrong reason code and lost the disputed because of that there is no second chance with visa. I'd file a formal complaint with your bank regarding the handling of your chargeback. 
I honestly would say with 99% confidence I would have recovered your fund were you a cardholder with my bank. Someone at your bank messed up. 
TL;DR: issue is with the bank; they messed up your chargeback. "

3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"Apparently if you issue a chargeback successfully over a certain sum, they close your account with no recourse. Meaning you've lost everything you've ever bought. So if you do in fact get hacked and someone buys $500 worth of stuff without your consent, you can either get the money back or keep your account.

In other words, Sony is a piece of shit."

I contacted Sony and luckily they refunded me but what rubbed me the wrong way was that they worded as they are doing this as a one time courtesy

No when I have unauthorized charges from you..it's not a one time courtesy..it's your duty to investigate and return my money.

3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"wow probably one of the most detailed posts i'v ever seen, Sony you fucked up big to make someone go this far out of there way."
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"A couple of things:

1) Filing a chargeback is not as serious as accusing the merchant of fraud.  It means you are disputing the charge.  Mistake happen all the time, as does fraud, but it's nothing personal against the merchant.  Filing a chargeback is not a big deal, and that's why I use American Express for most of my purchases, because they are very consumer friendly.

2) You got a chargeback and then the chargeback got reversed.  Don't create a new dispute, contact the credit card company about that dispute, and have the reverse the reversed chargeback.  Companies have no way to fight a chargeback that has been applied twice in a row.

In general, whenever you have a dispute with a merchant, give them a couple of weeks to fix the situation, and if nothing happens then just dispute it with the cc company.  That's usually the best way to handle the situation.

Also:

3) NEVER EVER EVER use your debit cards for online purchases.  NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER.

First off, if your number gets stolen, the money is being drained directly from your bank account.  NEVER EVER EVER use your debit card ever EVER.  Second, you are saving the merchant a ton of money because the most they would ever get charged is 0.22 for a debt card transaction, but regular charges would be ~2%.  They should be passing those savings onto you but they're not, so you're being screwed.  NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER use your debit card online."
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"Hey man. First off, I am very sorry to hear this happened to you. You stated that you had a debit card linked to your PSN account, which the transaction was run on. I don't mean to criticize you (simply educate), but there's a well-known principal by persons of financial background that one should NEVER use anything other than a credit card online. 

Reason being, the laws that define and regulate credit cards are actually a lot more consumer-friendly than other financial instruments (including debit cards). Credit card companies understand these rules and these are all built into their cost of doing business. Credit card companies understand that, if a customer claims fraud, they will immediately be refunding the charge, then investigating the claim for legitimacy. It is then on THEM to prove that you were lying, if they suspect such.

Debit cards do not have these attributes by default. Though some companies choose to voluntarily extend extra protections to debit card holders, it is not required by law. In general, you are better off just using credit cards to begin with. If a fraudulent charge is made on your credit card, even while waiting for action to be taken, you are not out $500 from your bank account. That is a different story with a debit card."
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"It's sad that this is what it takes to get treated fairly by Sony...and [after Sony installed malware on its customers' computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_BMG_copy_protection_rootkit_scandal), well, I don't think I'll be buying any Sony products ever again.

As soon as it becomes obvious that the front-line person doesn't know/can't understand/isn't empowered to deal with your issue (i.e. your issue isn't on their script), ask who you can talk to that is able to help you.

They can't issue a refund because an account is banned?  BS!  Maybe the front-line guys don't have the tools and/or authority to do so, but someone can, and they are the ones that you need to talk to.  They can't re-enable an account without access to the email address?  Escalate!

I ended up canceling my card, getting a new card, and fighting with Sony until i gave up, because i couldn't fight with them anymore.

Things like this need to stop, but it's never going to stop. People will continue to pay and use these services, despite the shitty treatment because 7 times out of 10 is still better than nothing.
personally, i stopped using any online interactions, only used prepaid debit cards or psn cards, never my real bank information. It seems paranoid to some, but they don't understand it until their taking the hit and being told to just accept it.

Your bank will absolutely try to screw you, because their only other option is to go to the bank that controls the merchant side and try to get the money from them.  If that fails then they're left in the cold without the money, so they hassle the customer to try to get out of it.  

Screw that, push harder on it, tell them you want to re-issue the chargeback and provide additional information.  Sony will have to fight it again and provide more info to do so, if they can't you win.

If for whatever reason you lose again, then you have to go to arbitration which is handled by the card association (Visa or MC or Amex) and there's a fee paid by the losing party, which would be higher than the few hundred dollars you're still due.  At that point might be easier to just eat it and shit all over Sony online (which is already done)."

I didn't read all your TLDR, because it was still to long for me: but, my advise is to cut SONY out of it all together, let your debit card holder take it up with them.

Go to your bank and get a debit card dispute form from them and fill it out. Whether your debit card is with Visa or Mastercard, they'll either get your money back or give you the money."

I explained the reason I had them was because I played it before the transaction etc. It wasn't downloaded to my ps4 and there aren't even any other ps4s connected to my account (checked).

I message Sony and tell them because I half didn't want to be responsible for what could happen and half just felt bad seeing this person buying DLC and being locked out.

Sony told me that they would look into it and in the meantime lock the account. I could still log into it for a while until one day the account was just banned. I don't know what happened to the owner or how it ever got attached to my email but it was gone for that owner. "

3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"Here are some tips for dealing with customer service in the future.  


**1.** Be calm, patient, and polite. 


*(Customer support reps are in a call center getting yelled at all day for things that are not their fault, so most will go out of their way to help if you're nice.)*


**2. Come prepared.** It lets them know that you mean business.


* Have something to write with/on. 


* Have your account number, and any other relevant identifying information readily available.


* Know what you want and how to effectively communicate it.


* Write your story on a sheet of paper to reference, including lists and dates. It's easy to forget things. 


* Make your claims quantifiable. You'll need numbers and dates, among other things.


**3.** If the person you're speaking with doesn't seem to know how to help you, or has reached the limit of what they are able to do for you, ask to speak with the appropriate department or their supervisor,  and *thank them* for their help and their time.



**4.** If you find yourself moving up the chain of command, expect longer waiting times and an increased need for professionalism on your end.


As your case is further escalated, the reps you speak with will have more power, be more knowledgeable, and be much better at getting you off the phone.


**5.** If you receive exceptional service, be sure to let their supervisor know. It will make their day and help to set the standard.

3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"PM'ing you now, used to work for Sony Playstation Tech support.

*edit*

**To anyone calling Sony Playstation Tech support**

If you don't get the answer you want from a tier 1 agent, or if you have a situation such as this come up, REQUEST TIER 2.   Now I don't mean if you don't have the receipt for your playstation and it's broken, or your cat pissed in it, or it's infested with bugs (those all get sent back in plastic bags cause you're nasty fucks), but if you're say within 30 days of you're warranty being out.  Or something else.  Or say you got you're playstation serviced and now it's fucked up again 2 months later (90 day warranty on refurbs or till the end of you're originals warranty whichever is longer.) tier 2 gives out free games for certain hardships.  Put up enough stink and tier 2 gives out free shit (games mostly), tier 3 can give out better stuff but you have got to have a decent problem that wasn't handled properly.

Also the ""one time gesture of free will"" makes me think it's the same company handling Sony's PS TS or, it's the same tier 3 agents.  Yes there is a tier 3 and they are actually sony based out of San Fran(these people actually have consoles at their desks.)

I'm in the second call now, **DO NOT REQUEST A BAN FROM A TIER ONE AGENT FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS** THEY ARE COMPLETE FUCKING MORONS.  


Source - Tier 2 agent(the supervisors for all of the calls I've heard so far, I'm on the second call and he's still at tier 1) for sony playstation tech support for 3 years a while back.  /r/pcmasterrace for life but fuck you guys getting screwed like this.

*Dbl edit* ugh fuck man, listening to this is so hard for me.  I'd have taken the call from the tier 1 agent and handled you myself or sent you to tier 3 if I couldn't.  I feel for you.

*triple edit*, notice how when calls get close the the 7:30 mark (plus hold times OP has allowed us not to endure how short and sweet the answers get).  Tier 1 agents are literally useless besides ""hey i can't setup my wifi"".  

I just looked it up on glassdoor, it's the same company handling tech support as when I worked there.  

http://vocaroo.com/i/s0UsQupzldas  - @~6:50 ""is there someone with the authority to override this that I could talk to?""  The tier 1 agent could get fired for not xferring him to tier 2 at this point.  Simple as that.  WHEN ASKED TIER 1 AGENTS ARE ASKED THIS YOU SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO TIER 2.  Shit like this pisses me off, tier 1 agents are idiots. Period, you'll find good ones of course now and then of course.  At this point man, call back and get to tier 3.  Tell tier one and tier 2 you don't even wan't to speak to them at this point.  It's the same company handling TS as when I worked there.  Get to tier 3, and if they don't want to give you the right answer get to the VP of customer relations (many a case I've handled has gotten to this point, but then again I tried to help people 9 times out of ten.)  Tier 3 would probably give you their email, link them to this post.

OP has zero temper issues in comparison to some of the calls I've gotten.

**Tier 1/2 tech support for sony playstation isn't based out of San Fran so two party consent laws don't apply.  HOWEVER since the tech support line themselves tells you ""Calls may or may not be recorded"" they are already consenting.  The company I'll list below doesn't record every call, just some of them.**

**Quad/Quintuple Edit**

This is who handles calls for Sony Playstation Tiers 1/2.  Tier 3 is based out of San Fran.

http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Sitel-Las-Vegas-Reviews-EI_IE11480.0,5_IL.6,15_IM477.htm

1st review on glassdoor is a coach.   They handle either a team of tier 1 agents or the single team of tier 2 agents( one team of tier 2 vs 8-12 teams of tier 1).  Tier 1 agents will either talk to their coach or call tier 2 when they put you on any sort of hold.  Either that or they don't actually know what they are talking about.  If you're on hold for more than 2-4 minutes they are calling tier 2.  Anything less is usually a coach helping out with new agents.  To the OP you're a fucking cool cucumber man.  If you'd have gotten pissed earlier you'd have gotten to tier 2.  As a USN vet I salute you sir.

**sextuplet edit**  Make sure OP sees this guys and looks at his inbox from me.  I've listened to every vocaroo and he never made it past **TIER FUCKING 1**.  He needs to tell tier 1/2 to fuck off and ask for tier 3 in no uncertain terms at this point.  

**Septuple Edit** Op has pm'ed me.  I'll assist him in anyway way possible.  "

Made my blood boil more and more as I continued to read.

My PSN account got hacked a couple of years ago, luckily the credit card I had registered to my account at the time was frozen and could not be used to purchase anything (per my request as I had been slightly irresponsible with it a few years prior and needed to stop the cycle). 

I called Sony, a couple of times, to tell them my account had been hacked and they managed to change my password (got an email notification that it had been changed, and confirmed it when I tried to sign on from my PS3.

The upside, once the wheels started turning, it was a swift process and I got my account back.

The downside, and because I didn't have the patience to argue about it, was they threatened to permanently ban my account/email address/IP address if there ever another breach. I was also just in pure shock that they blamed me for their security breach. The sheer audacity left me speechless."
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"Had the exact same thing happen to me, almost to the tee. Someone got ahold of my account, spent around $300, and Sony told me the exact same thing. Even banned the account.

However, I posted about it on Reddit, and was pretty much told to fuck off by everyone that commented. Good to see you got some advice though. 

I ended up selling off everything tied to Sony. Lost over a grand in games and DLC. "
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"This is going to get buried since I'm so late to this post, but I really hope you read this. I supervise a chargeback processing department at a banking software company. We process chargebacks for credit unions around the country. If your financial institution is going to hold you responsible for this, you need to escalate the issue with them and force them to refund you. If they won't do that you should take your business somewhere else. This is clearly fraud and your bank/CU chose the wrong reason code to dispute this. I'm assuming your credit card is either a Visa or MasterCard. If that is the case, you are ALWAYS covered for any fraud on your card, as long as it's a Visa or MC. Doesn't matter if you lose the dispute, your bank/CU is responsible for the loss, not you. I can't speak for AmEx or Discover as we don't support those card brands. I would not expect that the second dispute is going to be successful. You really only get one shot to get it right. If Sony wants to, they can deny the 2nd simply because the wrong code was used the first time.

One of two things happen.  The account was banned when they should not have, which screwed you with the policy of a refund,  Or the other guy had no clue and somebody was feeding bs via hold and mute to get you off the phone.  Either way this is screwed up.

Source: Laid off when they took my job to El Salvador.

EDIT: If you want this resolved quickly, call again and ask to speak to a Tier 2 representative.  Once you get on the line with them, ask to speak to a Tier 3 representative.  The Tier 3 support is still here in the US and they're a good group of people.  They should be able to resolve this for you once and for all as I've seen them do it multiple times in the past."
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"This is a pain and I get that, however there is a lesson here. Assuming this leak was NOT from Sony's end then you unknowingly allowed your account to be compromised. I would not blame Sony so much and think about what really happened here. Did you have a weak password? Did you log into your psn account on an untrusted network, etc.. (the list goes on and on). You can't say your account was ""hacked"", how do you know it was hacked? If there was yet another breach on Sony's end, I think we should have heard about it but maybe that is coming in the next few days. 

Lets say for a minute, you did unknowingly allow your account to be compromised. Is that really on Sony or on you? How I look at it, if your account was comprised by your own actions then why would Sony need to cover the 500 bucks? That is like saying, I left my five 100 dollar bills under a rock next to the river and someone took it, this is not my fault. 

That all said, I do think Sony should refund your money in principal due to the fraud that took place as it costs them almost nothing to return ""digital"" content.  I'm on your side sir, but I think you could have avoided quite a headache by being more aware of your login account security. 

One more thing to note, if this beach was on Sony's end then all above is null and void. "
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"Now I no nothing about law, except some cases of bird law. I understand your frustration, and wanting to get your money back. But looking at it from Sony's stand point how are they to know that you didn't make a purchase then try to get a refund?

Did you file a police report and present this as evidence? I know a charge back maybe simple but you were a victim of fraud. Going through the appropriate channels may help you more.

Now I think I have made myself redundant so I will stop here."

second, never buy anything from sony, ever. I bought a camera from sony that ended up being defective, and it took them six months to fix it under warranty, after they kept it in an oubliette in texas for around 4 months, employees never having any clue about the camera itself. Had to send it back twice, since they actually broke it further the first time. . this convinced me that no amount of quality or discounts or promises would ever be worth what sony will do to you whenever something goes wrong.

3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-17,"Years ago I got an email from Microsoft support saying my Xbox live account was now converted to Russian (I'm American) and that my attached card had just been charged $180 worth of Xbox points. I called my bank to dispute the charges and was told it was Microsoft's problem and to call them. I called Microsoft to inform them I was not Russian nor had I moved to Russia and they told me too bad, it was my bank's problem and all they could do was suspend the Xbox live account. After getting no further help and no refund I canceled both the bank and Live accounts and haven't looked back since.

The most annoying part was Microsoft trying to convince me I must have been a victim of phising, awkwardly try to explain what phishing was to me, and basically call me a liar when I assured them nothing of that sort had happened."

If you say you will do something, you have to follow through, period. I work in customer service and if I told a customer I was giving them a refund, I would die of embarrassment if I had to go back to them and tell them oops, no refund for you. They would get the refund no matter how less they deserve it (and of course, OP actually does deserve it). I don't know how this has gone on for so long when OP has written proof in the form of an email that he is going to get a full refund. I really hope this story goes even more viral.

3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"This is why I hate automatic billing. You should have to enter the three digit number on the back of your credit card or debit card for each purchase to verify that it is you making payments and not your child or a hacker who stole your account.

My son once bought $500 worth of stuff on an iPod while we were on vacation and he was with his Uncle and he had the account password. Apple would not refund the money as he bought songs, movies, and in-game stuff. I had to change the password and not give it to him to prevent further charges. It is a fear that every parent has when they have an account their child knows the password to, that they will go on a spending spree.

This automatic payment is set up to rip people off so that their children or a hacker can get access to their account and buy stuff and they are still on the hook for it. Getting your money back is always being to be hard without involving a lawyer."

It took me several months for a refund only to be told they would do this once as a courtesy. Then the ""refund"" only showed up as credit on my PSN account.  I eventually got the money back on my card by saying they deceived me as I had an email saying it would be on the credit card.  "

That's probably the only way Sony will take notice and maybe fix their broken customer interaction model. You can also spam their other social media pages if you want, I guess.

People are bashing BoFA for being difficult here, but it is pretty industry standard to operate this way. They're in the business of banking, not providing competitive fraud claim management and resolution.

Always swipe a credit card, always use a credit card online. Credit card companies make substantial efforts to detect fraud trends, stop fraud before it occurs, and reimburse you for fraudulent charges.

Full Story:

I used to live in the states for a time (from when I was 16 till about 19) and moved back to NZ. I had my PS3 with me and an American PSN. Because I had already bought games online and I am a trophy whore, I kept my account but had to set up an NZ account to buy games and dlc with my NZ card. Buying digital codes on Amazon proved to be slightly more expensive as my bank charges exchange fees when purchasing things in a different currency.

PSN ended up banning me for account sharing though I provided proof that I owned both accounts and was only using my NZ account to purchase DLC.

Prior to setting up a secondary account I actually called them and asked if they could transfer my US account to an NZ account, they told me flat out that it wasn't ""physically possibly""."

To be honest, I never associated with Sony's customer service until I got a Vita last year. It was my first Sony product since the PS One, and it was a pretty miserable reintroduction. It's gotten to the point that I am wary of buying any more of their products. They gave me all sorts of trouble that Msoft and Nintendo never did, and their customer service agents will tell you anything to get off the phone. I always chat in to their CS online so that I always have a written copy of the bullshit they say."

3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"I work in the fraud department of a very large corporation. If you think the system is messed up you're absolutely right. In many cases when a chargeback is filed, big corporations have an automatic representation trigger. Supposedly, they should be reviewed by Paymentech or whatever arbitration mechanism they have in place. But in many cases they're just also auto resolved in favor of the merchant. Talk to your bank, there are usually ways to refile the chargeback and those are usually automatically won by the customer. "
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,Next time just contact your credit card co they won't dick you around like vendors do
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"As an avid user of awesome Sony mirrorless cameras, I know very well of Sony's horrible customer service. It's why I have an Xbox. Between that and my surface pro, Microsoft seems to have really improved the last few years."
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"I see people make the same mistake too often in these situation. Here's the thing, whenever your bank account, debit card, or credit card are charged with unauthorized charges, the first thing you do is call or walk into your bank and notify them of said fraudulent charges. The bank will take immediate actions and suspend all activities on your account until new account or card can be issued and will return all the funds immediately. 

DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME CALLING OR COMPLAINING TO THE VENDOR (I.E. SONY PSN) WHO CHARGED YOUR ACCOUNT. 

That is the single biggest mistake you can make and time is very precious in such matters so talk to your bank or credit card company first and let them sort out everything. They have an legal obligation to protect your identity and money.

I've had numerous transactions charged back immediately without wasting my time pursuing the vendor, everything from Starbucks charging my twice for the same coffee to Amazon charging my account for Prime without my permission. In each and every case, I checked my bank account every day and as soon a transaction is flagged as not mine or not authorized, I exclusively deal with my bank and no one else to resolve the charges.

3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"This is why I don't save my ""payment profiles.""

Convenience? Are you seriously that lazy that you can't pull your wallet out for a whole 5 seconds to put your info in?

You do it a lot? Should have that shit memorized by now.

Be pro-active. OP even said he knows Sony has a history of getting hacked for fuck's sake."
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"While waiting for updates, I recommend repeatedly watching the following:

3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"good guy microsoft should offer him a free console! that's just good publicity.
"
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"So I work disputes at a major bank, first of all debit card disputes are super hard to win just due to the type of account it is. Also, Sony most likely won because they committed no billing error from what I gathered from your description. They most likely proved that they provided the services that were charged. If they had a breach than you should have changed account numbers. Target went HAM with their breach and pretty much took crazy steps. It also depends whether you have a Visa or MasterCard since both have different stipulations as to processing unrecognized chargebacks. 

On a side note, a chargeback isn't just for a fraudulent charge, its when your bank files a billing error with the merchants bank, it does give the merchant the opportunity to reply, based on what reason code your dispute agent used will determine how Sony responds, if its something they can easily prove than they win. 

My suggestion would be to gather any additional information that would only support your case and send it to your bank. Follow through with their re-dispute process and time frames. A hail mary attempt would be to find the highest person in their company on linkedin and email them directly, they usually handle things pretty well. If not than you will have to work with Sony directly.  If I knew specifics I might be able to give better info. Good luck man!"
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,Thanks for postng this. You may have saved me from being hacked in the future.

3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,Thank you for solidifying my decision to never buy any Sony products again! I was a devout customer for years but I can't look past their customer service snafus lately. PC gaming it is! 
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"The ironic thing is at my small business, when a customer charges back I lose basically every time, despite appealing with solid proof that the customer was committing fraud or being a cheapskate. Shows you how large corps can flex their muscles to the credit card companies."
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,Every time I've had an issue with Playstations I've never received a refund. Xbox have refunded me every single time. MS have great customer support and PS don't give no fucks.
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,my microsoft live account got hacked and they bought sims 4 and a few expacks plus a couple other. one phone call to them got me my money back and got to keep the games because they are linked to your account forever. i thought that was a pretty good deal.

It still baffles me, the process they claim they would have to go through in orer to unban the account. You'd think it'd be as simple as flipping a switch. ""This account is restricted, this account is unrestricted"". Bureaucratic nonsense."
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,What did they buy with the $500?
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"After following /u/JustRice's instructions, you should go to the BBB and the CFPB (= government organization, Sony is required to respond). Sorry to hear OP."

Got the money back after a few phone calls, but didn't get access to my account again for nearly a year. Claimed some legal crap about transferring accounts across international borders (THEN HOW THE FUCK WAS IT SO EASY FOR THEM TO DO IT THE FIRST TIME!?).  Wasn't a fun experience."

3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,I don't get how this happens. I've had my credit card info compromised a few times and someone always calls me before I even know it happens and it always gets taken care of right away.
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,I have a friend that runs quite a large gaming website in Australia called Stevivor. I'll send this to him and hope that covers down-under!
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"Had the same thing happen with Xbox live.  Got Arkham free with a graphics card but Xbox live was merged with Microsoft live or something like that and I had to reactive my xbox account--hadn't had one for like 4 years and it red ringed.

Next day bunch of Xbox live purchases (my card was to expire in one month too!). Disputed along with all that info, got a hopeful response then no told to dispute with my bank. 

They provided documents proving it was my account and gasp, I had logged in recently and was denied.  Followed up, denied again.  Thankfully it wasn't as much money as yours."
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"I'm surprised the representative doesn't have to inform you that you wont get your refund if you close the sub-account.  That seemed really shady.

Also, it doesn't make sense to me that anyone can request an account be banned(say, a sub-account that was made without the master account permission), but the imposing person with access to that email can unban his account and go back to doing what he was doing...

I wish you the best of luck, OP."
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,Op has tons of information stating they would refund the money. It aooears there was even recorded audio verifuing the chat transcript. Refile the claim and provide the bank with all that evidence proving that they agreed to refund. Hard for them to dispute it then.
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,they fucked with the wrong person lol
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,I like how this post just 5 minutes ago was at the top of my reddit front page. I refresh and now it is nowhere to be found. What is up with that?
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"I haven't done my thesis of my PhD in this much detail. Hope your issue gets sorted, OP."
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,Psn security and Psn support is a joke. I've had issues before and I basically don't keep any payment method on file. I'd never use a debit card as you're more likely to get your money back from a credit card company.
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,Just file a complaint with the better business bureau.  I've done it before when big companies have me stuck in their processes and won't make it right. They will most likely fix it and it shows them the hole in there processes.
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"Sorry about your situation .just to add some clarity to your concerns. I work in fraud and while your situation someone fraudulently used your psn acct to use your card they did not illegally obtain your card information.

This is a tricky situation due to the circumstances. It's wrong on sony's part either way but technically it's not fraud from your banks standpoint. They used your card to make purchases through Sony because your card information was already stored their. They didnt illegally obtain your card number and then used it which is what fraud technically is. It's a fine line trust me I know fraud and disputes departments work closely together at times due to how close it can be related to the opposing department.


If you have any questions I feel free to pm me,hope this gets fixed for you BS on Sony for how they are treating it. I remember seeing this topic a few months ago it's a shame"
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"Is this common on PSN? I'm currently looking to upgrade from my 360 to the PS4, but would choose to stay with Microsoft if this happens often, since I never had any issue with Xbox for the past 7 years."

They blamed my password and wernt going to refund me until I said I would charge back. Suddenly they had a one time grace. Traded in my ps4 shortly after that and will never even consider Sony again.

At this point, had he known it would have taken this much time, he might have just accepted the 500 dollar hit.
It's like my friend the other day was at Best Buy for 30 minutes trying to get 5＄ off some sale he was entitled to but the last had no idea what to do or what he was talking about. I told my friend, you make like 50 dollars an hour and you wasted 30 minutes on five dollars in savings. It sucks. There is a point where the time invested in fixing a problem isn't worth it.
I remember a guy onnreddit spend countless hours and letters and time writing his story on Reddit to get 500 dollars back from an ambulance charge taken away because he never used or called  for an ambulance. He probably spent 20 hours fixing the ploblem and MORE money on certified mail letters. "

3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"PSN support and Sony as a whole are completely unhelpful when it comes to fraudulent charges over a certain amount. I'm surprised you got over 200 bucks of it back, I was quoted at a 150 upper limit when my PSN account got hacked and I ended up getting over 300 dollars in charges. I ended up getting my money back after a chargeback dispute with my bank (with no counter dispute as in your case). I lost access to my account along with all of my digital content and the remaining 8 months of my year long PSN plus subscription. It's fucking ridiculous for a company with as shitty a track record for accounts and credit card info being compromised as Sony to have as back assward policies on fraudulent purchases as they do. It's absolute dog shit."

3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"I used to work in phone service. The thing is they always tend to give too little information to workers about how to work with specific ""nightmare"" situations as according to them they happen too little, so when it happens the ones higher up barely know either. I wouldnt blame the bad phone calls or screwed up workers as this happens due to bad education at these kind of places. I got a lawsuit threat for us by a guy who called himself ""an annoying customer"" that demanded I did something I couldnt do in any way as it was impossible cause someone else had messed up the entire case & left it like that without any messages for anyone else. I asked my working bosses but they just said theres nothing u can do. A week later my boss wants to talk to me about a lawsuit & says its not acceptable after this man apparently called him and said something that was probably blatantly false.

Really odd to toss a customer out with the bathwater so to speak, I could see if I had charged back without any communication or my account was consistently problematic, but nope. The one thing I will give microsoft I never had any problems when I had to call customer support for my 360 that included having a friend accidentally charge a 99$ live renewal fee, they just reverted it cancelled the renewal and I was on my way."

They closed access to my account for about a month while they investigated, then refunded the fradulent charges AND gave me a year of live for my trouble.

3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,This is a small claim. You can file in your local small claims court and odds are they will call you to settle before the court date. $500 is a pittance to them and it's not worth them hiring a local lawyer or flying theirs out to your courthouse over.
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"Your story the first time around scared me from ever buying anything online again from sony. I honestly plan on never buying another Sony product again. They were already walking a thin line with their bullshit when they put rootkits in their SOny music CDs. 

I will NEVER buy anything from Sony again because of your story. The fact these fuckwads don't encrypt credit info and left their shit for anyone to steal is horrifying. PS3 is where it ends for me. Sony is garbage and the only reason people tolerate them is for exclusivity of games... and as of late that too has been lacking."

I work for a smaller business, and we even have the leeway to assess each situation differently and handle it accordingly, so that our customers get the best possible result. No excuse for a company like Sony to not do the same, especially when it comes to a loyal customer that got duped out of $500, basically chump change to a company like them.

3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,I'm going to be blunt; don't do business with Sony. They aren't trustworthy at all.
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"I'm often amazed how hard huge corporations will fight for what is to them tiny amounts of money. 

$500 is NOTHING to Sony. Why do they risk bad press and loss of goodwill trying to hold onto it? Not to mention the money was used to buy products that cost FAR less than $500 to produce. I wouldn't be surprised if the actual amount Sony is out here is $0; these are virtual products after all!"
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"I've never been so focused in an online post before. I hope OP receives the proper attention to solve this unacceptable business practice. Heck, I wouldn't be surprised if the media gets involved in this."

3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"> There's no way Sony's robust security systems could have been breached, right?

Unless you were stupid enough to leave your password the same as before the hacks a while back, I seriously doubt this is Sony's fault. How complex was your password? Was it reused anywhere else?"

3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,Sorry to hear about this. I already told Sony/SOE to go jump in a lake on a cold winter morning back in 2007. Haven't given them a cent since. I hope you get your money back.
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"I was in the exact same boat, except I ""only"" got charged for one game, and then got back my account instantly due to getting an email on purchasing Mad Max.

I contacted them and got basically nowhere.
Issued a refund, and got a refund from my bank. It was dandy.

But got my account banned. I didn't want that.
I have games I have purchased. I contacted them, and they told me I had to buy the game again with PSN-cards to get the account back.

Really?.. Really?!

I caved. Bought PSN-cards to fill up my account to buy Mad Mad.
Bought it, got the account back.

Now I have Mad Max. Have still never played it, and most likely never will, because Sony never wanted to budge on the fact that I was charged for something that was not me.

Oh, did I mention that their 'Security Department' was going to check up on the charge, and then get back to me?
- They never did, and still haven't.

Yes, I gave up. You win, Sony. Fuck you."

I went threw a similar ordeal with Sony's support teams regarding their tvs. At one point, I had 4 55"" TVs in my house, all in the boxes, because they thought that would fix the problem. Long story short, it took almost 5 months to fix a simple problem that ended up requiring me getting a refund and purchasing a Samsung. 

Outside of my PS4, I will never purchase a Sony product again. They have the worst support teams I've ever seen. "

3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,Why the fuck would you store your credit card information on Sony's servers?
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"This comment is probably buried in this giant thread at this point, but you shouldn't have filed a chargeback.  You should have just called the bank, asked to speak with the fraud department, and they would have reversed the charges instantly.

The problem was you initiated the chargeback process, and that dings Sony's standing with their processor (plus costs them money).  It was obviously human error on your part by not knowing better, but you just got stuck in a bureaucratic process at Sony after that, hence the fighting of the charge and ultimate banning of your account."
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"Your problem is that you've got your priorities bass ackward: your first call was to Sony because you didn't want your account banned because of the chargeback. Let me help you out here: you can live without a fcking PSN account but it's kind of hard to get car loan, or a mortgage, or rent an apartment, or even get insurance or a job if your credit rating is destroyed by someone gaining access to your bank account or credit cards.

Your first call is ALWAYS to your bank or credit card company and you make that call as soon as the fraud is discovered.

3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"People are making Sony out to be this evil corporation, but really it's much more banal than that: it's just people being lazy, selfish pricks, as they are wont to do. 


*Of course* customer service is going to tell you they'll take care of it. They don't want to deal with you any more and will say anything to get you to go away. I know, it's their job to deal with you, but remember: they are most likely selfish, lazy pricks. 

*and of course* customer service will actually do nothing to resolve your complaint. Again, lazy humans will be lazy. Note that the person responsible for fixing your case is not the rep you spoke to initially. Also note that neither of them give a shit. 

*and of course* Sony disputed the chargeback. They dispute all chargebacks. Making an informed decision as to whether to dispute or not would require *work*. But the person responsible for this work is as you know by now, both lazy and selfish. And a prick. 

*and of course* your CC company sided with Sony. They're *Sony*. Who the fuck are you? Can you *imagine* the work involved with researching the case, and providing justification to your supervisor or even upper management why you went against a major international corporation? It would probably take *minutes*. Gross. 


So really, we should be outraged at the nature of humanity itself, and not Sony. Because Sony doesn't actually exist. "

With this being said, here's a word of advice for everyone:

**Never use a debit card for your purchases unless you really have to!**

Credit cards offer far more protection from fraudulent charges than debit cards. With a debit card, money is taken straight out of your account right away and don't offer as much protection."

Charging for online access when games already have it out of to box, banning indiscriminately for no reason (I've never been banned, but I've seen people get banned for zero reason, like my friend's kid).

I'm not saying they deserve it so I'm not being insensitive but it's just way too common. A lot of these companies have no 2FA or added it late in the game and people don't use 2FA even if it's implemented and there's always back doors. Just like Apple's iCloud there's always a place that doesn't check for password fails and block ips out for a period of time so there's always a way to brute force accounts. Even when you do get on the very fact that you have to link a creditcard without purchase verification is a threat.

It's just painfully obvious that Consoles are dead, and what's left are vultures."

Right before I ran out of the warranty, I just gave up and got it ""fixed"" one last time...which of course didn't last long.

"
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"Visa, MasterCard, and Amex all have procedures to appeal a denied chargeback.  Processing a representment (denying a chargeback) is pretty easy and most merchants represent just about everything as a matter of course.  Contact your bank and ask to speak to a supervisor in the claims division.  Tell them you want to challenge Sony's representment.  This process is usually called arbitration.  It will involve your bank and Sony's merchant bank meeting with someone from the card network (Visa, Mc, Amex) who makes a ruling on the case.  I can't see an arbitrator ruling against you.

The Sony support lady I spoke with could not have given less of a shit about my problem, and told me that their team would investigate and send me their findings in 3 to 6 months.

Couple months out I got fed up with waiting and just spent the $50 in my PSN wallet. I never heard a peep from Sony.

Correct. Not just for one account, they would have access to thousands if not ALL of them right? I mean in theory its possible, but then we'd be seeing 2010 all over again wouldn't we with every news outlet talking about it? Its an issue with **your** account specifically. Which leads me to....

> as I rarely actually use my PSN account

Problem here is that you rarely use it, meaning it was ripe for some lowlife scum across the globe to pick it up figuring you never using it would never notice it being used. Thankfully you did before any tremendous damage was done. This sucks man. Rooting for ya.

It will cost legal fee's if you wan't to go about it the legal route.

There is no dispute you can file with Sony that will result in you getting your money back, the bank needs to treat it as fraud, issue you a new card and cover your loss. As far as Sony, I seriously doubt the credit card company is ok with cancelling memberships for filing disputes, it is form of conflict resolution that must be agreed to to accept card payments. Maybe make shallow threats about contacting visa/MasterCard/ whoever, I suspect you may be protected from this behavior by their terms and conditions."

Just to add to this, generally with most credit cards you don't actually even have the option to request a chargeback. You have an option to dispute a charge, at which point you give a reason and fraud is the reason you would fill out."

Pro-tip to anyone else out there:  Even if this hasn't happened to you yet, don't think it can't.  Just take the time to cancel your card off the system and go with pre-loaded cards.  Plus you get the bonus of scratching off the backs of them like cool lotto-winnings!"
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-17,Another option is to just use a good credit card instead of a debit card.  I have never heard of any issues with chargebacks on a premium credit card.  When you use a debit card you are giving them direct access to your checking account.

I decided I wasn't going to wait for them to fix anything, so I called my card and told them someone had stolen my CC # and had access to it, the CC bank immediately returned all the funds that had been charged fraudulently and asked for as much information as I could provide to track the hacker down. Of course, I willingly gave them everything I had, because screw that guy. I never heard what happened to him/her but eventually my account was unbanned and I have access to it again now. =)"

3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,Id think an attorney would recommend contacting an attorney within the state that the complaint was made.
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-17,"I'm a bit confused, in his post he says that the chargeback was done incorrectly and should've been a case of fraud instead of unauthorized charges. It also says he is waiting to hear back from his bank again. This seems like a case that he has to deal with the bank and not Sony. If your CC gets stolen you don't take the places that money was spent at to court. Instead you work it out with the bank that has your CC.

So, why should he be dealing with Sony instead of his bank?

EDIT: Per /u/WigWubz personal experience:

>In my own very recent experience (my Amazon account got hacked two days ago and 1000 euro in gift cards sent to some unknown email address with a PO box in England) I was told by my bank that since I had legitimate business with Amazon in the past, I had technically authorised the company to withdraw funds from my bank account and therefore as the funds had been transferred from my account into theirs, it was all completely legal and there was nothing the bank could do short of a proper chargeback.

EDIT2: To the many talking about account bans due to chargebacks, I agree that this is bullshit and I don't know how/why it is legal. If /r/gaming wants to take that to court I fully endorse it because it seems like an unjustified banning and is a worrying trend for digital purchases that removes consumer protection. However, taking them to court over the fraudulent charges makes no sense at all. If your account is hacked, it got hacked. Unless there is a physical security device to protect your account (like an authenticator) it is impossible to guarantee with any certainty that your account is safe. What happened with OP was not a ""breach"" as he calls it, it was an account hacking. It happens in everything online and was EXTREMELY bad for Blizzard some years ago until they implemented account authenticators."
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"> Be advised that if Sony fails to provide me with a check for $500.00 within two weeks 

While I agree he should get his money back, he stated he's received $230, leaving him being owed $270. Why would he draft a letter demanding $500 when almost half has been paid? Surely you're not advising him to request more than what was taken."
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-17,"Sony will reply stating that you have already agreed to binding arbitration using an arbitrator of our choice and thus have no right to sue in a court of law.  They will include a very small list of arbitrators (probably just one)  that Sony has pre-selected based on favorable outcomes.

If OP is dumb enough to engage in arbitration, he will lose both the $500 and arbitration fees and possibly even Sony's totally made-up legal fees.

EDIT:  Sony will end their letter stating that despite arbitration, they reserve the right to sue OP in a court of law for libel for statements made on social media sites.

EDIT 2:  I found the actual TOS agreement [here](https://www.playstationnetwork.com/terms-of-service/) it does say this:

> SNEI HAS NO OBLIGATION TO REVERSE OR REFUND UNAUTHORIZED CHARGES MADE USING ANY AVAILABLE PAYMENT METHOD.

So, legally OP is fucked no matter what he does.  And nobody should ever use a credit card with Sony.

3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-17,"The fact that a consumer should have to go to the media to get refunded because of fraudulent activity is total crap. Sony seems to be particularly bad for this.

If by some miracle someone from Sony is reading these comments:

I used to sell your hardware for a living. I firmly believed in the high quality of PlayStation, VAIO, and Bravia. The commission I made selling these products bought me my first car. The first time I outfitted my home recording studio, every pair of headphones I bought were Sony's. Even after I stopped selling electronics, I actively recommended Sony products to friends and family because I believed in the quality of the product.

I've seen lots of complaints in the past few years from consumers about Sony refusing to refund fraudulent transactions, or refusing to cooperate with chargebacks. I wish I could say that this post was the last straw for me, but that happened a long time ago. I won't buy Sony anymore. I also actively recommend that other people do not, solely because of the awful customer service the company has developed in the past few years. 

So there it is. Chances are no one from Sony will ever see it, but its still just as true. I used to be a diehard supporter of Sony products, but not anymore. "

I'll respond to your PM in a bit. Also, if I can ultimately convince either Sony, BoA, or Mastercard to do something that would result in me getting the $269.94 back, I'll donate it to a charity yet to be determined, since I'd feel bad about taking extra."

At the end of the day, a lot of the companies know that credit card companies will just give out credits, rather than filing chargebacks for smaller amounts, because of the costs associated with filing chargebacks, so some companies will game the system as much as they can. "
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"Well, I hate to single out Sony. I saw lots of companies playing the chargeback game. It's just that the Sony Playstation accounts get jammed up in the system, because too many people at the credit card company don't immediately recognize it as fraud, since the thief didn't directly steal the cardholder's card number, they hacked into an account that contained the cardholder's information and used that to make fraudulent purchases. It can also be confusing, because most of the time, there are legitimate purchases from that very same playstation account. As far as trusting Sony, I'd say, trust them about as much as you'd trust any other large corporation. 

OP will eventually get his money back, once the case gets into the hands of someone who has a little bit of authority and can make the right calls to the right departments.

3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-17,"In the banks defense, which would really apply to any bank used here not just BofA, the reason listed on the charge back was Unauthorized Purchase instead of Fraud which this situation truly is. You should easily win your fraud chargeback claim.

Think about this logically. The reason provided accuses Sony that they charged you for something they didn't properly disclose to you. The responses they gave (likely canned responses) show the controls they have in place to ensure they did disclose everything to you as well as controls to ensure the purchase wasn't accidental. That's why the bank didn't accept the charge back. This would be the outcome at  *any bank*.

Now that you've filed under the fraud reason, the entire case will be handled differently. Think about this logically. With the first reason, you are blaming Sony for something and asking them to admit fault and make you whole. Admitting fault where none occurred immediately stops the act of making you whole and also represents damage to Sony by admitting fault. This is *bad* for Sony. With Fraud you are blaming an unknown 3rd party for something and asking Sony to bear the cost as a normal part of doing business. When Sony makes you whole, that's perceived as a *good* thing since Sony is the big company with the big pockets and you are the innocent victim.

As the cardholder here, you don't care as long as you get your money. And I agree with you. The unseen piece here is how this impacts *everyone* involved including Sony. If you were a business owner, you would not publicly and on permanent record damage your own brand by admitting fault when it wasn't yours to begin with. That's logical, reasonable, and that's all that happened here. Now imagine you get thousands of these requests a day, many of which are fraudulent themselves. If your policy was so loose that you just paid everyone, you'd be hemorrhaging money. That's not good either. That's why Sony's response was what it was.

You're doing the right thing by refilling.

For clarity, I'm only looking at this from the Bank's perspective. I'm actually not a fan of Sony for the very reasons you describe and refuse to do business with them. The rigmarole you went through sounds like nobody has the authority to do anything for you and it's unacceptable to me, along with their history of privacy breaches.

3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"I can tell you from experience that Sony's customer service is terrible. I spent $9000 on a TV that stopped working two days after I bought it. It took me almost two weeks to get it approved to be ""repaired"" and they wanted me to pay an astronomical fee to ship it to CANADA from San Diego. I eventually convinced the manager of Best Buy to let me return it under the holiday return policy and bought another one. It was an insane headache over something as simple as a manufacturing issue."

Additionally, I've have had to deal with Sony support previously, and I too know that they are not friendly or helpful to work with in many cases.

Meanwhile, I look over at /r/xboxone and Microsoft is often representing over there (something you'd never see in /r/PS4), they are listening to customers and implementing changes. Not to mention that they seem to listen to their users more oven and regularly update their console.

I've been itching to pull the trigger on a PS4, but I won't lie, I really think I'm going to go with the Xbox One. Maybe when the PS4 sees a couple price drops, I'll pick one up in a few years."

So I'm in an interesting situation where I was in an auto collision (not my fault) and the other guy's insurance paperwork looks like it's fraudulent (the listed company denies the existence of a policy).

Now I'm looking into the matter - even if I just sue the guy for the damages (probably a few thousand) and diminished value of the car (might be more than the damages), and it's starting to look like getting a lawyer to take the guy to small claims is going to end up being more expensive than I could reasonably recoup in court.

As /u/koteuop clearly explains in their post, you have no recourse if you use a prepaid credit card, if they had used a real credit card they would not have lost $400, they would have lost zero & Walmart would be out the money since the account was stolen.



Yet they lost money, Walmart didn't lose anything, walmart didn't do anything for the customer & what was their response.... Open another account & put more pre-paid money in Walmarts control.



If a company screws you, do not continue to give them your money.

Though I would be wary and spell out what that amount is, and keep receipts for the cost of the certified letter etc.  At least that is how it worked when I went to small claims court in my state.  The judge asked if I'd like to put in an amount for costs spent trying to claim my money, I came up with $300 off the top of my head figuring $50/hour.  He didn't find that in any way unusual and granted it.  I would figure you could ASK for it just like a store or anywhere else will add charges for bounced checks, etc.  It's just to cover the cost of getting the money back."

They have a Chargeback Analyst Team, full support by a corporate general counsel (with Jr. Counsels who only function is to attend court) who is already on the standard payroll.

You'd be surprise how many people don't show to arbitration and small claims when they used to try to fight their CB reversals; thus grant judgement in our favor"

Its actually crazy how powerful an arbiration clause can be. That said... you were correct in cost. For an arbitration they have to hire an arbitrator along with paying their own council. Arbitrators can run over $700 per hour. Plus they need to rent out a room and shit. $500 is nothing compared to the cost of arbitration.

3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"It's been a couple of years, but it's all coming back to me.

For Visa and MasterCard, the issuing bank has to pay a fee for each chargeback it initiates, to either Visa or MC. It would be different for Amex and Discover, since they issue their own cards. The company I worked for issued Visa and MC cards. There are also costs, such as labor associated with each chargeback. The fee is to keep banks from filing chargebacks without merit, since it is in Visa and MC's best interest to keep the merchants happy also, so that they continue to accept Visa and MC as payment. 

Once the merchant receives the chargeback, they can either just accept it, or they can re-present the charge to the bank. I believe there is a fee associated with that as well, to keep re-presentments in check, just like chargebacks. 

I never heard of the bank increasing processing fees for merchants for filing chargebacks. Even if that were the case, it would be Visa or MC increasing those fees, and not the bank. The issuing bank has to comply with all of Visa and MC's guidelines in order to use their symbol. In the case of the other 2, I'm not sure. "

So if you just do a little homework online and make sure to write all your documents clearly and dispassionately (i.e. don't go into a rant about how the opposing party is a *loser* and has *ruined your life*, and don't use ALL CAPS TO MAKE YOUR ARGUMENT BETTER!), then the judge will be very inclined to rule in your favor. 

TL;DR: if you just get your own shit together and be nice to the judge, you stand a pretty decent chance of getting back all those damages from your car wreck. And good luck! "
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,"Years ago when a friends Xbox account was hacked and they charged 500$ on his card, his credit card refunded the money AND Microsoft did as well to compensate. I've never had a bad experience with Xbox support. When my house was broken into and my Xbox was stolen I contacted Microsoft with the serial number of the Xbox and they tracked it down and sent the information to the police who then got it back for me. "

When they rip off your DEBIT CARD it is *your money from your bank account* and you don't get access to it until the investigation is completed. That means your rent doesn't get paid, you don't eat, etc. Never use debit cards online."
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,Of course. Credit card companies will fight to get THEIR money back.  Debit transactions are your money. Good luck!
3t78j6,2015-11-17,2015-11-18,Seconded.  Debit cards have almost zero protection.  Credit cards typically have insanely good protection.

The counteroffers were so ridiculous though that I took it to a bench trial and won lol. That person should have taken my 1k and walked.

Edit: Just to add, arbitration does not determine culpability or guilt. It is a way for two parties to settle a dispute without going to trial and wasting time and money. Judge Judy actually determines whether a party is culpable for damages or not. "

19c6lyz,2024-01-21,2024-01-21,TLDR: Piss baby is sad someone criticized their favorite game in the universe.
19c6lyz,2024-01-21,2024-01-21,"The games Story just isn't well written, Joel's death was cheap for shock value and he barely had anything in common with the smart survivor he was before. If you played the first game and then saw how stupid he acts in the second one, completely dropping his guard around strangers, you would be furious aswell.

It's not a case of being angry that he died at all, everyone knew it was coming, it was just out of character and cheap. Reminds me of GoT season 8 where every character just looks and sounds the same but acts like the complete opposite just to get to the conclusion the writers wanted but without any of the development to get there.

It's even more annoying when you know Naughty Dog have excellent writing generally. The idea of the Story and everything was also cool, but the execution really wasn't that good IMO. There is still good character writing in LoU2, but definetly not on Joel's part."
19c6lyz,2024-01-21,2024-01-21,"I hated Abby and the nonstop reliance on shock factor story telling. It was lazy and forced compared to the effectively flawless storytelling of the first game. 

The game itself is a fantastic game though mechanically."

People with that level of poor taste in writing exist in large numbers. This post is proof that some people are completely unaware of their poor taste in writing.  

If you aren't aware, and you can look this up if you actually had a brain to do so, but most game awards are given by journalists to justify their own opinions. Despite so many awards it wasn't even the player's choice, that's pretty telling for how good it actually was."
19c6lyz,2024-01-21,2024-01-21,"The story sucked and the characters were shit, there was not one likeable character in the entire game, even Joel sucked because he easily walked into a trap, you do not ""go soft"" in the fucking zombie apocalypse, so the idea that he would let his guard down like that is bullshit, this is a man who even at the start of the outbreak was willing to close his heart to other people, like when he made Tommy keep going on the road instead of helping the family that was begging for help.

  
Ellie sparing Abby makes no sense narratively, the game treats it as if she's aware of Abby's character development over the course of the game, but Ellie is not the player, she has no reason to spare Abby, even her helping Abby down makes no sense, she should've just shot her and left."
19c6lyz,2024-01-21,2024-01-21,"The entire premise of the game relies on people ignoring the highly questionable assertion that killing Ellie would result in a cure, which documents in the PS3 version of the first game even tell you is unlikely.


Furthermore, there is literally no chain of delivery for any cure and the Fireflies are at various times depicted as being thinly disguised terrorists with their own agenda and not much better than the rulling body they're fighting.


This is all conviniently put aside to make Joel a much bigger monster than he actually is.


I can accept Joel being killed as part if the past coming back to haunt him and his choices over the years.


I don't accept the game trying to say he had it coming on flimsy premises and with a poor execution.


 I never felt any sympathy for Abby at any point because quite frankly she's introduced in a terrible manner.


The game would have beneffited from actually having Abby be sympathetic, before you see her brutally torture and beat Joel to death and not after like it tries."

Bad characters, bad acting, bad plot points, bad themes, inconsistency across the board, bad main characters, nonsensical character progression, terrible ending. It's all just poorly written garbage around really fun gameplay."
19c6lyz,2024-01-21,2024-01-21,It sucks bruh 
19c6lyz,2024-01-21,2024-01-21,"Its far from bad game, but the story just sucked. Not that was poorly done in compare of other games, but some choices were just stupid."
19c6lyz,2024-01-21,2024-01-22,Did you see all the 10/10 reviews for cyberpunk at launch? Awards can be very stupid.
19c6lyz,2024-01-21,2024-01-21,The game is amazing. You think that a loud minority on the internet is the majority.
19c6lyz,2024-01-21,2024-01-21,I thought the story was better than Part 1

19c6lyz,2024-01-21,2024-01-21,"It's not a bad game, but it's not the masterpiece that some people call it.   

And the Elden Ring comparisson is dishonest at best."
19c6lyz,2024-01-21,2024-01-21,"The game is a story-based experience, and the story is the most horrible part of the game. The gameplay is frankly severely outdated so it doesn’t lift the weight.

Calling the game bad is completely justified when it fails at its most important aspect. You don’t see people calling Elden Ring bad because the story sucks, since it isn’t a game where story matters."
19c6lyz,2024-01-21,2024-02-12,"Game awards are like the academy awards. They're senior prom - a popularity contest. 

It doesn't mean they're perfect, or even that they're good games/movies, necessarily. It just tends to mean they got the most press and made a lot of sales. 

TLOU2 was solidly ok as a game, but made a ton of sales off TLOU1 and actually did innovate in how games can tell stories. Is it a ""true' GOTY? Subjective. For me, it's not. Someone else, might be. For me, as a game and a game alone - it's a solid 7/10. 

ER...wasn't even really a good From game. It was the first open world Souls game (let's be real - it's a spiritual successor at absolute best to Souls), the art design is mostly amazing, as is the music. It doesn't do a lot new - BOTW did most of it before ER, less the combat difficulty and builds brought over from Souls. It got a lot of hype from bringing GRRM in for the worldbuilding (though oddly - still feels built just like every Souls game before it). The combat is a downgrade from Sekiro and DS3, in favor of bringing in more build viability, especially with hybrid builds. The AI is hot fucking garbage. Does the dungeon copy/paste of Oblivion, different biomes but basically just spreading out the Souls worldbuilding more. Not bad, does a lot of things great or better. Solid 8/10. 

But - as a whole, it did a couple of things that really weren't in the mainstream that year and succeeded entirely well. No battle pass, no live service to speak of, No nickel and diming for DLC - just a complete, finished product. And done in a way that easily gives gamers 80-100 hours min of gameplay. That, when Games-as-a-Service were the norm - yeah, that's entirely deserving of praise. See also the praise (and controversy) of Baldur's Gate 3 for the same reasons. 

Tldr: It's more like Time's Person of the Year or senior prom, GOTYs are. It's 99% the most newsworthy, and they're an industry circlejerk more than anything. They're not a marker of ""pure"" quality."
19c6lyz,2024-01-21,2024-01-21,The vast majority acknowledge the game is great
19c6lyz,2024-01-21,2024-01-21,"You have quite justifiably been slaughtered for this bad post. A game can win 10 trillion awards and it'll mean

19c6lyz,2024-01-21,2024-01-22,Okay but just because something has won awards doesn't mean that everyone should like it. I'm pretty sure that it had a split reception from the get go with half the people saying it's bad and half the people saying it's a masterpiece and those people clearly managed to outweigh the bad opinions to the point where nobody is apparently allowed to say anything bad about the game.

And honestly just because you win award does not mean your the best game ever.  I mean take Eurovision song contest just because you win does not mean every human on the planet  will think your the best fracking band in the´universe.  Because every one has different taste in music as well as movies and games.   


I will get the game credit it has garner a following and it won allot of rewards and I think that great.  I personal think the game is a turd and even if you clad the turd in gold it´s still a turd and Im not in to shit.  And that´s  what I think. And if you can´t comprehend that people think and like differently then im sorry dude I can´t help you.   


Just keep enjoy the game if you love it and I see no reason why you should worry that people dislike it it will not change the fact you like it so just keep loving the game and don´t stress over what other people think."

19c6lyz,2024-01-21,2024-01-21,"No one who actually played it says it’s a “bad” game. It isn’t. Much like with S8 of GoT, it’s the writing that was awful while everything else was top-notch. 

And anyway, awards alone don’t really mean much anymore. 

And hell, no game is ever this divisive and debated without reason. That alone should tell you something."
19c6lyz,2024-01-21,2024-01-21,"I have noticed something recently.

Any sort of media that focuses on ""girl power,"" even if it isn't the primary focus, gets absolutely demolished by a certain brand of chronically online neckbeards.

They will nitpick the fuck out of it, while giving other games/movies/tv shows of similar caliber a pass for similar flaws. 

Is this to say The Last of Us Part 2 is perfect? I wouldn't say that it is. But I also think a lot of the dialogue around the game is made in bad faith. A lot of the arguments against this game are a pretense, and the actual problem is the increased visibility of women characters."
19c6lyz,2024-01-21,2024-01-21,"A lot of gamers just lack the emotional maturity to deal with the kind of themes TLOU Pt2 was trying to present. Perhaps Neil Druckman's biggest error was giving too much credit to the average gamer to be able to enjoy a piece of art in an intelligent way. Gamers can not accept that perhaps the hero  isn't actually the hero. ""But we play as him, so he must be the good guy, right?"". For games to be elevated to a more respectable medium, these people unfortunately have to be left behind."

19c6lyz,2024-01-21,2024-01-21,"99% of Awards were undeserved. 

The Game is garbage and everyone that gave this crappy Game a high score was either paid or is delusional.

But Reviews nowadays mean shit. D4, Spiderman2 and Starfield all got a bunch of 9/10 scores, even though all are literal TRASH!"

19c6lyz,2024-01-21,2024-01-21,"In my opinion, hot take, but I actually liked Last of Us 2, and it grew more on me over time. I still give it an 8/10. My main issue with the game is too much focus on Abby, trying to get us to sympathize with her, and the ending just sucks. But I do like the extremely dark depressing polizing tone throughout the game, it makes for a very memorable and engaging experience overall for me. 

I also enjoy the gameplay brutal combat of both Last of Us games, with Last of Us 2 combat being better than 1 in every way. Gameplay is also very fun on harder modes like Grounded and Survival mode. So Last of Us 2 is overall a great game, but not better than Elden Ring, these two games are so different and hard to compare. Of course I'll choose Elden Ring out of personal preference because Dark Souls is probably my favorite game franchise of all time."
19c6lyz,2024-01-21,2024-01-21,It's not a bad game. Just overrated. Winning GOTY over DOOM Eternal and Ghost of Tsushima was laughable. The story wasn't nearly good enough to justify winning over other games with such remedial gameplay elements.
19c6lyz,2024-01-21,2024-01-21,"I loved the first game and loved the 2nd just as much.

Some didn't like the story, i personally did. I got what they were going for with the story and think they nailed it.

I liked the way it was told and liked how the characters were written with there motivations for each action and how there motivations and feelings evolved through the game making sense to me. 


Others can of course disagree with that."

19c6lyz,2024-01-21,2024-01-22,I had a good chuckle cause I love Elden Ring but I've seen a lot of shit talked about it... And I helped. Gods now I wanna go play some more Elden Ring.

19c6lyz,2024-01-21,2024-01-22," in the last of arse the messaging was bad, and people hated it, pretty simple, Elden ring had no message but ""git gud' and we loved it"
19c6lyz,2024-01-21,2024-01-22,"The game is just paced weird. If they reorganized the story a little, it would've worked much better. It's just so weird being hit in the face with Joel's death and then being forced to ""like"" Abby. I personally love Abby, but I can see why it was hard for people to give a shit about her character. We should've gotten more time with her before we watched her kill Joel. They really thought they could immediately kill one of gaming's most beloved characters and convince people to love the person that killed them. That was their mistake.

We should've gotten a spin off game where you play as Abby with her friends being the other characters so that we could get attached to them. It would be something that is seen as a spinoff at the time of release, seemingly having nothing to do with the first game, but then release the game we got afterwards and bring it all together in a big surprise.

I love the game for what it is. I even appreciate it's simple story. I could've gone without the whole ""she's pregnant"" story point three separate times, but I still love it. I just personally think they could've done better with the layout of the story. They rushed things with these characters, and that's the problem. We didn't love the first game because what the characters were going through was terrible. We loved them because of the way we got to know these characters and how they reacted/grew from what they encountered. The issue with part two is that we just didn't get that. They tried to force people to feel bad for a character that was already on the shit list 45 minutes into the game. We needed time with Abby before she started this mission to kill Joel."
19c6lyz,2024-01-21,2024-01-22,"I mean, I agree with you, I think the last of us 2 (especially at launch) received a lot of undeserved and prejudicial hatred, and it still does.

Yes the game and many people that worked on the game was the target of bigot harassment.  Which unfortunately made it impossible to have an open discussion about why the story wasn't very good.

I hate how they made Ellie's character and Abby is probably one of the most boring and annoying characters I've ever encountered. 

If disliking the writing and characters in this game means I'm an honorary neackbeard then so be it.

Game play was still great and I would absolutely replay if I could get past how there are basically 0 likeable characters and the situations they put themselves in repeatedly make little sense."

19c6lyz,2024-01-21,2024-01-21,"Writing off people disliking the story as not being able to appreciate how deep it is is, ironically, one of the shallowest takes you can have.

The story being deep doesn't change the fact it's poorly told with terrible pacing and theming. What the author intends with the overall story doesn't change the fact that many characters act against their own best interests and even their own established character traits to progress the plot. It doesn't change the fact that half the plot runs on convenient contrivances."

1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,I can only think of FORE! reasons.
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,"Because forcing the player to watch their character from the previous game, get brutally beaten to death by the new game protagonist, was a huge shock to a lot of players."

1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,Oh Boy.. You just stirred up the hornets nest of people that think their subjective dislikement of the narrative makes tlou2 an objectively bad game.

1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,I wish it went for longer
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,"Because it crapped on the story of the first game, just to make a generic and cringe ""revenge bad duh"" story. Along with other stupid retcons that Druckman pulled when the actual good writers left the studio."
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,"It's an excellent game. Really pulls at your emotions. I hated having to play as Abby at first, but once I got more into her background I started to get sympathetic to her. I got to the point when fighting her as Ellie, I wanted to stop beating on her. I wanted them to talk to each other. Not necessarily make up and be friends, but realise that they are very similar in reality."
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,"It’s an amazing game. I loved the combat in the 1st game even though it wasn’t groundbreaking, just felt good hitting enemies with bricks and pipes. But man did they improve in Part 2, some of the best gameplay I’ve played"
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,"Odd writing decisions to put it mildly, it would have been better with Joel and Ellie not in it and just a civil war in Seattle with Abbey's story focusing on past trauma and Lev and overcoming the cycle of violence. 

The marketing prior to launch also mislead consumers as to how much of a role Joel would play in the game and when the story leaked early and was found to be accurate the sentiment was 'not good'."
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,The absolutely terrible story is probably why

1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,"Oh it's because the narrative is garbage. Fans of the game will hide behind it behind transphobia. For me it has nothing to do with that, it's the fact they went from an amazing narrative in the first game to an absolute stretch of a set up for this game and none of the characters really act like we've come to know (specifically Joel, ellie and Tommy). It's just really poorly written and I'm praying the show fixes it but I know it won't."
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,"It's because >!after playing as Joel throughout the first game as the protagonist, players were not expecting to be forced to murder him themselves. !<

It was a highly unpopular narrative decision."
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,"(Spoilers obviously) Big time LoU1 fan here. A lot of people were expecting to delve into Ellie and Joel’s relationship from the beginning, but they decided to off him and fill the game with flashback scenes. The pacing was just poor because of that choice. If they had just made it so his death happened in the middle of the game instead of acting as a catalyst for a long revenge story, then it would’ve had a more significant emotional impact."
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,"Naughy Dog released a 2 hour video documenting the journey with the making of the game. I just watched it and it was amazing. 

You'll have a new found love for people who really love giving all for the art."
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,"There is a valid argument that Druckman tried the “betray your audience” thing that Kojima is fond of doing. *to similar effect*

Except here, the culture of gaming is not the niche market it was trying to escape in 2002. (Games are way more high profile than ever before) 

A lot of people didn’t like the protagonist swap that happened then with Sons of Liberty which turned Kojima’s flagship games into a Vanilla Sky-like mind bender. 

Here, w/ TLOU, what was pretty much the Walking Dead turned into Old Yeller (or whatever the cinematic western-genre equivalent of that is) Or Of Mice and Men or some Steinbeck novel."
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-06,"I never really liked the first one, so not liking the second one came easy to me. I didn't grow up with a PS3 so I missed all the PS exclusives of the era. Uncharted, TLoU, Infamous etc. I don't have a veil of nostalgia covering my face, so I've played a whole heap of games before TLoU, and I enjoyed them more to the point of thinking of TLoU as a bad game."
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-06,"A *bit* long? It's an absolute slog, completely unnecessary. Doesn't hold a candle to its predecessor."

No not the current one, the next one."
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,The pivot was a stroke of genius. I love the complaints about the game cause it’s all very telling. Subversion of expectations makes good art. Another story about a father figure protecting a child is boring as hell
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,People hate it because they can't get over Joel. It's at the point where it's like desperate obsessing over an ex.
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,Gamers don’t like women 
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,People that don’t understand the story and hated that a specific character died. A bunch of cry babies if you ask me.
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,"I loved it but I think the timing of this game at the height of Covid was a serious challenge for a lot of people including myself. At the time, society wanted escapism stories and this game explored the realities none of us wanted to face."
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,"I think people hate, bad review, whatever because they didn’t get what they hoped or expected. I thought the story and game was a beautifully, and painfully told story."
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,I never played this game (or the first for more than an hour) but I think It's because *spoilers* you murder Joel and fans of the first game were not happy 
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-06,There are hundreds of better games. The story is beyond shallow and written by children. 
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,"As I was told at the game dispensary - ""you're gonna feel some kinda way about the ending"". 

I thought the game was extremely well executed. I ended up flipping my viewpoint on how I felt about things a few times (trying to be vague here) and definitely felt some kinda way."

That is why people were (and still are, for the dumbest bigots in the community) so shitty about it"
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,"Generally, people loved the graphics and enjoyed the combat.  People disliked the story (particularly the spoiler moment), thought that it went on way too long, and absolutely detested playing as a certain character in act 3."
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,It’s a bad plot.
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,"I paused and googled ""how long does the game force to you play as Abby"" the first time you take control of her character. When I read that it was roughly half the game I uninstalled and never touched it again. TLOU1 is one of my favorite games of all time. TLOU2 is one of the worst games I have ever played."
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,"I didn't play it myself, but every once in a while since this game released, I watch this compilation video of Abby's friends got gruesomely murdered."

1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,Is this bait or bait?
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,"Joel died at the beginning when they had advertisements that showed him in later parts of the game.

The ending was pointless and anticlimactic. Ellie killed hundreds of dudes without a second thought only to not kill Abby at the end. Which made all of the collateral damage caused by Ellie to get to Abby totally pointless.

They should've had Abbys section of the game occur first. Would have made Joel's death more understandable, and she would have been more relatable.

I think the show did a better job of telling the story for the first game. In the show they aren't killing hundreds of people the entire time, so when Joel goes crazy at the end and kills everyone in the hospital to save Ellie it was far more effective at conveying Joel's depravity and the lengths he was willing to goto for someone he loved.

In the game it was just another shooting gallery in a long line of shooting galleries."
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-06,Because an unfortunately significant part of the gamer community is composed of brainlets who hate whatever they believe is 'woke propaganda'.
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,"Different perspective here - I liked the narrative, BUT I absolutely hated being forced to play as Abby, not because of the character, but because I lost ALL MY UPGRADES that I worked so hard to get for Ellie. I also dont love constantly digging through drawers and cabinets for upgrade material, it was repetitive. Story was great though"

1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,That's what SHE said!
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,"Pretty much. The game's plot is not particularly deep, nor does it say anything new or interesting. It does the same thing as the last Terminator movie, killing an important character for shock value as a method to prop up the new narrative, and retconning various previous details because they were inconvenient for the story they wanted to tell. Unsurprisingly, both plots were poorly received.

Couple an unpopular plot (and I get it, some people like it, I won't pretend they don't exist, but they can't pretend the general reception is nothing but mild at best either) with a rather average third person gameplay (It's not bad, but so many games have done the style better) and you have TLoU2. It really shouldn't be such a shocker that a lot of people really don't care for it."
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-06,"They also killed all the men in story, except Tommy who is crippled now"
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,Please tell where you yourself murder him.

1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,"Truly, objectively, I think most fans can agree now that the story pacing was completely incorrect. So many things were told out of order. Everyone was raging that Joel would just tell his name to strangers. The line that explains that is in the literal last scene of the game; where he talks about trading a lot with people who pass through and got some coffee. You needed to feel more comfy in Jackson before Joel died and let Ellie and his relationship begin to heal - then take it all away. The choice to have you play as Abby at the start was weird; it would have been much more digestible if it just happened. If you were to open the game with Abby do it with her crying over her dad’s body so the emotions are more conflicting when Joel’s death hits and it doesn’t feel out of left field. But this is all hindsight. Hindsight I hope they take to heart in making the next one; because some of our feedback was actually constructive."
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,So glad they have time to make *another* documentary but couldn't even make the multiplayer they promised the MP community for over 4 years.
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,"People couldn't get over Dante didn't have a white hair when he was young on a DMC game. And you are probably one of them.

And it looks weird to you that fanbase (not me) were angry the protagonist of the first game gets killed asap just to point ''oh well, it doesnt matter'' after 25 hours of gameplay?

Oh btw, Ellie is lesbian and the villian is Trans and we see them have sex. Not that anything to do with the game but...just to make you sure it is really really important."

1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-06,This is top 3 third person gameplay. 
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,No. I think I'll just let you be an idiot instead.
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,"Two hour documentary = years of work on a game. Indeeed the same thing. 

I feel they would have made it if it made sense gmameplay-wise and how good the concept was in the first place. Bungie said it didn't hold up so they might try again later or move on.

People also want a Bloodborne 2 or a remake since forever. They would sell big units and Sony still doesn't do it. This should tell us decissions are not taken only thinking about the money."
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,They literally explained why they didn't make it you dingus
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-06,The documentary was filmed from 2016-late 2019 so literally has nothing to do with current game development.
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,"No, it doesn't, but you didn't come here to speak in good faith anyway."
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,"Yep, and they've shown up to express their displeasure at being called out."
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-06,"Not anywhere close. From the top of my head I can list Gears of War, Max Payne and Dead Space as having way better gameplay.

TLoU2 is not bad, just serviceable. It's cinematic, but I don't find that as an interesting vehicle for fun gameplay. Just in the third person shooter department I could list dozens of titles that do it better."
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,"Their explanation makes no sense. 

""We realized that after 4 years of making a live-service game that our game would require service and we weren't prepared for that"". 

Who would believe this reasoning? The project was simply never prioritized at the studio, despite their public facing statements."
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,"Funny, because I enjoyed the story on my playthrough and have gained even more appreciation for it when rewatching the cinematics on YouTube."
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,I see.
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-06,"None of those are stealth action, which TLOU2 is a masterclass in. Yeah I moved the goalposts."
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,"Firstly, it didn't start as a live service, it was going to be free with TLOU2.  

Then, it was going to be f2p.  
 
Then, live service.  

That was the rumour timeline.  

Secondly, they outright explained that keeping a LiveService game would mean they wouldn't be able to keep developing games the way they do. They chose to not alienate the core fan base just for GaaS money. Developing LiveService is EXTREMELY hard and it's a gargantuan amount of work that would push any other projects (like their new IP) on the backburner for several years. It just made sense as a business decision."
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-06,"You really have a low bar for masterclass.

Another 3 then, that do the third person action stealth way better than TLoU2, are more ambitious in terms of gameplay, and offer far greater variety in play styles: Metal Gear Solid V, Hitman Reboot, Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory."

And everyone with more than two brain cells to rub together would have predicted this 4 years in advance. 

They announced they were splitting the MP off into it's own thing in 2019, and presumably spent the majority of their time working on TLOU2 until it's release in 2020, with a small team developing the MP. 

So from 2019 - 2023 they were working on a GaaS game and somehow nobody foresaw that the game would require service beyond it's initial sale/release? That's not something you ""suddenly"" realize years down the line. 

You don't even have to work in game dev to have the foresight to have seen this. But somehow, it escaped the attention of the most talented game devs in the industry? You believe that?"
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,"I mean in all honesty i understand the business aspect.  
I can get Naughty Dog fucking up like this because they aren't very well known for tidy development cycles whatsoever. And also another reason as to why it was canned is Jim Ryan stepping down and thus the GaaS push Sony had ending.  
Could ND be lying? yeah, 100%. But i still think their explanation is still somewhat true. Many companies start LS games and then don't realize they need like 2 updates a month to keep afloat!"
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,It's frustrating because they could have handed the post-launch support for this game off to a Sony support studio. There's no real reason as far as I can see why they couldn't have done this. But I'm not an insider so idk.
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,ND is a little weird with handling work to other devs. Afaik the tlou remake was the first time. Ofc I'm frustrated too because it looked great (and no mp made me drop a point from tlou2 tbh)
1ajh39q,2024-02-05,2024-02-06,"I feel like they've also been defeated by their own success such that unless their new projects are absolutely revolutionary and ambitious, they won't release them. They can't tarnish their record with something that is ""pretty good"". It has to be over-the-top exceptional."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,It's because of the story. Most people wanted The Last Of Us 1 all over again but with better graphics. Instead we got a huge story twist. Which is very good in my opinion. This is a revenge story that ends badly for both sides.
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"I think a lot of people had a picture in their head of what the game would be. And then when it was radically different, and went in a darker direction, that really upset them.

There are problems with pacing, and the order of playing some sections. I think they could have benefited with introducing a load of a new character's storyline earlier (if it could be done without spoiling the surprise too much) - I think a lot of people had problems empathising with the character after playing 10+ hours of the game. I also think the last ~20% of the game could have been carved off as a separate DLC, giving a happy(ish) ending for those who wanted it, but then continuing the story for those who needed closure.

IMHO it's a very good game. It's not groundbreaking, like the first was, but then it was never going to be. It has flaws (limited character models, pacing issues, some aspects of the story), but ultimately I think a lot of hate comes from people who didn't feel they got enough fan service."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"Playing TLOU1 made me feel powerful and the end felt like righteous justice. Ellie and Joel’s moralities were really painted in a positive light that was not completely accurate. TLOU2 made me feel uncomfortable, drained and that every decision Ellie went through was a path further into darkness. The ending felt like resolution to all that darkness with a small semblance of hope. I think I know why people didn’t like the game because I personally felt fatigued playing it. With that being said, it has a great emotional impact that the creators clearly set out to do. It’s not a feel-good experience and wasn’t meant to be. 

Character development was excellent including for secondary characters. I was thrown for a loop on the change in the playable character but I ended up liking the experience.

Gameplay was very similar to previous game with a few innovations. I was a bit disappointed by the weapons system being largely the same. The stealth element was improved in diversity and felt much more challenging. Overall gameplay was fun but left a little to be desired.

Game was 8/10 for me"
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,"Abby as a character was very controversial for some reason, but I never minded her. I guess a lot of these incels felt their masculinity was in danger by seeing a women stronger than them, and hated her after that. I felt her story was well thought out and important to the story, and everyone that dislikes her didn't play the game."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,I think it was because of the story.
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,Had no problems with the game. To me the story was amazing if they had been able to add the parts they had to delete would've loved it more
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"People missing the point of the story and the narrative they were trying to drive home. Revenge isn't black and white. Ellie and Joel are not the heroes of the story necessarily. Most games paint the protganists as righteous, mowing through hordes of nameless NPCs. TLOU2 gives those NPCs a name and a story - and makes you think twice about killing them. Abby's motivation for revenge is just as compelling a story as Ellie's. The point of the game wasn't to make you feel guilty about the choices Ellie makes throughout the game, but to show you the two sides to every story. I personally enjoyed the twist and Abby as a playable character. To someone else's point, the ending is a suitable way for Ellie to break the cycle and try to find some semblance of peace in her life. The game does have some questionable choices though - forcing us to repeat the first half of the game, but as Abby was weird. I would've much preferred a back and forth until the climactic confrontation at the theater. I could also do without the violence against dogs. I genuinely thought about putting the game down after encountering that. Overall, I'd give the game an 8/10."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,The Last of Us Part II is magnificent. Easily one of the best games of the entire console generation
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"I always loved ND games because they add lots of details and small events that keep the gameplay fresh and sometimes give it a new twist.

I find the story ok so I don't get why people hate it either"
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"I know the haters are sick of hearing they “just don’t get it” but I’ve been reading through reddit for a few days now since finishing it and... That’s how it is, by and large. I don’t think they’re stupid or anything, I think they just got too caught up in their own emotions to see the bigger picture. That, combined with people who just want to shit on things for fun. If the haters want the lovers to stop calling them stupid, they should probably stop falling for the “Ellie is the first female protagonist” meme/joke EVERY SINGLE TIME. There are legit, intelligent critiques out there, but nobody sees that due to the constant stupidity of loud mouthed fools."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"People didn't understood the final, the biggest Ellie's fear was to be alone, and in the end, she saw that she was alone."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"People wanted a Happy Story, that's why the hate. 

The Game keeps getting depressing the more you play. I liked the game, not same level as part 1 but its no way an absolute garbage like how some of the people are claiming it to be."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"I didn't like the game personally bc of the story, narrative, storytelling, the setting of promises and payoffs, and the fact that they use Joel just as a plot device and emotion device.  I don't think it's the worst game ever tho, it's a solid 7/10 at least."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,"So I just beat the story. Pretty good. About on par with TLOU1 (minus 1's great ending).

I have a few lingering questions, though, probably because I wasn't paying enough attention:

>!So...that lady that had her mural painted all over the city? ""She will protect you""? The leader of the Scars? Who was she? Did she ever show up? Was she that chick that god smacked in the head with a hammer durring the Abby section? (If so, what a fuckin' waste, I didn't even know it was the same woman)!<

Second question:

>!There's notes all around the city that you find several times. They just have a person's name on it (can't remember the name). What's the deal with those>?!<"

I didn't hate the ending but it would have been nice to know if Ellie even realises how broken she is and how her actions ruined her life and those around her even more."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"Oh I don’t know, maybe because they killed off Joel in the worst possible fashion and force you to play as his murderer for the second half of the game while you hunt down Ellie and try to kill her? It’s bullshit. 

I’ve read people say “Did you really expect Joel to live through the sequel??? Lolz”

So ignorant. The first game builds up so much emotional attachment to these two and the second game just says “fuck you and what you feel or want for these characters”. Not to mention Joel, who is the most careful person in this post apocalyptic world, who NEVER gives up his identity, just gives out his info and is immediately murdered for it. 

Completely fucking ridiculous."

I was disappointed with the Ending, she didnt get her revenge she didint get a famaly this complete Game builds to something. You kill everyone with Friends and Family and the everything was for nothing. This is stupid.

Then the story steers you in the direction of hating a sympathetic character who does bad things but feels remorse, then loses everything in the end

While at the same time trying to make you sympathize with a bad person who has done unforgiveable things and seems to feel no remorse then gets away with it in the end"
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,I played it without ever playing the original. Gameplay is boring.
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"I would say that a big problem with the game is its pacing and story structure, since it is honestly shite. Flashbacks inside flashbacks, either because the tone in the real game is getting too dark, and they need something people wanted when going into the game, or just building up context, that we need to know to understand the story. This is a story that i think would have been much better if it was told chronologically, since it would have given a much better first impression of >!Abby too. Her campaign would probably also have been much better first too. And then the ending really messes and fucks up the overall theme, and gives players a lot of dissatisfaction. !< I would also say the representation feels really weird and forced, but worst of all is how many plot holes and stupid decisions that have to be made for the story to actually carry out, and these you might not realize, since they are gonna take a while to settle in."

hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,"Yup. Its fantastic, just like the first. I left feeling just as morally conflicted as I did with the first. I never in a million years thought the second would be able to recreate that feeling.

hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,Exactly. And without her you don't walk away with questioning morality the way you do with the first. They managed to recreate that feeling by including her and i think they nailed it.

It's hard to end revenge cycle when you need to make the decision as a player since you need to feel something for the other character and for the most people it failed miserably.  
Most people wanted Abby dead and felt betrayed for the ending, but that is one part of many with what's wrong with the writing but at least you liked something that I couldn't.

Personally I think that last quarter >!(from Tommy visiting Ellie+Dina onwards)!< would have been better as a (possibly free) DLC.

But I'm not disappointed. It's certainly not an 'up' game or ending, and does hammer you over the head with 'revenge is bad', and does have pacing issues in the last third, but overall I liked it."

At least Joel's death serves a huge purpose to the story. His death has a motivated reason behind it that properly works off of his actions in the first game.

Literally speedrun until the end no joke. The story is predictable passed that point because you kinda get the theme of the game already, which is ""revenge""."

Then again, many people seemed bothered by Far Cry 5's ending and I thought that was actually really well done also, though that wasn't quite near this level.

If game writing in general continues to be absolute rubbish, it's because when something actually thoughtful and well executed comes around a bunch of people throw tantrums."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"For me it was the theme. The game seems like it wants to pretend the overall theme and message is unique or deep in any fashion? But... its not and the hammering of the message throughout the story feels grating because of its lack of originality.

Don't get me wrong the graphics, sound, and even gameplay to some extent are spectacular. The story just tries to play like its deep when its true depth never goes beyond a teaspoon of water."

Killing off Abby would not satisfy anyone. That's the whole moral of the story.

The game is not asking you to make the decision for Ellie either. She, not you, chose her path. This is not a roleplaying game so you're only supposed to be the passive observer. You don't have to agree with it but that doesn't make it a bad game."

hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"It’s not a band wagon. 

Something similar happened with TellTales TWD a New Frontier. You’re forced to play as some random ass character that you don’t care about at all, while the game also forces situations on you that put a beloved character is a negative light which further makes your dislike the character you’re forced to play. Eventually it gets better, but the fact that you’re put into those situations to begin with is just stupid. 

It makes sense why people dislike the game. Add in extremely shit writing, and character traits being tossed in the trash for the sake of plot, and you’ve got a lot of angry people. Just like TellTales TWD a New Frontier. The only difference is in a New Frontier the ending makes up for the shit beginning. TLOU2 doesn’t."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"The ""bandwagon"" exists because many people don't like the game, and they actually have an argument to justify it.

hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-28,"Regardless, it was incredibly rushed and contrived. 

“Okay, I’ve travelled hundreds of miles to find this guy and...oh there he is!”

Could they not have written a better sequence than one so coincidental for the death of this character? Especially since on top of that, he acts rather uncharacteristically to get there.

Game of Thrones SPOILERS:

It’s like in GoT S8 when Melisandre finds Arya and says “Hey remember when I said you need to shut blue eyes? Get to work!” and Arya just immediately kills the Night King. It’s way too fucking convenient. The fact that they are both based on retcons of previous material makes the comparison especially apt, I think."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"Possibly, yes. But the player’s attachment to him isn’t diminished because of that, he did what he felt was right because of his love for Ellie."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"Joel did what any good father would do. He'd already lost his daughter, and there was zero chance he was losing another. If you think Joel saving Ellie was a choice, it wasn't. Its what I hope any father would do."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"...but none of that matters, people liked Joel's character and that's that. It really doesn't matter what he's done, he was a likable character."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-28,"Right, the people who were gonna rush to cutting the only immune girl’s brain open, killing her without her consent. Those people were innocent?"
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"That has nothing to do with how he did his death though. He was very careful in the first game and in the second game, he’s a fucking moron or you know completely out of character. He would never trust random strangers that he just met with his real name, especially when he should know that they likely people after him and this is what kills him. Then he gets brutally murdered and tortured by Abby. It was more to do with her father dying than Joel supposedly screwing the chance to save humanity. People are also still attached to Joel. So to play as his killer for the big part of the game, of course nobody is going to like that and if they were going to do that, they need to do it right but they didn’t. Then Ellie doesn’t choose to kill the one person responsible for why Ellie wants and actually does murder so many people along the way which is stupid. 

Both RDR games actually did the revenge story and how certain characters died, a lot better."

No one said it's a bad game, it's a great game with a crap of a story.

You should be pissed off at what happened to Joel. You should want to go hunt down Abby. You should be feeling exactly what Ellie feels.

And then you play Ellie, and do a bunch of terrible shit to a bunch of people, all in the name of ""vengeance"". And as a player, you feel just in your actions because of what happened to Joel.

But then the game shows you why Ellie is such a terrible person for doing so. Because it shows the people Ellie has been hunting down as what they are: people. People with their own lives and their own loves and their own motivations.

It surpasses the death of X character which was pretty much comprehensible for a TLOU fan coming in to this sequel.

The success of a story is to convince you of its message, not only to explain you. You can drive a cliched or an exceptional message and land it amazingly IF you lay down the foundations for it."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,You brought a good point up tho
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,"Probably because its so soul crushing to watch. And then we have to face the realities of all the terrible things Joel has done. An emotional gut punch to say the least.

I love how both these games leave me feeling so morally conflicted.  So much to think about and consider"
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"I dont see it as a problem to introduce a new faction. Factions arent too important in the game, its implied that there are so many in the world, I would have hated it if the scar or WLF had come back with a vendetta and settled a score in the last hour or so of the game. That's a waste of future resources, the ending was apathetic though, but it did leave room to tell more story which is what I was hoping for."

hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,Forgiveness as a lesson rings hollow when exemplified by a mass murderer
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"Ah yes, forgiveness.   
Don't mind me killing everything beloved to you and then forgive you.

I can see why you see the theme as forgiveness but it falls so flat on it's face that you can easily miss it, they didn't do anything new to a theme that has been done a million times that it just comes out as bland and uninteresting."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"No one ever thought Joel was a saint, especially himself. That doesn’t mean his choice at the end of Last of Us 1 is ‘wrong’."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"And that theme is the exact reason the game falls flat.  It's such an overdone theme that to make it worth iterating for the one millionth time, it needed to be better presented than the amateur-level trope show that it was."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"And because of that you throw every review that isn't an 8/10+ in with review bombing and discard any legitimate criticism of the game.

All the time in the world couldn't help you understand the nuances of the situation. You're on your bandwagon and nothing is gonna convince you otherwise."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,"Well most disagree. The story telling was fantastic. Not sticking with the main characters just because its traditional is stupid.  Going along the ride with Abby really showed just how fucked up the people we love are. But we stll love them and root for them.

The questions of morality is just as strong with LoU2 as it is with LoU1. Thats what makes these stories so special."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-28,"Ok, that’s the first valid point I’ve heard about it. Thank you for that."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,To be fair. When you play as Abbie you kill plenty of people with sons and daughters. So what's the difference? We only have to wait for Naughty Dog to make TLOU3 about WLF soldier number 342 to then humanise him and demonise Abbie?
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,And I don't think anyone has a problem with that. People just hate how he died
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"Well if we're talking realistically, no. Since a vaccine for a fungal infection wouldn't be possible. And yes I knew this before matpats video"
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-28,"Well the game both literally figuratively spits on his corpse, so he clearly isn’t beloved to the people behind the game."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-28,"Well, we’ve heard nothing of those other supposed innocents, and they certainly never sough revenge, so it doesn’t have a lot of bearing here.

Sure, they argued with each other. But they still came to decision to kill a girl without asking her if it was okay. Therefore they are not innocent, and their supposed heroism some serious stains on it. If they can decide that Ellie could die, Joel can decide the same for them. They just lost."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-28,"Did you see how much of a stickler he was for patrols to be safe, particularly the ones with Ellie? Also, why are Ellie and Dina and such all tough and hardened after years of comfort, but Joel got soft? Doesn’t add up to me."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"That isn’t a good excuse though. He’s been surviving for 20+ years and there’s no way he’d lose basic survival instincts where one of the biggest ones being, dont trust anybody unless you know for sure you could trust them. He’d have to be an idiot to do that which is what they made him. Also, he could’ve just used a fake name anyway. There’s no reason he should be using his real name. 

If they were going to give Joel a heroic death, that’s fine too. If they were going to make him die a horrible death, that’s fine as well but they shouldn’t somehow make him a huge dumbass for him to die. There is no excuse at all for how they made him die. Most people aren’t even mad that he died. Hell they are fine with it but how he died, how they did his death, was absolutely terrible. Another thing is how they misled people into thinking he had a bigger role in the trailers. I get the idea of misleading people to avoid spoilers but what they did was straight up lie about what the story was about."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,"Is it? So if someone dislikes it or has a different opinion than you, then “you just don’t get it?” Fuck all that. I got it, it’s trash."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-28,"They edited the ending surgeon scene, and seem to be ignoring the original depiction of the Fireflies. I know what retcon means."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"No, it’s not. They wrote a really shitty story and I had no desire to continue playing it. If your game is so bad that people walk away from it two hours in, something is wrong that that story."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,"Great insight, thanks."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"I don't see in that way at all, it feels like she lost all connection to Joel while caring form him.  
No one would like to forget about someone you care about and how Ellie was crying fro him shows that she cares deeply about him.

But no at the end she leaves everything that remind her of Joel and I feel that she lost something so deep that she can't get back anymore."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,">!I think you nailed the point with some critics I have with the game. You, as a player, are making your own assumptions about the ending and how the characters feels, it's ambiguous bc that's what they wanted you to feel, that's why the promise of Ellie's character arc it's at the end, it's for subvert your expectations and give you a lot of questions for you to answer. There's no real answer bc they don't explore the answers within the characters. They give you the answer for the argument ""what is the prize of revenge?"" and ultimetly ""revenge is bad, it costs everything"", a story told over and over again. Imo, TLoU it's not about the plot, it's a about the characters, but tone, argument and themes are the protagonist of this game by a lot. You can say ""Abby's story it's like the first TLoU"", yes, but she's being use as a mirror of what Ellie and Joel went through in the first game, she's (as well as Joel) a device to make you feel things wich also the game does a lot. Even Dina is used, she's only there for Ellie to go back and later, to show that Ellie lost everything, she's nothing of a character beside that.!<"
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"considering that the seraphites were built up for like 10 hours of gameplay, and this new faction had like...2 hours maximum, it felt rushed as hell to me. felt very much like the  creators were writing themselves out of a hole in order to make sure abby and ellie would run into eachother."

hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-28,And the lesson of the game only really applies to one of the characters. Ellie lost everything. Abbie didn’t. But who was the one who actually got their revenge? I thought the lesson was the pursuing revenge was a bad thing? It really only seemed to serve to clear Abby’s mind and direct her toward her life’s old purpose: the Fireflies. Ultimately Abby is rewarded by this narrative and Ellie is just punished endlessly.
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,I don’t think Ellie actually ever forgave Abby. I think she saw Joel in her since she was only focused on saving Lev. Ellie didn’t forgive her she just didn’t kill her

hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-29,"I definitely think that the game wanted to make a point about tribalism and that expands to the players themselves. In-game the survivors have all formed tribes that see themselves as in the right and others as wrong. Because of the time we've spent with Joel and Ellie and our attachment to them we're basically part of their tribe. We excuse or justify actions of theirs that we condemn other characters for. Once we got the reveal of who Abby's dad is everything clicked for me. Ellie wants the exact same thing that Abby wanted. How can we root for Ellie and at the same time condemn Abby.

I don't think the game wants us to hate Joel and Ellie for what they've done. We understand and empathize with them. It wants us to understand and empathize with what Abby went through. I think Ellie's decision at the end was meant to honor Joel's decision in the first game. Ellie wanted to forgive Joel for what he did. Joel risked everything and put a giant target on his back so that Ellie could live and have a good life. He knew that there would be people like Abby that would want to come after him. I honestly think that if Joel knew who Abby was and why she wanted him dead he would have respected it. He wouldn't have wanted to die but he would understand. He wouldn't have wanted Ellie to sacrifice her humanity to avenge him."

Abbey is WAY more moral than Joel for that reason alone."

They changed the scene when Joel approaches the surgeon, who never delivered a diatribe about all the people a cure would save, he just draws a scalpel. That’s a literal retcon, and they did it to make Joel appear more villainous.

The Fireflies were clearly portrayed in a very grey light in the first game, sure they were some people’s “light in the darkness,” but to many others, they were terrorists. However, in this game there is no implication that the Fireflies were anything but humanities last hope, which Joel squandered. The game never depicted the cure as a surefire thing, in fact the Fireflies pretty much failed at everything they tried to do. No we’re just supposed to accept that they had their shit together?

I think I'm that moment Ellie accepted that she wasn't cut out to live a normal, quiet, peaceful life. If they ever make a part 3 I fully expect it to be about Ellie searching for someone that can finally use her to make a vaccine so she can sacrifice herself like she's always wanted."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"And, correct me if I’m wrong because I’m not heavily into the lore, but wasn’t there a journal entry somewhere in game stating that the cure wouldn’t have worked with Ellie anyhow?"

Then when Ellie and Tommy come back proving her fears correct and try to kill her and all her friends she lets them go again.

In the world of the last of us, with people raping, eating and killing each other to survive Abbey is in fact a very moral person. Of all the factions and main characters in the game who in Abbey or Ellie's position would let the focus of their pain and vengeance live?  

Abbey had one her friends who was pregnant killed by Ellie so obvious the cycle of violence and eye for an eye would want her to even the score, whats more Ellie threatened to kill Liv unless Abbey fought her. Everyone in this world is damaged and angry, Abbey and Ellie are the playable protagonists because they break the cycle of violence.

hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-29,"Dude.. MEMORIES. The doctor death scene is fucking ptsd MEMORIES. Lol how hard is that to understand? Its how Abby and Ellie view the incident through the lens of their trama. The fact the death scene changes everytime we watch ot should have made it clear it was tramatic MEMORY. 

And no, you don't know what retcon means. Adding more scenes about what the fireflies were doing is not retcon! Haha wtf. It doesn't change ANYTHING, it adds more context. We know, from the first game, that the woman the surgeon is talking to, was close to Ellie... you think they never had a conversation about what they were going to do to Ellie? Lol. Of course they're going to discuss the procedure. Of course they're going to have pause, its a human being they're going to kill and there is no guarentee it could work in the first place. (Although, both #1 and #2 implied it actually was guaranteed to work.)

Okay, reading more of your comment... you really didn't get the first game.  The fireflies were not just terrorists. They were trying to save humanity. But like all the other factions in this game-world, did some fucked up shit to survive. No group has their shit together. None. The world these characters live in is brutal and unforgiving. 

I mean come on. That moral dilemma of saving humanity vs saving Ellie WAS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE ENDING OF THE FIRST GAME. That moral conflict is why people still talk about #1 to this day.  That ""what if"" is what makes the ending of #1 embedded into so many people's minds. 

You're arguments are ridiculous and show both games have clearly went over your head. Not liking it is fine, but dude you dont even understand whats happening in them."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-28,"The game at that point isn't really about the faction you're fighting. Ellie is there for one person, the Rattlers are merely obstacles and her dialogue in this section pretty clearly indicates that."

Everyone keeps saying that Ellie killed a pregnant woman but think about it, where did she come from?  
She came all the way from Seattle to find Joel, why? Shes pregnant for Christ's sake.  
And then we see her in Abby side of the story walking about like a bloated balloon, impinging, claiming and  engage  in dangerous combat while pregnant.  
How should we thing about her getting killed?

it makes no sense while Dina who is also pregnant is so weak after a while and barely can fight back.  


Mostly she never left them alive as other person in the group didn't want them to kill him, she just supported him.  
That can make her more moral but in this world where survival is top priority  so morality is the most less important thing."

Joel has killed so many people that he should’ve known by now that it would be too dangerous to use his real name anyway.

https://youtu.be/A9at4zEWhCQ

Considering how Joel almost got killed in this encounter and had his name slip I'm guessing you'd have an issue with this. Of course not bc you're looking at the first game with rose tinted glasses.

The game world is completely built. You didn't pay attention to the first game. His whole redemption ark changes him.

Would old Joel have a home? Have a library in a home? Have a city to live in where you don't have military scanning you to be infected and shoot you on sight? Have a workshop dedicated to playing guitar and fixing them up? Go searching for a museum to make a kids birthday special? Think about his daughter? Find a tape of the Apollo mission to play? Take people/strangers in to their community?

You completely turned your head away conveniently to all these changes. Changes that occurred for 4 years. It's not bad writing, it's bad comprehension on your part."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"It does change why:

1) The hospital was 4+ years ago  

2) He gave him name to Sam and Henry who said they were part of a larger group, Joel continued to work with them too. Also keep in mind they first attacked Joel and Ellie too. So even in Part 1 Joel would work with and trust strangers part of a larger group.

3) Abbys group saved them from infected, any reasonable person would assume this group of people were not hostile. Leaving Joel and Tommy to die by the infected is a pretty easy opportunity to off them. 

4) And again Joel post Jackson is much more trusting he traded coffee with strangers, they go out of there way to help Abbey, Jackson even has a ""identify yourself before entering"" not a ""will shoot on sight"" sign.  

Part 1 and 2 show Joel and Tommy trusting Abby is consistent with them as characters based on how they met and their past actions and where they were at that point in their lives."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"No community should know his name at all if he knows that he’s going to be wanted after what he did getting Ellie back.

hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,And nothing of substance to rebuttal the evidence of how the game gives you all this information. It's not an opinion when it's laid out in the game.
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,"You can dislike the writing or the story, but saying it dosent make sense is not a valid point. Saying ""Oh Joel would never trust a random group of people"" when he did it in part 1 does not make sense. 

You can dislike Abbey, the way they killed off Joel or whatever you like. But the story makes sense and has themes to it, if you want a story you have control over pick one where the player has different branches they get to choose. But most people who are going into Part 2 know the story is written in stone. 

Boycott the game and leave 500 negative reviews, but its already outsold God of War and Spiderman and has one of the highest ratings of this gen of all time. Again you are allowed to say this game is bad, just like any of the people who shit on the new God of War for having a different style of game and story."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"I can say more but considering the fact that you’re trying to personally attack me for an OPINION on a video game, I’d rather not waste time with you."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,"A lot of what you said was absolute BS like using high ratings. The fact that you think that’s credible shows how little you understand or can’t accept why people don’t like the game. That includes you using the “Joel trusted people in part 1” argument. Outselling the other games doesn’t make the game any better at all and a lot of people who did buy it hated it too. Even apart from you calling someone an idiot for disliking a game or having a different opinion from it, the arguments you’re trying to make aren’t even good either. 

I could on about how very wrong the first sentence you said is."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,I can see you've folded in your argument and claiming a victim complex. The points still stand.
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,"I am not hearing any actual counter arguments from you or examples... 

You are right sales and reviews dont necessarily make a game good. But you cant say there is no relationship between the game outselling every other exclusive game on the PS4 and getting higher ratting makes it bad. Short of Cyberpunk this is the game to beat for game of the year.  

My arguments are plenty good, you say Joel would never trust with a group of strangers he just met, I point out a time he did exactly that. And you reply with.....""No thats BS"". 

Its like Dunkys review of the game says you hate the plot but cant give a reason for it. You just say the story makes no sense but cant give me any examples of what does not make sense for you. 

Go play a game where you can make up your own story instead of trying to justify why Part 2 is bad on a thread about how the game has a interesting story."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-26,"No, I just rather not argue with someone that’s offended over my opinion."
hg515o,2020-06-26,2020-06-27,"I said I could say more, as in actual counter arguments but as I’ve said multiple times, I’m not wasting any more time with you used the “oh you just don’t understand or didn’t play the game” argument. What I’ve seen from you is all I needed to see. The exact arguments people use and how they attack anyone who don’t like the game. If you like the game, fine. I was never trying to force anybody to hate the game despite how it seems like you’re trying to force my opinion to change. It’s not going to happen.  I could tell you’re going to say more “counter arguments” or other things but I’m not going to say anymore things."

16t0m4f,2023-09-26,2023-09-27,"I don't care that it was woke. I just didnt like how depressing it was.  It's a good game, I just didn't enjoy it for the story.  The first game wasn't exactly cheery, but still had a good relationship between the characters that kept you interested in it.  2 was just watching people take turns being hateful."

Games that people dislike but i like?  
MK deception - i like the ideas of 3d era of mk, but was not well made in terms of gameplay, at least the konquest mode was great in terms of story.  
Final Fight Streetwise - it was a Capcom idea of try find a new to the franchise that did not work.  
Persona 1 - have a outdated dugeon crawling gameplay in first person, then is complicate to walk."

The only people who hate it are weirdo incels with nothing better to do than complain about a game no one is forcing them to buy, play or enjoy. If they had legitimate complaints it would be one thing, but they're literally mad you play half the game as a female character who could beat them all to death with her bare hands and that there's a trans character portrayed in a positive light."
16t0m4f,2023-09-26,2023-09-27,"People just complain about the fact that Ellie didn’t kill Abby. The point was that by the time she was able to kill Abby, she already coped with Joel’s death.

16t0m4f,2023-09-26,2023-09-27,"Extremely popular, successful and well received and if you think otherwise that says more about your echo chamber than the game."
16t0m4f,2023-09-26,2023-09-27,Because it's mostly cutscenes.
16t0m4f,2023-09-26,2023-09-27,That's because it was almost three times longer than 1.
16t0m4f,2023-09-26,2023-09-27,"I liked it, but I think the game could have been significantly better if it was structured differently.

16t0m4f,2023-09-26,2023-09-27,"I can't think of any other game that has you play as the antagonist, at least not for a significant portion of the game. I think a large portion of the hate came from two things:

A) playing as a character you're supposed to hate
B) this character was a physically strong woman, and her section has you protecting a trans character.

If someone doesn't like the game because of reason A, it's halfway understandable. I liked it because it was such a diversion from traditional video game storytelling and really lent to the theme of the game, which from my point of view was that revenge is a matter of perspective, it's a lot harder to decide who is good/bad or wrong/right when you're looking at the whole picture. 

If someone doesn't like the game because of reason B, then they need to reevaluate their world view and maybe realize nobody is holding them down and forcing them to play games with themes they don't agree with."

I don't think someone out for revenge for a whole game of murder should even have the option to spare the person at the end. Like... Why?"
16t0m4f,2023-09-26,2023-09-26,Lol what a statement. I don't like it because the story is dumb and the action limited.
16t0m4f,2023-09-26,2023-09-27,The controversy was made up by it's fan. People here are not even mentioning that stuff most complaints are valid(eg the story was written by a teenager)

Most people are just too attached to Joel and Ellie (more understandable with Ellie I guess) and no offence but video game players aren't really open to change or to having a story go a way they don't like, if they go the same way with the tv show I'm sure it'll get a much better reception"
16t0m4f,2023-09-26,2023-09-26,Depends entirely on the reasoning given.

It's really not that hard."
16t0m4f,2023-09-26,2023-09-26,"Because that was the point of the story, violence begets violence. And Ellie realized that"

It was interesting to see the other side of the conflict and realize they weren't necessarily evil, they were just trying to survive like everyone else. The saying ""if you set out for revenge, dig two graves"" is fitting. Abby got revenge on the man who killed her father, but his ""daughter"" got revenge herself and killed dozens more of Abby's friends and adopted family.

But you can't refuse that the writters of the game got some back lash for how they tried to over ""*woke*"" the story and how the story was approached in general. There were some people that thought the game was intentionally made to make you hate parts of it.  


And i feel like i should note that i'm not personally against the game. I can see how the writting could make people mad. But i personally never played part 2 but really enjoyed the first one. And because of that i can see how some people would be mad about the play out for some characters. As it is a game that takes you on a journey with the characters and you get to like them or dislike them through out the game. Which to me is good writting. Bad writting is when you aren't interested anymore. But i can understand peoples frustration and still acknowledge good writting."

It's been 4 years of Joel being in a civilized civilization that's not oppressive. He is not the same person he is at the end of part 1. Also on top of that they were just saved by the friends of the girl that they just saved, they have no reason to believe they are in danger.

Quit being obtuse and think outside of what you know. Joel and Tommy doesn't know Abby is looking for someone in the camp, we do. For all they know they were just helped out by a group of people that are ""just passing through"""
16t0m4f,2023-09-26,2023-09-27,"Yeah, they're pretty much the same person, if anything Abby is the one people should sympathise with more, it's just that we were introduced to Ellie first.

16t0m4f,2023-09-26,2023-09-26,">So why make Ellie go for revenge 3 times in the game?

Because it's about revenge as a cycle that's potentially never ending and all consuming.

>why the blonde girl's revenge is okay to be shown but not Ellie's?

Because it allows for contrast which furthers the point and the thematic.

>treat Joel like a disposable secondary character?

Because he wasn't, he met the only end he could have met for two reasons

1. It's just basic media literacy that yes, the selfish bastard gets punished for his actions
2. While TLOU1 is Joel's story, TLOU2 isn't.

It's all just basic media literacy you're expected to have by 16."

16t0m4f,2023-09-26,2023-09-27,"You not liking the story doesn't make the story fucked up.  I liked it quite a bit.

Original comment was still ignorant though.  Not liking something doesn't inherently make somebody a bigot.  That was a weird assertion.  Reasons matter."
16t0m4f,2023-09-26,2023-09-27,"The story wasn’t bad because it was “over woked”, whatever that means, it was bad because of poor pacing, nonexistent character development and it having a very basic revenge is bad storyline that didn’t really challenge you morally in any way like the first game did, it felt like a writer trying to go through the motions, hitting all the beats necessary to produce a morally questionable ending like the first but without any of the actual buildup to those moments. Things just happen for the sake of it. Word to the wise, no offense but whenever someone says they made it woke, 99% of people don’t bother reading past that because they know that your main gripe with the game is there was diversity, that’s all that can be taken from that."
16t0m4f,2023-09-26,2023-09-27,Well that’s why I put it in quotations. No one is really an enemy. It’s just people doing what they have to do. But in the story from our view she is the enemy especially at the beginning when we see what she does.
16t0m4f,2023-09-26,2023-09-27,Oh so meeting strangers in a post apocalyptic world is safe with no worries at all? How about in the show when Joel arrived to Jackson? They took no chances and aimed at him. You have no idea what you’re saying haha

16t0m4f,2023-09-26,2023-09-26,"I don't think it's empathy but media literacy that's lacking in this case.

Like often you'll see people be like ""why is Joel the protagonist of the first game if he isn't the good guy ?"" So clearly they do empathise with Joel but don't get that it's not because you empathise with him that you're supposed to sympathise with his actions"
16t0m4f,2023-09-26,2023-09-27,Do you think that we are feeling anger towards the situation because we are afraid of the painful feelings so compensate by getting angry and dehumanizing instead
16t0m4f,2023-09-26,2023-09-26,"He did get a good death. I mean it was fucking brutal and unexpected, but it made sense in the setting of the world and the characters effected. Shit is brutal. It would be worse if he just lived out his life and died a happy old dad, this is not where his story led, even at the end of the first game. The way that fucking story ends with ""I promise"" and ""ok""

Joel fucked up, and that choice he made set his fate into motion."
16t0m4f,2023-09-26,2023-09-26,">But we play as the blonde girl basically 90% of the game

Does ""thesis, antithesis, synthesis"" ring a bell to you ?

>we play as Ellie that went to look for her, got beaten, then she goes back for her, she lets her free AGAIN and after still wanted to kill her, she looses her fingers

Oh look, it's almost as if that's precisely what I described as revenge as a possibly never ending cycle and all consuming mindset.

>so what was the point of all of that?

Character growth and showing that revenge only brings violence, pain and suffering. Do you even read the stuff you reply to before writing your comments ?

>why we're supposed to feel sorry for her when she did exactly what Ellie did?.

To empathise and to sympathise are two very different things. You're meant to empathise, not necessarily sympathise.

>you cant just completely dispose of the main characters like they're nothing, at the very least, give them a good death

He's had the exact death you could have expected for him. Heck, he's had one of the best death possible in this regard.

You're not ""completely disposing of him like he's nothing"": you're concluding his story like he's exactly what he is: a selfish bastard.

>its not a new story, its a continuation of an already existing one.

A story can be both of these things. In fact most sequels are exactly this. Look at the lord of the rings or marvel movies for instance.

Once again, all this are extremely basic concepts."
16t0m4f,2023-09-26,2023-09-26,"So Ellie's revenge is bad, but the other girl isnt, and at the end Ellie is the one who gets the worst end, gotcha. So how is Joel a selfish bastard because he tried to save Ellie, but the other girls dad trying to kill her without certainty that she was the cure is ""the good guy""? People just idealize what they thought about the game, completely ignoring that it failed in every turn."
16t0m4f,2023-09-26,2023-09-27,">So Ellie's revenge is bad, but the other girl isnt

So you indeed don't read comments before answering to them.

>So how is Joel a selfish bastard because he tried to save Ellie

1. By doing so he more than likely codemn the rest of humanity
2. He don't save Ellie for Ellie's sake but for the wholly selfish reason that he don't want to lose his ""second daughter""
3. He spent his whole time with Ellie teaching her to live strictly **his** way and to basically be a clone of him.

Like Joel got presented with the trolley problem and his solution was to put everyone on the tracks the trolley's going towards.

At this point it's elementary school levels of understanding a story mate.

>the other girls dad trying to kill her without certainty that she was the cure is ""the good guy""?

Who said anything like this ?

>People just idealize what they thought about the game, completely ignoring that it failed in every turn.

You should take a long look into a mirror mate."
16t0m4f,2023-09-26,2023-09-27,"Again, seems like you're the one who doesnt read...The 1st game states that there's no certainity that Ellie is the key to the cure, so they're killing her ""just to see if it works"", just the same selfish mindset, but you're trying to say that Joel is the only bad guy..."
16t0m4f,2023-09-26,2023-09-27,"The difference is that they're killing her because the humanity is on the brink of extinction. If there is even a sliver of chance Ellie's death could prevent that, it's a risk worth taking.  


Even more so, I understand you love Ellie, but she actually is a nobody. Yeah, she's a little child but at the end of the day, there are 100 more little children running around dying to clickers. Why aren't you sympathising with them?  


Furthermore, for all intents and purposes, Ellie died the moment she was bitten. By some miraculous act of God, she had immunity. I'm quite sure she knows that she shouldn't be alive and that she has something the world needs.   


She has a chance to save humanity from her best friend's fate and Joel robs her of that chance. Autonomy is taken away from her and a choice is made for her.  


In the end, the needs of many outweigh the needs of few but Joel decides that his need for a daughter outweighs humanity's need for a cure."
16t0m4f,2023-09-26,2023-09-27,">The 1st game states that there's no certainity that Ellie is the key to the cure

Never said the contrary, but it also states that there's a huge chance that she is.

>they're killing her ""just to see if it works"", just the same selfish mindset, 

Ah yes "" let's kill this person and potentially save the rest of humanity"" is definitely as selfish as ""let's kill loads of people to save a single one"".

I guess you really don't know what the trolley problem is.

>you're trying to say that Joel is the only bad guy...

That's not even close to what I said but whatever pleases you."

b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Hey Ske7ch! Thanks for taking the time to answer some questions! The Reach speedrunning community over at HaloRuns has a few questions for you:

How much has the campaign been touched? Were any glitches fixed like the forklift glitch on Nightfall or trigger skips on Pillar of Autumn? (We hope not)

Will the cutscenes be skippable on Long Night of Solace? The cutscenes were made unskippable for Reach’s demo at E3, but never got made skippable again when the game was released. It’d be awesome for speedrunners to be able to skip the 4 minutes and 18 seconds of cutscenes while speed gaming.

Will the in-game timer for each level be maintained or will it be converted to the same timer at the rest of MCC? The in-game timer (IGT) is how most all individual levels are timed for speedruns. As it stands now, the IGT can not be on if you are running the full game because if the IGT is on, after a level is completed, it will kick you out to the Campaign Menu screen and not automatically move on to the next level. This requires that all full game speedruns be timed by adding up the theater times from each level to get the final full game time. Will this still be the case in MCC Reach?

Will the original Theater system be used for the Reach campaign or will the MCC theater be used?

Wolfy and Pedro were pretty great at ADGQ this year huh? 😁

I obviously don't expect an answer to each of these, so i'm putting them in order of importance from most to  least


- Is there anything being done to account for the fact that, on PC, the differing aim assist and bullet magnetism values used to balance weapons on console will cease to be a factor; and weapons like the sniper rifle, CE magnum, BR etc  will be easier to consistently land shots with due to using a mouse (as is the case in the existing PC ports)? Should we expect PC specific balance tweaks to try to balance it out, like reducing spread on other weapons so mouse precision also benefits them?

- In the Xbox One version of MCC, saved clips and screenshots are routed through the Xbox One's internal capture tools rather, as in the original 360 releases of 3, ODST, Reach, and 4, the clips being saved as re-openable files in theater, and the screenshots being rendered at higher resolutuions then the game normally runs at. How will these function on PC? I would LOVE if we could render out screenshots at any resolution we wanted. 

- If MCC on PC does well, is there any chance we could get more remade multiplayer maps for Halo 2 Anniversary? I'd love to see Headlong, Turf, Gemini, and Containment running in that engine.

b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Most of my questions are regarding Halo Reach as its my favourite Halo and is the first to be released on PC. Sorry if any these have already been answered before.


**1. Progression:** Will Halo Reach's credit/progression system return? Out of all the Halo titles, Reach had the best customisation and progression system IMO. To add onto this, will the daily and weekly credit challenges return?


**2. Customisation:** For armour customisation, will we be able to mix an match armour combinations? Or will it be like the MCC where you have to pick pre-set armour combinations?


**3. PC Options:** Will Reach and the rest of the MCC be playable at higher frame rates than 60fps? Many PC gamers like me have high refresh-rate monitors like 144hrz for example. What is the max FOV you plan on using? I play most FPS games between 80-90.


**4. DLC:** Will Halo Reach and all the Halo titles receive all the DLC maps that were released for them? Would this include the Halo CE Anniversary MP and firefight maps too for Reach? The Russian Halo Online included new maps not seen in any Halo game. Do you plan to included these maps? If you are which game would they be added to?


**6. Firefight:** Halo Anniversary edition includes a firefight map called Installation 04 for Halo Reach. This was the only firefight map in Reach to provide AI support in the form of Pelicans dropping off ODST's, Marines and Warthogs for support. Would it be possible to carry this feature over to the other firefight maps in Reach for PC and Xbox? Will you eventually add Halo 3: ODST firefight gamemode at a later date? Will firefight include matchmaking for Reach and ODST if you add it? 


**7. Campaign:** Would it be possible to play all the Halo campaigns with 4 players total or will some be limited to 2 players only? Would matchmaking be possible for the campaign too?


**8. Forge/Custom Games:** Will we be able to download and play on PC and Xbox one Halo forge maps created by the Halo community when the games originally released on the Xbox 360?


**9. Split-Screen:** Will split-screen be added to the PC version of the MCC?


**10. Cross-play:** Not so much a question, more of a suggestion regarding cross-play between Xbox and PC. If cross play is technically possible I would recommend that it be enable by default. If players do not want to play with the other platforms make a option to opt out, so that they only play against players on their platform. This will create a healthy player base as there are more Halo players to play with. I would only limit this to competitive play to make sure there is an even playing field.


Thank you for doing this AMA, I understand if you can't answer any of my questions yet, as I'm sure your still not sure if all of this will be possible. I'm sure there are a lot of engine limitations you may not be able to get around without rewriting a ton of code. Please take your time to make sure this is the best port possible. And thank you for bringing the Halo franchise to PC I can't wait to test it and get back to playing one of my favourite game series of all time.

and/or the multiplayer announcer?

1. Is splitscreen planned to come to PC
2. Since the insider quiz survey asked about the inputs, and included stuff like Playstation controller and Steam Controller, is there a plan to have native steam input support? It would be nice since it allows for sharing control profiles and can be used different controls each game
3. Are the Reach Armors going to be like the rest of MCC armors, i.e. Only sets, or is there going to be customization to the level of old Reach?"

b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Hello! First, thanks for this AMA and bringing Reach and Halo back to Xbox One and PC in a way it's never been presented before, Reach is what got me into Halo, so I was personally excited so see the news.

Now on to my question, what can we expect in terms of armor customization? I know that in the current MCC, armor customization for all games is diminished to selecting from pre-made sets, but in my opinion, armor customization in Reach is too important, as it was the best the series had ever been, and important to making Noble 6 feel like your spartan. 

Adding on to this, if armor customization is huge technical hurdle to implement into the MCC, or even an impossibility, could you tell us this here or possibly in a blog post for closure?

Thank you!

b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,Have you thought about Steam Workshop integration into Forge for Reach?

I had a question about mod support and steam workshop support.

Will we be able to mod our game?

My question is, what was the reaction from content creators when you told them about MCC PC six months ago (a very hard secret to keep)? And what was it like getting their feedback on the upcoming PC release? Thanks again. "

What of the unlockables via achievements such as the Vidmaster Challenges between Halo 3 and ODST?

Will the Katana for the Hayabusa set be obtainable via achievements as it was?"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Hello,  thanks for holding this AMA. Is Splitscreen considered for the PC release? Even if it isn't popular on the platform, don't underestimate its power! I would love to plug in a few controllers and play with my buddies without them having to take their PC over to my place or vice versa. I think having dynamic graphics settings would work well with this aswell(so maybe lower a few settings if 2 player is enabled, and lower some more if 3-4 players are a thing). Besides that, considering PCs can have multiple screens, splitscreen would be amazing due to being able to give each player their own individual screen(assuming the screens are the same resoltion etc.) 

I haven't seen ""local multiplayer"" or ""local co-op"" on the steam page which has me concerned. "
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"I'll make mine short and sweet:

~~1. Will we see centered crosshair options outside of Halo CE?~~

2. Will our gun viewmodels be able to be customized? (aka, where are guns are located in first-person.)

That's it! Thanks for the AMA!! Much love from a long time Halo fan. 

❤️

Edit: 1st question is already answered elsewhere~ Basically, they've heard the concern, and are looking into it :)"

b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Question regarding Halo: Reach Armor

&#x200B;

What is happening regarding Halo: Reach armor/ customization/ rank? 

\- First will we see the brilliant ranking system/ credit system in the original game

\- Secondly, Specifically in PVP Multiplayer will we be able to customize the spartan (as in the original game), if so will all the original armor and effects be available/ will all armor be locked for players in Multiplayer? Will we be able to earn the armor as in original game (assume not if no ranking system), or will it potentially be all unlocked for all players? Definitely not a groundbreaking question, but part of what I loved (and I'm sure many others) about Reach was the amazing armor customization. A summary of what's happening regarding Armor customization for both the Multiplayer side/ Campaign would be great! "
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Hi! First, just wanted to say that I appreciate the hard work and dedication to better not only the MCC, but the Halo brand as a whole. You are all giving off a completely new vibe that has been exciting and encouraging to watch over the past year or so.

I have a few questions that i hope you can answer.

~~1) I'm sure this will be a popular one, but are there any plans/progress on a universal EXP based progression system across all titles? If so, is this something we can expect by the time the PC version of Reach has been flighted and given the green light to ship~~ 

2) Any plans on adding a pregame lobby ala 2, 3, and Reach where we can see the map/gametype while loading instead of the current loading screen? This would also allow players to talk (or mute) each other before a match as well. I get that doding might be a concern, but people still do this while on the current loading screen anyway.

3) In the PC development process, are your teams putting any focus on correcting any inconsistencies between the OG Xbox versions and MCC versions of these titles? (ie. Classic Halo CE sounds, hit regestration in older titles, etc). If any are corrected, would these changes be made to the Xbox version?

Thank you so much for taking the time and I can't wait to see Halo continue to grow and develop!"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19, Is there anything new that can be shared regarding the progression system the team was looking into adding? 
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"You'll probably get asked this a lot, but will centered crosshairs be an option? 

I ask because a very large majority of fps games on PC use a centered crosshair (I can only think of one game outside of the Halo franchise that uses a lowered crosshair) and that's what I've built muscle memory for and thus is what I am most comfortable with."
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,Any other new features coming to MCC in the future you can talk about?
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,Hi 343! i was wondering what the min and max system requirements for the MCC on pc will be! thanks!

b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Is there any plan for releasing a roadmap of sorts to the community, so that we can see when to expect certain release windows and/or updates?"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Since Reach is being added to MCC will the limit of only 50 custom maps and 50 gametypes be increased as well? If not just curious as to what made this limit be put in place and why it is very small compared to the limit in other games like Reach, 4, and 5?"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"With the idea of cross-platform play causing somewhat of a divide in the Matchmaking community, would the team be open to exploring some kind of “opt-in” feature for Matchmaking? I don’t see why cross-platform play shouldn’t exist for cooperative modes like Campaign, Firefight, Spartan Ops, and Forge, but I can understand people’s concerns about potentially unfair online multiplayer matches. I believe an “opt-in” feature would alleviate these concerns."
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"On the Halo MCC FAQ, It is mentioned that all amours will be unlocked.

Is this confirmation that the progression system that was in Halo Reach will be omitted from the game? 

Or is this something you guys will look into implementing? 
"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Halo games with the excetion of 5 and CE have always had a non-centered crosshair. Playing on a couch isn’t unconfortable but playing on a monitos up close it can quickly become bothersome and at times nauseating. Are there any plans for an option to toggle between centered and non-centered crosshair in the PC version of the game? 

Cheers."

Thanks for taking the time to address the community about Reach and MCC on PC. It seems many people are excited about the Master Chief's return to PC after being absent for more than a decade!

b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"File share was a critical part of the Halo Reach ecosystem. Can we expect to see Halo Reach in MCC have file share support, and if it does support file sharing, is there a chance for files to be transferred between PC/Xbox one (maybe, but not expecting, between even 360)?


Halo Anniversary used a different game type to normal Reach multiplayer. Will the Halo CE Anniversary be a selectable separate  gamemode?

Will the Multiplayer on Reach on MCC be Title Updated Reach, or Classic Reach?

It's what got me into game development. I know there are many in 343i right now with the same story. It has been 15 years and I still regularly talk to people I met while making maps for Halo 1.

- will the DLC helmet that you guys teased with all the dlc maps be included in this new release? There was mini dolls with that helmet hidden in all the maps but I don't think it was ever obtainable.


- will we see gamma/contrast/saturation sliders be implemented into the game, like overwatch? It's a small feature but it goes a long way in helping taylor the games to your own preference


- this last one is incredibly minor but would be cool, will spartans go back to being green for the invasion game mode? It felt really bad ass and almost like the fights were cannon seeing green spartans vs blue elites

b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,This is an awesome AMA! Quick question: Is there any work being done with Steam to make this proton-compatible? 
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,Is there any plan to release the MCC & Reach on Linux? Or baring an outright release to Linux support for Proton via steam to enable players to use an OS other than windows?
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,Will we get original title screens?
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Will we get Audio Sliders for background music, SFX and Voices? I remember some parts of the MCC, where I would have loved to be able to increase the volume of character dialogue."
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,You mentioned you will sell the MCC both as single games and as a bundle on pc. Will the cost of the bundle be the same as all the single games put together? 
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Any plans to bring Halo 4's DLC armor into the game? And what about the numerous skins and the DLC armor mods?

And if yes, can we potentially seen any of those usable in Spartan Ops?"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Someone asked you whether or not we can buy the whole package all at once, and you answered this:

> Both - It's the players choice if they'd like to purchase each of the games within MCC one-by-one as they release or wait and pick them all up at the end. 

Does this mean that we can't buy the whole thing as soon as Reach is released, sorta like a preorder or a Season Pass? The option to buy games separately is nice, but having to wait until the last game is released to be able to buy the whole package is weird.

&#x200B;"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Not a PC related question, but could we see the end credits reinstated at the end of each campaign at some point? Not hearing the fantastic end credits music in Halo 3 in between the ending and post-credits scene feels wrong. Thanks for everything!"

1. Will there be any expanded graphical options for PC?

b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"How the hell is it possible, the game was created by Microsoft yet never released on PC? I mean I know majority if not all games are made or programmed on PC then ported to a console , but was it because the PC tech wasn't there back in the day?"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,How do you handle to plan graphic changes in halo 2 ani? A console is a piece of hardware you can lock but pc frame rates are constantly fluctuations. Are people with poorer systems going to crash when they switch? I have a very nice pc so it’s not a concern for me but I’m just wondering how you do it engine wise 
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,Will i be able to buy all of the MCC on steam and get all the games as they come out or do i have to buy each one individually or wait until their all out?

Also what was the most challenging part getting Reach into MCC considering that Reach is an Xbox 360 game (architecture-wise, game framework, art-work, licenses, etc.)."
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,Will the PC version have proper raw input? One of the issues I had with the Halo 5 Forge port to PC was that the mouse had strange acceleration and just felt off

b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-20,"I use the ""Hell Jumper"" control scheme in Halo 5. Could you add that to MCC please? I want to play it, but using different controls is too jarring. I'm guessing it's not there because it uses the left trigger to zoom, but one of the older games has dual-wield? I'd happily just not play whatever game that is, or be at a disadvantage dual-wielding with the trigger on a weird button. "

b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-20," Can someone help me understand what this “flighting” thing is? I don’t get it at all. 

Edit: Thank you for the replies and informing me. I don't know when the change to ""flighting"" was or what prompted it though. Why not just say beta or ""feedback program"" (is that fair to even call it that?)"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-20,"Don't get me wrong, I've been a huge Halo fan from the beginning and I am beyond excited that this franchise is finally returning to PC. I just can't help but wonder why this was announced seemingly early, with no release date to share and with the news that we won't even be getting all of our favorites at once, on top of that we have to pay for them individually. Answer me this, is it at all likely we will see the completion of this collection PC before the release of Halo Infinite? It'd be truly puzzling if not."
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-20,Has nobody has asked when development began? When discussions began about bringing it over to PC? I'm really curious as to when 343 decided to go ahead and bless the world with this port.
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-20,Will buying the entire collection once they are all out cost more or less than buying each individually as they release?
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-21,"My concern is just pricing at this point, whether or not we'll get the MCC for the same $55 it went for on Xbox One of if MS will try to make PC users cough up more.  
I love Halo, but I've already bought all the games a couple of times already on other devices. As much as I am glad to see it return to PC, I'll be even more glad if it is priced appropriately."
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-21,I have been reading the for the last 20 minutes and i cant see anything about current progress within thr rank system. When Reach is re-released will previous players have there rank and custome spartan the same as we have left it or will we all have to start again? Also what about DLC is ot going to be included in the remaster or will we have to download it again from previous purchases or will we have to purchase the DLC again. Thabk you for taking your time to amswer our question. 
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-04-17,"DO NOT ADD A SYSTEM WHERE PLAYERS NEED TO EARN THEIR ARMOR PIECES!! It's pointless to have a system all of a sudden when you could've done it in the first place but instead, you allowed players to have full access to every armor set for Halo 2 Anniversary, Halo 3, and Halo 4! Just because the original Halo Reach had a system, doesn't mean you have to tag it along with Halo Reach for MCC. Allow every armor piece to be free, just like the armor sets for the previous Halo games in MCC!
And the modding BS. Keep that OUT! Players had enough of it in the original Halo Reach. We don't need players to be flying around and noclipping and all of their nonsense. If you decide to add it, keep it out of Custom Games for Halo Reach!"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-07-02,What is the ETA for Reach. As well as the eta for the whole collection.
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,when will early access be?
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"There's a lot we all want from this release and it's a very long time coming. I'm not seeing a lot of talk about certain things though. Assuming it's not the run of the mill console port, and it sounds like it's a seperate engine. Would that automatically rule out crossplay? It seems like PC players are going to have a huge advantage in that case. I have so many concerns about us PC players being able to lower or flat out remove shadows/textures, or manipulate resolutions to have an unfair advantage.

If it's a new engine, will that allow an uncapped framerate?

How will anti-cheat work? 

Will button ""combo's"" in H2 be taken out?

Will we be getting a server browser or the ordinary playlists? In either case please bring back double XP weekends in the style that Bungie had back in H3. It's one of the few things that was actually able to unite the ranked and social communities. 

Will the BR spread in H2 and H3 be tightened to make up for the lack (hopefully) of the bullet magnetism? 

Are controller players on PC going to have aim assist?

File browser? If yes, can we get a weekly community top picks list for maps, gametypes, screenshots, ect.?

Potential for a standalone Forge (for free pls)? 

Can we expect a pre-load? It sucks for us who have terrible internet and have to wait a day or two to play. Especially one I've been wanting for 15 years now.

Please tell me we'll get a theater mode with the ability to set paths and the ability to save raw saved gameplay from it. Halo needs a strong community pressence and allowing us the ability to share our content (montages, machinima, anything!) is going to keep this project alive.

Can we expect a spectator mode? I can't wait for competitive Halo to make its way back to the spotlight and we shouldn't have to deal with multiple capture cards for split POV anymore. 

Weekly challanges like Reach had? Can we get a progression system like Reach along with playlist XP and the normal 1-50 rankings?

I have a thousand more questions and things I think should/needs to be included, but the main take-a-way is this. Give the community what we need to keep the game alive! Give content creators, modders, and players the tools we need to make the game fun for hours on end. I miss the days when I could wake up play Halo and not realize I spent my whole day laughing and having fun with friends. Please don't just focus on the competitive side (which I desperately want)! Give us community involvement. I still remember thehaloforum holding montage contests. Bring stuff like that back and tie placings into our profiles with emblems or armour sets. 
"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Are there plans for a file browser for MCC, whether in-game or on Waypoint? Right now there's not really an easy way to find Forge maps; you have to go directly to people's profiles and download them."
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Hi team at 343! Thank you for this AMA!

b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Question regarding Halo: Reach Armor

&#x200B;

What is happening regarding Halo: Reach armor/ customization/ rank? 

\- First will we see the brilliant ranking system/ credit system in the original game

\- Specifically, in PVP Multiplayer will we be able to customize the spartan (as in the original game), if so will all the original armor and effects be available/ will all armor be locked for players in Multiplayer? Will we be able to earn the armor as in original game (assume not if no ranking system), or will it potentially be all unlocked for all players? Definitely not a groundbreaking question, but part of what I loved (and I'm sure many others) about Reach was the amazing armor customization. A summary of what's happening regarding Armor customization for both the Multiplayer side/ Campaign would be great! "
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Hey u/ske7ch343! Without naming names (unless you’re allowed to), can you confirm if any 'grizzled ancients' are returning to work on Halo at 343?"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,[deleted]
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"  

Will Halo Reach have one of its most defining features, full Armour Customization?

A huge part of Halo Reach's appeal to customers was the wide range of customization. Not only was this constructive in

people being immersed into the Multiplayer and Campaign with their own ""Personality"" or ""Avatar"", but also created a lot of opportunity

for unique characters in fan made creations like Halo Machinima. So a massive need many members of the community have is for

traditional armour customization, be it a 2D image of what the armour piece looks like, or a full 3D render. There may even

be a need to export the meshes from Reach and import them to a new armour preview in the customization screen of the MCC.

This could be extended into Halo 3 and 4 down the road."

Are there any plans to add more maps to Halo 2 Anniversary for the PC release of H2A in the MCC? I seem to recall you talking about this potentially happening before. I find H2A multiplayer very fun but it could do with some more variety.

&#x200B;

As you added Halo CE (PC) and Halo 2 Vista maps to the MCC, are there any plans to bring in Saber Interactive's maps from the Halo Online project for Halo 3? I'd love to see Icebox (remake of Turf for those that don't know) and Reactor being played instead of going to waste.

Once you have Reach up and running the way you have in mind, do you expect the process for the others games to be easier/faster?

Thinking of small things like moving the reticule to a more central position on the screen and providing graphics options such as anti-aliasing settings, along with potentially bigger features such as the ability to host private dedicated servers and - perhaps the biggest - some form of integrated mod support.

b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Customization is a key part of player identity and Reach’s player customization is far and away the best and most expansive in the series. In MCC’s current state, player’s armor is restricted to selecting a set. They are unable to mix and match pieces, which would come as the biggest detriment to Reach. Simply put, changing it so that way players can equip any armor pieces through the games that support armors would go a long way.

My question is,  has there been any discussion of creating any new h2a maps? It's my favorite playlist on mcc and could really use more maps"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"This is pretty cool!

1. Can we expect crossplay, at least for everything but ranked matchmaking? This is what me and my friends have looked forward to the most!

2. With Reach's customization being one of its most defining traits over the years is there are plans for full customization and a use of the credit system (even if reformatted to make it a bit less of a grind) for Reach itself? Any plans to retroactively add full customization to games that had it like Halo 3 and 4?"

It seems strange to me that halo 4 doesn't have a single ranked playlist and the classic feel of legendary Slayer would definitely feel more at home with the rest of the ranked playlists.

b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Hey guys, got a small handful of questions, understand if you can't answer them all, but we appreciate any answers you got.

Assuming the MCC performs well on PC, and with Infinite being confirmed to be coming on PC, is porting over Halo 5 a plan as well, so the entire collection will be available?

I understand you can't talk release dates and are loathe to give hard estimates lest you be held to those estimates, but ballpark, about how long do you expect each game to take to roll out?

Will we have to buy each title, or will there be a one time purchase option?

I own a copy of MCC on Xbox One, and I heard the comments you guys made regarding Play Anywhere on the PC version. I was just wondering what the logistics are regarding this, moreso what you guys would be considering as alternatives for those who already own it? I'd be happy to receive a discount for the PC version as I own a digital Xbox copy, I don't want to be given something like an exclusive emblem or something little like that, I'd just like something that would be a much bigger way of appreciating players like myself. 

TLDR pls make it play anywhere or if not pls give me a discount for having a digital copy

Thanks again for doing this! "

First of all I just wanted to say thank you to Microsoft, 343, Splash Damage, Ruffian, Steam, and anybody that's working on making this dream a reality. As a PC player I miss the Halo series so much and I'm excited to play these masterpieces with my buds.

Now on to my question. As I'm sure you guys know, the reason we PC players love steam so much is the amount of features and flexibility it has. I was curious how many of those features will you guys take advantage of? Will MCC on PC have steam achievements? Trading cards? Will I be able to invite my steam friends to lobbies and games from the steam overlay? Is steam workshop integration with forge and other modes a possibility? I'm sure the focus is on making sure the games run well on PC but those features would just push it over the top for me and a lot of other players.

Thanks!!! Can't wait to begin flighting soon! Good luck with everything!"

b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Hi guys, thanks for this great opportunity! 3 questions I think we are all wondering about:

1. How are you planning on breaking the 60fps cap?
As we all know the engine is based on fps, and currently works with 60fps and 30fps respectively.
Seeing trends in other PC releases, as well as H5 Forge PC, 60 fps maximum is an absolute dealbreaker for most consumers, especially those who invest heavily in machines that run in the 200-300fps range along with 120Hz + monitors.

2. What kind of mouse movement can we expect from this? Is it going to be among the likes of counterstrike, which is known for the perfect mouse-to-game translation? What standards and goals are you setting for yourselves here?

3. Knowing that a fully customizable armory live preview like in the 360 games is very difficult to cram into the menu, how will you guys tackle armor customization?

Would a selectable picture list of every part be an option? How about progress through the unlocks, will there be any?

Have a nice day!"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"What should we expect for FOV and viewmodels? Can we expect 120 FOV or will we more than likely see lower and is there talks about modifying the view models since in some games like Halo 3, the weapon models are fairly large and would take up a lot of the screen. "
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,Hello friends thank you for doing this AMA I was wondering if all my achievements will transfer over seeing how a Xbox live account is needed to play and will I be able to use my blue flames in reach?
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Hi Guys, big thanks for coming on and taking some questions.

&#x200B;

My main question is around cross platform play. What's your thoughts on a cross platform searching system similar to fortnite where you can have matchmaking preferances between playing against players with controllers, KB&M or both.

Is this something you guys are looking to bring to MCC and beyond with Infinite with the release on PC? Cheers"

&#x200B;

First of all I want to thank you for bringing us that masterpiece in all its glory to PCs. 

Second of all thanks for doing an AMA for your community.

&#x200B;

So my question is if we are getting steam achievements ?

MCC is a paradise for achievement hunters.

Steam is my preffered platform where I hunt for them so I would love to get them all on it.

b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"In the MCC October Update on Halo Waypoint, Sean Cooper said that he was ""on the same page"" as the people working on the Halo CE Refined project, whose mission is to correct numerous mismatches between the original console version of Halo 1 and the 2003 PC version which has been the basis of every Halo 1 port since, including MCC. He also said he wanted to ""work out the kinks that make MCC’s Halo 1 maps and levels not match the classic version"", and that he was ""in the investigation process of this work"".

How is the work going, and how much is going to be fixed? I personally want to see the visual effects fixed the most, followed by the multiplayer map geometry."
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Can we except some of the features coming with the PC version, such as the FOV slider, come to Xbox as well?"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Without console to pc cross-play being a current priority I see this news as a bit of a disappointment for those of us who play MCC on the console since the player-base population won't likely be growing; in fact, it could potentially shrink if current players actively shift over to PC. You mentioned that console-pc cross-play is something the team would like to do in the future (if possible) and based on the community's feedback, but in my opinion it shouldn't be a questionable goal. It should be the primary goal in order to grow the population base across the board. And therefore from the get-go questions should be getting scrutinized with regards to cross-play input tools such as controller vs keyboard and mouse.

* Q1: How come prioritizing console-pc cross-play hasn't been the most important goal of this announcement.
* Q2: What are the current ideas/plans regarding managing input controls?

My personal preference would be to have the Ranked environment restricted to Xbox Controller play only. But, this would also mean that the game/system would need to be able to recognize the input tool. In my opinion, players should have to demonstrate their proficiency with the franchise's accepted competitive control setup (the Xbox Controller) within that specific environment, but that's just me.

It's on the Social side where I believe KB+M should be allowed, but perhaps with less, or no, Aim Assistance. This would include Reticle Magnetism (aka sticky aim) as well as body and head Bullet Magnetism (aka bullet bend -- think of the movie Wanted). It would be interesting to see where KB+M player Match-Maker Rankings (MMRs) slot-into the game's skill curve on the social side since it could act as a tool to help adjust the level of the game's Sandbox Aim Assistance in order to find the best balance between the two types of input tools. Perhaps, in custom games the host could be granted full control over the Aim Assistance and the percentage that either KB+M or Controller users get. Anyways, just my thoughts.

* Q3: Will the MCC be receiving TrueSkill2.0 (TS2) or otherwise known as Trueskill Through Time (TTT)?

This much more accurate skill system is vital toward improving the matchmaking within the game and if cross-play is to exist between different platforms it's just another measurement that can be more accurately accounted for within TS2.

* Q4: Will Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary receive it's own match composer selection option?
* Q5: Any chance potentially new developer created remake maps get released for H2A & HCEA?

I know there's been some discussion about the forge community creating new content for the MCC, but it would be interesting to see what the mod community might also be able to create if specific types of modding is allow to take place on the PC. With modding maybe you guys wouldn't need to recreate all the Anniversary remakes.

* Q6: PC dedicated servers?
* Q7: Will ODST release before H3 given the chronological timeline order?"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Hey devs! Thanks for taking the time to go over questions! I have 3 or 4 myself..

1: Will there be Workshop support for mods and stuff on the Steam version? PC games last a lifetime if the community has the tools to create new content.. And if so, what types of mods will be able to be created? Is there limitations?

2: When you guys mentioned adjustable frame rates, do you mean we can go up to 144 FPS? Or will the games be locked at 60 due to physics issues?

3: Will we have to buy each game individually? Or is it a base price and we get all the games like the Xbox One version? (Not including ODST ofc)

4: Regarding flights, are you guys looking for people with high-end specs? Or are you looking for a broad spectrum of players?

My question is in relation to Halo Insider and the expected time frames for possible MCC Testing. Is there a specific time frame we can expect a flighting for Reach (Q2-3, mid summer?) Would we be able to expect a flighting for each individual game before their respective release (i.e. a Halo 2 flighting before Halo 2, a Halo 3 flighting before Halo 3)? 

Thank you again!"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,What price point are we looking at for the PC release? Is it going to fall in line with the Xbox one price or will it be higher (Given Reach is now included)/lower?
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Finding a question someone hasn't already asked is kinda hard. But I guess a few things on my mind about MCC and Reach would be the armor customization going back to it's original form for each games (mainly Halo 3, 4 and Reach), will the maps from our file browsers carry over for Reach or will it be like in Halo 4 where nothing is transferred over, and lastly will all of the customization items be returning over? Halo Reach pre order bonuses, waypoint bonuses, blue flame helmet, Halo 4's champion DLC armor and weapons skins. I was very disappointed I bought the bundle back on Xbox 360 and the armor and weapons skins didn't come back in MCC"

Any word on a release road map?

Can we pre-order the game as a bundle and just get the games as they come out, like a season pass almost?

Even with Frankie's comment defending the announcement, I still don't quite get it. Why would you announce a PC version of a 4 year old game and not give a release date? Why not just wait until you guys had some concrete date before you started to build hype that you knew you were never going to satisfy?"

Love you all!"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"So, here's my questions:

1) Achievements: Will the PC version count achievements separately from the Xbox version, or will it still function like an Xbox Play Anywhere title in that regard?

2) ODST Firefight: Is there a chance that we could see this mode come to all MCC versions in the future? I would be willing to pay for it as well.

3) Halo 4 Champions Bundle content and updated maps: There are four armor sets and a large variety of skins, tactical packages, and support upgrades that are not currently in the game. Will we be seeing these items in the future?

4) Improved armor customization: While I don't personally care about armor customization, I know it is important to some. As such, would it be possible to get customization in line with each previous release for Halo 3 and Halo 4 as well?

5) New achievements for Reach: Will we get more achievements for Halo: Reach on the Xbox One version?

As everyone's already asked *the* question and you've answered, I'll ask about something people are sort of hopeful for, but obviously it's not mandatory or anything.

Do you guys have plans to allow mod/steam workshop support? perhaps not now (now being when the game's release) but further down the line after you get everything released and squared away. 

Thanks again for doing this!"

1. Armor customization. Specifically, the haunted helmet. Will the haunted helmet be unlocked through a progression system, challenges, achievements, or something else entirely?

2. Forge and Custom games. Is there any plausibility of us being able to transfer over forge creations from Reach on the 360 into MCC Reach? Or will we likely not?

3. I believe you said full armor customization for Reach will be present, but will it return for Halo 3 and Halo 4? Possibly even Halo 2A?

4th and Final. Will we possibly get a proper file share for Master Chief Collection?  For a long time people have been asking for this and without it, it makes custom game hosting on MCC difficult"

Not sure if this has been answered anywhere so apologies if it has:

I have a physical copy of Reach for Xbox 360 - would I still need to buy it again for MCC on Xbox One?

I didn't have an Xbox One when you added ODST, so not sure how it worked back then. 

Thanks! "

So will the competitive scene shift from console to PC eventually, and if so, shouldn't we , the competitors, be let aware of the fact that it may be? Most of us have been competing on console for the majority of our time spent playing, and KB+M is a huge shift from our controller muscle memory, and all I'd like is a fair warning that we should start getting used to PC instead of console. I greately appreciate any responses, 
Thanks"

And will halo 4 ever gets it dlc armor? (MK V, ODST, Prefect)"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Instead of ""mod support"" are you guys considering ""custom map support"" as it was made on halo custom edition,with a editing kit for it?

b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19," Hey so 1 thing I'm concerned about is seeing how MCC HCE competes w/ OG PC Halo CE & Custom Edition. Custom Ed. has a long-running active community with insane amounts of content (Halomaps.org halomods.org). I've been disappointed how MCC's CE experience never seems to give me the same big map experience as PC CE. How can these experiences be bridged?  
In my experience, traditional multiplayer remasters (Modern Warfare Remastered, for example) never end up succeeding while the original multiplayer community stands strong. Obviously MCC is different, the culture around it is different, and it being on Steam helps - but I do worry for the state of things competing. I want MCC Halo CE to be amazing and etc. but I don't want to see everything from the old CE experience to die.  
Likewise, I understand licensing issues affects a lot and you can't just incorporate all the custom maps/mods from Custom Ed. either, likely. (Or maybe you can?) And I'm assuming the original map editor/modding tools might be out of the scope of the MCC project, as well.But given the preservationist aspect of MCC, it'd be neat to see original HCE with the required high refresh/etc mods integrated somehow but I really don't know what the solution is. :/ 

Any thoughts? Has this been considered? "

1. I know better than to ask for a release date, so I'll simply put it this way: could I reasonably expect to be playing Halo Reach on my PC by fall of 2019?

2. From a development standpoint, what was the hardest thing for you, or the team, to do for MCC since its revival last year?

3. To what eldritch God must I pray to to get some regular game nights with you awesome guys at the studio? (Are any planned once its launched? Will there be PC game nights?)

4. Personal question (of sorts): when you land in a match made invasion match, are you hoping to start as a Spartan or an Elite?

5. Finally, can we expect any Reach forge maps, once created, to make their way into matchmaking in MCC?

1. I'm wondering with the inevitable PC release will the Terminals be implemented into the game in future updates or still require the Halo Channel?
2. Since the end credits are cinematic in Reach (an important one at that) will it and possibly the other titles end credits be added to the game?

 I really only have a few questions:  


1. With MCC coming to PC, would the prospect of Halo 5 being merged into MCC be a prospect (on XBOne and PC), and then also released on PC, to form it into more of a ""Halo Collection""
2. Will there ever be a possibility of Having an Importer Tool for Forge to allow us to import the old forge creations and game types, and have it symbiotically link the file-associations, so that we can import them into MCC for each game?
3. Given the 20th anniversary of the Franchise will be upon us in a couple of years, and Halo 3 never received an Anniversary treatment, would there ever be a possibility of a Halo 3 anniversary, possibly being added to MCC as a DLC-style release (e.g. having base halo 3 if you don't have the H3A DLC purchased, then having it change to the anniversary content if you do)?
4. Mouse and Keyboard Support on Xbox One MCC (With accompanying trimmings such as FOV Slider, customizable input configurations, etc.)?"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,Would you ever consider adding in ODST Firefight to the MCC as a custom game or with matchmaking support? I prefer ODST's struggle for survival over the arcadey version in Reach.

1. Are there any rough estimates for PC specs, and if so. Do they differ much from game to game?
2. Will progress from Xbox be transferred to PC, even when played through Steam?
3. Are there any estimates for pricing, are we talking a couple of bucks per game or more ""full-game"" type pricing?
4. Will there be a purchase option like a ""season pass"" that includes all games in 1 package?
5. Has mod support (Halo Custom Edition and custom Halo 2 maps) been discussed at all? If so, is there a possibility of this being included?
6. How far apart can we expect each game in terms of release timing? Weeks, months, years?
7. Will we be able to host custom servers like we can on Halo CE and 2 on PC? (Server browser maybe?)

Will H1A multiplayer be listed under H1A or as part of Reach - or both? I think it'd be cool to have H1A SP and MP grouped together, as they were separate engines in the 2011 release so it felt disjointed, but now it can be slightly more streamlined.

Nitpicky request - It'd be great if you could change the H1C MP playlist image to the 2001 art instead of the 2011 black and white art... as, going by the H2C/H2A distinction, the 2011 art should represent H1A Reach MP, not H1C.

And another thing I noticed is, nowhere in the game does it say Combat Evolved, it's always CE. How is a new player going to understand what CE means? :P"

b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Thank you so much for doing this AMA. Here are my questions:

1. Since Halo is coming to Steam, a dream of mine was for Halo promotional items added to Valve's Team Fortress 2. Would you guys and Microsoft love to make that dream come true? Some possibilities for items added could be Master Chief's helmet, Johnson's cap and cigar, an Energy Sword for all classes, and more.
2. Could we see some of ElDewrito's additions to Forge added to MCC? Besides an uncapped budget some other additions were enabling the Elephant on all Halo 3 maps, which lead to some really creative custom games. Another addition I really loved was the ability to resize Spartans, which lead to fun custom games like Mouse Hunt, or Attack on Titan. They also allowed for skybox changing, which lead to cool nighttime versions of maps like Standoff, making really spooky Infection maps
3. Think we could get some more Halo 2 Anniversary maps?
4. Can we please for the love of god finally nerf Armor Lock?
5. For the Steam release, will our ingame names be our Steam names, or our Xbox gamertags?
6. What pricing can we expect for the individual games? Between $10-20 per game?
7. Players made a mod for ODST that added traditional multiplayer for it, something the original never had. It was a completely unique experience from the other Halo multiplayers due to the health and movement system of the game. Could we see that mod added as an official patch for ODST maybe?"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"How closely will Halo CE and Halo 2 in MCC be to Halo: Custom Edition and Halo 2 Vista, in terms of controls and UI and things of that nature? Personally I came to Halo through the original PC releases, not Xbox."

b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Hey ske7ch, thanks for this.

Would you consider making the multiplayer of PC MCC games to be accessible for all who purchase one of the games to not fracture the player base?

If someone only buys Reach and Halo 3, this would throw off the Mixtape Matchmaking system populations. 

Maybe a base fee for all multiplayer that would be added to PC MCC, and additional for each campaign?"

&#x200B;

My question: There were a lot of small communities that had Halo CE servers back in the day when it first came out on PC, and many to this day still maintain their Halo PC and Halo CE online servers. Many of us community administrators that have a Halo PC/CE background would be absolutely devestated to be unable to run and host our own servers and server software on our own computers and servers, or to see Microsoft pull an EA type move and close it off to specific providers only who have to be pre-approved. Can you confirm that there will be support for community owned and operated servers? A cloud option from Azure would also be neat to have, but I think that a majority of us would love to have an on-prem server daemon/software that we can run ourselves."
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,What resolutions are you looking at supporting?  Are we going to get native ultrawide support in this?  Would love to see support for 3440x1440 resolution in this.

b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Right now the priority is getting Halo: Reach ready for public flighting and work is underway almost in parallel for Halo: CE, which will be the second game. Ultimately we want to get these games into player's hands as soon as possible. We're hesitant to commit to a firm time frame because the truth is they're ready when they're ready. Flighting will be critical to help us get these titles to a great place and depending on how that goes, it could lengthen or extend the release cadence. We'll definitely share more details as we start ramping up flighting. "

Currently our focus is on Win10 and Win7. Win8 is still being investigated. "
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Seconded for purchasing options. I am curious about this as well. Whether its together or separate, though, you can bet I'll be buying all of them "
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,">FoV

Yes, support for FOV-sliders is the plan. We will adjust what level of FOV is supported on a title by title basis. As an example, if adjusting the FOV causes significant player/weapon model distortion, we may need to put limits in.

Uncapped framerate is the plan, but the specific level of support will vary by title. "
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,They already confirmed a FoV slider when it was announced.

b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Current plan is to support 'uncapped FPS' in each title. But, as we move deeper into development on each title, we'll have to determine what's feasible within each game. 

Delivering great KB+M controls is one of our top priorities. We are exploring different ways to make a balanced, fun experience for PC and will share more details in the future. 

We've been blown away by the interest and support for the Halo Insider program! Our goal is to balance accepting as many as possible against the specific needs for a particular flight. "
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"A follow up to this, is there 144hz support for all of the games? If you're limited to just talking about Reach today that's cool "
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Ultimately, flighting and the results of those tests will help finalize the min specs but we want to support the widest range of hardware possible. We'll definitely share spec details soon.

b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Yeah would be interested to hear about optimization.

I realize this is early days and the devs probably can't nail any concrete details down, but I hope they're aiming for what originally could run Xbox 360 games back in the day when they were ported back in 2006-2012.

I understand if maybe not system specs that could run the original Halo CE on PC are so marginal that you can't find PCs to test builds on, but if you can aim for optimization that is in the same ballpark as the Halo Wars Definitive Edition on Steam, maybe more generous and inclusive with the original Halo Trilogy on legacy graphical fidelity, then this collection would be absolutely brilliant in my mind.

&#x200B;

Also please make sure Exclusive Fullscreen works, perhaps allowing custom resolutions (ala AMID EVIL)"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"We love Forge, too! It's a bit too early to get into this level of detail but these are great suggestions. Forge and Theater are awesome features but as we learned with Halo 5: Forge, these features require a lot of extra work and diligence to bring to PC - particularly with the complexities of M/KB and remappable key-bindings. With this in mind, Forge and Theater for Reach won't be ready at the same time as the MP/Campaign/Firefight experiences on PC. From a development perspective, it makes more sense for the team to tackle Reach's Forge/Theater a little later in the roadmap at the same time as Halo 3 and Halo 4 work.

Re: Halo 3 Hayabusa - it's a bit too early to say, but we'll be sure to add this to our list.

As Bonnie noted on Sunday, we appreciate all of the Xbox One players who have supported MCC over the years and we realize that many existing MCC players are also interested in playing the game on PC. While MCC was released prior to the Xbox Play Anywhere program, we are still exploring ways to recognize the continued support of our Xbox One players so they are also able to enjoy MCC on PC.  We will have more details as we get closer to launch.

&#x200B;"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"1. We want to get these games into the hands of PC players as soon as possible once they're ready. 
2. It's too early to get into specifics on what playlists will be available and with what settings, but as always, we'll look to the community for feedback and input as we craft these experiences together. 
3. We are always investigating ways to bring the wealth of Halo user created content to a larger audience for everyone to enjoy. Halo Custom Edition content is definitely on our list and is actively being explored. "
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,Im all for armor lock leaving but personally I liked bloom. They removed it in 4 (even though it still appears to be there) and it made the DMR in 4 an unstoppable force you did not want to run into without also having a DMR. Halo Reach’s DMR required you to pace your shots unless you were right up in front of them.

re: Dedicated servers for Reach - our goal is to continue using dedicated servers to power the matchmaking experences within MCC. We'll definitely share more details as development progresses. 

re: ""How many people are working on MCC"" - while the majority of 343 is hard at work on Halo Infinite, the Publishing Team has partnered with Ruffian and Splash Damage to hep us bring this ambitious project to life. When flighting kicks off, Halo Insiders will also be partnering with us. 

re: ""Hype"" - We know there's been a longstanding desire for the Halo saga to come to PC but it's still been incredible to see the outpouring of support and excitement! 

re: Release order - Bringing MCC to PC represents a chance to introduce Master Chief's story to a brand new audience and Reach is the fictional starting point for that journey.

Although, at launch of Halo 2A, Sword Flying and Super Bouncing was available, (which was patched on the original before launch of MCC, and later in MCC), who's to say different ¯\_(ツ)_/¯, only an official response will appease this question, but just wanted to let you in on some useful info."
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19, noble hierarch what are you doing among us common folks?
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Honestly, as a massive Halo fan who transitioned to primarily PC gaming a decade ago, I just want to play great Halo games on PC.  I'd rather you all spend the time to make them right, than get them out quickly.  I've waited so long for Halo on PC, I can wait a bit longer to get the best experience!"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"With the understanding that things can change, does the goal of ""later this year"" on waypoint refer to just Reach or hopefully as much of the entire package as possible?"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"> priority is getting Halo: Reach ready for public flighting 

Didn't someone from your team say that it is ready, you're just waiting for sign ups?"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"what does ""flighting"" mean in this context?"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,but can we get an idea? Are we thinking weeks? months? Quarters? 
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,Will it rely on steams VAC system or will it be its own independent system?
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"When Reach officially launches, will we have the option to 'pre-purchase' the full MCC collection (on PC/Steam)?"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,Any estimate for the price of each game?

b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,wait so we can’t buy the whole collection now and get the games as they release?
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,Can you buy the whole package immediately and wait until other games are available. Like a season pass of sorts.
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Will there be a season pass option at the beginning? I definitely plan on getting all of them, and I dont plan on waiting until they are all out to start lol"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"So no ""season pass"" sort of deal where you can just buy the whole pack ahead of time?"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Please, don't force your player base (myself included) to wait to buy the whole package. Make the bundle available immediately (with a discount, preferably) and make the games available to download as they're finished."

b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,Thank you for supporting Windows 7!
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Can we buy the entire collection when Reach launches? 

Or do we have to buy each game individualy if we want them at release and if so will it be more expensive to but them one by one instead of the final bundle?"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,So that means we can't pre-order the entire package from the start? I'd like that as an option. 
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"I want to emphasize that I hope you offer a ""season pass"" from the start, or I feel this will be your biggest mistake.

With the MCC on Xbox, players got Halo 1-Reach multiplayer all included in the base cost of the game. You even said that existing owners will receive Reach multiplayer for free, and I assume the reason you are doing this is to avoid fragmentation.

If you release the multiplayer for each game separately, Reach and Halo 1 will have the biggest populations, and by the time you get to Halo 2, Halo 3, and Halo 4 the population of those games will be so small due to few buyers it will be impossible to find a game for those who actually bought it. Even if the games are sold individually at only $10 a pop, players won't have much of an incentive to buy later games if they feel they are happy enough with only their first $10 purchase. You will be hurting yourselves more with this model.

I was really hoping you would sell Reach including ALL FUTURE MULTIPLAYER MAPS as the first game ""The MCC Collection"" for $40, and then sell each additional game's CAMPAIGNS/FIREFIGHT ONLY for $5 as they come. For Halo 1, 2, 3, ODST, and 4 that would put the total purchase price at around $65. That would be comparable to the Xbox version, allow you to access the biggest audience, and avoid fragmentation on PC."
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"What are the prices looking like if we want to purchase individually?

but holy shit this sounds absolutely amazing"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,Will there be a price discrepancy between those two methods?
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"No Halo 3 Field of view slider then? Because using Halo Online or ElDewrito for exemple, changing the field of view breaks some weapon offsets and you can see the FP arm model clip through the camera as it was not meant to be seen areas."
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"As a suggestion on FOV sliders, maybe have some sort of advanced setting to opt into taking it beyond the limits where there's distortion, but with some sort of warning message that it's not how the game is intended to be played? Especially if there's a title which doesn't have a wide range of options before distortion?"

b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Really hope community dedicated servers is heavily considered. I would consider this very important for the longevity of the (or most any online multiplayer) game! It's definitely a core part of PC gaming. 

Halo Online stayed popular because of community 24/7 mini-game servers! Mods may actually end up requiring community servers. "
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"I honestly think its very important have community hosted dedicated servers. After all Halo CE (custom edition), Halo 2: Project Cartographer, and even Eldewrito thrived for the longest damn time because of this. I don't see any reason not to have this as an option eventually. "
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"There are very few games these days that have support for community hosted servers, I think if it was added it would be embraced to the fullest."

b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"The experience I was looking forward to having, and the only incentive I had to buy the game, was that I’d be able to play the MCC split-screen co-op with friends. 

While online was a fun experience, splitscreen co-op campaign was the defining experience for me growing up. I won’t be getting this game or any without it. 

I refunded W10 Ark because of false advert of split-screen on pc. I play local 2player+ fifa 2019 on pc. I have plenty of choices for a good online shooter. I don’t however, have many choices for a splitscreen campaign fps. 
GOW4 i bought for that reason. Fun game, 3PS though. Bought bo3 for the splitscreen, campaign is pretty rough. Bought RSV2 for splitscreen!

b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,So essentially the timing on when players can start flighting all comes down to when the dev team can get the UI and KB&M controls up to a min point that is seen as good enough for players to use somewhat intuitively.

WASD for movement, E for your action key, shift for sprint/ability, and Ctrl for crouch. 1 and 2 for switching weapons. Q could be flashlight. Even F could do that. It only gets tricking with zooming in Halo, since it works a bit different than most games in CE-4. Do you map it to RMB or Z. I have grenades mapped to RMB and zooming mapped to Z in CE on PC currently. But that's probably something they'll just have to test."

Now, if this game was about spartans that burrow underground more than anything, rather than using jetpacks, jumping ridiculously high, and being up on ledges... then having it centered or even higher in the screen would make more sense.

Or if it's a game like goldeneye where there isn't jumping and barely any verticality, then it makes sense to be centered."

Within MCC, yes, your progress and progression will carry-over between the console and PC versions. All stats, achievements, Forged maps, and game variants will be shared between all of the games within MCC. Mid mission saves will be unique to each platform and cannot be shared.

 Your Halo: Reach unlocks and progression from the original game on Xbox 360 will NOT carry over to MCC. 

And as a reminder, MCC on Steam will require a free Microsoft Account, but not Xbox Live Gold. ""

b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Right, but the solution of just lessening bloom was a bad idea since it worsened weapon balance by making the DMR, needle rifle, and magnum better then they already were at mid and long ranges, making the Focus rifle, the AR (which in reach is more of a close-mid range rather then a close range weapon) worse.

What should have been done is to scale bullet magnetism inversely with the level of bloom/spread, combined with a *higher* level of max bloom and bloom rate, but faster bloom recovery: this would make it so that bloom builds up faster and the total reticule size could be bigger, so spamming makes you *really* inaccurate and shots actually miss past very close range, and there's no ""help"" to have shots guide towards enemies when you do this, but bloom also goes down much faster so pacing is more effective. 

Alternatively, they could have just reduced the DMR's rate of fire, but given it increased damage, alongside the reduced bloom, and that'd do it. "

b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"I seem to remember from the waypoint post that odst was after 3 as it was released after, despite taking place during the events of Halo 2."
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Reach, CE, 2, 3, ODST, then 4.

So technically not chronological.
"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"If you want to play them chronologically in universe events, its Reach, CE, 2, ODST, 3, 4. My recommended way for a first play through is CE, 2, ODST, 3, Reach, 4. It just may be odd going from the second newest game to the oldest."
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"To second what Tjtod said, I would probably play them in their original release order (minus H3:ODST and H3 being swapped in his).  Being the release order that is kinda how the games were 'meant' to be played.

Alternatively you can play chronologically with the release order of MCC on PC, so Reach first.  If you want to play them vaguely chronologically but also closer to the release order I would recommend starting with Halo Combat Evolved (2nd MCC release), then playing Reach (1st MCC release), then Halo 2 onwards in release order.  The biggest issue with this would be going from a very old game, to a much newer game and back to a much older game again.  It might feel a bit janky gameplay wise, but is probably best lore-wise for understanding.

If you want any help understanding the Lore, background etc. feel free to ask me anything, read through Halopedia or come visit r/halostory for all your Halo lore needs."
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Oh I know, I've played every Halo game on basically every platform available; plus loads of Halo community mods for other games.  Hence why I'm super excited for MCC on PC but happy to wait a bit extra for it to be done properly rather than have them rush it out."
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,since H2 was on post-XP PC before it shouldn't take too long to make work right? at least compared to 3/4/Reach?
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"I’m a bit suspicious of this and I don’t think we will be able to as I think this is a business move under the guise of “perfecting each game” before release. 

Edit: Just seen underneath that we can’t pre-purchase them all... colour me surprised. "
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,...can you say what was answered in terms of pricing?
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,Where was pricing already answered?
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,">Where was pricing already answered

where was pricing answered i cant find any info on it..."
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,Sounds good! We're excited for the flighting!
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,My excitement just faded. I thought this would be comparable to pricing for MCC on Xbox.  
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,Pizza time!
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,I'll sacrifice my discount to play the games as they come out tbh
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"I think many of us would like to purchase the whole thing and just have the new games unlocked as they come out much like the life is strange games episodes.

Edit: the madmen actually did it, I’ll see you bros soon to finish the fight."
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,Yeah I think a majority of us would like to just make a one off purchase. Please consider this. 
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,">Players can purchase each title one-by-one along the way or wait until the collection is complete at the end. We don't have any plans for a 'season pass' model.

I'd love to just be able to purchase the whole collection at the beginning and have things unlock as they become available. Please look into this. I AM TRYING TO GIVE YOU MONEY"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,Please consider the one-time purchase a the beginning.
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Yeah i would like to buy the whole thing and then when a new one releases it added to my menu, just like the xbox one"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,For some reason I can suspect that all 6 titles will be around 10-15$ and the whole package being 60-80$ USD with this knowledge
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Or the model goes back when changing the FOV to higher values, something like that yeah."
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,Yep i still run a Halo PC server. although i do get sick of all the teleport modded bloodgulch maps with rocket snipers

b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,It weird because I'm the opposite.. I was really hoping to completely unlock all the achievements again. I wish we could reset them or like prestige them. It was such a blast to go through and unlock everything. 
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Not most, but there certainly are alot that uses it, including myself. I play alot of local multiplayer on my PC such as Lethal League, Rocket League, Screen Cheat, Ultimate Chicken Horse.. I use a NVIDIA shield to play them in my living room and it works great"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"There's no technical reason that they cannot, unless the game must be controlled through mouse or keyboard. I have played a fair share of local multiplayer PC games, including ones with split-screen."

b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,Playing through Reach on splitscreen with a friend is one of my favourite gaming experiences. It’s one of the things I hate about Halo. 5 not having it was just awful.
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"As another lifelong PC gamer, splitscreen is something I would do *often* if games actually supported it. I've done some absolute fuckery to do same-machine ""split screen"" with Left 4 Dead 2, for instance."
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"No but it is something that Halo fans want. I know if I ever show this game to my kids or whatnot, I’ll want to play it with them, and I’m not sure I’ll keep my Xbox around purely as a split screen Halo machine "
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"I have my pc hooked up to my tv in the other room. We sit on the couch and play tons of games on pc using xbox controllers. Its no different than playing on a console. No reason to exclude the feature

b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,Yeah proper releases will be great instead of dealing with hastily made ports
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,The Halo 2 on MCC is essentially a complete remake. Best looking cut scenes I've ever seen in a game.
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,1 and 2 have Anniversary versions with updated visuals and sound they're not going to be the same as the original PC versions
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Probably not. And the original Halo: CE PC version works fine on Windows 10 (was just playing it last weekend). So that's probably why they're working on CE while they work on Reach, because there's already been a port, so there's some basis they can go off of. Both ports (especially H2) were a little wonky though, so I think for the most part they're building them for PC from the ground up, not just doing a lazy port like before. "

b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-20,The problem is they know most people will do this lol.
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"For context, it gets tricky when we have a flexible release plan that ties to flighting and ongoing development - it's hard to definitively promise a player when they'll get the thing they paid for (or even what features may or may not be there at one time). We have to get this right on PC and do so in a way that doesn't potentially upset customers."
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"Yeah, I don't want to have to spend 15 dollars on each game when the entire bundle is much cheaper on console."
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,I don't think it'll sell well if it's anything over $10 per game. Even that is a bit high but maybe doable. The original game on release was $60 so it's not fair to release it on PC 5 years later at a higher price. That'll be received poorly.

b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"there is like HUNDREDS of local multiplayer games on steam.  [https://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/List\_of\_Local\_Multiplayer\_Games](https://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/List_of_Local_Multiplayer_Games)

Call of Duty Blops 3, Call of Duty WWII, Rocket League, Serious Sam 3, Serious Sam HD (two games actually), Screencheat, Gunscape, Space Beast Terror Fight, Polygod, RICO...

And it's just a first person shooters.

Throw in emulation and stuff. You can play WAAAAY more split screen and local multiplayer games than on ANY EXISTING CONSOLE EVER."
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-20,"According to co-optimus, there are more splitscreen games on Steam than on the modern consoles"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"I still think the poor sales of halo 5, and by extension the Xbox one in general (since I would generally consider halo to be a system seller), can be heavily blamed on the lack of splitscreen.

You can't convince your friend to spend 400 dollars on an Xbox with halo if all you can do with one console is play solo. Especially because when you pass the pad (so they can try it) they'll be matched with opponents of YOUR skill level so they'll be fighting a losing battle. 

It's a negative experience all around for the person you're trying to bring to the dark side. Why would they spend 400 bucks for a shitty time?

Halo was successful BECAUSE of the local multiplayer. People invited their friends over to play ""that new halo game"" in split screen and the next day there were three new people itching to play again. 

Some of those people bought their own Xboxes, some just became best friends with their local halo dealer, but either way, people were hooked because of that split screen experience. 

Halo 2 was an even easier sell using the same tactic, with the online play meaning you could basically do the same thing as split screen with these friends *every night* without so much as putting pants on."

Yes yes, I must be fun at parties or whatever, but correct terminology matters, there are waaaay too many people that have remakes and remasters mixed up and have unreasonable expectations for things."

It would be so great for somebody like me who are deaf and missed out so much of the dialogue during the campaign playthrough and the fact that Halo 5 and Halo CEA have that features give me hope that other games would follow suit. :)"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,Will the cost of the individual games be similar to waiting and buying all them in a bundle?
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,This type of model raises concerns on the price though. Will buying individually end up being more expensive than a full prices title? In my currency (GBP) 6 (games) divided by £50 (full price release these days) doesn’t divide equally. 
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"I have a feeling each game will be $30 at least..hence why they are releasing seperately and not waiting until all of the games are complete that way once the new game releases you forget about how much you paid for the previous one cause ""omg Halo! Take my money again"". I really really hope I'm wrong"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,Can confirm. Played a few matches of Fat Kid last night :D
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-20,"Same. I think unlocking armor will still be a thing. I sure hope so, because it was a status symbol of storts. I'll miss having my favorite armor set unlocked though. I'll just have to work back up to it. Chief Helmet, sniper torso, and I forgot the names of knees and shoulders I had, but they're nice and slim ones, not too bulky.

b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,I never realized it until a few years ago. And I'm not sure if any others do it.
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,Hunt: Showdown has the crosshairs a bit below center. My friend makes jokes about that and its lack of FOV slider as we obsessively play it.
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,I mean the surface book can include a gtx 1060 so it should be able to run them 
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,I had no idea. I’m deaf myself and I thought they had subtitles already on the X version. I must have missed something.

b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,"I would expect that buying individually would be more expensive since you get each title as soon as possible, and games frequently have discounts applied after being released for some time. I doubt it will be significantly more, though. Also, ODST comes with less than the rest and only costs $5 USD on Xbox One. I would imagine $10-$15 USD for each of the other games, but that's just speculation, so take it with a grain of salt."
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,Watch it be 40 bucks per game.

Edit: Unless you're talking about cutscene part? In that case all Halo games have subtitles during the cutscene not gameplay except Halo CEA and 5"
b2yhk8,2019-03-19,2019-03-20,That's how 343 would kill all this hype real quick and go back to being the company that ignores all the fans.

Hector is one of the main lords in Blazing Blade. During the events of the game, he gets a powerful axe (Armads) that is prophesized to lead you to an early grave in battle.

182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-23,Only happened because his Voice actor was busy with a T.V show
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,He's killed extremely abruptly off screen. So many people didn't even think he was dead until the end.
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"I kept expecting him to just show up sometime. He was Johnny fucking Gat, the man who shrugged off getting stabbed through with a katana.

Saints Row 3 wasn't just a disappointment, it was a *betrayal*."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-23,"I actually liked quite a bit how this was portrayed. As you said, it shows that Jack is a complete prick, whilst also not butchering any characters in the process. Helena’s death felt like it was actually important, despite it just being another day for Handsome Jack."

182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-23,"See this is what's always pissed me off about 343s halo games, they had so many opportunities to do cool shit with the story that they just flushed right down the drain. Same thing happened with cortanas whole ai rebellion thing at the end of 5, and then infinite comes in and theyre just like ""yeah we solved that off screen don't worry about it"" like ???"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"The Didact. The Absolute Record. The Created. The entire planned Reclaimer trilogy. 

343i are terrified of commitment it seems."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Saying that Halo 4 built up Jul M'dama is giving the game too much credit lmao. If you were like me in 2012 unable to purchase Xbox Live, you would have absolutely no clue who Jul M'dama is since they relegated him to just Spartan Ops! A mode that required Live."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,Not to mention it was done in a cut scene.
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,The best way anyone described the 343 halo games to me was that each game felt like the beginning of a new trilogy.
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"As someone who got really into the Spartan Ops storyline with hunting him down, that was SUPER annoying. And it was still only the second biggest waste of a Halo 4 plot point in that game."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Jul was shit. He was only relevant to the books, never appeared in the main campaign, and only appeared in a handful of Spartan Ops missions. His LT Gek L'har was more interesting. Not to mention, the books he appeared in are regarded as some of the worst in the franchise. I always thought his motivation was terrible and saw him as a failed character from an author we had to suffer through."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,I’m pretty sure Halo 4 was the final game idk what you’re on about? /s but serious too
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"343's Halo trilogy has the same problem as Disney's Star Wars trilogy. They had no idea what they were doing to connect all these movies.

They didn't have an idea for a story that was going to be told in three parts. They just wanted ""a trilogy"". Because fucking EVERYTHING has to be a trilogy, at least."

182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Lol some Star Wars sequels shit

I could never take 343 seriously, I stopped buying Halo after reach despite being huge fan until then"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Yeah, Halo 4 had a GREAT setup. Then 343 just fucks it in the ass.

Cortana gets retconned back to life despite literally being deleted, becomes a megalomaniac that tries to control the universe through the threat/promise of annihilation, doing a COMPLETE 180 from her original personality, by virtue of a magical Macguffin we never find. Then Infinite rolls around and she's been deleted again, offscreen, while at the same time the Infinity gets the most bullshit write off possible with next to no,explanation of HOW that scenario was possible."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"And in a cutscene without you ever actually fighting him, no less. I remember reading the books leading up to Halo 5 and actually really liking 'Mdama, then being confused when he stopped showing up. I hadn't even realized that it was him getting merced in the game when it first came out"

Hes not the greatest fighter but he was good enough. Dude was just always minding his own business being a little nerd fighter and liked having him in the party. The quest in SoD where you help him make a necklace for jaheira was so sweet.

And then he was just dead & gone. RIP my boy."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,The grief and rage in Jaheria's voice lines when you find the body still gives me chills.

182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Gives more weight to Irenicus, especially since not even you can truly kill a companion"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"So that's what happened to Khalid. I played BG and then BG3, but I was so annoyed that Khalid was never even mentioned in BG3. Not a single reference. Even when you flirt with Jahira. So many missed opportunities for rich dialog."

182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"They did him extremely dirty. All 3 of his endings suck.

You either abandon him after he loses everything and send him walking off into a snowstorm alone and depressed never to be seen again.

Shoot him in the face.

Or if you choose to stay with him, he forgets to wear a seatbelt, goes flying out of the front windshield, cripples himself then gets eaten alive by walkers all in under 2 minutes."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,Originally they were going to have him commit suicide abruptly during dinner but it was rightly pointed out by someone that it would be extremely out of character for him to do that considering what he had already been through.
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-23,"In my playthrough, I had Clem leave Kenny at the entrance to the Wellington camp and never saw him again. How is he killed off in New Frontier if he comes with you?"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Wait, but Kenny comes back later in the game if I remember correctly"

182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,Remember when the horde couldn’t hold a warchief?
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,Activision’s Blizzard loved killing off everyone from the previous games and expansions. My guess was to make room for new stories.
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,His logs from the Normandy Crash Site are so damn good.
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Technically ME2 killed Shepard in the beginning as well, it just didn't stick lmao"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,Sir Patrick Stewart did a wonderful job nonetheless.
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"I mean, that was an important plot point that is used as an M Night Shamalan twist. I think the fact your hero Petrenko from WaW is given such an ignominious death is much worse although again, it did serve a purpose in motivating Reznov."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Master piece of a campaign, both of those. The last good CoDs in my book"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,Shame I can't play those campaigns anymore...
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"It's such a shame how mismanaged this series is. I'd love to replay some of the earlier campaigns and huge story moments but so much of the prior paid content is locked away. 

Also, I really hope they don't fumble him appearing in ""The Final Shape"" story. They could do it right, but there's a chance it feels cheap or it's just to latch onto nostalgia as their player-base is dwindling and community frustrated."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Was waiting for at least one of these, however let me raise you the speaker who died pretty early on into the Red War"

182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"I never played Mafia 3 (heard it was bad) but how does it connect with Mafia 2?

Do the characters just...show up?"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-23,Are you telling me you weren't completely blindsided when you found out that Plisken and Solid Snake were one and the same?
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Child me was blown away. I was prepped to spend the entire game on the tanker and then suddenly we're playing as this super cool, ""rookie,"" agile, pretty boy. Wish we'd gotten more raiden games before reveangence."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,Interesting to note is that Eliwood in Binding Blade is one of the rare moments in the series where the protagonist's parent is still alive at the end of the game.
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"You mean Hector, the only sensible person in Blazing Blade? The only one who, though a bit rash and hot blooded, actually suggests reasonable courses of action out of the 3 protagonists? Who if Eliwood and Lyn had just listened to, would have had the whole game over in a few missions?"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,AC7 was a good game. Hope we get another soon!
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"God I loved that though. Wish the inside guy who could clear your name didn't get shot down late in the story too. The only reason you got pardoned was because you were too good to let die in the ""spare"" squadron. 

Ace Combat is one of my favorite as well. Great memories growing up with those games."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,Would you recommend Ace Combat 7 for someone who's never played the others? I keep getting updates on it being on special from steam.
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,And the last minute as well during the modern day.

182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-23,No his VA just had scheduling conflicts
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,Only good npc in the game was Zoltun Kulle. Everything else was more/less silly goofing around till you see Diablo's new boobs.
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,I am still sore over that.
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,Game did a really good job of driving home the themes of overattachment
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Good game, but made complete trash by it's treatment of what came before it"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,Doesn't it stick? Isn't the new one a clone?
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-23,"I thought you went into a coma, or am I remembering the wrong game?"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,Plus Liu Kang dying between 4 and 5

I may be wrong. It’s been a long time since I’ve played them."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"No, I don't believe so"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,They got better tho
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,You mean it was an F U to everyone who completed TLAD. Johnny's entire arc is thrown away just for shock value. That's even without questioning why it's The Lost as cannon fodder in V when the Angels of Death should actually be on the west coast.
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,That’s on them for playing ahead.  TLATD released 4 years before 5.
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Yeah what the fuck. I liked Johnny. I liked TLAD DLC. Why did GTAV take a shit all over him and then make The Lost the bad guys?

They could have made The Lost the bad guys without bringing Johnny all the way from Liberty City just to merc him unceremoniously."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,Shhhh
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Off subject but how sad overall is the ending to vice city stories? 
Such a good game I wish it was playable again."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,When they killed the Normandy?
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,That reminds me that Anton Slavik gets killed off screen in Kane's Wrath.
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,It's been so long since I played Halo 5 I had forgotten all about Jul M'Dama. That really pissed me off!
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,just out of curiosity can you expand on this?
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"If you mean Lastimosa, he didn't appear in Titanfall 1. And the protagonist from the first game is not named as it is the player."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,They do initially claim he died I think.
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,It does?
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Explain, please"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Technically GTA 2 has Claude Speed, GTA 3 has claude. They are basically the same character with a few differences but mainly they are just in different universes"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"I stopped playing the game and said that it was stupid. People told me I couldn’t criticize it since I didn’t give the game a chance and beat it. So I forced myself to finish it, and they were right. It gets far, FAR more stupid than I initially credited it for."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"I think the main issue with 2 is that you don't get to know Abby or her group until like 10 hours in. By that point I don't care anymore. I am FULLY on board with Ellies vengeance. 

We should have immediately cut from Joel's death to Abby's section leading up to that scene.

Ellie letting her go at the end still reeks of Arya in Game of Thrones being told ""vengeance bad, mkay"" when she's 15 feet from her ultimate goal she's been chasing for the entirety of the show and just going ""yeah makes sense"" and turning around."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"I gotta ask:

TLOU is very very clearly about a cruel and unfair world. So why do people get upset when cruel and unfair things happen in TLOU2?

Why is something cruel and unfair not allowed to happen to Joel/Ellie?

I feel like it's missing the point.

It's a horror game. You SHOULD feel horrified.

It's like when people complained about Glen's death in TWD. Like why the fuck are you watching a ZOMBIE show if you can't handle people being brutally murdered?"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Had the inverse effect on me lol. I liked the original TLOU, but it's probably not in my top 10 games. Part II is in my top 5! 

It's even more jarring when you replay them both, I feel the story of part 1 is a lot more generic and less mature."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"That's on you, not the game"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,Ahhh... I enjoyed Atreus' story but I hated playing as him lol. His combat was just so meh after the very enjoyable Kratos combat. But I didn't dislike the extra story time we got with him at all.
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,Don't have a PS5
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Nope, it's complete trash."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"It makes no sense that someone wants to kill the man who murdered their father? 
 
 
 It makes no sense that after years of living very cushy, getting softer and more trusting, older and weaker, that eventually you would be murdered yourself?  
 
 
Honestly if Joel continued to survive it would be the single worst case of plot armour Ive ever seen in my life. At the time of his death he was probably the oldest man on earth. I dont care how ""badass"" you are, its a fucking miracle he lasted as long as he did."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"How does it make no sense? Joel wasn’t expecting the people he just saved to turn out to be there specifically hunting him. He’d been living in relative safety for 4 years at that point, with the infected being the only real threat.

Abby and her friends were motivated by Joel going on an unhinged rampage through the hospital and slaughtering every single person in there."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"I swear I keep asking because I just wanna know:

Why are you people upset when something cruel and unfair happens, when TLOU is clearly taking place in a cruel and unfair world?

Like did you not realize that the world of TLOU really sucks to live in? And NOT just because of the zombies?

Like did you people play the first game AT ALL?

Joel is not Kratos. He is not Master Chief. He is not the ""TLOU"" franchise. He's just a dude. A mortal dude. THAT is why Joel is an interesting character. Because he acts like a REAL person and not a video-game main character."

Thankfully MK1 (new timeline) Sindel is on the side of good, or is at least a flawed good leader."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-23,"That makes sense (Daniel Dae Kim is an incredibly accomplished actor, both in physical roles and voiceover work), but immediately bringing him back after killing his character kinda cheapens the whole thing. Don't get me wrong, I know the SR series was never aiming for intelligent or emotional writing... As a huge fan of 2-4 it felt really contrived. Especially when he was immediately dead in the very next game they made (Gat out of Hell)."

182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,Some of the best writing in gaming history. Handsome Jack was unironically the perfect villain.
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"It was more impactful than Scooter’s death. He was killed off by telltale’s game and then gearbox made it awkwardly cannon in a what-the-hell-is-going-on funeral we participate in from an expansion released years after all the other BL2 content designed to excite me for BL3. 

The handling of his killing off didn’t make me excited for BL3."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Nope, she's the leader of New Haven which serves a similar purpose to Sanctuary in the first game.  You check in with her frequently to progress the story.  Sometime between games Hyperion sacked New Haven (Jack brings that up too with the spoon bit) and she attempted to evacuate civilians, only to be caught and executed in the process (the civilians too)."

182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"To be fair, at least they seem to be sticking to the only villain who was actually interesting out of the 343 bunch (Atriox). I don’t mind them scrapping shitty ideas for a soft reboot/requel (Infinite)."

182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,I personally thought it was extremely out of character to not put a fucking seatbelt on when teaching a child to drive in the zombie apocalypse… At least that’s how he died in my playthrough.
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"He's killed off in a 3 minute long flashback

You know in GTA 5 when you crash and your character goes flying out the front window at 70mph? Yeah that.

Then he just sits up and says ""well fuck. my legs don't work"" and gets eaten alive while Clementine and AJ run away."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-23,"This is only if you choose him over Jane. >!Him, Clem and AJ are driving along in a car, Clem's driving and Kenny starts checking on AJ who's sat in the back. Kenny has no seatbelt on, Clem clips a rock or some other bullshit, car swerves out of control and hits a large rock or sign post or something. Kenny gets ejected out of the front screen, becomes paralyzed then gets eaten by walkers as Clem and AJ make their escape.!<

That's all off the top of my head. Can't remember which game it's in. Think I completed the 2nd game and tried to play the third one, but I couldn't connect with Javier(?) and I realized my choices as him were bizarre because I was usually choosing and siding with Clem (for obvious reasons because she's our baby) rather then siding with his family."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Him dying happens in TWD3, I think. In a flashback. And if I recall correctly, that's the only way he'll appear, because in other instances, he's either already dead or disappeared (I think, lol)."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Yep. For the Horde and all that, but Alliance leader was personally disenchanted by fucking Gul’dan and got to sling a sweet one liner at him. Horde guy killed by poison from a trash mob’s weapon. 

That cinematic and Varian’s line there really made me want to switch to Alliance."

182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,Yeah early-ish in the game you try to make connections and get info on the Mafia and you’re told there’s a guy somewhere who needs your help. Wouldn’t you know it it’s Vito Scaletta.
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,Basically when you take over areas in the game you can choose who runs it between the different factions and Vito is the leader of one of them.
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,Mafia 3 gameplay is fun but it’s very repetitive and nothing like the first 2 in terms of story or mission quality. It’s worth playing if you can find it cheap.
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"I told my childhood friend over and over that Plisken was Snake and he laughed it off until the reveal. I felt so validated. “He looks, sounds, and acts the exact same!”"

182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"That is interesting! I can think of a few other cases in other games I played, but that definitely is a theme. From what I recall, there are the queens of Solm and Fierene (I forgot their names), and Geralt can survive the events of 3 Hopes.  If we count adopted parents, then Mycen survives in Shadows of Valentia. 3 Hopes/Houses (Hopes does more) does some neat showing of the parents in the nations, and different parents survive in different routes."

182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Every Ace Combat game is functionally standalone. They are set in the same world, but generally different wars and different time periods. Even the mentioned “they killed harling” thing is just an easter egg reference rather than an important plot detail. I’ve played every ace combat game and I didn’t realize he was a character from a previous game because it had been 10 years since I played Ace Combat 5.

So yeah. Ace Combat 7 is a perfect jumping on point."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"I'd HIGHLY suggest Ace Combat 5. It's mostly considered the best one in the series by far. You can even get it on the Playstation Store (the only one available on it for PS2, PS4, and PS5)   


If you do have a PS2 laying around, Ace Combat Zero, and 4 are also great.   


Personally Ace Combat 7 was the worst story wise (in my opinion), but graphically breathtaking."

182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-23,So? Nothing in the above comment is not factual besides that he was not brought back immediately in the next installment but instead in a dlc for that next game.
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Supposedly not a clone, no."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,Its not. There's a whole thing with Liara getting your corpse and handing it to Cerberus. They did make a clone of you for spare parts doe who you end up killing in a dlc.
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,Nope they rebuild Shepard from the corpse. The Clone >! comes back as villain in the citadel dlc in 3!<

182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"This is exactly how it went for me. Forced myself to play through as a character I hated and would not learn to like. The game was put together in the wrong order, why they decided to start the game by killing off a character everyone loved then force you to play as the one who murdered him is beyond me. I get that it's trying to show how the world has gotten and the cycle of revenge but it just falls flat"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"I wasn't a fan of the death in the beginning but I was willing to give it a shot. I still enjoyed the characters and the story was more one dimensional but it was still enjoyable. Then the game reset itself and made you play the rest of the game as the bad guy. All subtlety went out the window and they just beat you over the head with the ""lesson"" they wanted you to learn. Then after it should have been over the game tacked on another ending that was basically a rehash of the entire plot but with the opposite ending. The first game is still one of my favorites but I will probably never play 2 again."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,It became too successful for its own good. TLoU said everything it needed to say. I had no desire to continue their story.
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"It's ridiculous because if you remember how cautious and ruthless Joel was in the first game, he'd never realistically be put in the position that he was in in Part II.  The writing is honestly quite terrible.  Not to mention it has such a pointless conclusion.  On the other hand, I couldn't believe how good the game looked.  The visuals and gameplay was absolutely phenomenal.  And the few moments in the game where the game forgot it's own story and just focused on the atmosphere (The hospital and hotel sections with Abby) and gameplay was some of the best stuff you could get on a PS4."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"It was a good story all round and the death felt ok.  Let them tell the story they want to tell I mean that’s what you pay them for, but seriously give it a shot"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,It's a fine game. It just drags on longer than it needed to
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"She lets go of Abby because that moment stops being about her, instead it’s all about Ellie and Joel, and in that instance she finds that inner peace she was desperately searching for. She’s forgiving Joel for what he did but she’s also forgiving herself for what she did to Joel."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"No, TLoU was about Joel/Ellie and their relationship.  That’s it.  Everything else was secondary."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"A lot of people just wanted to play a zombie apocalypse power fantasy game as Action Hero Joel, and they were mad that it went in a different direction away from ""Joel slaughters zombies and renegades with no regard"""
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"I mean you're right that it makes sense story wise but it's not the narrative that was the issue in my opinion. The story was mostly fine. 

The decision to make us play with Joel's killer is what's questionable since it's hard to empathize with someone that the story and the game itself just made you instantly dislike with that scene. Who went ""oh I get to play with the person that just killed my beloved character, yay""?"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"It's like the last third of the game, lol. Dude above you hasn't even touched the game."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"You are right, I recalled incorrectly the facts of a game I completed almost 13 years ago. A Google search confirms it's chapter 14 where you kill Tommy. There are only 15 chapters.

182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,I mean… I can’t speak for the rest of it but his death is impactful in the telltale game itself
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,Scooter's death in Tales (one of 2 best BL games as far as I'm concerned) was the only moment in the entire series where I felt something for a character.
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"5’s story is awful.

Infinite’s story is much improved, but it’s also a soft reboot."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"I'd say it was slightly different than Disney, personally. I think with 343 Halo's, the story is still mostly cohesive. It's just that it feels like a game has been skipped between installments.

In Disney's Star Wars it feels like the movies are actively fighting against one another, retconning plot points, character backgrounds and whatnot, which makes everything feel arbitrary."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,It sucks that the best parts happened in a cutscene and off screen. But 5s story was so stupid they didn't want to finish it. Nor did anyone else.

When the seas heat up and the world falls into global catastrophe I will still be fucking mad. In the afterlife, when I get to the gates of Heaven, St. Peter and his angels will ask me ""Are you still mad about Diablo 3?"" My answer will be yes.     


When the race of man is no more and the ruins of man's cities have crumbled into dust, I will still be mad. Ancient alien civilizations will find the smoldering, volcanic corpse of planet Earth and decode the secrets of the ancient ""internet"" and they will find this post and so my eternal anger will be brought forth into the far-flung reaches of outer space.

182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Yeah, definitely. I like to think that if you choose the first option and go to Wellington without him then he just goes on to survive on his own, without any regrets. He might have lost his initial family, but he saved this new one. That kind of achievement is enough to fuel a man to power through anything."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Just watched it on Youtube, that's a ridiculous way to axe him off."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,Don’t forget Omid was killed in the beginning of TWD season 2
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,It was Thrall crawling away from a Felguard in the background that really got me lol
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Let's not forget Renegade Shepard in Mass Effect 1. 

Shepard: ""I don't like having these aliens on board my ship.""

Presley: ""I don't trust these aliens much.""

Shepard: ""My ship my fucking rules Presley, those aliens are your crew now so learn to get along!""

Renegade Shepard, especially in 1, really is just the ""verbally abuse whoever you're talking to"" option."

182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"I can also think of Soap and Yuri’s deaths in MW3(2011) — you watch Soap die as Yuri, and then watch Yuri die as Price

EDIT you also mistakenly(? my memory of this is pretty vague) kill Mason while playing as Woods in BO2 during one of the flashback missions"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,No. I payed money for those 3 or 4 campaigns and I should be able to play them in their entirety.
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,It’s got even more layers! If anyone has seen Escape From New York it becomes super obvious that Solid Snake is inspired by Snake Plisken.
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,People that haven't seen Escape From New York
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,STOP IMPERSONATING HIM!

Yeah, I remember now it shocked me at the time."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"It wasn't because people disliked it like the comment said, it was simply because he wasn't free for one game but was for the next. If he'd still had scheduling conflicts the character would have stayed dead."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"I mean, kinda a clone? Part clone? They used as much original tissue as they could use, but they did have to grow a bunch of new material, which is why they had a whole other clone, for spare parts"

182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,Best DLC in the series
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,Of mass effect 3 IIRC.
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"I’ve never played ME3, but I’m picturing that goes something like:

“I’m Commander Shepard, and this is my favorite store in the Citadel.”

“No, I’M Commander Shepard, and this is MY favorite store in the Citadel!”"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,Heh I am glad it went that way
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"I searched this up myself and this does not seem to be true. GTA 2 and GTA 3 take place in two completely different universes, so it is impossible for this to happen. Also weirdly both these characters have the same name, Claude, just that GTA 2’s has a last name being speed."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"It’s misery porn for masochists. I guess there are people that exist that enjoy getting their balls kicked in over and over, but I’m definitely not one of them."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"I got told I hate women for disliking the last of us 2. Pretty interesting take. It's wild out here.

EDIT - [Here's the link because apparently that's where we're at.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/17ffoqg/comment/k69u561/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"""No no no! You don't understand, the writing is actually like so deep because it's about how revenge is like, totally bad and stuff and like Ellie broke that cycle and Abby is actually a totally understandable mirror of Joel and Ellie because they are all like so selfish and like took revenge and stuff""

- Some last of us 2 fan probably."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"I always thought the people who dislike TLOU 2 were much louder and more annoying than it’s defenders, which is currently being confirmed here by y’all"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"100% agree. Neil Cuckman single handedly destroyed that game. It could have been soooo much more, but instead we have to play with this beefy ass chick that killed Joel for half the game."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Because Joel’s decision at the end of the first game came with consequences, shocking, I know"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Besides cannibals and the Slavers, no one is the good guy or bad guy. Joel’s decision at the end of the first game came with consequences and Abby is that consequence"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"I would probably view the game a little more favorably if it ended with Abby sparing her and Dina. Shows that she’s a slightly better person than Joel, and Ellie learns mercy > revenge considering she murdered Abby’s pregnant friend. Joel would still be dead, but Ellie gets to live on with Dina and the kid. Bittersweet ending.

But no, gotta make sure they shit on her character like they did Joel.

I traded TLOU2 in the same day I finished the game, and I never do that. Also never planning on replaying it, and never supporting a third one, assuming they even ever get past all the remasters and remakes."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"You realize that Joel is a changed man because of the events from the first game, right? Like you do realize that, no?

Also, it wasn’t Joel that said their names first. It was Tommy and he did it to help calm a shook Abby. They were being chased by a horde and there was a blizzard going on, they couldn’t make it to Jackson. So tell me, how was Joel’s character butchered exactly? They all saved each other’s lives, so naturally there would be a surface level of trust amongst them, no?

You say a pointless conclusion but lemme guess you missed all the themes outside of “revenge is bad”. Y’know things like forgiveness, I’ll give you a hint I’m not talking about Ellie forgiving Abby, she’s forgiving Joel and also herself. She’s letting go so she can move forward and live again. I dunno if you noticed for not but Ellie wasn’t exactly thriving at the Farm, she was drowning"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"How would he never get in that position?

Joel was ruthless and overly cautious in the first game because of the environment he lived in. In Part 2 he’s been living safely in a community for years, and the thing that gets him killed in him telling them his name and then realizing he’s the one they’re looking for. It’s shown very clearly they had no intention of killing anyone else but Joel, so if they never learned his name he probably would’ve been fine."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"I did give it a shot, like I said, I finished the game just so I can criticize it in its entirety. I can respect that you disagree, but nothing anyone will say can change my mind."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,They did!
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"They did tell the story they want to tell, let people criticize things they want to criticize"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,So you are saying TLOU doesn’t take place in a cruel and unfair world?
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"They make you play as the arbiter in halo 2. If you play the campaign you aren't **meant** to immediately like Abby, however as the game progresses you end up empathizing with her way more"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,Having a hard time initially empathizing with Abby is the whole fucking point
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,Or they’ve simply forgot which point of the game it happened because they haven’t played it in 13 years? That would be an extremely weird thing for them to lie about lol.
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,Yeah bro I believe it's literally one of the main catalysts for the finale 🤣
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"So how is saying ""it should have a spoiler tag"" different from saying ""it doesn't have a tag""?"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"LOL considering you're fighting with people in two subreddits, perhaps you should look in the mirror"

182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Exactly this, it was really well done on tales. 

Playing bl2 then tales, then commander lilith Dlc worked well to bridge the gap between 2+3"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"The Reclaimer Trilogy has been such a mess, which is a shame because I thought that Halo 4 had a pretty strong story despite the gameplay being mediocre.

Halo 5 pretty much undid Halo 4’s story by bringing back Cortana and turning her into a villain and Halo Infinite undid Halo 5’s story by turning her good again and killing her off screen.

The who saga just felt like putting bandages over a big water leak."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Personally I think 5’s plot actually has pretty decent ideas, they’re just really poorly carried out (in terms of characters, dialogue general story beats, etc.) while Infinite’s plot is pretty terrible but done in a much better way."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,And now they’re probably going to do another soft reboot because of what people said about Infinite…
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"I watched the first two sequels back to back before the third and they work a lot better together. Yeah TLJ didn’t go in the expected direction, but it still mostly felt like a proper follow up to TFA. TROS then tried to undo TLJ and made the whole thing feel like a mess."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"yea they jumped to the end of VASTLY MORE IMPORTANT ARCS, in my opinion at least"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,Same.  He was such an important character lore wise and deserved a noble death.
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,You have my sword
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,You mean even a deckard later
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"And Crista is killed off screen to get replaced with a different pregnant black woman who has less characterization and also dies extremely in a lackluster contrived way. I kinda hate season 2, like a lot."

182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Didnt seem right, sure the choice is there but its low and near sighted. Despite being an asshole in one, one still becomes a specter, has to play ball. Its almost inconceivable. Now a Turian First contact war, told through pinnacle station- i can get the xenophobe"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"I'm not telling you otherwise bro.

Personally I think it's stupid, lest everyone wants the game to be like 400 gigs, but I understand it. but I'm not disagreeing with you entirely, nor saying anything of the sort with that comment. 

I was just letting you know that the first mission is available to play."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,I loved that movie growing up. I felt like I was in on some secret as most of my friends hadn’t watched or even heard of that 80s action movie but my dad had good taste. It takes me back to morning with red dawn or navy seals.
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"He would have, but would he have a dedicated DLC he would be brought back in if people didn't hate it so much? I still don't see anything you or he has corrected about that comment.

They also chose to kill the character off in a terrible way. The scheduling conflict might be the reason he was written out of the game, but they could have made his death either more meaningful or found a different way to remove him from the game, so I also fail to accept it as a wholistic explanation for how his character was treated."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"They specifically said they wanted to keep the same brain, same logic, same morals. The clone didn't have any of that.

They used the base body, and, well, fixed holes here and there with cybernetics."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"I remember talking to the ""bad guy"" halfway through and my stupid ass went ""Oh, she has the same hair as me, cool!""

And then I stopped and went ""Hey wait, could it be- Nahhhh that has to be the fan fiction brain talking."" And then went back to thinking it's a cool coincidence. And felt so stupid yet smart when we met the villain."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Actually, you murder your clone, then get brought up on charges and get off on a technicality since suicide is legal in the ME universe and I'm lying my ass off"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"I would say my information comes from OPM. The official PlayStation magazine from around15-20 years ago. As I said I don’t have anything at hand but they mention in print that it’s the same character. Now, that could just be an editorial."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Again, I gotta ask you people:

How is TLOU2 ""misery porn"" but the first one isn't? Y'know? The one where the guy's daughter dies in the first hour? Then has the gay couple who's partner committed suicide? And then the ending where Joel mercs everyone because he can't let go of Ellie?

Like, TLOU (the first one) very clearly establishes that it is a cruel and unfair world that everyone is living in. So why do so many players get upset when something cruel and unfair happens to Joel in the sequel?

And then they bitch ""bad writing"". Because their idea of a good TLOU sequel is to just do the first game again. I just don't get it."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"That's probably the best simple description of the game: misery porn with no real payoff.

The last of us 1 was a game about finding hope in nothing and was a simple yet heartwarming cross-country road trip between a father-daughter dynamic, and the ending presents you with a very real, very human, morally grey question.

The last of us 2 says ""yeah fuck that"" and sends you on a pretty dull 25 hour long revenge mission where you don't get revenge because revenge bad. Roll credits."

182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Near release I got told I was a Homophobic woman hating bigot because I wanted to play as Ellie instead of Abby.

I still don't know how they came to that conclusion. Tlou2 fan's brains operate on higher realms of thinking us mortals could only dream of achieving."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Same, and also that I’m homophobic. As a gay woman, that was news to me"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,yea youre either a bigot or sexist for not liking a show that has a woman in it. People just dont know how to argue points
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,It’s not because the defenders can easily call the dislikers sexist/bigots/homophobic for not liking the game. Which is why most people don’t give their true opinions on the game and why it’s such a touchy topic
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,Sorry you couldn’t handle your weak emotions
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Yeah, it definitely was not more complicated then that, or anything"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"It seems anytime anyone criticizes this game all anyone who likes it sees is people upset that Joel died. Maybe if you actually knew how to read you'd see that the issue I had with the game wasn't that Joel died it was that they had him killed by a character we didn't know then tried to build that character and her motives. Like I said, maybe had they done that FIRST the game wouldn't have been a slog to get through."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Eh, the friends death was her own fault. All the two of them had to do was tell Ellie where Abby was. She had no intention of killing either of them. The dude tells Ellie where she is and Ellie starts backing away, and then the friend comes down with a case of the stupids and tries to kill Ellie with a knife."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"They didn’t shit on Ellie tho. In fact she’s finally free because she found her inner peace and is able to move forward again.

In case you didn’t know Ellie was drowning in her PTSD and trauma, yeah she was happy with Dina and JJ, but she wasn’t healthy and eventually she would’ve broke.

Also, because you missed all that you probably didn’t see that Ellie is wearing Dina’s bracelet when she returns to the Farm. She didn’t have it during Santa Barbara, and her guns are also not with her on her return, so there’s already a good chance she returned to Jackson and made up with Dina. She’s just going back to put Joel to rest"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,Well man I’m sorry we do don’t have the same experience
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,Exactly. You didn’t give it a shot. You went in determined to hate it and already deciding that you wouldn’t change your opinion.
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,Then maybe we let people critcize people criticizing things they want to criticize as well.
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"I never played Halo so I don't know the context of your example. 

I don't believe a game giving you a reason to not enjoy playing a part of it is the best of ideas, playing Abby felt like a chore I had to do in order to get to play Ellie after.

Again, to be clear, I have nothing against the role she played in the story, I only think it was a turnoff to be forced to play her after Joel's death, it took a while to get the mood to get back to the game."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Clearly it was only ""initially"" given the game's completion reactions /s"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"This, this exactly. I made an obviously huge mistake in my recollection of the sequence of events for the second game."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Yet apparently he remembered it being specifically the first mission? Quite a selective memory. /s

People repeat hearsay or outright lie on Reddit and the Internet in general all the time. The first mission is in freaking WW2 Italy and about the 1st third of the game barely has you interact with the Mafia directly. You might not remember the exact point where you kill Tommy but there's no way you mistake it for the first mission if you actually played the game."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Yes and the more I think about it I do recall the first mission was in Italy, you're in the army, and really it's just a way to show you how to use the different guns mechanics. 

I feel like our friend above was out to crucify me for recalling wrong."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Compare to posts that have spoiler tags but don’t need them. They should not have one. This one, on the other hand, actually deserves one.

Can you not read¿"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"You would be incorrect, at the time there were at least 3 living people in hell."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,He is joking. A good antagonist is sympathetic like (to me) Roy in Blade Runner and Thanos (when I'm stuck in traffic)
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"It does.   
From a certain point of view."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"the seeds of cortana becoming evil were well set up in 4, it’s just everything else that was set up in 4 was ignored 

cortana’s return should’ve been saved for 6 as the leader of the remnants of whatever you defeat in 5, which should be the bad guys i don’t remember in 4"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"I can see that.

5’s insistence on >!focusing on Agent Locke & repeatedly bringing back the Warden as a bullet sponge boss!< ruined the campaign for me."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,Infinite was just a series of copy pasted empty fields and copy pasted metallic hallways. The entire game is lifeless I could hardly even focus on whatever boring plot they were trying to land
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"They’re too busy gouging gamers for core colours, I’ve lost all faith in 343.

With Staten now at Netflix, I don’t trust anyone else to write the next story either."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"TROS was in a tricky spot with fan rage and also needing to wrap up the saga not just the trilogy, for that i say for the most part it did well, definitely should’ve been longer and had a bit more time in the oven though. 

it works well on rewatch though, especially if you take its “undoing” as more “challenging the concept”"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,He deserved a proper D2 style pre rendered death scene at the very least
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,">a noble death

Or at the very least a bitterly depressing but fully rendered cinematic death reminding you of the senseless brutally that is suppose to be the world of Diablo and that it isn’t fair, and people don’t get a noble death here — not a goddamn butterfly bitch in game cutscene."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,And my bow.
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,How is she killed off screen?  I always thought she just never saw Clem again.
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"It should just be like how Master Chief Collection works. Finished the campaign? Cool, you can uninstall that specific one to save space."
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Ok that's fair. I just think rather than a wipe, they could've released a separate game"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"Illusive man didn't want mind control either, which in hindsight was a mistake on his part when you disobey him"
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,Sounds like the magazine messed up and said misinformation
182b9o0,2023-11-23,2023-11-24,"""No, but don't you get it? It's about making you realise that the enemies are humans too, and that's groundbreaking, and no game has explored that before that before""


NieR: Automata has trash can robots as enemies, and I feel they get a better ""humanise"" treatment than the last of us 2 gave any of their enemies. I genuinely felt bad killing those tin bastares towards the end.

And I say this despite liking the last of us 2 overall, the combat is good despite being really similar to the original game, it looks fantastic, and  the level design is enjoyable. It's just that the story falls flat. And you can show this because I bet 80% of people can't name the dude who got shot in the theatre despite him being a major side character or anyone of abbys companions. There are just too many side characters who aren't well developed or memorable enough for their deaths to mean anything ,other than Joel. This, coupled with the revenge is bad because everyone is human, there for the only way to have peace is to move on and forgive, yourself/ the ""enemie"", theme, not really landing, leads to a pretty bland story.

She didnt spare Abbie because she randomly realised revenge bad. She didnt even consider sparing Abbie until she met Lev and Lev begged her not to. She hated who Abbie made her become, and she didnt want to do the same thing to another innocent child.

In halo, you play as a super soldier, master chief.

In halo 2, as you play the story you switch back and forth between Master Chief on Earth fighting the covenant (bad aliens), and the Arbiter (an Alien soldier with the covenant). It's literally no different from Abby and Ellie in TLOU2

As the game goes on Abby is actually like 10x more likeable than Ellie as well lol

Yes, she had moments of rage and contempt, but those were also accompanied by moments of existential wonder and a deep sadness, all thanks to her rampancy. But her final act was a sacrifice play because she loved John.

Imo, bringing Cortana back, especially as a villain, is one of the biggest narrative blunders I've ever seen in a video game."

Rey being a nobody was a good call in my opinion, as it makes Star Wars about more than just bloodlines and gives us a truly new character rather than just another descendant of a powerful villain. Kylo Ren killing his master and becoming leader lead to a much more complex conflict then simply retreading Return of the Jedi, then they brought back Palpatine and redid the ROTJ ending anyways. And Palpatine is back for no explained reason, and exists simply to give the story a bad guy for the good guys to defeat. It doesn’t seem to have gone over well with TLJ haters or TLJ fans, and feels like safe, bland filmmaking that tries as little as possible.

Yes... Because by taking *revenge* then the cycle would continue, and obviously this is *bad*.

Hence- revenge bad. You can dress it up with all the words you want, but the entire moral of the story is literally ""revenge bad"" no matter how you look at it.

You do realise that is the theme of every anti-revenge story? And you just described the 2 basic are core elements of an anti-revenge plotline, that being forgiveness and moving on from the past.

Which might be explained by her being a bit put off by her bf being Abby’s ex and the obvious feelings the two still have for each other. I guess that while she resented and disliked Abby, she still didn’t want her dead.

Mel also seemed to be the most sane of Abby’s friends. She didn’t really seem all that interested in actually finding Joel, and kept suggesting that they give up and go home."

I vividly remember a couple times when I would just run around the Tangled Shore, and see fellow Guardians running alongside Spider's Fallen crew as part of the final Forsaken mission.

Even then most of these areas are linked together, and some of them are even reused for Strikes. Even if you play solo, the worlds are designed so you can move between the zones seamlessly. It's not like actual singleplayer campaigns where you load your own private match setup and just play by yourself."

Let’s say you have a friend that takes their life, you maybe saw a couple signs but they went blatant, but you’re filled with regret and some guilt thinking you could’ve done something , who are you gonna get your revenge on?

* Congress for the most part has no idea what they are doing when it comes to software. Remember these guys learned to type for type writers NOT computers.
* Its the algorithm portion of tiktoc that they are most afraid of. Imagine a short form video telling people to protest FEMA workers during a national disaster. The damage to public trust would be immense."

1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,Under this law the president can technically finagle his way to banning them if he so chooses. It’s a dangerous law.

1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,"Why are people being so stupid about this. U.S isn't going to ban every Chinese company nor do they ever have plans to. This entire thing was because the company that owns Tik Tok also owns Marvel Snaps and they chose to shut it down themselves... temporarily. The amount of posts I see wondering if they're gonna shut down other games owned by Chinese companies is so incredibly stupid. If that was the case, Marvel Rivals would also be on the chopping block. Also, the U.S has no interest in cutting off China anyways. You know how much money U.S makes off of blockbuster movies in China?"

1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,"Thanks for offering a proper response.

So point 2 in the quote seems to say ""social media company"" but there definition of such isn't clear within the law. Also 2(g)(3)(B) is probably what point 2 is referring to but that does not specifically say ""social media"" nor does it point to a specific definition that I can see other than to 2(g)(2)(A) which defines a ""covered company"" as:

>The term “covered company” means an entity that operates, directly or indirectly (including through a parent company, subsidiary, or affiliate), a website, desktop application, mobile application, or augmented or immersive technology application that—

>(i) permits a user to create an account or profile to generate, share, and view text, images, videos, real-time communications, or similar content;

>(ii) has more than 1,000,000 monthly active users with respect to at least 2 of the 3 months preceding the date on which a relevant determination of the President is made pursuant to paragraph (3)(B);

>(iii) enables 1 or more users to generate or distribute content that can be viewed by other users of the website, desktop application, mobile application, or augmented or immersive technology application; and

>(iv) enables 1 or more users to view content generated by other users of the website, desktop application, mobile application, or augmented or immersive technology application.

This is the actual definition of what's in scope since there's no legal definition of ""social media"" that I'm aware of, nor is it referenced if it were. If you look at 2(g)(2)(A)(i), (iii) and (iv) it seems that what Fortnite offers is within scope since Creative mode allows you to create and share content. Once again, I absolutely could be wrong but I'm looking for some evidence as to why it wouldn't be in scope."

There's nothing I've seen in the law that provides an exemption based on that. The defining clause effectively reads ""based in a foreign adversary country or 20% owned by them"". There is no innate protection I can see for simply being US based."
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,"An outdated figure, it's mentioned in the article itself which says it issued a correction after Epic reached out to them. Tencent's share has reduced over the years but it's still over 20%."
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-19,"But Marvel Snap was affected because it's owned by Bytedance, even though Nuverse isn't a social media company"
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-19,"This might be right but can you please show me where it defines social media companies in such a way that it's out of scope for Tencent owned companies to be defined as such?

Also, there is no provision for other ByteDance owned company bans to be lifted in the event of a TikTok sale since ByteDance and TikTok are listed separately in the Act itself. I don't think people are understanding the question."

But going beyond that, laws that grant major powers like this can always go beyond the scope of whatever the original ""point"" was. We have many such cases throughout history. If today they're saying TikTok is brainwashing the youth, what's to stop them moving on to say Fortnite and League of Legends are doing the same?

The president can modify the list of foreign adversary nations, but which companies and apps it applies to  is unlimited.  Basically, if the country is an enemy of the U.S., it cannot control a significant portion of our communication infrastructure.

These sorts of restrictions have long been in place in the U.S.  For example The Radio Act of 1927 banned foreign (not just adversary) ownership of any radio station.  Such restrictions have been long upheld as valid, as long as they are aimed at the foreign nation, *not* the people's speech.  In this case, there are very many domestic alternatives to TikTok, and the ban has nothing to do with stopping U.S. users from saying stuff, but is instead aimed at the Chinese government's ability to sway various elections and blackmail our representatives into supporting pro-Chinese positions and laws (or push propaganda right before an election to get their puppet candidates elected, as Russia did in Romania a few weeks ago).

Several of our elected representatives have already reported being contacted by Chinese spies with such threats, which is why the urgency.  This Act merely extends such jurisprudence from radio to other forms of communication, which is why it is both bipartisan in Congress, and upheld by the Supreme Court by 9 to 0."

1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,"China hacked our phones not all that long ago. Why haven't we banned them from having anything to do with our phones for ""national security"" reasons? China apparently has unlimited access to practically every phone now. At least if you believe the news from a few weeks ago."
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,"The data is also exclusively held and maintained here in the US under our surveillance systems, and not in mainland China directly tied to a CCP server.

Bytedance however, is in direct cooperation with the CCP at all times and is regularly used as a weapon to carry out Chinese state intelligence operations.

Allowing apps/games from companies who haven't completely divested from being directly linked to the CCP (thus cooperating with their 2017 intelligence laws) are expected to be letting the Chinese government carry out operations on anyone that connects to those games/apps.

This isn't a ""Google knows you like BBC now"" kind of emergency, this is a ""China can mark you as an important target and is literally able to scrape every piece of data you've ever created and realistically put a hit on you within US soil"" kind of emergency.

So unless you like the idea of your own digital footprint possibly being the connecting reason that leads to Chinese assassins being able to operate swiftly and efficiently within our own borders, this ban ultimatum was the only option."
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-19,"As far as I understand, the concern is that even though Tencent is very hands off, there is still a chance that the Chinese government tells them at some point to be much more hands on and follow government directions. Not like they can just say no.

Well, at least that's the only fair criticism (and even though it's fair, I don't really think it's likely or an immediate threat like it is portrayed), the rest is a lot of ""China bad"", which also kind of started the whole mess in the first place. The real solution here would be proper regulation of what data can and cannot be collected from users which would quell concerns of foreign governments getting access to that. But of course the US has a vested interest in still allowing US based companies to have that access, so can't anger the tech billionaires too much. Privacy first design helps the users too much, imagine that."
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,"As far as the government cares what really matters is how much user information is being funneled back to Tencent from Riot.  The government doesn't really care if it's just a monetary investment, at least not per this bill.  So even if Tencent was more hands on so long Riot can prove that data isn't being shared then they should be fine.  And with Riot being based in America, thats something that the US government can much more easily demand and enforce."

That said TikTok was *made* in China and they merely based the company outside of China, it would be like if Zukerberg made a new company for an app, then had them based out of Australia or something."
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-19,"As someone else said, TikTok also has/had a US HQ. Within the definition of the Act, I can't see a distinction for companies that are US based if they are over 20% owned by a defined foreign adversary. I'm looking for someone to show me that in the Act, if I'm wrong. In the case of Riot Games, they are 93% owned by Tencent. They are effectively a Chinese business operating in the US. You can't use servers or HQ or employees as an excuse when TikTok had all of that."
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,"They purchased 48% (at time of purchase? which then levelled out into 40% after the sale. I knew it was a significant share and just did a quick google to get the figure, was a simple error using an outdated figure. I updated my post as soon as you pointed it out. Materially it has no effect on the scope of the legislation since the facts remain that Sweeney is majority owner and the bar is set at 20%."

1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,"Also, by giving Trump credit preemptively, in theory that puts more pressure on him because any ban that comes after this will land on him in the eyes of users."

All it takes is a fair argument from the President at which point whether it's upheld or not will go to court.

Your latter point is something I considered and I did say ""if"" they were actually banned in my original post. Do you have evidence of this being the case because I can absolutely believe it. However, the law does say that ByteDance subsidiaries are explicitly within scope so it's a bit up in the air for me."
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,I don't think you understood my point. It's about the Act as written and defined. TikTok is irrelevant here (outside of its specific naming within the act for the purposes of definition). My question is about how this Act could affect the games industry. I'm asking mostly from a place of academic interest. I read the Act and it got me thinking.
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,"> Are you arguing you should let a declared enemy propaganda machine free and unlimited access while they do fully block your own ?

Why would making TikTok an American owned company change anything it does? The law explicitly states that if they were America based, it would be fine to continue gathering and selling data to anyone. Just like what Meta, Google and Twitter is doing right now. 

Did everyone forget about Cambridge Analytica and how the sale of personal data led to one of the biggest disinfo campaigns in the UK? And the fact that they were involved with the 2016 US election?

Facebook and Instagram are provably worse than Tiktok, so far, as adversaries of democracy and freedom. And this isn't a defence of Tiktok. They are bad too, all of it is fucking terrible."
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-22,"Tencent, from what I've seen, are absolutely foremost concerned with making money.

They tend to be very hands-off after making purchases of companies, content to just take their ownership to the bank each quarter.

Now, that's not \*always\* true.  But it is more true than most other companies that love to get directly involved, and often muck things up.

Tencent seen the writing on the wall about foreign paranoia from the USA, and took an extra step back.  Again, because they want to keep their profit coming, uninterrupted, more than they care about meddling."

1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,"Being determined to be a military company does not automatically make something a national security threat. The law specifically targeted and banned ByteDance and everything they own (I will leave the interpretation of why they targeted that specific company up to others) and also empowered the president to ban other companys after some determination about them is made.

So per the law, anything owned by ByteDance is banned. Other social media companies *might* be banned if the President chooses to determine they are a national security threat and also chooses to pursue a ban. It is not automatic.

Your problem with the law, that it seeminly makes zero sense in how it is targetted and formulated, is natural. The law is pretty awful. The only reason it was allowed according to the SC is that Chinese companies are not granted the rights afforded to US companies. If this had targetted a US company the law would be illegal. 

It is, fundamentally, a way to shut down ByteDance. It also expands presidential powers to give them the authority to shut down any foreign social media they apparently do not like. It is a one-two punch of targeted enforcement and expanded presidential power.

If it were actually about shutting down data use and manipulation by foreign governemnts, it would be a much more complex and well thought out piece of legislation."

Not to mention that Tencent is in China and Riot is in the US, staffed by US people. I'd assume if something truly nefarious came through Riot would probably go to the US government. 

Also, I think more people are now not caring about their data, either China gets it or someone else does and let's not act like the US and stuff are that much better. Some no longer care about their data, like does it matter if they know my age, many companies online know about me and my usage habits, that sorta thing."
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,"It has to be more than China telling Tencent to be more hands on for this to apply. China would have to be able to compel the non-Tencent company to supply it info for military/intelligence purposes, and there are more ways to prevent/deal with that if you're a US-HQ'd corporation (such as reporting any such demand to the relevant agencies in the US). 

And regulating how and what data can be collected isn't enough (not that it shouldn't be done, but rather because it's only good for regulating relatively trustworthy entities, there needs to be more), because there's really now way to verify that a Foreign Adversary hasn't collected said data and there isn't trend for any enforcement of similar regulations from the commerce side of things for being anything more than slap-on-the-wrist fines."

1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,From my understanding the law was written because tic tics parent company is Chinese but the tictoc was registered in the US so it did have certain protections that US companies had but the parent company was doing sketchy shit with the data (they would just get the data from tictoc) so they were essentially outside of US law when it comes to prosecution/regulation whilst enjoying all the benefits of being a US company. Basically it closed a loophole which exists due to how tictoc/byte dance is structured which I think is fair enough really.

Everything after, all the justifications like their algorithm or everything else, was a pretense to get that ban in place.

There is a reason it was unbanned. And as long as ByteDance kisses orange ass, they'll remain unbanned.

So /u/LazyWings - to answer your question: the reason those other companies aren't on the banning block is because this is all about *politics* and not *policy*. If those other companies start making anti-Trump noises, then they too will be on the banning block.

1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,"The ban, was intended to force them to sell to Musk, or a Musk wannabe, then turn it into another MAGA haven."
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,"> How would you find out? 

You really think there aren't a million security nerds out there that scrutinize that kind of shit as a hobby to unwind on the weekend?

If it was doing anything we'd probably know by now. 

Even **if** the Chinese government decided to abuse it, it would be a one time thing that would burn Riot and TenCent to the ground. You can bet your ass that Riot would tell them to fuck off even if TenCent tried to make them, they're an American company and they aren't about to not only torpedo their company but piss off the federal government sucking up to Pooh Bear.

They say, no fuck off. And then whats TenCent going to do? Take them to US Federal court to make them do something thats blatantly illegal and a national security risk? Lol please."
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,The nefarious thing I’m talking about is launching a cyberattack in some sort of context. 
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,"Because there are people like me who run network sniffers and monitor what their computer is sending out and receiving.

But if they only pushed the malicious update to targeted users, that might go undetected. Like if it sent a different update to any IP blocks owned by Boeing and people were playing at work. Which is a security failure on that employees part, and probably whoever runs their firewall.

(the ones that run the firewall are the most likely to be playing games at work in my experience.)"
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,"Unless you have really really important documents which may threaten national security, what does it matter if they're collecting your data tho?

I am not sure what the Chinese government is gonna do with all the memes or university notes saved on my laptop 🤷"
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-21,Lots of apps scrapping data. Most live service games. Probably Steam as well.
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,"For sure, you can teach them to ignore the stuff on the table, or the sausage you dropped on the floor, but that's also where the analogy falls down. Influence can be conscious or subconscious, and that pet will always be thinking ""FUCK THAT FOOD IS DELICIOUS"" no matter how much you train them, so if you're not able to consciously see the manipulation, there's only so much you can do to stop it."
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,"Yeah

You’re never going to whack a mole away manipulators and keep them away from the American populace. The only defense is getting the American populace to stop falling for manipulation. 

Too many people think that’s a lost cause, but also bizarrely think we should still try and shield dumb American eyes from the dangerous words lest we get brainwashed. 

If someone has given up on the American people and thinks no better of them than dogs to be trained, we’ve lost already. There’s no way to win. "
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,Man I literally don't care about TikTok being singled out. I'm from the UK. We still have TikTok. I can go on it right now. I'm talking about the technical powers offered by the legislation. People are downvoting me because they're misreading some sort of agenda when I have a genuine question. I'm upfront about my political views. I wouldn't be posting here if it was about that... I'm interested in the potential impact on the games industry if this legislation continues to stand as it is. I even got some fairly good answers in between all the idiocy.
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,"So make *that* illegal.

It's not, by the way. Nothing currently stops Facebook or Reddit or Riot or any other media company or website or app from selling or giving that data to China or *anyone else*.

Instead, this law was drafted to ban TikTok *in particular*. (And now it's been unbanned because they kissed the ring. If the ban was such a good idea, why reverse it? And worse yet, why reverse it without telling anyone *why* it's been reversed.)"

1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,"I think it is the fact that you are asking a question itself that confuses me. If I adopt that ""will"" was a typo, then I am not really seeing why you are asking why they are not in scope. You seem to understand it perfectly fine. They are probably within the scope.

It is absolutely broad enough of a definition that the president could define basically any company with any foreign ownership as a threat with only minimal definitional straining on the part of the president.

Congress has been slowly granting the President more and more power over the years, and the courts have been expanding it even more. It is pretty disturbing."
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,"You would be an incredible exception, and I as a person would never assume that my understanding of the technology to be greater than a government who invests a lot into intelligence warfare. 

That being said most of it isn’t about personal attacks, China cares about America, not individual Americans imo. They probably don’t care about “your” data. Just data in general. "
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,"You could say that about anything, until they find a way to use the knowledge maliciously. Just because you don’t care that they have your information, doesn’t make it not an issue. "
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,"it just needs to be the 0.01% of people who are handling important access or even people who share computers/communication with people who handle important access for the software to serve its purpose. when that software is installed on so many millions of Americans’ devices, the chance of them finding what they want (or taking control of critical systems) becomes non-zero. Think of all the non-zero people that try to make War Thunder “more accurate” over the past few years."
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-21,"Yup, those aren’t enemy nations that America is in an information Cold War with though. "
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,"It's a bit of both, people need to be smarter, and one of the ways to do that is to let them think for themselves on the stuff that doesn't really matter. But some of the more subversive influence does need to be tackled by others, as it's almost impossible to see when you're in it."
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,"Then I don't know what to tell you. You've framed your arguments poorly if you are truly neutral in this.


For the record, I'm not neutral. I hope the rest of social media gets the same treatment "
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,"Have you even read the bill?  I'd just suggest you do, alot of what you're saying is not true"
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-21,It's probably going to be a moot point anyways since TikTok has apparently decided to become the propaganda machine they were accused of being. But for the US government.
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,This is the same reason we know that your phone isn't recording your voice and sending it to Google or whatever. There are a *lot* of nerds with wireshark out there. Someone would catch it if anything significant happened.
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,"Yeah but you gotta remember the sheer amount of nerds like us that **do** that shit and are **trained** in that shit and have infosec jobs.

One nerd probably won't catch it, but with big enough numbers people will notice something is fishy and start talking about it with other nerds.

Don't underestimate crowd sourced knowledge. A lot of researchers use it to make scarily accurate predictions on things."
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,"There's no way they can use any of my info maliciously. It's just memes, games, and university stuff. 

The most they can do is give me targeted ads, which is good. I'd rather see ads of products that may interest me than see random ads tbh.

They can monitor your activity, but they can't install keyloggers. So they can't obtain your banking info.

I am not sure why people make such a big deal about their ""data"" tbh."
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-21,I mean they can sell these data to whomever they want.
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,"Pretty much every comment I've made on the matter has been saying ""law says this, does that mean this?"" - I don't know how much more neutral I can get. I'm convinced the majority of responses are knee jerk reactions from people who haven't taken any time to read or understand what I've said, or made any attempts to read the legislation I'm referencing. I'm not arguing a point, I'm asking a question and testing my understanding. If someone makes a point, it's my job to test that too. That's literally how you learn!"
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,"Have you?

The bill literally only applies to TikTok (Called out by name), and 'Any other company that the president determines is controlled by a foreign adversary). It's literally up to his whim to determine this."
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,"You are thinking personal levels. The Chinese government doesn’t care about you, they care about America. So they collect all American data to be used as they can. 

So no, you might not be personally attacked, but you are giving a enemy nation that your nation is currently in a information Cold War with, and if your country is negatively impacted, you will eventually also. 

I also am saying this not for your benefit as you sound like a Chinese government apologist, but for other people that don’t automatically trust another country’s government, especially when they are known for questionable actions. "
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-21,"True, they could even sell to China! 

Of course those aren’t enemy nations companies who are based in western countries and their executives can be held to account for their actions unlike most of tencent. "
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,I think you may have tried so hard to appear neutral that it came across as excessive and insincere?
1i5bvkb,2025-01-19,2025-01-20,"Yes?

I feel like you watched a viral Tik Tok and are just repeating points...

Going from playing Borderlands 2 on PC to trying to play on Xbox made me feel sick (literally) I have to change the FOV of most games these days like Bioshock Infinite, Skyrim etc because they look nasty on PC in default.

But this game is so hyped yet only on Ps3 :("
1lut93,2013-09-06,2013-09-06,"Use them all up. Seriously. I figured out that if you just hoard the little ammo they give you the game never bothers to give you any more ammo. If you use it and kill the enemies you use it on they're much more likely to drop ammo since the game won't leave you without any ammo at all. 

My general rule of thumb for Survivor was to stealth most areas and just go completely insane in areas where killing everyone is just easier than stealthing your way through. The game practically hands you bags full of bricks in every area and they're all you ever need to whoop ass in that game.

If you have really low supplies like in OP's pic then that's just proving you have poor resource management. If you're using shivs on anything other than shiv doors you're doing it wrong (you can play however you want just don't be surprised you have no scissors if you constantly shiv kill people). "

In the TLOU AMA, one of the creators made a comment that this game REALLY uses the HD. While I have a 160 GB drive, I had only installed 3 games before getting this one. Maybe this game is using a very large amount of gigs as extra virtual memory."
1lut93,2013-09-06,2013-09-07,"Club them with a brick.  Don't throw it, hang on to it and beat them with it.  Bricking satisfies.  "
1lut93,2013-09-06,2013-09-07,"Of course. You have to be careful if you try to kill them with a brick though. It's very easy for them to just ignore you're swing and insta-kill you if you don't do it right. It's extremely satisfying if you pull it off though and you save a lot of supplies by not using arrows, shivs, or ammo on them.

Classic signs of heat issues. If you can start out playing any game, and it takes a while before it decides to crash, it's usually going to be caused by overheating. It's true for any game system or PC. And yes, if it gets louder, it means it's getting hotter. The fan ramps up in speed to try and compensate for the increase in temperature.

Get a can of compressed air to blow out any dust through the vents. Or if you're feeling adventurous, find a guide online to tear your PS3 apart and clean it properly."
wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-08-22,I think it's overhated but it's definitely not a masterpiece either

The writing just holds back what would otherwise be a really good game. I'd give it like a 5 or a 6, maybe? Somewhere around just an average title for me."

Also the cozy and relatively safe life will influence the attitude of Joel and Tommy, but I am not sure the influence level… After all, 5 years may be short for change of habit and personality?"

wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-08-22,I just got hated on for saying it was a great fucking game LMAO. Thank you.
wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-08-22,"I thought it was amazing as well. I went into it blind, only knowing that it had people hating on it, but not knowing why. As I was playing, I kept waiting to find the part that turned people off on the game. After many hours of playing I was enjoying it and couldn’t find anything. Then I did hit one scene that I assumed made people upset: the Abby sex scene. It took me by surprise, and it wasn’t even that graphic, but they could’ve done a fade-to-black a few seconds sooner and got the message across. It still didn’t bother me or take away from the game, but I figured that was what made everyone upset. Then I beat the game, and there was nothing else I could find that would make people so mad, so I had to check online to see where the hate came from.

I was surprised by what I read. I get everyone has their opinion, but man, the hate from the game’s different creative decisions was insane. The Joel death scene was a big problem for a lot of people, and yeah it was brutal, but it hooked me in because not only did I want revenge, but you’re left wondering who the people were that murdered Joel and why. And that played into the point of view switch later on too. When that happened, I thought it was cool because now I could see things from a different perspective and see what led up to everything. Little did I know this was another part people didn’t like, but again, while I was playing, I thought it was cool.

But everyone has their opinion, so to each their own. But sometimes the hate bandwagon can get a little too crazy, because when people start taking personal attacks at the director and voice actors of the game, you know things are getting a little out of hand."
wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-08-22,Classic bait post.
wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-08-22,"I loved playing this game, I'm trying to do a second playthrough right now but man oh MAN is this game brutal. Like, it's so good at what it sets out to do that I feel miserable while playing it, lol"
wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-08-22,"It's second on my list.

The first one is mass effect andromeda.

And the third one is fallout 76

There is a big message in the game which haters don't understand.

Revenge only brings suffering. And it is bad for the main characters. The life of main characters  is a valuable thing. Side characters are cattles, so you can murder them or torture them..

But Don't  forget about main characters. Because they are important. And fuck side characters even when they are not the reason for your suffering.

But main characters are like people. Side characters are chicken.

Just forgive one main character after a long killing spree to get your redemption. Because you're a main character too."
wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-08-22,I won't rank it equal to part 1 but it is 7 or 7.5 out of 10.
wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-08-22,"Honestly I believe a lot of the hate was reactionary in nature (I mean the game getting review bomb literally minutes after the game release kind of prove as much). And it became one of those cultural battleground similar to Star Wars: The Last Jedi or Captain Marvel where the positives are ignored for nonsensical reasons (like being woke) and any flaws with the story or writing is hyper focus on. I mean the harassment that Neil Druckmann and Laura Bailey gotten certainly reminded me of those situations. And once it because one of those cultural battleground situations, people will rarely budge from their position (especially when they hate it)

Like anyone who said the game is trash is just objectively wrong based on the game mechanics alone. Some may not like the story which I think can be subjective, what isn’t subjective however is the improvement of gameplay in terms of shooting, AI, stealth etc. Like when it come to gameplay, it blown everything that ND did in at least the past decade out of the water and it became more like the game that the original TLoU promised to be when the gameplay was first reveal

Personally I thought the story of both games are around similar quality but if I’m being honest, I kind of prefer the second one more for being more daring if that make sense. Like I loved the first one but I think it’s fair to say that the story did use familiar tropes (like the hardened old survivor having to work with a young naive but hopeful child for example) which make it feel a little safe at time whereas the second one was more willing to go against norms and expectations. I mean I thought having you play as Abby during Ellie and her confrontation was brilliant and how it force you to go against someone that you have played as and sided with for so long."
wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-08-22,"I agree, I was expecting a cynical, lazy sequel and got a brilliant twist on the seemingly-established formula. Ideas that weren't necessarily new to storytelling, but done in a novel way allowed only by an interactive medium. There is nothing I like more than being given something I didn't know I wanted, and full kudos to the creative team for actually treading some new ground. And like... risking some decisions that would make people mad."
wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-08-22,"Absolutely, I actually found myself on Abby’s side and was so conflicted in the end game battles. I loved the way the last fight ended and was really holding my breath there"
wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-08-22,"After playing through the game and loving the hell out of it, I came to the conclusion that gamers are brain dead. The game beautifully explores grief and the revenge born from it, and it does so from two opposing perspectives. I lost a few people I cared about during the pandemic and I could truly see myself in both of these characters throughout the game. 

And the ending evoked feelings similar to those I felt after the ending of the first game; the uncertainty of the choice, the futility of the quest, but there was an added cathartic element woven in with the flashbacks of Joel. I could write a whole fucking essay on how masterful the storytelling was, and I honestly might when I do a second play through.

I had the game lightly spoiled for me (Joel, character switch, ending) cause I followed the drama when it came out, but I really really wish I could’ve gone in blind. What a masterpiece."
wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-08-22,I agree with you. It appears some gamers are just too shallow and don’t like (or get) thought provoking games.
wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-09-19,"OP, the extreme hate was from incels that attacked people for no reason and sent or faked death threats because they couldn’t handle anyone liking a game they didn’t and a certain sub started a controversy last year and became the laughingstock of this site for a little while. Truly pathetic behavior.

The game has its flaws and I still don’t like Abby (plenty of reasons that have nothing to do with Joel) but I can’t call this an objectively bad game in good faith when the graphics, gameplay, acting, and music are all objectively great and as top notch as they are. The story quality is subjective. I personally enjoyed Ellie’s portion of the story very much but I just didn’t enjoy it as a whole due to obvious reasons. I may give the game another shot soon and see if my mind changes on it."
wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-08-22,"Agree, one of the best games I ever played, it was a fantastic experience. I way prefer it over the first game and it's not even close."
wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-09-17,I agree

wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-08-22,I don't really like the series for reasons unrelated to politics. But I get that it's a very influencial game and is a console seller for PS.
wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-12-10,"Its one of the best games ive ever played, period. Most of the criticism ive seen for it is absolute nonsense, it basically amounts to butthurt fanboys being angry that they killed joel. I get being angry that he died, he was a great character, and you're allowed to be upset, you're supposed to be, his death and ellies lust for vengeance is what drives the entire game forward. And then you get to play as abby, and see her perspective, and her actions, while unjustifiable, are totally understandable. People seem totally unwilling to to grant her any empathy, and its kinda childish. Her character is incredibly emotionally complex and well written, the whole story is, ESPECIALLY for a video game. Honestly im pretty sure the only reason people were so willing to jump on the hate train is because of the subtle political undertones. Ellie being gay, lev being trans, abby being a ""STRONG WOMAN"" but i think they handled most of this stuff pretty well. They didn't preach, they took a color blind approach to ellies homosexuality, abby wasnt your typical strong woman stereotype as she actually had flaws, they did a good job with this stuff. But i guess people are so fed up with wokeness, that the second something even feels slightly political, they become irrational and go into review bomb mode. Which i get, im tired of politics everywhere i turn too, but this game didn't deserve it. I also hear that people are upset about ""false advertising"" because the trailers make it seem like you're going to play as joel, my response to this is  DUH! They obviously wanted his death to be a surprise. Then they say the story and characters are terrible, and i get thats subjective, but i never here any real reasons for why. Again it usually boils down to""joel dead, abby bad"" sometimes main characters die to illicit an emotional response, this isnt exactly a new strategy, its been done in literature, cinema, gaming ect. And Sometimes its going to be brutal and visceral, and when you consider the mood and atmosphere of the game, how else did you expect it to go down? When you take into account the incredible graphics, how smooth the gameplay is, the attention to detail, the story and characters, it should be easy to give this game a 9, at least an 8, instead people are choosing to be dramatic and say its its the worst video game they ever played, its silly. The idea that the story and characters are bad enough to warrant some of the opinions i saw is ludicrous. People Say hideo kojima is one of the best writers, and i totally agree that metal gear is undoubtedly one of the best story driven video games, but if you were to convert all of it over to the big screen without changing anything, what youd end up with is a b movie riddled with corny dialogue and overacting. But gamers are able to overlook this because they consider the medium, they understand its a video game so they relax a bit. And The last of us series is far better written then anything kojima has done. Personally i consider it to be right up there with red dead."
wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2023-01-24,"This is a hot take, but bare with me. The reason why people have such outrage about the sequel is because of their misogyny and bigotry. Most male fans from the original felt like they could relate to Joel and likely did not feel the same towards Ellie. The sequel is completely dominated by female and queer characters and that’s what angers the male gamers. Of course they try and cover this by claiming the story and gameplay is garbage and repetitive.

Sorry, did we play the same game?? The gameplay in the sequel completely tramples the original. The story is absolutely brilliant and devastating. The last of us part 2 is indeed a masterpiece.

And for the love of god can we stop saying Abby is a bad character. I finished the game dying to know how her and Levs story continued."

This new personality in Joel stuck around as long as he was with Ellie, and this is what killed him."

wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-08-22,"Agree with you, I don't have a problem that Joel died, i was expecting him too, but his death is nothing but shock value and nothing else, not to mention the rest of the games story is nothing but pointless brutal death, filled with characters who make really stupid decisions just to drive the plot forward, it is an absolute disaster."
wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-08-22,"It's fine if you don't like the game, but comparing it to the last Jedi is a bit ridiculous"

wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-09-17,"That's funny because Rian Johnson is actually a very good writer/director. The Last Jedi was great, and so was Knives Out. Glass Onion looks fun as well.

He even directed what are generally regarded some of the best episodes of Breaking Bad, if you can believe that."

wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-08-22,That . . . That wasn't the message. There was no redemption. Just consequences.
wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-08-22,"I thought the fight against Ellie was one of the amazing parts of the game. Once it started I was like “Okay this is the final boss.” And it was so cool to me because you had to fight this character you played as and cared about, and in a way I didn’t really know who I wanted to win because they both had their reasons to kill each other.

Then when I found out it wasn’t the end of the game, I was pumped because we got more story. But then I had that same conflict again at the final battle. I was torn between do I want Ellie to kill Abby or not, and I had no clue how it was going to end, but I was kinda hoping Ellie would let Abby live. If she didn’t I could understand it and I’d been satisfied too, but then stuff happens and we get the ending that it is."
wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-08-22,">And like... risking some decisions that would make people mad.

And the story and characters are far from terrible, especially considering the medium, this is a video game, If people can video hideo kojima as aone of the best writers in gaming, and metal gear as one of the best story driven video games, then recognizing tlou2 as having a good story shouldnt be that difficult.

wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-08-25,Exactly… I’d say “being a father again” made Joel think only daughter matters. (Perhaps the PTSD before Sarah’s death.) Could I say that Joel actually neither wanna to live or die since the break out. He just survived…again and again.
wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-09-17,"Except joel was super paranoid about ellie going outside the walls of Jackson for patrols (he would interrogate Jessie about ellies patrols) and in the scenes where Ellie was outside with him, he was still paranoid about ellie wearing a mask to hide her identity.  Joel even killed a bloater with his bare hands - something never done before. Goes to show that joel is still capable and very serious about survival.

Joel mellowing out inside the walls of Jackson and trusting more people in the community around him? Yeah, I can believe that. 

Joel going outside the walls and instantly trusting complete strangers who have nothing to do with Jackson?  This is not realistic.  The dangers of the world are still the same regardless of ellies existence, and joel knows this. Especially when the first game established that there are dangerous bandits outside the wall of Jackson and we played an entire level killing these bandits. 

Having a child doesn't LESSEN your instinct to protect. It raises it. So joel ""letting his guard down"" when he has something to protect (ellie) is the opposite of what normally happens."
wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2023-01-18,"I mean even when he was with Sarah, he still had survival instincts. He shot a man, he forbade Tommy to stop for that family on the side of the road."
wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-09-18,"Yes but even when Joel had Sarah, he was still a hardened survivor only 4 hours into the outbreak. First, though reluctantly, he shoots his neighbor he’s probably close to in front of his own daughter, and then left a stranded family on the side of the rode. It’s clear Joel never was “soft” especially when he’s in dangerous fight regardless of which child he’s with, and definitely not on patrol where infected and humans are trying to kill him."
wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-08-22,"If you're curious why so many hated it, it can really be simplified into [bad gameplay](https://youtu.be/QCYMH-lp4oM) and [bad story](https://youtu.be/MvTFF-E5wkw). Both videos do a great job objectively breaking down the game and explaining why it doesn't work for so many people.

TLDR the gameplay is oversimplified, archaic, repetitive and boring. It plays out like a movie full of pointless and unlikeable characters whose motivations you rarely share. You have no say in how the game plays out, you simply travel to the next checkpoint through the walled-off maps and press the quick time event buttons to see which cutscene comes next. Ellie's hollow and inconsistent actions throughout the game's poorly structured plot leave us with a despicable shithead in place of the surrogate daughter we came to love in the first game. Joel, the character we came to identify as in the first game, is gone and his death amounted to nothing more than a call to action for this bleak, empty journey."

The writers were trying to show maturity while delivering a tik-tok story.

wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-08-22,"Ha ha, did it ever! But yeah, you don't get to do anything that interesting artistically in a sequel without making some enemies, I suppose. And it's fun getting to be a 'rebel' just for liking a good thing."

This is what I meant to say. I don't like the series because an annoying person in my friend group made it their personality to always talk about TLOU."
wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-09-17,"This was also while joel was beating the life out of Henry with his bare hands. After this scene, ellie learned not to give her name to strangers, as David had to beg and manipulate ellie for days in order to get her to simply say her name. 

Unlike tommy and joel INSTANTLY introducing themselves to total strangers outside the walls of Jackson with their guard completely down and guns absent.  They are also doing this after joel slaughtered an entire militia and they both have reason to believe there is a high chance someone is after joel for taking the only immune child on the planet. 

This is also after the 1st game established that there are lots of dangerous bandits right outside of Jackson who arent to be trusted - we played an entire level killing bandits who break into Jackson.

The simple truth is, tommy and Joel's actions were laughably stupid and NOT the actions of 25+ year hardened survivors of the apocalypse.  I can understand them ""softening up"" and trusting people INSIDE jackson. But them being in Jackson for a few years doesn't magically make them trust everyone OUTSIDE of Jackson.  The outside world is the same as its been for 25+ years and they know this. They were dumbed down for plot's sake, and it's an insult to the fans that the writers thought we would buy this cheap sendoff. 

When people try to compare these 2 scenes it goes to show that certain fans will go to any length to defend the questionable writing in part 2.... even if their reasons make no sense and are contradictory."
wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-09-17,"If joel didn't care about living or dying and didn't have much to fight for before he knew ellie, wouldn't he be less protective/paranoid about people? 

Having a child makes you way more protective/paranoid because now you have something that depends on you.  After finding ellie, his want for survival/paranoia would have gone up, not down."
wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-09-18,"Tbh all the people reaching to turn Joel letting his guard down for a second at the most inopportune time into incoherent writing seem stupid. Acting like you know shit about writing when you can't even spell ""lessen"" right."
wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-09-18,Shooting his neighbor who's going crazy during a zombie outbreak has nothing to do with whether Joel could make one mistake 25 years later because he let his guard down.

That's what I am saying.

You can kill side characters because they are worthless. But be sure to forgive the main characters because revenge is bad for MAIN CHARACTERS.
Otherwise torture, killing a pregnant women, etc. have no consequences.

Processing is slow it seems."
wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-09-19,can you just admit it's bad writing. nothing bad will happen to you. you won't magically become a racist or bigot because you admitted the writing is bad. it's okay.

wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-08-22,"Abby's point of view shows you they aren't worthless. That they're people. That was the point. That's why the extra effort was made to give NPCs names in enemy encounters.

Killing Abby's friends have consequences. Ellie lost so much because of those decisions. And Abby lost so much because of her decisions.

What a strange take. No consequences to killing these people despite the fact that it literally got Jesse killed.

You need a dictionary."

wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-08-22,"What person kills a bunch of people to reach a person who she had the grudge on to forgive her while the people she killed were innocent.

That's what i meant by cattle side characters.

This is called inconsistent writing where the things dont happen spontaneously but when the writer wants to. Kinda like cheap twist and turns.


It's about how ellie sacrificed so much to reach Abby. How ellie killed innocents to reach Abby but then she remembered ""fuck, she is one of the main characters"". How jesse died for fucking nothing.

How the writers put in the death count just for the shocking credibility and factors.

Kinda like cattles.

They went through all the effort to name every enemy just to spit on all of it by showing them worthless meats. And forgetting what it was all for. 

The game's aim wasn't clear at all. Like a bunch of writers worked on it. And then the pacing was shit.
It just feels like writers were hey what I do with this character oh yes, just kill him instead of consistent writing. 

Because people think that games having sex scenes and a lot of deaths are mature and deep.

Last of us 2 is like the game version of elfen lied. Both look deep and mature but are filled with inconsistent and bad writing and poor characters.

You need a mature brain."
wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-09-19,like others im mad they didn't write their characters congruent with traits they had already established. not everyone has the same standard. I mean people pay money to watch whatever marvel just came out in the actual theater 😂

wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-09-19,I assume you're talking about Tommy introducing himself and Joel to Abby? You've never done anything a little out of character or made a mistake doing something you've done a thousand times before.

Do people actually know that the game is bad before buying it?

People bought it, played it, regretted it. 

What are you even saying?

A Game selling well is because of the previous games from the devs.

Lol


A lot of people bought the game? True.

A lot of people loved the game?  False.

Now care to elaborate your point?"
wuh9rv,2022-08-22,2022-08-22,"Like talking to a wall.

Motherfucker didn't even had the guts to post the whole comment. 

The fucker didn't even bothered to look up the fact that this all was related to that removal and crying out loud based on that mod on marvel spiderman.

How bringing all this fuckery bullshit into a game can hurt a community when someone mods it. 


How the fucker didn't even bothered to look up my comment where i said that bringing LGBT characters is okay. But not something that represents a community. 

But no you're gonna behave like street bitch. Using these 

But who am I kidding, what a person can expect from a kid who can't even counter statements properly...

I mean I just feel disgusted by people who think that legit criticism can be countered by this stuff..

I pitty you.

I mean just say that you don't have a shit to say.

Now I atleast know why you like tlou2 story.

Only a tick tok kid can like a tik tok story.

Here is the full comment:

>>No. Gaming is a fun activity and bringing all this into it is gonna ruin it.

>>Adding a gay character is acceptable and great but adding something which literally represents something in real life is just  unnecessary.

>>I wanna play games instead of seeing posts about people crying over mods removing something from a game.

>>If you are that considerate about it, leave it away from the games otherwise don't cry when something happens to it in the game.

You're the lowest of all scums I have seen on this reddit.

And youre that free to search for my comments.

Get a life dude.

And there is one more thing you weren't able to search.

In one of the posts I said..

""I have no problem with Gays and all. I literally don't care. But fuck your flag and all these bullshit advertisements in video games. Because putting a flag does nothing. Nobody's gonna have a heart change by seeing a flag in a video game and vice versa. """

I think it's bullshit. 

Ofcourse bad story  in video games don't have a specific meaning. 
Bad can be good by someone. 

I know you have different opinion. And for me that opinion sucks.

Have a mature brain and a reasonable argument if you want to argue. Bringing gay stuff in a discussion about a game?

using these tricks is lowest of the lowest techniques. And I can't bring myself to argue with scums like you people.

That's what your parents taught you?

You think this is funny, bringing a serious matter in a game discussion and manipulating it.

1eq845v,2024-08-12,2024-08-12,Thanks for letting us know!
1eq845v,2024-08-12,2024-08-17,I loved that game
1eq845v,2024-08-12,2024-08-12,"What I did like is the way the world was built to show how people survived going on. The small western style town where Ellie lives, the stadium that has become a fortress for humans to survive, the cult on the island building up. Though, I admit, the cult on the island didn't feel explored enough. It just felt weird to bringing them into the story to me. What I loved too is just the way the world is built to show how things have decayed, the buildings laying over, collapsed. And adding in all the things you can find to add extra story. I also enjoying the combat. The whole effort into building a game that has a real feeling world, one that you can totally be involved in is something I always love in games. I do like that the game builds on the first, making it even bigger. 

What I didn't care much for was the story in a lot of ways. I get it is a revenge story to start and ends showing that revenge is an empty journey, or that is how i saw it. But I thought it odd that Abby goes to track down the man who killed her father, dragging her friends along, out into the world and out into unknown danger. Or that she manages to find him what seems too easily. I get wanting revenge but at the same time...in a world like that, it seems like a fools errand. At the same time, the whole revenge tour of Ellie just ruined her for me. She throws away everything and anything and becomes a serial killer? Another thing that was lost to me was the sense of tension and survival from the first. It just seemed less about trying to live and more about trying to kill, often violently and excessively for revenge rather then survival.

Would I like to see a third part, continuing Ellie's story? I think so. I think that they way the game ended, it seems like there needs to be a circle of that comes around to redemption, a point where Ellie becomes the Joel character. Honestly, having built such a vast in game world, it seems like there are other places to explore, other things to see. That could be fun with Ellie. But at the same time, I wonder how the rest of the world might fair. Does it look the same everywhere? Are other places more stable? Less stable? Does the country as a whole start to rebuild, come back together? And do they ever find that cure/treatment they were trying to get in the first one? I have this weird feeling that one part of the story would be someone slowly discovering that they did find a cure at the cost of killing untold numbers of people to their horror."
1eq845v,2024-08-12,2024-08-12,"Never understood the issue explained with Joel's death. Do you think only soft people get offed? Bc, soldiers, gang members, terrorists, heisters, special agents, they all get tricked, take wrong turns, eat bullets etc in a regular basis."

Terrible story issues aside, I think the worst thing about the game is that it still feels almost identical to part one in terms of gameplay. With so many years between release you'd expect some form of evolution."

I had just thought it sounded stupid knowing what was to come due to spoilers and the way my family reacted so negatively to the game. Played Part 1 and 2 back to back last year, and wow, those are incredible games. I love Joel; he's my favorite character in the series, but I actually liked Part 2 more both definitely in gameplay, and honestly in story.

i17wh2,2020-07-31,2020-07-31,I was a fan of the D&D campaign you stumble across in the latter half of the game. That was fun little find
i17wh2,2020-07-31,2020-07-31,There's a Ps1 in metal gear solid 1 where you fight the cool ninga dude and meet Otacon
i17wh2,2020-07-31,2020-07-31,this is exclusive 'exclusives' - they won't port to Steam ever
i17wh2,2020-07-31,2020-08-01,No one cares about yhe WARHAMMER set up and it pains me...
i17wh2,2020-07-31,2020-07-31,Looks like Sony trying to tell us PS3 is dead .... We had great years old friend 🙏.
i17wh2,2020-07-31,2020-08-01,So entire buildings collapsed but a fucking PS3 survives?
i17wh2,2020-07-31,2020-08-01,How fuckin loud were they?
i17wh2,2020-07-31,2020-08-01,What did you do to pass time while in search of these?
i17wh2,2020-07-31,2020-07-31,Not ONE switch or Xbox? Must be a parallel-universe...where Sony is the one and the only.
i17wh2,2020-07-31,2020-07-31,I also found the [script](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B5n_K2Co3Jw/maxresdefault.jpg) for the story of TLOU2 in the game

i17wh2,2020-07-31,2020-07-31,And the one room in that same apartment has some warhammer figures and a little paint desk!
i17wh2,2020-07-31,2020-07-31,Hopefully whenever they do they'll put highend PC with burnt out RGB cases in place of those PS3s ;-)
i17wh2,2020-07-31,2020-08-01,That's because when the building was collapsing they only had time for the important stuff...... So they grabbed their Xbox consoles and GTFO
i17wh2,2020-07-31,2020-08-01,I did not search for them I just came across them while looking around
i17wh2,2020-07-31,2020-07-31,It is a first-party Sony title... putting competing systems in the game would not be smart.
i17wh2,2020-07-31,2020-07-31,All companies do this. The early Pokemon games had an N64/GameCube/Wii in the player's room at home

1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Hogwarts Legacy. Game starts out really strong but definitely fades at the end. Plus those Merlin trials ....

I went through the main story missions, then called it good. I don't do well in sandbox games, since I lack the creativity to make my own fun within them.

Those story missions were insanely well done, though."

1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Bioshock Infinite. I enjoyed my playthrough and the DLC story stuff was cool but the game was easily the worst bioshock game. 

It’s objectively a good game but it fails miserably at being a “Bioshock” game. It feels way more like a generic fps game that was inspired by bioshock than an actual game in the series. 

You could change a few minor plot points in the main story and change the title and no one would be able to guess what series it’s from. The gameplay is radically different from the first two games. The dlc brings it closer to the other two games but is still not the same. 

So yeah I’m not itching to ever play it again but it’s not a bad game just a let down as a bioshock game."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Outer Wilds.

An incredible game, and truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

The game is discovery based, so your knowledge IS your progression. On your first run you could theoretically beat it in like 15 minutes, you just don't know how.

Thus, there's no point playing it more than once. And that's OK - that game is an experience, and I'm grateful to have gotten to play it."

1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Assassin's Creed Valhalla 

I'm not saying it's a bad game, but dang, it can feel like a chore simulator after a while. And while I can give it up to Ubisoft for trying a new story formula, the massive ""story arcs"" totally took me out of the actual story. Spolier: >!It also feels like it doesn't end.!<

Looking back I remember it being a good game, (post-Roman Britain looks spectacular. Both countryside and cities.) but have zero interest in go back to it."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"God Of War Ragnarok 

I loved this game on release and do think it’s a great game. But I have zero desire to replay the game. That Jotunheim portion literally slows the game down to a snails pace and I do not want to replay that."

Like a chore I had to complete.

Every couple of years me and my friends get together and play metal slug series, contra and super contra, battle city, double dragon, etc because they take only a couple of hours and they were our childhood.

The only games I have replayed on my own are Resident Evil 4, Dragon Age Origins, Mass Effect 2. I don't think I have replayed any other game besides these three on my own."

I play just for fun, I don't look for accomplishments, it might be that. I wanted to do the achievements, but after finishing it, I couldn't bring myself to play it again, dreading the jumping puzzles and pole-swinging, and most of all, the constant weapon switching. Every enemy has their own best way to kill them. What a slayer, Tarzaning around in a battle-suit, tactically taking out the enemies.



I boot up 2016 when I want some DOOM. Super shotgun 95% of the time. Eternal missed the mark for me, and I'll never play it again after the Nightmare Run. The game isn't hard; it's just hard work. I don't mind investing time, I don't like to invest too much energy. :)

- kept saying 'i hope you all die' (ingame) while i was saying 'gl'

- refused to skip tv cutscene, pretty sure they were spamming simp comments for scary larry too just to get on everyone's nerves

- opened door for fake pizza guy, proceeded to hide with another player in an unreachable area while everyone else tried to fight him

- got defended by their mother when i called them out for being a coward (i was medic and had saved the mother like 4 times)

- was a total jerk throughout the whole game

- accused me of not being helpful (i was reviving their mom for the 5th time, the computer was lagging)

They ended up dying right before the final boss after falling in the lake; me and my brother went on a little longer. All I can say is that I was glad they weren't the last living player (like they said they would be) and I wish I wasn't such a suck-up, choosing to try and keep those two alive.

either way, here is my LIST: + reasons why

Sly cooper: I hate the miss ruby fight. I still suck at it despite owning the game since it came out.

Sly 2: I hate the last boss fight, annoying as hell.

All my xbox 360 games: I don't want to dig out my 360 and play with a worn out asf controller. \[srsly it is SO WORN OUT\] I also refuse to use any other controller. \[through i could take the shell and put it on a good controller if i Absolutely wanted to.\] its a halo controller. 

LoZ Ocarina of time: I get bored half way because of how many times I have played it.

LoZ Skyward sword: as of right now, I simply do not want to. But I DO have a Hero mode save file which is NEAR the end? i have no idea. after beating it once, i played through hero mode really far and then just stopped.

sorry, but most of my ps2 games: i just cant seem to play most of them without falling asleep, getting distracted by litterally everything else. I have just played through them so much."

1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"I can’t replay any game but if you’re referring to games that have multiple endings or different routes towards the end, the only game I did that with was Resident Evil 2 original, I did the 2 different endings only because out a short game and I felt like the game varied enough for the two play throughs to keep me interested, besides that I can’t replay any game"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,All of them.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Hellblade 1.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Subnautica. Loved every second of it but it took way too many hours and way too much traveling
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Undertale, and a lot of big rpgs like witcher and final fantasy 14."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,With so many games in my current backlog I’d say every game is like that for me if I ever plan on playing everything.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Dead Rising. I 100%'d that mamma jamma and then I swore off gaming for awhile.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"I mean once a platinum a game, I'm done. 

Dude I loved Elden Ring and I don't even plan to get the DLC because it would mean reinstalling a game I was done with a year ago.

I didn't even get the god of war ragnarok dlc because at that point I had finished (read platinum) the game and it meant returning to it and it was free.

I can count on one hand the number of games I did more than once completely.

Dark souls
Chrono trigger
Alien Isolation"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Battletoads. When I was in high school I learned of the game and its crazy difficulty, so I decided to flex and played it for like a week straight trying to beat it with friends. I didn't even feel happy once I eventually got through, just relieved I'd never see fucking Clinger Winger again"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Funny enough I can go back to The Last of Us Part 2 but only for the no return mode. Shit is addicting.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Resident evil village. Was just ok
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Dawn of Mana

Sat on my shelf for years. Finally, I decided to take it down and play through it. It went immediately back on my shelf after the credits, and it's never coming down again."

1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"I agree with you 100% OP. Last of Us 2 just kept going and going and going and going. I kept saying ""well this has got to be the end"" for two weeks while I beat it."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Starfield. It was memorable in a bad way. The few good highlights were recycled from other, better, Bethesda games."

1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Quite a few. Like, there aren't many games I beat more than once. It'd be easier to name games I love going back to. Dragon Age, Mass Effect, KOTOR, Skyrim, Fallout. And yeah, I do play the story stuff in Skyrim and Fallout again."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Most of the ones I've beaten for sure. It's a serious mark of excellence for me to want to revisit a game.

1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Starfield. Unless the DLC is truly gamechanging
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Most of them. I occasionally replay a game, but rarely."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Every yakuza game
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Elden ring. I've played through every souls game multiple times but something about elden ring just doesn't grab me. I think it'd mainly the open world as I prefer the more linear style of RPG games but it's honestly a lot of things.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"For me this is the normal way. Buy, play, sell.

Unless it's a classic or I really liked it. Which is like one in 20 games I touch."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Probably AC Odyssey. It was always engaging for me but never that fun. I went through once just because I like the series but that was more than enough for me
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Read Dead Redemption 2. It's a beautiful and amazingly constructed game with a great but sad story. I could see myself entering it from time to time to take pictures of the vistas and be amazed at how Rockstar managed to cramp and squeeze every ounce of the PS4's power but I couldn't play Arthur's story again.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Any interactive movie game, Detroit Become Human, Until Dawn, Hellblade, etc."

1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Mass Effect Trilogy.  It was pretty fun for one playthrough, but there was way too much bloat, and I didn’t even do any romance because I was playing almost full Renegade and wasn’t interested in that part of the games."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Elden Ring, I think. I loved it, one of the greatest games I've ever played for sure, played it for about 140 hours and got almost all the achievements and saw/did everything.

But I tried starting an NG+ and stopped after an hour, unable to care for it. Even the prospect of DLC doesn't pull at me particularly."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Death Stranding  


I dont want 17 hours of cutscenes and 23 hours of walking again"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Every single game I've beaten. Backlog is too long to replay games.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Persona 4. Can’t handle all those feelings and post persona depression again
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,99 percent of the games I play. It has to be really good for me to want to play again. There are some games that are so good I replay every few years like gta 4 or rdr. But games like that are so rare. I don't know how people replay some of these games because a lot of them have zero replay value.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Most of them, honestly."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Mad Max
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Skyward Sword. I would absolutely *love* to play the game again... but I *cannot* do the tears again, those part sucked and gave me Big Anxiety lol"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Atomic Heart. There was so much depth and lore but it really felt mechanical and uninteresting to me by the end
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Almost all games?
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Death Stranding

Enjoyed it a lot. But after unraveling the mystery of the story, I got everything I needed from it."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,I wouldn't replay about 99% of the games I have beaten. Pretty rare I replay a game unless it becomes one's of my few cherished loved games
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Twelve Minutes. 100%ed the game, achievements and all. It’s a great game, it’s just incredibly time consuming and tedious. If you make a mistake it can change the outcome of your run, or just be bothersome because you have to keep hearing the same dialogue (which I obviously get because that’s how the game is designed, but when you’re only interested in getting the last couple of achievements, it can be a drag)."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Sekiro and Elden Ring.. that was a lot of pain and years of happiness… but I can’t do it again
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"That's most games. I'll give anything a go, but few games are made with replays in mind.

An example is pretty much anything by Ubisoft, like Far Cry or Assassin's Creed."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Interesting.  Can you please explain why with minimum spoilers? TLOU is one of my favorite games and I have replayed it around 10 times.  I haven't played TLOU2 yet since I don't have a PS5 but I'm planning to play it like TLOU.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Dark souls 2
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,I 100%’d Witcher 3. It’s amazing but there’s nothing left for me to do really.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Diablo IV. Don't even know why I bothered finishing it tbh. I guess because I loved all the others (yes, even Diablo 3) and I felt obligated to? In any case, Diablo IV is garbage."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Most story games I wouldn't play a second time. Unless its been years and I don't remember the story. Even then I'd probably watch a youtube summary. I generally play games on the highest difficulty anyway so usually I've experienced it all by the time the game is done.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Dragons dogma 2
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Outer Wilds. Hands down one of the most engaging and emotional experiences I’ve had but sadly non-repeatable.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Pretty much any Naughty Dog game. I love the characters, settings, and stories but I was never a fan of the gameplay. That's not to say the gameplay is bad but it always starts to feel a little tedious to me."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Horizon Zero Dawn
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Almost every single one of them
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Death Stranding. Hot garbage, even when I gave it the benefit of the doubt. But it’s not made for me, it’s made for other people."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,AC Valhalla felt like a second job very early on. I'm a massive AC fan but that the dlc and fuck doing the base game again.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Elden Mother fucking Ring.

Barely beat the final boss after literally 100 attempts with just a sliver of my health. As i am getting on in older age my reaction time isn't as great as it once was and the brutal punishment of fucking up on Soulsbourne games isn't for me."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Once I platinum a game - I end up not playing it again for awhile
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,far cry 4. way too long
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,I absolutely loved TLOU2. The only reason I played it again just recently though was to play it with the girlfriend after we watched season 1 together.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"The last of us in general, great and memorable story so much that I don’t need to play it again. 

On the contrary I’ve played watch dogs 1 like 6 times. I also loved that story as it was more “real” and kinda like a “taken” revenge hitman type movie game."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Not in a bad way, but A Plague Tale 1 & 2. I liked them, but I’m good. I played them and have no desire to do it again. 

Also that new game I, The Inquisitor. It was honestly really fun despite looking like booty for a 2024 release, I love detective-esque games. I felt like I did every possible thing right to get a good ending and still got a shit ending. Turns out the endings are all kinda shit, which soured an otherwise fun experience. Except the Unworld… tedious and boring piece in an otherwise enjoyable game."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"God Of War, Horizon Zero Dawn & Metro 2033 are all games I've beaten once and never loaded again."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Most every game I play honestly.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"I'm actually replaying TLoU pt2 again now (albeit very slowly and in between other games). It's been quite something playing knowing what's coming, certainly not as impactful but I'm still really enjoying it.

For me though, it'd have to be a game like Skyrim. Was fully invested in it for hundreds of hours when it came out, beat it over a coupe of months, and have no inclination to.play it ever again. I've dabbled in the remasters just to see how much difference there is, but wverytime I've given up because I'm just not interested in doing it all over."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Pretty much every game I play. I usually just play through once and then move on to the next game. I live for new single player story games. Very rarely do I come back like a decade later and play something a second time. Of course I have a few things like Chrono Trigger I can play pretty much once a year, but 99% of games I play are 1 time only."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Fable 3 

That game made me unreasonably angry with it from the very beginning. 

""The darkness"" - or in other words we ran out of resources."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Tomb raider and Rise of the tomb raider, just don't feel like it would hit the same."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Horizon forbidden west
Not because I didnt like it but because I loved it so much when I played that I have 100% on the game and there is nothing else to see or do."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"AC Origins. The combat is too clunky, and the ancient Egypt isn't as ancient as I hoped it would be."

Yeah."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Ninja Garden 3 Razors Edge. 

I remember after beating that game, putting the disc back in its case and saying out loud ""never again"". What a drop off in quality and game design that was. 

Bring back pimple sunglasses man who knew how to design games."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Skyrim.  The thought of going through every cave and dungeon, and stealing from EVERY. SINGLE. NPC. makes me want to groan.  I went full power and did everything once, I’m good, I’m done.

edit: Just remembered another one.  Person 5!  I’m not going through every single day and planning events and balancing boosting my stats and grinding dungeons and all that dialogue and making sure relationships are good again."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Theres plenty of games. Most of them I forced myself through cause I had nothing else new to play.

FF13 absoultely hated it kept telling myself it would get better never did.

FF15 was boring and kept hoping it would get better and then that stupid survival horror chapter happened and I hated it even more.

Tales of zestria friend bought it for me. I forced myself to finish it for my friend absolutely hated it

FF12 didn't hate it but game is a slog and wont ever go back to it. Feels like an offline MMO

Persona 5 I found the social links good but honestly hated the new direction with the dungeons and the main plot. Wont ever go back to it."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Most games fall into the category as many explained why. However some games simply don't fall into ""never touch again"" category due to the very nature of the game itself. Those you can keep going back to for fun or chill. Any kind of logistics game like factorio, Dyson Sphere Program, shapez, you can play again and again, but with a big break in between ofc. There are those games like RTS thst you can also play and never get bored like supreme commander FAF, C&C and the like. It boils down to replaybility, nostalgia, preference and so on.
Games with stories and linear progression simply do not provide that incentive unless you have the aforementioned nostalgia, ""just want to play again"" feel and so on."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Don't think I'll ever play GTA5 again. I put waaaay to many hours into that trying to get all the trophies.

1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,A Hat in Time. I was so glad it finally ended when I finished it. So many technical and other issues with the game.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Tomb Raider triology and The last of us. IMO, boring games and told nothing to me while playing them"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Basically all games. I have a really hard time replaying a game once I’ve finished it.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Ghostrunner.

Fun game but jeez was it ridiculously hard at some points.

Just finished the second game yesterday and it's a lot more forgiving and just more fun anyway. I could see myself replaying that one down the line."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Almost every single JRPG is this for me.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"FF7 Remake. Great graphics, but a damn slog and a half to play."

1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"A lot of them. But something that came back to mind lately is Braid (because of the recently released remaster).
Nothing against the game, I enjoyed it, but when I think back on it I just don't get ""I wanna play it again"" vibes"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Too many to count😂 I have ADHD so switching games after beating them happens almost every time, I always find something new to play."

1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Resident Evil Nemesis and Dino Crisis!
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Most games. I barely have enough time to finish a game, let alone multiple times. That's why any game that requires beating it again on a newly unlocked difficulty to gain its platinum trophy can fuck right off."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Basically every game I've played.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"In my mid 30s, I have enough disposable income for games(and not enough for anything really meaningful) but nowhere near the amount of time and energy.

1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Even though it was literally designed to be replayable; Baldur's Gate 3

It's a fantastic game, but I was so done with it after 120 hours that I can't imagine me playing it ever again."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Middle Earth Shadow of Mordor/War. First of all, there’s no point going back to Mordor when you have War. But when it comes to War, it’s just a fine game imo nothing special. The only reason I would go back to play it would be to see the different orcs the amazing nemesis system generates but after beating both I think I’ve killed enough orcs to last me a lifetime."

1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,So many mixed emotions. By the end it was such a mindfuck on whose side should I take that I just gave up on that. Turned off my emotions and just played for the gameplay and atmosphere.

1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"All of the Yakuza / Like a Dragon games. I get super into the side quests and minigames on my first playthrough, but I couldn't fathom doing them again (even though many of them are recycled from game to game, haha). I guess I could go for a main story only replay, but I know my OCD brain wouldn't let me ignore the side activities."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Probably outer wilds and disco elysium. Last of us, Generally linear or ""first time wow factor"" experiences. Outer wilds is unique in that you 'beat' the game by learning, and once you learn it, you can beat it in like 10 minutes. 

Disco i was contemplating, but given its practically a visual novel/point and click and the other options would just be fluff since its quite a linear game, it makes sense to just let my experience be the mine, i played it how i played it.

Last of us, horizon zero dawn, most sony games really. They are so narrative heavy and the gameplay is just eh. If im being honest I just watch sony games on youtube now.

Most narrative games with weak gameplay"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Most horror games tbh :) I scare easily
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"FF7 Rebirth. I’ll try the story again hands down but after I beat every single Brutal Challenge, I’m never touching anything in that fucking simulator ever again. Ever. AGAIN."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,I try to 100% as close as I can to a point where I feel like I don’t ever have to go back. The first one that comes to mind is Hogwarts Legacy. Had a blast and got the platinum and said “bye”
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Literally ever game I've played. Too many systems and too many games to look back

Wait does bite sized emulation session count?!"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Baldur's Gate 3.

Absolutely loved my first playthrough. Worthy of all the awards.

Gave a second playthrough a go and it just felt flat. The main character animations were identical, despite picking an entirely different character to play. My durge was exactly the same as my tav. Completely broke the immersion.

Other things too made me not enjoy it a second time so I gave up and uninstalled."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Arkham City/Knight. the moment i find a riddler trophy, i start to get anxious if i don't complete all of them."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Man of Medan, hated every second of it. And I will nog be touching the rest of the series, or The Quarry. And yes I know I'm missing out."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Likely most Metal Gear games even though I love them. They're just A LOT to try and keep track of story-wise, some of the games can be a bit of a slog to fully get through/enjoy, and past the first one it's hard to truly feel like you got EVERYTHING you could out of it because there's so much you can miss or mess up on. I replay the first Metal Gear Solid probably once a year, but 2-5 (and Peace Walker) involve a pretty enormous time investment, and I get more enjoyment out of just discussing the series these days and Kojima's other works in comparison to them than actually sitting down to replay the sequels."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"For me its Black ops 3. Story line was all over the place, jumping here and there. Some obsession with crows and memories. It lacked anything even close to enjoyable."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"All of them. Once I beat them, meh. I don't really leave any stone unturned when I play them, and I don't really have time to go back and replay them."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,All of the farcry and assassins creed games
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"GTA games, Racing games (especially the NFS series)"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Her Story

And any game like it where once you have experienced discovering it for the first time, it loses any real replay value unless you get amnesia (the medical condition, not the game...)"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,I have just finished Persona 5 Royal and I'm never touching that again. I did enjoy it and I'm glad I finished it but my god what a slog.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Horizon Zero Dawn. Recently completed it on PC. Enjoyable but feel absolutely no need to go back to it. Played Elden Ring after, completed it and immediately started a new game with a different play style. So much more variety."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"A way out. It was just meh. Very linear, no choices on what to do or where to go. 90% cutscenes and very short gameplay in between. Felt more like an interactive movie than a game."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Horizon: Zero Dawn and Forbidden West.

Love both games, and I'm about to finish all the side quests in FW, but I won't play it again most likely."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Dark souls 2, first time around it's somewhat enjoyable as you get to explore and figure shit out, learn bosses and have a sense of accomplishment reaching the ending.

But holy shit I DO NOT want to go through that ever again 
The game has so much bullshit in it that listing them all would take me all morning, it is unpleasant and uninspired, nothing about the game makes you want to play it again, I legit uninstalled it the second I was done with it. It was so bad that the developers FromSoft tried to never repeated the same mistakes that they did in DS2 and every game since ds2 has been an absolute banger.

I guess I can appreciate it for being a stepping stone for them, still does not make it good though"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Subnautica. I am thalassophobic, I had nightmares for weeks after and while playing it."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,The Last Guardian
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Horizon Zero Dawn and Forbidden West - I loved the story and gameplay but the length of them is just preposterous. 

Uncharted 4 - waaaaay toooooo looooong."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Mafia III. 
It’s not even a game I can get through all the way let alone thinking about trying to do it again. 
Every time I try to come back to continue where I’ve left off I just find myself just wondering what I’m doing. The characters are good, but the story just seems as if it never ends."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Primal.  Great game but don’t think I could go back to basics and start again.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Detroit - Become Human, which is silly I guess because it could potentially play out completely different, but the story hit me so hard. That was my story and I have to live with it."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Any story based game. (The only exception being ""To the moon"", which i play every other year for nostalgia ans music.)"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Almost all games I've ever played.  I almost never replay games.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Titanfall 2. The story's great but you beat it once and then the multiplayer is where it's at
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Alien: Isolation, tough game, very fun but i cant put myself through that skin-crawling experience again."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,I’m the opposite of you lol only games I’ll probably play and beat again are the Pokémon games and TLOU games.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Mafia 3. Easily the worst game in the franchise. Mafia 2 was my favorite to replay again and again, but 3 was just so boring that once I finished it, I know I’m never redownloading it again"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"All Uncharted, TLOU 1 ( still haven't played 2). Basically any 3-rd-person-naugty-dog-sony-exclusive-type-story-game with boring shooting arenas, that completely destroy suspension of disbelief."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Final Fantasy 13,15 and 16, Meal Gear Solid 5. Didn’t care for the story for all of them."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Most of them. I feel like it's useless to do so, unless it's sentimental value. I replayed LCS and I'm playing VCS for that reason. I might replay GTA 5 bc I didn't pay attention to the story and world as much as I'm doing with RDR2. I honestly lose interest after completing a game. Even freeroam."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"There isn't one tbh. I never thought I'd play through borderlands 2 again but me and my friend have just completed it over the past few weeks and are planning to do it all again on true vault hunter mode then again to max our characters out.

I've played hundred and hundreds of games by now so there probably one but the ones I can remember I'll play them all again at one point probably."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Pretty much all of them I won’t play again.. I don’t understand why you would want to play theough the same story again.. if it’s got an ending but you can still play in (like gta and similar games) then I will keep playing but I won’t do the story again.

There’s one game I’m considering playing again which is bokura.. I played it with my sister, if you haven’t seen the game I don’t want to spoil it cause it’s way better if you don’t know

>! You each see a different thing and we both want to play again as the other person so we can expiernce it !<"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Elden ring, diablo 4, destiny 2, helldivers."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Almost all of them.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Total War: Atilla as the Western Roman empire. It was exhausting.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Any game... unless it's multi-player 
Once the campaign is done. So am i"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"CoD: WaW. Mostly because I jumped right into playing it on veteran, got my ass whooped enough before beating the campaign then never went back. Nothing I didn’t like about the game itself."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Honestly might be Sekiro. 

Easily one of the best games I've ever played, but damn it was tough. I dunno if I'm.strong enough to go again."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Only up lmao
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Yakuza 3 Remastered.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Death Stranding. That last chapter felt like a chore
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Through my 25+years of gaming life the list of games I've finished more than once: Witcher 3, Starcraft 2, Control, KOTOR 1-2. If we are talking about playing at all: probably SOMA - while I considere it the best experience I've ever had the second play through won't deliver even a fraction of it again, Borderlands 3, Inside, The Forgotten City, Quantum Break, AC and all it reskins, Dishonored 1-2."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Frostpunk
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"I don't replay games because I really don't have much time to spend on them at all. So if I've beaten a game, I'd rather move onto the next.

However, I could say that there are lots of games I want to replay if given the chance. Cyberpunk 2077, Skyrim, Most Pokemon Dungeon titles, Metro 2033 and its sequels, Fallout 4, and Fallout New Vegas. I find them fun and worth reliving once more.

With that said, there is one game that I can't ever push myself into playing again no matter how much I love it. Red Dead Redemption 2. I'm rarely that invested in a story. Only time I cried that hard is my grandpa's passing. I really grieved for Arthur Morgan and I can't say I can go through that again."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Cyberpunk, Starfield. Other games available and I know what happens in the stories already."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Halo 2 Legendary.


But I'm lying to myself, soon as I get around to finishing H4 Legendary ill come back to it 🤣

Be a while though."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Silent Hill 4: The Room. Story's so messed up, traumatized my young mind lol"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,It's easier to name the games I'll play again.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Tunic. Enthralled by the lore and secrets behind the game but FUCK THAT
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Basically any Assassin's Creed game. I always play them, always enjoy them... and then promptly forget they exist."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,That's 100% of the games.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Most single player story driven games. Can't experience it blindly again, so no reason to play again."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Rdr 2
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,ALL GAMES.  Too many games to play
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,The original need for speed most wanted on ps2. That last mission trying to out run the cops pissed me off to a level no other video game has ever come close to lol
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Besides most jrpgs any game I enjoy enough I will likely replay and if I didn't have fun playing it I didn't beat it.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Last of us pt1 and 2, GOW/GOW Ragnarok, and ghost of tsushima come to mind"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"A lot of them unless you count going back in to get trophies.

Very few do I actually go ‘let me run this back from the beginning’. Only ones I’ve done recently were BG3 and Cyberpunk."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Crysis 2 and 3. I recently played the remastered trilogy, and wow, yes, those two are one-and-done for me. Armor abilities are cool, but the guns are terrible to use. The enemies'/AI is brain-dead, and the overall story is very, very cliché and predictable. I heard they are releasing Crysis 4 sometime in the future, and I hope they return to Crysis 2007 levels."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Sekiro. The final boss destroyed me.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,The only game I've ever replayed is Sekiro. That too only because you can not fight all the bosses in one playthrough. Every other game where I went NG+ I just quit midway because the charm was gone.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Half life
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Lots of games. Mainly Detective Pikachu 2. I've played it all, no reason to do so again"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Dr driving
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Any Final Fantasy game besides 7 and X
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Normally I would consider a second playthrough on the highest difficulty but most of the time it doesn’t go beyond you doing less damage and the enemies taking more.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Classic wow.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"This is breaking the prompt a little because I've played Majora's Mask two or three times, but when the 3DS remake came out, I decided to try doing a ""perfect cycle.""


After getting every mask, I went through all the sidequests and made myself a rough schedule. I wanted to complete every task that I could construe as ""helping someone in need"" (didn't bother with the beaver races, for example.) A couple are mutually exclusive, so I had to make judgement calls. And fixing every great fairy was out of the question - that's hardcore speed runner stuff.  But the stuff I included was almost every sidequest and all the bosses. 


And I did it! With with a solid half an in-game day to spare. It was surprisingly doable. But after completing it, it felt wrong to even open up the game again. It really felt like the perfect day that breaks the curse in Groundhog Day, you know?  I can't just go back in time again. I felt like I broke the cycle. "
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Honestly probably all, once I get the plat I’ll go on to the next, the only game I played again excluding going for trophies was spider man 2018"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Many, but Ori and the blind forest is one."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Most Ubisoft games and other ""movie like"" games."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Every single one of them.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Dark Souls III, I only beat it because I wasn’t gonna let it beat me"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Every single game I play. 

  
I'm not into replaying games."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,All of them I’ll just play a game once then move on to a new one too many games out there to replay stuff.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Outer wilds. It was a fantastic experience, but I now know how to beat the game right from the start, so unless I suffer some sort of traumatic brain injury there's literally no point in trying to replay it."

state of decay 2"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Alan Wale 1/2. Unique gameplay, story was interesting, but very convoluted and some of the combat was really frustrating."

1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Sekiro
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Dead Island 2, Hogwarts Legacy, Any Assasins Creed game, and Borderlands 1 and 2. 

The first 3 titles are all games that are only fun to play through once and never again (at least imo, can't speak for everyone), and imma big BL3 nerd so going back to 1 or 2 is a nearly impossible"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Basically all story games I only really play once, as it just ist great if you remember most of it, same for new game + never playing it"

1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Almost all of them? I have such a huge backlog with no time to play them. Like I'd ever have time to play them again let alone beat them again.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"The Last Guardian, it was emotionally taxing"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Final Fantasy X 😭 Game took me about 100 hours to finish just because every item needed to get strong was locked behind an impossible minigame. Also you couldn’t just spam with whatever attack in battle like in FF7, you needed actual strategy. So most of the time I was grinding and trying to learn enemy strategies.


BTW CUTSCENES ARE UNSKIPPABLE 💀"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,I'll let know once I finish any of the games I've bought recently
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Jurassic Park on the SNES 
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Outlast 1 and 2
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Persona 5 for me the game got really repetitive and started putting me to sleep just mindlessly running over enemies with the car tell I was max level.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,I think NieR:Automata is not meant to be replayed after the first playthrough. It kinda defeats the meaning of the sacrifice you do at the end.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Control, I love the story, but by the end of the dlc I enabled assist mode and blew through. That combat just did not vibe with me despite loving every other remedy game."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"I would say this about Halo 1 because of The Library sequence. I want to play through them all, but that one bit just sucks so fucking much!"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Pretty much any heavy story based game that has minimal to no RPG elements that allow for different play styles.  The PS5 Spider-Man games are a good example.  Love them, 100% completed them, will never play them again."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Loved the sense of achievement of beating Red Dead 2 100% but I'd never do it all again. Takes a big time and patience commitment. Happy to just replay the story and complete random side quests

I got all I need out of it."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Definitely Fallout Tactics..

1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Telltale's The Walking Dead
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"A plague tale: Requiem. I fucking hate that game. It dragged on for 10 chapters too long, Amicia was annoying, I wanted Hugo to die by chapter 7, and the count humiliating and hunting down Amicia was the best part of the game, hands down."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Subnautica BZ. Took me three tries but I knew I had to beat it before Grounded came to PS5 or I would never go back.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Stray. It was a bittersweet game for me because the cat looked just like my Harvey cat who passed away unexpectedly several years ago.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Dark Souls 2.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Jedi Fallen Order. New game plus seems so pointless.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"After getting the true pacifist in Undertale, I can't bring myself to play it again, it just feels wrong"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Usually, such games have mediocre gameplay or there is no variety."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"The Last of Us Part 2 would also be my answer. Unbelievable drain due to being one of the most violent games I've ever had the misfortune of playing (seeing that stab-in-the-neck animation hundreds of times...), terrible pacing, and making me do things (**>!**that HORRENDOUS final fight**!<**) that I straight up didn't want to do.

Yeah, I'm done with that one Naughty Dog."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24, Witcher 1
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Probably Disco Elysium. I loved it, but, once you know what’s going on, you lose a lot of the fun."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Have the same with Last of us 1, never played 2"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,most of them
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Duke nukem forever.  Terrible, absolutely terrible.

Also coincidentaly the last game I ever pre-ordered."

1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"I hate that it is this way, but OMORI. Absolutely fantastic game, but replaying it is so damn slow, it's the reason I probably won't grind 100% achievements."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"All games I have come across that I have beaten, prove as a fun challenge to try again. That is, except for Legendary difficulty on Halo Reach. "
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Most games, for whatever reason I always get burnt out the 2nd time around, especially if I do back to back playthroughs tho there are exceptions but they're extremely rare, the mass effect trilogy is the best example I have as Im currently on my 3rd back to back playthrough lmao"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Puzzle games - the only reason to go back is if I don’t remember the solutions.

Fuck. That."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"For me, all games above 40-50 hours of length have very little chances of being played another time.

The perfect game in that matter was StarFox64, which was taking about 1.5 hours to finish but had multiple paths to explore. I replayed that game about 60 times, if not more than that!"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"The original Last of Us.  I felt like it was a true masterpiece and never want to ruin that memory.

For bad reasons, Fable 3.

For good reasons, Halo Reach LASO.  It was magical but NEVER again.  That was a PAIN."

1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,The outer worlds and Starfield. If you force my camera to focus on who I’m speaking to one more time….
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"almost all of them. For some reason, I have a difficult time rewatching, replaying or rereading anything. I already know the outcome. I feel like it is a waste of time even though the action of playing a game is already a waste of time, I still revel in the new experience. 

Open ended games keep me much much longer."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Baldurs Gate 3. Not to take away from the game or the replayability of it, it's incredible and I know there's a million things still left for me to find. The problem is it took so many hours to finish, and now I know the essential plot points, so just couldn't get into it a second time."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"The portal games. I loved every minute of playing them, but I don't see the point in completing the same puzzles again."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Jeez. That's almost all of them because of who I am as a person.

I guess if I had to pick one specifically, I'd say Witcher 3. I hunted every contract, completed every dlc, and lucked out getting the best ending. An adventure complete after 400+ hours. After all that toil, I think we deserve a bit of a rest."

1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Skyrim. 

Wasn’t as good as oblivion and I never played it again once I beat it."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Pretty much any RPG. Don’t get me wrong, I love RPG’s. But when I’m dedicating 50-100hrs of my life in a single play through, I just don’t have it in me to give it a second playthrough. I think the Persona series is the only one I’d consider playing over again."

1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"The list of games I'll actuallt play again is a much shorter list. There's a lot of fantastic games where once I was done, I was *done*."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Dark Souls 2

After getting the plat. That game can go to hell where it belongs."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,I have never played a game that I finished with the intent of playing it through again in 40 something years of gaming.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Drakengard 3. That's enough trauma from collecting all the weapons alone, nevermind the final boss."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Pretty much all of them bro, it has to be special for a game to replay it. Nowadays we can barely keep up with game releases, let alone replay them."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Ghost of Tsushima. One of my favorites, but I can’t go through the horse pain again"

1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"alien isolation 🥹 loved the game, but shat my pants in the process"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Skyrim. I think I’m done. That is with the main story, DLC and side quests of Skyrim. Still gonna play Skywind and Skyblivion when they release.

I’ll also say Deus Ex… Just kidding. Now you gotta reinstall it though. Them’s the rules."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Any game that takes more than 20 hours at this point. I just don't have the free time anymore which sadly means a lot of my all time favorites. 

The witcher. Mass effect. Dragon age. Red dead redemption. They would all take me several months to finish at this point in my life."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Unpacking on steam, was fun but there isnt many levels. And replaying it just gets boring."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Puzzle games like Fallen Order. Why would I willingly put myself back into those frustrating mazes??
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"I love Baldur's Gate 3, but I may very well never play it again. I'd like to try some other classes and stuff, but like, I already know the story. There might be some surprise notes somewhere, and it might be fun to do an evil run, but ... eh. There's a lot of other things to play."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"The planer crafter.

I really enjoyed the game, but it was very grindy, and I doubt I'll ever do a replay. 

Dead Island 2 was another one. Loved that game so much, but no replayability to me."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,I hate multiple playthroughs to be honest.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Rdr2,and it's because you can really change the ending or alter the story enough to play it again."

1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,most of the games i play haha i want to replay the souls-likes though
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"The only game I’ve replayed is GTAV, I don’t know, there’s just something about it’s story and gameplay that no other game had for me"

1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Sorry for the spelling 




What remains of Edith Fitch - it was a good short story, but there is really nothing to do besides playing the linear story. You cant even die in the game except when the story does it. It was just too depresive to me, but still good one and i recomaind it to play at least one."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Either spiderman game. They’re fun but I don’t see much for replay value

1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Final Fantasy 15. I really hate the end-game. From Cerberus to Ardyn himself. I was only saying #### about it and I only wanted it to end ASAP.

I loved it so much that it was the first time I got the platinum trophy for a game, but I got so burned out by it that the thought returning to the Lands Between makes me feel exhausted.

I know the DLC is going to be great, but I don’t think I can bring myself to play it."

Super neat game that my wife and I just finished. Basically a first person idle tycoon game in concept. Very active early on, but eventually turns into a wait for number to get higher so you can make item to get your numbers higher faster. 

We 100% it then quickly uninstalled it. There's a chance they'll add new content, but eh."

1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Why not. I’d replay it on a harder difficulty because the gameplay is phenomenal.

1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Red dead 2. Tried a second time but just didn't enjoy it. Felt like a slog. I'll leave it as a beautiful one-time experience.

Truly one of the greatest games ever made and one if the greatest I've played, but damn it was a journey where I was stressed and on edge the whole time and the ending/story was so uncomfortable and upsetting"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Last of Us 2. It was a very draining journey, in a good way. But, I don't wanna revisit."

There's a few games that I always go back to, but they are games I never actually beat. I will sink hours and hours into them and then stop, but eventually reroll a new character, try new things, do things a little differently than before. Wash rinse repeat.
These games are
- Skyrim
- Dark Souls 1+2
- Mount & Blade Warband
- Minecraft (this is obvious)

But these are the only games I actually EVER replay."

It was supposed to be a fun hack and slash through a futuristic hellscape inspired by Norse mythology, but what I got was a repetitive marathon of a game where I only completed it because as a kid I didn't have many games. Now, looking back, I wish I just never got it."

As a kid we didn't have digital downloads of everything and having hundreds of games available at all times. Funnest thing to do was going to game stores picking out something new.

Watching G4/TechTv with shows like X-Play, Cinematech, Attack of the Show, Cheat codes. Such a special time to be around experiencing all of that."

Then again I'm the kind of person to watch a TV show and not be able to watch it again for the next 5 years at least."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Guitar Hero on expert. I sold it and bought a real guitar. 🎸
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,Dead space. I can't handle that suspense.

1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-26,Lego Jurassic world is complete BS after you finish it one time. I beat it when k was like 8 and now I lost it and I literally don’t even care
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-27,Red Dead Redemption 2. Rockstar games are notoriously long and the first play through was amazing anyways.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-27,"days gone, & any gta game"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-28,"Most story games. 

Maybe 20 years from now I pick one or two of them back up again but as of now, the memories are still fresh and a lot of modern games have quite a bit of slow sections and padding."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-28,Battelfild 1 una bestemmia dopo l'atra in modalità difficile
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,P5R. Overstayed it's welcome.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Cyberpunk. Truly an awful game
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Days Gone was a long, difficult, satisfying campaign - and quite a pleasant surprise as well. 

But I just know I'll never play that one again."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Dragon’s Dogma

I played it fully, waiting for the BANG moment that would surprise me, either gameplay wise or story wise, but it never came - ended up just being an okay game for me, so I never looked back"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Yeah, ones with like  a really heavy story. Great to experience once but don't want to go through all the emotions again lol."

1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Haha, I replayed last of us pt 2 immediately and then again a few months later!

There’s not much else that competes with its polish"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"I'm not sure I'll ever play Disco Elysium again. 

I went in completely blind, didn't look anything up online, no save scumming - just experiencing the story as a unique, private thing. I felt real emotional connections to the characters, struggled with where to place my loyalties, and literally gasped out loud at certain beats. I don't know how many endings there are, or if I got the ""best"" ending, but it was _my_ ending, and it felt right and final. I'm sure there's a ton I'm missing out on with different builds and decisions, but I know that I'll never be able to recapture the magic of that first playthrough."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Every game I have beaten basically. I find replaying games very boring because it's just the same thing again either story or gameplay. For me the best part of games is discovering things for first time, the sense of adventure which I don't get when I play the second time.

And there are so many great games out there to play"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Pretty much all of them. I don't really tend to replay games. 
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Don't play singleplayer campaigns
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Every game I beat. I get zero enjoyment.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Halo Series. They are good one and done playthroughs. But since they don't offer anything else after, there's no point of playing it again"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Elden Ring 
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Undertale... Sorta. I beat the true pacifist route and I refuse to beat the genocide route. I just like the characters too much.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Basically anything that isn’t Final fantasy!
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Most of them
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"All of them. Like movies, once I beat a game, especially the storyline, the novelty immediately wears off. Ironically, I can listen to the same song 1000 over with no issues."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Spiderman 2. It was anti fun. They knew we hated specific parts of 1 and they brought them back out of spite. They also decided to cater to cop-hater scum bags. And had a certain consulting company make the absolute worst missions of any game I've ever played. It was so bad that not only will I never play it again but I'll never play other games by the same company that I've loved for do long.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,basically every game I have ever played. I don't do replays. but definitely not elden ring. Plat and discard that turd. Souls games are downgraded RPGs.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Grand Theft Auto V, it's the only game i have completed in my life."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"yeah i felt fucked after playing that game but revisited it years later and appreciated it again, sometimes time is good for that kind of thing"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Any Assassins Creed.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Definitely uncharted 4. That game was so long and such a drag to play. Took me half a year to actually finish it. Which is crazy considering how I breezed through the original trilogy and how many times I've actually replayed them. I'd actually replay TLOU2 just for the awesome gameplay
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Everything. Once my story is done, it’s time to move on with memories created along the way."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"For me, Bugsnax. It’s Pokemon made by guys with a serious LGBT+ obsession. I like a cute gay relationship or a well written trans character in a game, but this game had way too much of it and was constantly in your face about it to the point it became unsettling. Won’t play that game again in a hurry."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Last of us 2 I can agree. Probably my favorite game ever but I couldn't get myself to go for the platinum.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,All of them. I don’t enjoy replaying games when I already know the story
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Final fantasy 16. An absolute waste of time and money.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Plenty I haven’t replayed, because:

Too hard - Super Mario Bros. 3, Cuphead.

Too easy - Sonic Forces, Pokémon Moon.

Too long - Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Undertale.

Too boring - Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Donkey Kong Country 1."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Probably Skyrim.


Enjoyed it while it lasted but I have zero interest in searching and configuring 300 mods from Nexus again, only for Bethesda to drop a nothing-burger patch with zero content that nukes my whole game again. 


I literally spend a whole week setting up my Mod list and troubleshooting bugs. 


 I shouldn't even be doing that, it's Bethesdas job to make a good game. Not mine, I paid for it. "
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Elden Ring.

I technically beat it multiple times and somewhat enjoyed it the entire time, despite those moments where I really didn't, but I'm going to consider 100% Steam Achievos as ""beaten once"" in this case.

For me, ***personally***, the world is too big and has too much going on that it kind of makes its replay-ability tedious.

238 Elden Ring bosses. I know I don't have to kill them all but that is still *significantly* more bosses than any other previous released FromSoft game."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Starfield
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Ghost of Tsushima, sooooo boring."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Witcher 3.

Once the platinum trophy popped I un-installed the game immediately.  I despised the boring combat with a passion."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"FF7 rebirth, game literally killed me emotionally with the nostalgia.  But the mansion was cringe and I got rid of my ps5

Same goes for ff16"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Demons souls... Never again
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,KC:D
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Skyrim.

I'm just done for now.

Hogwarts legacy, unless they expand the game or create a multiplayer mode.

Pokemon scarlet, super smash bros. Melee, because I already beat them and I have no need for a second playthrough."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Any GTA game - (Beating again wise)
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"RDR2.

The story was great so I finished it but the gameplay was absolute dog shit. I don't think I'll ever install that game again.

Hit me with the down votes idfc."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Spirit Farer once you know the story to that game there no point in playing it again.

Outer wilds is the same way once you know the mystery behind everything there no reason to go back

Planet Crafter, it’s a very linear progression system so once you’ve brought the planet back to life there’s not really a whole lot of reason to play it again. 

Any Super Mario game once I beat those once I’m usually done with them I’ve never gone back to one. (And I mean the mainline Mario games, not Luigi’s mansion)

Any Halo Games, I forced myself to play through most of them (on the fourth one currently) and although they were fun I just don’t see myself coming back there are some grand set piece fights but the coolest ones are short and the longest ones were always the worst and I don’t want to experience that again.

A Plague Tale Innocence, simply because I know how it plays out and the gameplay isn’t interesting enough to bring me back.

Breath of the Wild, haven’t actually beat this one yet but I’m close and when I do I have no plans to come back the durability mechanic is just not fun in a legend of Zelda game and the world is 3 times larger than it needed to be it is the least fun 3D Zelda game I’ve played"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Cyberpunk
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"I can tell I’ll never go back to Hellblade 2 when I get through that dull slog.

FF7 Remake I’ll never play again. Dragged horrendously."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,i will never understand people watching a movie or a series or in this case playing a game more than once(well in the games case i get it i have a few games i can go back to i'm playing dark souls 2 for the third time and each time i open eu4 100 hours of my life banish) there are so many things in the world to experience and they choose to go back to experience the same thing they already experienced except that this time they already know what will happen
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,I'll never play a game twice after beating it. Seems like a waste of time
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Yep and to add to that, the moment I see a New Game + requirement for the trophies, that's my cue to take none of the trophies seriously and have the most casual playthrough ever."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"This. I don't have enough time to play games I haven't played, let alone re-play old ones."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Yep. It’s actually shorter to make a list of games that I would replay once beating them for the first time
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Same. Especially if you have a subscription like Game Pass and you don't feel guilty about getting your money's worth. I will regularly hit uninstall a few minutes after the credits have rolled and any completion achievements have popped. Any games with achievements forcing you to replay games or play multiplayeryer get uninstalled even faster.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Same. Once i see the credits roll im done
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Besides RDR2 and BG3 there just aren't a lot of games I want to replay. I've finished Skyrim twice.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"No time to replay anything. But also, games are becoming less repayable with all the always online, multi-player gimmick. 

Arguably I've ""replayed"" Deep Rock Galatic countless times since the core concept of Danger, Darkness, and Dwarves remains the same every mission. But it would be disingenuous to qualify that as a replay."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Yep, Theres quite a short list of games that I've actually played more than once (excluding multiplayer games), and the rest is ""played once, watched a YouTube video with the things I might have missed and then never touched again""."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Yeah same, if I beat a game, or watch a movie. Im not doing it again"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Yeah same. Once the credits roll, I lose all interest to come back to it ever again, even if there's still post-game content. There has been a few exceptions to this where I replayed a game but I can count those exceptions with one hand and even then it's several years after the first playthrough."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Same, once I beat the game and possibly gotten the platinum trophy, I’m done and never coming back. There are a few exceptions where I might do one or maybe two more plays throughs, but it rare."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Yep that's my answer. Also it changes depending on how much time has gone by.

A couple months? Maybe there's a chance. A couple years? Nope, it's firmly in the past and I'll remember it fondly."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"LOL, you are so dam right. XO"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Darkwood or subnautic next 
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"One of the best games I’ve ever played

Never finished it, never plan on playing it again"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,i’ve beaten it 7 times (i love the alien universe) and it’s still stressful as hell.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,admittedly its much easier after the first time once you know how everything is gonna go and where you need to be without wandering too much 
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,I wouldn’t play this again solely because there’s segments where they force you to slowly walk for a boring spacewalk level
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,This but with alien colonial Marines. Is this a hot take?
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Is Alien that scary? I played the first few levels and it was nerve racking, but it never felt like Dead Space or Evil Within (for me at least)"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"I couldn't play that game without another friend in party chat playing it simultaneously. My girlfriend was dying laughing at a couple 35 year old men on ours mics like, ""Dude, you can do it! Just turn the corner, it'll be okay. I'm here with you in spirit!"""
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Personally I love replaying this one. Got pretty good at speedrunning it (glitchless no exploits tho, I never streamed or actually uploaded times or anything, I just liked to lol)"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Hands down the greatest experience of my life was getting to watch my little sister livestream herself playing Alien:Isolation for the first time. I had been ranting about it to her for YEARS. 

No other game has made me feel the way that game made me feel. Raw animal terror like nothing else I've ever experienced."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"I'm feeling the same way about AC Odyssey. It's my first AC game and I LOVE, but I don't see myself picking it back up after I finish it."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,The first couple regions were pretty fun but the 2nd half of the game felt like they just threw some shit together to make the game longer
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"I was about to start either majora or ocarina of time, would you share what makes ocarina so special for you? I'm also probably going to emulate on 3ds if that's the definitive version"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"100% ran through BotW twice. 

I won't be playing that game again.

Got maybe 25% through TotK but stopped because before the TotK launch, I played through BotW and the games are just a little bit too similar that I burnt myself out."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,I’m playing Ocarina of Time on 3ds and I doubt I’ll play it again once I finish. I will be walking around a dungeon for like 30 mins wondering what am I supposed to do next. Then I’ll look up a guide and realize it was something super simple. This has happened multiple times. I think I’m just too stupid for this game lol
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"I get bored playing through oot but I've beat botw and ToTK multiple times. The only thing I didn't beat in botw are the master sword challenges in master mode.


Botw and ToTK at least allow you to be far more creative with how you tackle the game.  Oot is mostly the exact same thing over again and the beginning of the game is so very slow. I'd rather play any of the 2d zeldas than oot."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Please go back to Zelda roots. We had our fun with the novelty of the Switch games.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Fair enough not wanting to play them again, but weird reasoning. You don't have to do any shrines after the intial four on the Great Plateau. You could literally go straight to Ganon after the Great Plateau. If you are saying it just isn't worthwhile replaying because the shrines felt meh to you, and there isn't enough other stuff to do, then I understand that.

I have to wait a long time to replay games usually since I remember way too much of them, and it bothers me."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Same, both these games started out mega fun and ended in a fucking grind in my opinion."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Technically beating the game is just defeating Ganon, you don't have to find ever shrine unless you want to 100%"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,The game is also incredibly memorable. I haven't played it since launch and still remember most of it. It's so great.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Thanks for reminding me of this game. One of the best sci-fi stories in my life (while having some of the worst designed enemy encounters I've experienced).

I need to replay this game while still on vacation next week."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,I don't think a second play through of that game is needed. That game's story is so good that it leaves an impression on your forever.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,This. The game and all of its endings is just art. The fact that you sacrifice your own time for another is the ultimate piece of art I can imagine a game could provide
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,NieR Automata 2 when? ;-;
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,No word of a lie i am literally just about to start my 2nd play through in about 5 minutes...
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,This is a neat idea

1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,At times I want to run the coliseums again but also don't want to grind chips again 😭
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"God I really wish I could forget the game so I could do it again, though."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,I thought the same but on a thread not too long ago someone informed me of some dlc. So I will be playing again 
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,why not? only takes you 5 minutes ;-)
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"It's my favorite game of all time... and it might be forever because there's no reason to replay it, so it will always be this *perfect* little 35-40 hours of awe inspiring exploration and discovery."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Yes and no. I replayed it after a year (main+dlc) and could appreciate it even more. You want to complete the memories 100% and you give yourself more time to enjoy it. At least it was like that for me. Outstanding game❤️
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"it's fun to start a new profile and try to complete the ship log, you get to explore all the locations again with a set goal in mind and you have enough knowledge that you can enjoy the journey without stress. people say outer wilds is a game you can only enjoy once and I think that's just flat out wrong."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"I played TLOU2 at launch and couldn't bring myself to play it again until the recent updated version released. I think I enjoyed it more the second time. 

You'd think knowing what was going to happen would dull it in some way but the beginning was even more tense!"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Both of them for me. I played through once for the great stories but like most horror/survival/stealth, they give me the exact opposite feeling I play games for- which is to relax. 


Like, I can’t stand Alien: Isolation. I know why people enjoy it and as an Alien superfan, I really appreciate the devotion to the source material. I just feel like ripping my hair out the entire time I play it- not fun for me at all."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,I'll never play part 2 again. Just an irredeemable depressing experience and I don't see the point. I think the world of tlou would have been better to have just ended after 1
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"My wife gifted me TLOU2 during covid lockdown... Fantastic game, truly a work of art, but fucking hell the timing couldn't have been any worse. She understood why I struggled to finish that game, it just felt way too on the nose"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Just have some FAITH, ARTHUR!"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"I have a friend who adores that game almost to an unhealthy level. He did five 100% playthrough on xbox. Then when it came to pc he did it again, if not more."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"I loved the 1st time I played through, tried to do it a 2nd time and couldn't get into it.  Probably my favorite game I don't plan on playing again."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,God not the snow tutorial again...
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,I started a second playthrough and tried to go for 100% but I just couldn’t bring myself to do it
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Honestly I didn't even like rdr 2 the first time. The second time is where I really started to appreciate it because I actually took my time and took in everything the world had to offer. I didn't finish that second playthrough but I made it a very large chunk of the game I will probably go back soon to finish.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"I recently replayed Killer Is Dead, and I enjoyed the experience a lot. I think it's easier to justify for shorter games, instead of most stuff released today that demands 30+ hours minimum. Another one I replayed was Lego Star Wars, the original one. It's much more focused and shorter than the sequel, and much better for it."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Thats gothic 2 for me i bought it about 15 years ago as a teenager and it was my first proper rpg. Ive beaten it sooooo many times but im still having fun with it.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,I just redid Earthbound last year! I wish I could erase my memories of first beating it
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"> rewalking the same road is never the same

I wish I had this attitude lol. I've been replaying the same games my whole life, I probably average 1 new game a year, if that"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Yeah I only reread books and rewatch things if I forget 80-90% of what happened. 

I still have Witcher 3 sitting in my steam library untouched. I should probably give playing the whole thing a go."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,The lack of difference between the houses was a bit disappointing
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,I wouldnt mind the merlin trials so much if it werent for the unskippable scene of the shrub raising EVERY SINGLE TIME
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"The first 20~ hours were amazing, but then the open world got really really boring, almost didn't finish the game."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,As soon as you get the killing curse everything becomes pointless really.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Same. I thought that once the game is out im gonna play it forever because i love Harry Potter but besides the story there is nothing else in the world thats interesting and even that is flat for me
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,I only created multiple characters to see the different common rooms.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Right now I'm taking a break from XC3. I finished the main story but man, the game is long. I haven't even done the yellow side missions and I had to quit. It's too much."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Yeah, they’re one-and-done for me, and I’m a huge Star Wars fan. 

I’ve experienced all I needed from a single playthrough + revisiting levels for collectibles."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,I remember replaying this game over and over from a save near the end. Looking for any way to redeem myself. Incredible story.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"I’ve only ever got through half of Yakuza Zero, loved it and then lost all motivation to continue. I don’t know if I can play through half the game again to finish the other half"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"I'm playing Zero - my first Yakuza game, and I am absolutely loving the cutscenes and drama.

I grew up with Hard Boiled etc and these games are those films writ large.

But yes - I cannot go through all that again - not even sure I would play another Yakuza game - theres just too much.

Perfect for the Deck though!"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,I’m trying to replay the Mass Effect series again but I just can’t seem to get through the slog of the first third of the first game. It’s one of my favorite game series of all time but I’m just waiting until I can get into it
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"I'll never finish that one. I hit a game-breaking bug and then dropped it. Once I found out that they dropped support of the game and I just never picked it up again. It's kind of sad thinking back on it. I did multiple playthroughs on the first three games. 

Sometimes games just aren't good on release, but if the developers put in the work, fix the mistakes and add content. I'll come back around."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"I dont think I have ever been more disappointed with a game than Bioshock Infinite. I am so glad Prey 2017 exists because holy fuck did I need to wash out the bad taste with a proper successor. Also really enjoying the system shock remake, even if I havent played in a long time due to being stuck on the chess match puzzle"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"I adored Infinite but I hated the DLC, especially the second one, so much that I’ve avoided replaying it. Also I don’t want to replay the game, now fully aware of the story, and risk picking up on potential plot holes and contrivances that could potentially ruin my first playthrough."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,And you *dont* want to replay it?
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Chu chu rocket?
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Yeah, I didn't finish valhalla because of that. I just left and never came back. But prologue was fire. Norway was cool to travel and had this climate I was looking for - then England came in."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,[deleted]
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Agreed. Day's Gone is something I want more of, but not a game I want to go back and revisit. The horde mechanic was so unique and engaging."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,I gotta get around to this game eventually
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"How is that sony's fault?

The game's critical reception was middling, and popular reception was that it was average-mediocre.

Most people who play it don't even bother finishing it."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,After a while I was skipping every conversation. I just didn't have time for it
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Zero Dawn was kinda similar for me. Same gameplay loop got me fed up.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,I didn’t get far before I put the game down. Couldn’t stand the combat.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Try going for the complete genocide route, do the “master reset” offered at the end, and complete a full true pacifist route. The ending is different and will creep you out a bit too."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"This is exactly what I was going to answer too. I loved it, but I’ll never play it again."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Same. I immediately uninstalled and haven't touched it since.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,ive tried to beaten it at least once but get bored each time.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"This 100%

I actually watched the credits roll and immediately uninstalled right after. I played it so I could say I did, but man that game was an absolute slog."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,I wouldn’t say it’s boring but the game is exhausting to play through I could go back and do the dlcs frankly I just don’t want to
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Mostly bcuz with the og spidey, you know what you are fighting. The good old villiains from the movies, comics. 

With Miles? for many a new character and a random ass new villain. All that while basically being the exact same game just different character models."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Rage 2 was super boring, Jesus. The setting had some great potential but they just didn’t do anything interesting with it."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,Got this dlc coming out lol gotta hop back in 🤣
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"I played days gone 3 times in a row back to back haha. The mini games are addicting, and I still can’t get a gold on like half of them.

Super overly hated game, as well as underrated. An easy top 5 modern single player game for me."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Same. I've tried to go back and it just turns into either following the same path I did the first time or forcing myself to go down a different path and being aware that I'm doing it. To me the vaguely left wing sad cop who learns that he is still alive despite everything is just who Harry is, and while there is some really interesting writing in the other paths it just feels like I'm going through content rather than his story."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"If you're not a fan, I agree. If you are a fan, many easter eggs are fun to find, although with Halo 2 Anniversary I guess skull hunting became redundant. I still want to play the campaign using the Scarab Gun, or the Black Eye skull."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Super Mario Bros 3 is too hard?


This is the funniest thing I've read on this thread as that is not a hard game."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Ocarina of time is too long? What? 

It's like... 20 hours. Maybe 25 if you wanna 100% it but... Even then that's still not long by any stretch of the imagination. TotK is 55-70 hours for a basic run of the mill playthrough, and into the hundreds if you wanna 100% it. Even if you do just the bare bones main story stuff it's still 45 hours minimum.

Lots of big AAA games are upwards of 100+ hours for the main quest stuff."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Isn’t undertale like 10 hours?
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Back in the day, I did 4 runs totalling over 1k hours, and only once actually ''beat'' the game.

It's more of a game you play to play it - not play to beat it."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,[deleted]
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Elden ring is entrancing and addictive when you don’t know what’s coming. When you already know the sheer scale of what you’re embarking on it can be overwhelming.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Hear hear!
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Yeah once was enough the remake was beautiful but I don’t want to go through the puzzle bosses again which make up most the game also fuck world tendency
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,For me it's the multiplayer trophies.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"I'm kinda glad that NG+ and Multiplayer trophies, even DLC are categorized for games like Ghost of Tsushima on PS5. So you can still get platinum by playing the regular original playthrough of the game only"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Luckily Horizon Zero Dawn you need to just beat the game once on very hard difficulty so get all the achievements and can use new game plus for it. Took about 2 hours (with the recharging suit).

But those games that list all difficulties and each one with their own new game plus, wtf."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Absolutely this, I have barely enough time to play through it once! Screw trophies for second playthroughs and multiplayer"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"As a kid I'd replay the same games over and over but I think that was largely due to having fewer games that I actually enjoyed playing. Now there is no shortage of great games that take like 30-100h to finish, and effectively no limit to how many I can play. Also, when I'm not playing through a game with a story, I spend a lot more time playing repetitive MP games online."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,">But also, games are becoming less repayable with all the always online, multi-player gimmick

You're really just buying the wrong games if that's an issue for you. There are tons of single player campaigns coming out still."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Subnautica with multiplayer is so much fun, even on the reply."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Did you get to the part where the Xenomorph starts hunting you?
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Do yourself a favor and play some of the earlier ones. Black flag especially.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Oh man. It took me 110 hours to 100% the game. By 90% completion, I'm completely tired of seeing the same mission over and over again. The Legendary beast were a nice change of pace though."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Whichever arc was the one where you smuggle out the queen and grab the guy’s old gf was dumb as fuck
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"It's hard to put into words why it's so special to me. There's definitely a degree of nostalgia to it, I first played through the game when I was in grade 4. That being said it's still a very solid game that holds up.

-Great soundtrack
-Tons of content without meaningless filler 
-Cool dungeons with flavour 

I could go on and on but one of the big things for me is the game doesn't drag on for 100 hours. It's not a chore to play at all (maybe one particular part lol)"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,[removed]
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Ocarina features more linear gameplay with a very basic hero's journey story. The 3ds versions of the game are definitive. Majora's mask on the other hand features more of a primitive open world design, with more of the map becoming accessible as you gain tools. The characters and story are vastly more unique and deep, but both games have incomparable charm and staying power. You really can't go wrong starting with either entry in the series, you're in for an amazing time either way."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Look up ""the Ship of Harkinneon"" or whatever for OoT"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Majora's Mask version on the switch is amazing btw, you can use the Suspend save feature to get around the only main problem with the original version: the save system. And the atmosphere is SO much stronger in my opinion than the remake."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"I played through both of them for the first time. Ironically, I played majoras mask first"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Definitely play OOT before MM. It just makes more sense.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"I just played TOTK again after burning out after completing the 4 region quests. 

Definitely recommend finishing it off the story finishes nicely."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Haha which dungeon was giving you problems? I've played this game multiple times and still do that so I wouldn't worry
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"That ship has sailed. Aonuma thinks linear design is the plague and the switch games have sold too much for Nintendo to think of going back.

We'll get Zelda games with the BotW formula until they stop selling, or the open world craze subsides, or Aonuma retires."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"That was the same for me. The front half was amazing, the back half was me forcing myself to play. When I finally beat it I wasn't even happy or anything"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,The anime on Crunchyroll is decent if that helps at all
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Ikr. Can’t wait for the dementia to kick in.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"I finished the DLC last week! It was really good, and continued the same vibes as original OW. I did have to turn on the “reduce fright” option not because it was scary, but because it makes certain parts easier to accomplish

It does a great job integrating with the main game, while being its own totally unrelated thing. Just so brilliantly designed (like the base game)

Once you finish the DLC, definitely finish the main game again. And stay for the post-credit scene"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,It's amazing. 10/10 and scary AF.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,'almost' lol
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"People dread this opening, but the tedious rancher opening area in the first game is much worse for me.

I'd rather watch cutscenes I've seen over having to herd cows again."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Man, same.  That final moment of seeing my name pop up as the final person to hear Paula's prayer and defeat Giygas send shivers down my nine year old spine way back in the day."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"I refuse to uninstall tw3, it's such a masterpiece. Played through it multiple times."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Damn, Witcher 3 is not a game to be left sitting in your library. You are missing out"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"I dropped the game long back. Is the end worth it? I had most of the spells I think by the time I was done. Didn't seem like a strong storyline game, just good mechanics and nostalgia."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Did a NG+ run and stopped a few hours in when I realised so much of the exploring was story locked, so you have all these abilities and.the game just pretends they don't exist so you can't get to certain areas"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Hard Boiled was so good, I haven’t thought about that movie in a long time!"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Keep going! A few years ago I had never played any of the Yakuza games, tried Yakuza 0 and fell in love with the gameplay. I really enjoyed Shenmue when I was younger and this filled that void that I did not know was there haha. I have played all of the Yakuza games at this point, and most of the spin-offs. It really is a great ride, most games I will skip some scenes or talking but with Yakuza games I really take my time."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Yeah the first game can be such a slog. So much backtracking and getting lost. The gunplay isn't great. I think it's worth playing through just to get to the second one and having all your choices carry over. 2 and 3 are so much of a better experience. I much prefer the linear level designs and gameplay is a lot better.

But if it's too much you could just skip to 2."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,The first game has no bad moments for me. The ending of 2 and most of 3 is a slog though.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Wlel that and the game should have been titled ""Parkour and Rock Climbing Simulator"""
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,It drags on for too long while also being monotonous.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Cursed Halo is always a fun and wacky experience, no matter how many times I play it."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-26,Idk I was like 6 years old last time I played it lol
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-26,"Idk I haven’t played it in a while and lost my NSO subscription lol 😭. But don’t think that means I don’t love it, it’s one of my favorite games ever!"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Maybe they’re just REALLY BAD at it lol
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,If you do a pacifist run you have to jump through a lot of hoops and I think it takes quite a bit longer. And if you do a genocide run you have to fight Sans and you know how that goes.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,I’m pretty sure I beat it in like 4-6 hours lol
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-26,"I played through the pacifist run twice, the hard-mode runs in the neutral/pacifist/genocide styles, and the neutral run twice. I’ve also found many Easter eggs, but I didn’t want to play through the pacifist run that much again. I’m not bad at it, someone else mentioned needing to go through many more hoops to complete a true pacifist run."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"There actually is a very high probability, if not guaranteed, that I will be skipping the DLC.

Not just because of the aforementioned reasons, but also because I, *personally,* can't justify spending $40 for a ***DLC***.

Edit: This is *my* opinion based on how I manage *my* finances. Just because it's worth it to someone else, doesn't necessarily make it worth it to me. Especially considering my previously mentioned stance on the base game."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,yea multiplayer trophies are sucks. i cant platinum my gta and rdr2 in ps4
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"As a novice who likes to play video games, I use the excuse that not everyone in life gets a trophy 😆."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,You speedran HZD IN 2 hours?
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"wait, there is a Multiplayer??"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Yezzir.   You know what though, I think it’s because I didn’t use headphones at the time. I should give it another go"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,I plan to. I'm trying to work my way through a back log of games and I plan on some more AC games after Odyssey.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,That soundtrack is etched into my brain stem. Chills every time I hear song of time or song of storms
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Fuckin water dungeon man.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,how does this compare to doing the...whatever nintendo plus plus + extra subscription is called that includes OOT? for some reason everything felt off to me.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Yeah, I bought the N64 controller for the switch just so my 8 year old daughter could watch while I help her out. Majora's mask is her favorite game now."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"what's the difference between the two? i have been waiting for the perfect moment to trying majoras mask. yes, i never played it. yes, i know, it's been a horrible decision that has haunted me. did this save issue exist in OOT? i wasn't aware of anything related to game saves."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Haha true. I only said almost because it has been a few months since he last played it. I wouldn't be surprised though if he has actually been playing but hasn't talked about it.

Edit: Just checked and he has 1700 hours on it for PC on steam. Last played... last month! That son of a bitch."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"I did a NG+ run just to finish the You've Got a Friend achievement and then uninstalled. 

It was great, but yeah.. got all I needed."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Same, mass effect 1 is my favourite game of all time. I loved everything about it. It feels more story based than the other two, so maybe thats why people find it a slog, but I still find joy in reading and listening to the codecs and listening to conversations and just experiencing the galaxy"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"To emphasize, the VR spin-off is just mountain climbing"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-26,"I did the pacifist run. I’m not bad at it, that run takes pretty long first try. Nice pfp tho"
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,I wouldn't skip it. 40$ is definitely not cheap but their DLCs are always of insane quality compared to the base games. The Old Hunters is probably the single best piece of content I've ever paid for.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,That $40 DLC will give you much longer playtime than $50 Hellblade 2.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-25,"I thought multiplayer trophies were a thing of the past by now.half because I play alot more single player games now , and half because I haven't heard of things like vid master in halo 3 or seriously since gears of war 3 ."

1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"The recomps of OOT and mm are a LOT smoother, and have some nice QoL features. The switch versions run at like 15fps, which is what the originals ran at on the n64, but imo a frame rate that low is rly jarring to play through in this day and age."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,Fantasic. You are a wonderful parent and should be lauded for this.
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"Majora's Mask on the N64 has - in my opinion - better atmosphere and also  more player freedom. For example, in majora's mask you can fire ice arrows at any part of the waer to make platforms of ice but in the remake you can only fire at specific spots which are perfectly placed for the easiest platforming. This works fine but it undermines some of the freedom and oppressive themes of the game.

The remake looks visually brighter in a game that often made use of the nd6 graphics and darker lighting. Shadows add a lot. The edged polygons are sharper than the smoothness of the remake but they add to the feel of an inhospitable world. Smooth surfaces are frinedly, edges and angles are offputting. This is a foundational concept in visual design. Squares are standoffish but solid, circles are friendly, triangles are evil. Check Lord of the Rigns for example, the dark lord's forces are filled with sharp edges and triangle-like designs in their armor, helms, and architecture for a reason.  Polygons are triangles and lower polygon counts make it more obvious.

The Save System is a major hassle in the N64 version because you have two ways to save:

1. Reset to the start of the timeloop.

2. Be directly at an owl statue and stop playing now, while still at the owl statue.

You cannot save in the middle of a dungeon to go do something and then continue where you left off in the original N64 version.

HOWEVER - the nintendo switch version of the n64 game included free on their NSO subscription fixes this even better than the remake did because you can use the ""create suspend point"" feature. This lets you save mid-jump if you want to, it effectively lets hyou create save-states. Which is awesome for usability: You can create a save state right before a time-sensitive challenge (like something that you can only do on the third day) or just before one that would require a trivial but annoying amount of backtracking to attempt again (like having to climb up a long ladder to retry a jump). You can easily control your playthrough and cut down on down-time this way. It replaces the default save system wholesale and makes for a great quality of life experience."
1cz8qdm,2024-05-24,2024-05-24,"In majora you have to save at owl statues, so if you're in the middle of something and mom said you had to come to dinner it's leave the n64 on pause and pray that there isn't a power outage. I mean I didn't mind the system, it was annoying occasionally. Ocarina you just hit that pause menu and press B (I think) to flip the screen and save wherever you are.

In majora you're also racing against time, you have 3 days in game to beat the game and you have to constantly watch that clock. So the difficult save system is sort of part of the whole time and resource management system. I think saving anywhere takes away a bit from the experience but that's just me lol, majora is my favorite zelda game of all time, and I've played almost all of them"

17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"In Star Fox Adventures, there's a part where you have to beat two trials in a village of... I think they're Troodons? Doesn't matter. They're assholes. One of these trials is an obstacle course where you have to run around their village and activate a few objects in time. If you've been playing the game and paying attention to your surroundings, it's not hard. If I remember right, you can even remove a couple of the obstacles ahead of time.

The other trial is the hardest button-mashing challenge I've ever played in anything. I could not do it with a turbo controller, even. The only time I beat it, it was because one of my friends was over and offered to try because he's a great masher. He really was. I was stuck on that challenge for weeks, but when he got through it for me, I beat the rest of the game in days. 

I never got past it again. That one challenge destroyed the game's replay value for me. Whenever I thought of playing it again, I thought of that, and it made me not want to try."

Further on the ""gunship"", it's presented as sufficient an obstacle to prevent you from outright murdering Kai Leng when he recharges, despite the fact that in Mass Effect 2, you can use the M79 Revenant, which is also available in Mass Effect 3, to down identical gunships simply by dumping an entire clip into them in a matter of seconds.

In Far Cry 3, a kidnapping happens organically in the middle of a mission when Vaas shows up outta fuckin nowhere. It catches you off guard and makes sense to the story. ""You Are Being Hunted. Capture Party. x9"" is lame and uninspired. Just give me a mission where I'm supposed to get kidnapped, don't just bag and tag me whenever the game feels like it. Is this an open world sandbox or a telltale game? Might as well put me on actual rails at this point. The story is great but I fuckin hate how the game chooses to tell it."

I had a character who had a spear that healed himself for like 2/3rds his health every time he hit with it (it was kinda OP tbh). And Sauron had an attack that put the whole party to sleep.

So he put my whole party to sleep, killed everyone except the spear guy. Everytime he attacked the spear guy spear guy would counter-attack and reheal to full or at least more than he just lost. That would count as his turn though, so then the eye would put him to sleep. My turn, he was asleep, Eyes turn he attacks him, counterattack, sleep, attack, counterattack, sleep.... And since I didn't choose counter-attack it just kept going without me hitting buttons.

I roll my eyes and have to force my way through the boredom, and it ruins the tempo. Another great game that does this was God of War ragnarok. I hated playing atreus.

17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"Turbo Overkill is a fantastic retro style shooter with some of the most liberating and expressive movement the genre has ever seen. Then there are the vehicle sections. Now the hover car was delightful, flying through the heights of a cyberpunk city and parking on the tops of skyscrapers to clear a combat encounter on foot. I liked that. The motorbike was ok I guess, it was used as an escape scene, riding fast to outrun imminent danger. It was ok, the controls where a touch floaty and I felt rushed, pushed forwards too fast to appreciate the spectacle... There was another hover car scene, but I won't go into great detail about that one, it was alright, but not quite as good as the first one.

On to the dumb bit. Now, there are several candidates I could pick from: the constant invulnerability + adds in the boss battles, some of the more restrictive arenas, and the time limited moments in the last level. But, as you might guess by my picking on the vehicles in that first paragraph, the dumbest part of Turbo Overkill was the mech segment. I love a good mech game, but on rails mech moments in shooters have not evolved since FEAR 2 turned replica into red clouds. In Turbo Overkill's mech you have the same load out as you get in the hover car: machine guns and missiles. It's clunky to move, but it shreds the mobs to pieces. The problem is that Johnny Turbo doesn't need a mech to take down hoards of enemies while being fun to control and armed with a plethora of devastating weapons and abilities. The mech limits what the player can do entirely, slows down the pace of an otherwise bat shit game to a crawl in a linear tunnel, and then the game makes you fight a boring boss (with invulnerability + adds phases) in the mech and I'm sorry for you if - like me - you picked one of the harder difficulties. I might be the only one, but I thought that was the most pointless and stupid parts of an otherwise crazy and fantastic game."

17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"Letss see how strong *you* are.

It's burned into my brain."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"There was a stupid button mash quick time event right AFTER the final boss in the Starfy DS game. Or I think it was 3 progressively harder button mashes so you tire yourself out on the first 2. If you fail it you have to repeat the final boss and cutscenes all over again. 

After like 3 attempts I gave up and never beat the game."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"The only way I beat that part as a kid was I was desperately scrubbing GameFAQS message boards looking for tips on how to get past the mashing battle.

Some random user suggested cupping your left hand around the right side of the controller and using your right hand to drag a pen back and forth across the a button really fast using the left hand as a stopper. This essentially allowed for double presses with minimal effort. After hours of trying I got it first try with this method.

GameFAQS guy, if you’re out there, you’re a god damn hero to 9 year old me"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"If I remember correctly that mash mini game has rubberbanding ai essentially. The faster you mash the faster the computer mashes. It was actually discovered that you're meant to mash briefly, stop entirely, then mash again and you win quite easily.

How a child was expected to figure that out I'll never know."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"À friend gave me the game because he could not go past it and was pissed off. I did the game, and gave him back just after it so he could enjoy it too!"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"U are forced to do it twice for basically no reason. Just to tell u you got tortured for a year by the bad guy who I guess was drinking fajitas the whole time cause literally nothing changes after u get out.

Edit: my brain farted and confused mojitos and fajitas and I was too lazy to check"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,I remember it as Fable is still one of my all time favorites. The race itself wasn't difficult at all but yeah it was a weird choice.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"Replaying now. Just finished it. I was so confused. I just spent 2 years in prison and nothing outside really changed? Nobody thought to look for me or mentioned that that happened? Occasionally an npc says, ""We thought you died"" but it didn't seem to have any effect on the rest of the game"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,Geez you just unlocked a memory. Was a pretty weird storyline too that did absolutely nothing beyond just…delaying the goal of going in in the first place. Fable and their prisons I guess.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"There's a shortcut. If you follow exactly the right path, you win the race easily every iime."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,I like it and always have. In Fable 2 aswell. It could definitely have been better though. I think it is way too short. Mostly because you only do one thing. You just race.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"That reminds me of the race in the original Mafia. It was SO HARD they had to issue a patch to make it easier or skippable, I forget."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,Also if you fail this race the game keeps you in the prison and your character keeps aging until you eventually beat it it's very annoying for a first playthrough I remember this and I failed at it the first time or so.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Kai Leng was bested by a terminally ill drell. As Thane put it ""He should be embarrassed"""
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"I'll add Mass Effect 2 to this for the reveal of the human reaper. The mission was fun and the boss fight was fun, but I bust up laughing every time I come out of that tunnel for the big reveal. It's just so silly.

And also fuck Kai Leng"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Good. You opened this message. This isn't actually Asari military command. They're busy tending to what's left of their planet.

So you survived our fight on Thessia. You're not as weak as I thought. But never forget that your best wasn't good enough to stop me. Now an entire planet is dying because you lacked the strength to win. The legend of Shepard needs to be re-written. I hope I'm there for the last chapter. It ends with your death.

17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,I feel like they should have made Kai Leng the Virmire sacrifice or something. Someone with an actual connection to Sheppard.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Man, I feel so disconnected whenever I hear people talk about this dude.

I beat the trilogy when it was new, and at this point I swear I don’t remember even meeting this guy.

And I got the ending with my entire squad there."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"Yeah, the weakest part of ME3 by far is Kai Leng. Trying to jam a ""nemesis"" for Shepherd just kinda outta nowhere doesn't really work. Especially when every encounter is:

1. Kai shows up
2. You completely kick his ass to the point he probably doesn't land a hit
3. He escapes in a cutsecene, often through Deus es machina
4. He taunts you because he escaped
5. Repeat like 5 goddamn times"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,I'm pretty sure absolutely everyone always takes that renegade interrupt to shank him on the Cerberus station.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Plus like half of the classes Shepard can be are biotic and could still damage the gunship and bring it down just like we do in other gameplay sections 

ME3 was rushed and badly written, especially the ending

There’s great character moments in there, I’m not denying the presence of good stuff in the game but they needed to give the game more time 

It’s crazy to think about now that ME2 and ME3 only had about a little over two years of development each"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"I don't check here very often, so I don't know if this is a popular opinion, but Kai Leng should have absolutely been whichever squadmate you left behind on Virmire in me1. Would have made his edge lord bullshit 100x more palatable."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,Whoever made Kai Leng must've loved MGS4 Raiden a little too much.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"Thanks for writing this.

I'll always hate that asshole. 🤬"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"I love mass effect 3 but man I hate that fight as let’s be honest shepard and their squad would easily mop the floor with him, also Liara is forced on that level so doesn’t she just grab or pull him and just use her biotic powers. Nothing annoys me more in games than cutscene incompetence"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Panicky mad dash was my tactic and it worked swimmingly. The game kinda spelled it out for you, making you walk through this insane path that was obviously going to flood with enemies upon starting the loud af generator. I think it was a brilliantly tense moment."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"I think the game allowed you to do it both ways, the enemy type that they put in there says a lot, ""you can fight here, there are a lot of them but you can do it if you are good enough"" or ""there are a lot of enemies, make a run for it!"" I personally love that scene and always fought it out but that's because I'm a sucker for tlou 1 fight mechanics"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"As soon as I saw the generator, I paused the game, looked up ""Last of Us Basement Generator Cheese"" and proceeded to set mines at all the spawn points and then practice my escape route several times."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Halo 4s entire campaign was walk to this button and push it, then walk to this other button and push it. All while fighting boring enemy types. Awful Halo game."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"And especially cause the 3 separate people I've played it with didn't realize it was a QTE so they died, waited in the loading screen, rewatched the cinematic, and then got the QTE. Really takes you out of it."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,The first shadow of war game was the same iirc. A fantastic game let down by a silly final boss.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"fun fact IIRC the final boss doesn't even die there, there's a book to reveal that he secretly lived (and I think later died in that book because why should master chief actually accomplish anything on-screen in his game)."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,TIL your opinion of Halo 4 is the same as my wife's opinion of me.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Felt the same about Uncharted 4
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"All of halo 4 felt like a reach reskin aside from the new forerunner enemy type. The pelican mission felt like a photo copy of the mission New Alexandria. 

I'm agreement to your comment why was there a QTE? Would've fit well if there were other QTEs in the game but nope and it was the final boss fight at the end of the game."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"just generally devs need to remember that the final boss is going to be the last thing many people experience in your game. Not the collectables, not some obscure hidden boss that you need to look for. But the plotline boss. It doesn't matter if there is a deadline, it doesn't matter if there is a budget problem. Make sure that is a satisfying way to end the game that player's have spent X (potentially dozens or even over 100) hours playing. It isn't a QTE, it isn't pressing a button. Seriously what do most people remember about fable 2 (besides molyneux's expected seriously overhyping it)"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,Halo 4 was a bit disappointing.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,I hate the sparkle that fakes you out. Like what's the point of disappearing so fast?? How is this fun?
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"It’s funny to me how I only discovered the powers part like 110 hours in, after doing everything I could before continuing the main quest, was too afraid to get through it too quickly.

Ended up only having powers for my last few hours of gameplay, and honestly didn’t miss them. I don’t know why people bash the minigame though, seemed pleasant and quick enough, I only did it like 7 times though, didn’t feel the need to get more."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"There's a way to avoid those, just uninstall and play a better game."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"My hopes for the next Elder Scrolls game are not very high anymore.

I shouldn't be surprised though. Skyrim disappointed me with the muddy/blurry textures and low poly jowls on Khajiit on launch day, 11/11/11. I was more innocent in those times. Yes, I played and enjoyed it... with a few hundred mods 10 years after it came out. (I couldn't finish it back in the day because of game breaking bugs and gave up after playthoughs in 2011 and 2015).

Honestly, Bethesda is incompetent and the only reason their games are popular is because their IP (Elder Scrolls and Fallout) are really good concepts. They just execute them poorly. It's no surprise that when they tried something generic like ""space!"" there's no there there."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,It fits with the rest of starfield though 😂
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Missed the ""otherwise great games"" bit"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"I felt such dread when I realized I'd have to do that minigame dozens and dozens of times, possibly even hundreds. That might've been Starfield's final nail in the coffin for me"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,For me it's so bad it's good. Super cheesy. Even by 80s standards it's cheesy.

17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,People tend to ignore it because of nostalgia but honestly the entirety of Halo 3 is a complete trainwreck in terms of writing and narrative. Which is a shame because the missions and setpieces are amazing.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Doesn't matter, just land somewhere, send out troops, order them to fire in anything ""alieny"" and we'll go from there."

17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"I like most older AC games, but AC1's gameplay loop was trash as hell, it wasn't very narrative driven, you basically ride your horse to a city, take the contract, kill the contract in a very railroaded way and get the bounty, repeat 10x until you face Al Mualim, thank God they fixed this in AC2 and it's my favorite game because of it."

17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,and then when they made a standalone gwent game it just wasn’t the same
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"My criticisms of RDR2 really came to a head in Guarma. Dutch kills a woman, probably needlessly, out of paranoia, and it's supposed to be this really dramatic moment of where a serious moral line gets crossed. But earlier that day, I killed three people in a fight that I started when I punched somebody's horse by accident."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Story telling aside, I actually like Guarma and wished there was a bit more with it. It was a nice change in locale and tone.

I'm even more disappointed that they didn't do more with the southwest of the map (Mexico), story wise, in the prologue. You can finish the game and most quests just happen in the north part of Mexico. There are some interesting interactions far south but it feels like cut content."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"I loved Guarma.

I hate how little it mattered and it can never be revisited. It was just a weird time out.

Which sucks because there was so much potential."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Guarma was enjoyable in terms of gameplay. But it broke up the pacing in a really strange way. If they'd done it earlier in the story, or just put less story before it or something, it would've been better.

As it was, you could just feel events coming to a head and then you get thrown into this weird time-out. I couldn't even enjoy it because I spent the entire time wondering ""why the fuck am I doing this right now"""
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"What exactly do you mean? 

I really liked Guarma, since it took the player into another very different environment. It also showed the beginning of Dutch getting mad, starting to blame John for everything. Also there are the first signs of Arthurs sickness. The only flaw I see in it was not being able to explore it freely and the general lack of content there."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Yeah. The MJ sections aren’t great either but they’re at least better than the Spider-Man 1 ones. But the biking sections are just a bizarre Inclusion. Why would I want to ride a terribly handling bike when I’m fucking Spider-Man.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Nah I love the that stuff tbh. Personally I think those moments where you are not playing as Spider-Man are imperative.

The most important aspect of Spider-Man as a character is the fact that he’s an everyman. His alter ego and normal human life is just as important to the conflict and drama of any given story as his heroics are. Any adaptation that doesn’t focus on his both parts of his double life is a failure as an adaptation imo. For a video game that means both sides have to be interactive.

Those moments where you play as Peter or Miles doing normal human activities are the difference between the games being fun games where you play as Spider-Man and the games being genuinely good Spider-Man adaptations."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,I REALLY hope in NG+ we’ll be able to skip those activities.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"So, so awkward. It’s not even a good bicycling mechanic, it’s just clumsy and weird. I don’t know why they bothered with that shit, but I think it was a total of 2 missions, and that was it. I’m mostly happy with that game, but the bicycling and a couple of other “nothing to do with Spider-Man” parts could have been skipped."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,I didn't hate it. But it did feel weird. Honestly I'm more disappointed I couldn't ride a bike again as Spidey.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,I skip theough all the puzzles. Seems like a waste of time to me.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"There were an unlimited amount of autohacks you could get

You didnt need to do the puzzles"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"I remember the first one I tried I was like ""Ok they've thrown in some new mechanics, cool,"" but it took very little time for me to hate those sections. It's easier to just kill the fucking island"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,Friendly reminder that only the first 3 levels are mandatory and that the last 2 just give you some free armor which honestly isn’t that good. The 5th level can also be cheesed by placing turrets near the target block and waiting for them to randomly shoot it.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Came for this one, it was an ugly wart on an otherwise fantastic DLC"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"Yeah, not to mention the quest was so glitchy I actually had to install a mod to bypass it on pc because otherwise those dumb bug things just would not move and I was trapped in the quest."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,">Holy fucking shit, why couldn't this have been a cut-scene

Absolutely this.
It could have been one of those hazy dialogue-free journey montage sequences you see in movies sometimes, some music, cut to Arthur walking, cut to Arthur sitting down to dig a barnacle out of his foot, cut to more walking but more tiredly. The sun moving along to suggest the passage of time.

That would have been fine. 

Forced interactivity *can* be interesting as a slice-of-life thing, like in Mafia II when you're starting out, and Vito loads boxes onto a truck as a warehouse worker or something like that. It works, because eventually you as the player will get tired of it, whether its after 3 crates or 10, and when you do, Vito will comment something like ""that's enough, fuck this.""
It gives you a moment with the character. 

But there's a trick to it, and that beach moment wasn't it."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"That's the *short* version of the intro to MGS V, lol"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"In the remaster, it has absolutely INSANE scaling on higher difficulty levels, to a point where people mentioned doing it 150+ times and not coming even close. I remember it being hard in the original game but damn."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,Lords of the Fallen has the absolute worst platforming Ive ever dealt with. And I loved the game. But my death count by fall dmg or misstepping into giant brutes off of a curb is way higher than my death count by actual gameplay. They gave the character a 1x1 ft jump box. Might as well not let us jump.

17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"I would say the MJ level where she’s pinging target for Spidey was quite fun, but every single other one is awful."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,But then they made you jump off a ramp on a bicycle
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"Just got the game on Steam sale. You people made me believe MJ sections would be tedious slow stealth. What I got was quick, easy sections. So, stop lying"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,That whole area was so disappointing compared to the masterpiece that is the rest of ds1
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,It's a weird boss and one I spent too much time having to redo all to get in a single hit
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,For me it is Taurus Demon. I can mostly coast through the game but that motherfucker still gets me a LOT.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"I'm replaying Cyberpunk. If that's the mission I'm thinking of, I took my time on this one and found the cop you're chasing stops when out of sight and continues when you catch up. I drove carefully because I had that exotic car that drives 200mph and is super squirrelly in turns. So I drove carefully. It helped not getting too messed up from being hit from traffic."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,I hate games that do that as I know gta 5 does that shit but the worse has got to be drag races in the old need for speed games mainly underground and most wanted as I swear it doesn’t matter what lane you pick some dick head in a van always pulls out right in front of you
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Its the first mission of the Sinnerman side quest. I know because the whole side quest is a waste of time IMO and thats just the first step.

Always lodge a bullet right in that holier than thous face first chance I get."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Trick with these is always to take your time, slow is smooth smooth is fast."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"If you drive at a regular speed you avoid the car spawns and they just yeet themselves out in front of you, and it's hilarious to watch."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"And if you kill a pedestrian while swerving onto the sidewalk, your car automatically stops and they “get away”!"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Sinnerman!!!!!! Fuck, I just finished it after try 3 (on 3rd playthrough) by actually killing that guy with a sniper rifle. Here's how:

First, you need the quickhacks to stop movement and weapon malfunction on the one cop that pops out when they stop under the overpass. Run past him and duck into the depot to the left just after the overpass. Climb high and stay out of sight of the workers or they will aggro. The resulting FLOOD of aggro'd cops won't be able to find you, and once the wanted level disappears, there is one corner of one shipping container you can crouch on to get line of sight. Dome that prisoner and go on your merry way."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"I told myself I could grind through it to the master sword, but once I learned that weapon had durability as well, it kinda made me give up on it."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,You basically just need to know where your favorite weapons spawn and do a quick fast travel run for them. It's far too frequent.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"I don’t mind it. I feel like if it didn’t exist, there would be no incentive at all to fight enemies after a certain point because you’ve already gotten your preferred weapon and upgraded armor, so why bother? It’s not like you get EXP. The only thing defeating them would do is they’d drop resources you’d ignore because they’re pointless now. 

Once you got all your stuff you’d actively avoid fighting any fodder because it would be a waste of time, unless the game forces you to do it. It’s not like old Zelda games with tiny rooms and top-down view that made avoiding enemies hard. 

Hell I already avoid enemies a bunch right now in Tears of the Kingdom but at least if I do fight high level enemies they’re giving me parts that make my weapons better, and weapons to replace the broken ones."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"This is why I never got into games like Dying Light. 

There’s no logic to having a crowbar that will break after x amount of hits."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,That plus the pure barrenness of the world did me in. The horse helped but if you like it good fucking luck they have a range limit on the whistle. Liked climbing random shit though.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"Emulate it on PC with Cemu. Ez preinstalled mods with Cemu where you can choose the durability time or completely get rid of it.

Keep in mind thought that it does change the gameplay to be even more easy if you disable durability."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"I'm so happy I bought the physical game so I could sell it off after experiencing that awful durability system and tiny inventory. The game is beautiful and I love the physics and small details, which made it so damn infuriating that I didn't even try the sequel."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Tbf that part is meant to piss you off
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"Don't forget the one where you had to drive cars into the harbour, because they were rigged to blow up or something... against the clock in two minutes, I hated that part so much.

Also the constant lack of ammunition - in a game that is all about auto fire, explosions, chaos and action.

JC4 sucked!"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"I knew it was going to be bad, so I just ran right through. I actually really liked it. Super tense and memorable part of a game with a wealth of memorable moments."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"I actually found a great solution for those: Played like roughly 20 hours before getting to the first temple. Did the whole thing. Got the power, went outside the temple, tested the power, closed the game, uninstalled. Because the game is a mediocre, shallow, reskinned Fallout 4 turd."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"I think the worst part about that is how mysterious and intriguing that whole sequence is when you first discover it. You’re left thinking, whats the meaning behind the sound and the imagery? There are so many possibilities that could lead to sick story lines about how it all works and how the powers began/were created… then you get to the end without knowing anything, only for the other 400+ times you have to do the exact same thing in the temples and witness the same animation which just reminds you of how disappointing the main story is"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"""Here’s how to do stealth in the game"" ""So I'm going to use stealth a lot, right? Right?!?"""
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"The drill demolishes the big sister

Lightning then drill"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"I mean, you can actively choose when the Big Sister event is triggered lmao.


Just go get more ammo, set up traps, then trigger the b*tch and boom, easy peasy."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Oh yeah. I loved that game. That level is hot garbage and a waste of time.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"Agreed also what was up with action games and having slow garbage water levels as dmc also had them, like who actually thought they were good and fun. Only good part is the doku fight the rest of that level is awful"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"Yes, I hate this in any game.  I am much more the kind of person who likes how Halo approaches this: as you progress through The Pillar of Autumn, that's exactly how quickly you need to to escape.  And the ending is timed, yeah, but it's more than enough.  Really just there for effect unless you have been walking everywhere the whole time and are out of practice.  Plus it has checkpoints."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"Bonus facepalm if the screen transitions in a way that you can't hold one button or you go up/down the ladder again.

Most recent one I've encountered this with is Enter the Gungeon, where if you hold up to climb the ladder to climb out of the elevator shaft but don't let go fast enough, you fall back down the hole and have to do it again."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"It’s so weird, he has very little gameplay variety that you essentially experience it all in the first section you play as him, yet the game has 3-4 more sections like that. Not to mention that he only has 2(?) finisher animations that don’t even change with enemy type."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,I honestly didn’t mind playing >!as Atreus!<. His combat obviously wasn’t Kratos but it was new and unique so I liked it. It’s just that >!Jotunheim!< was way too fucking long and didn’t really do anything for the plot. It had like 3 separate sections of chores and were all connected by you wading through water slow as fuck. The sections in >!Niflheim!< and >!Musphelheim!< were leagues better and they had >!Thor!< with you too and he was great.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,They keep trying to make me like playing as Atreus... It ain't happening.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Man the island intro seems great compared to kh2 intro and I agree the first games isn’t good. But the intro to 2 keeps me from going back and replaying it even though it’s a great game.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"Only one I liked was the one where Spidey is hiding and you can call out for him to web up guys. That was fun. Otherwise I hated them

Don’t have the sequel but was sorry to hear these mission were back"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Carrying the bomb at mt kadar to get past Niles. I liked that level it was a bit annoying on insane because 2 people controlling the camera movement got a bit tricky sometimes.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,Yeah really is the only flaw in a nearly flawless game
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Its fine in stardew valley imo. Idk about any other farming sims
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,You and me are moral enemies. I literally *always* appreciate a fishing minigame to the point that I'll neglect other aspects of the game to fish more.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"I'd go even further and say any fishing minigame in any game. Want to know what the best part of a game focused on fighting giant dragons is? A dumb minigame for ammo (Monster hunter) /s

If it is absolutely needed to have fishing be part of the game 'press button to fish' is more than sufficient."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"It's fine in HoloCure, IMO"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,FFXV is a fishing sim
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,What about the Knuckles/Rogue scavenger hunt levels?
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Yes those sections are annoying for me it was that one quest where there was a fire in a manor and you had to save two npcs in there that was the worst and most infuriating part of the game (still a great game but some of the sections like that quest or the puzzles feel like they were overlooked/weren’t revised later on in development)
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"There's also the infamous ""Escort Men Through Sewers"" mission in Jak 2 even though I still don't think that's the worst mission in that game."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"I disagree, those are one of my favorite little mini games. Well worth the 20 rupees"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,If that game didn't exist this is the kind of sentence that would indicate a stroke.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-15,"I'm surprised I don't see this mentioned more often. It's such a tedious quest, and ultimately doesn't matter because the Carnivale is rigged and you have to steal the prize anyway instead of winning it.

There's a trick to it, at least. If you get to the flag first, jump into the canal.  Your opponent cannot swim, so you can use the water to get you right next to your goal, and just climb to the roof to score the point."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,😂😂😂 fuuuuck that did my head in
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Just curious, when do you have to lose? Been a long time since I've played and I don't recall that"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"It's supposed to be hard, you're playing as the worst team in spira against the best, but you definitely can win"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,I couldn't win ANY bliztball match. For some reason it just never made sense to me.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Not to mention that dark bird boss prob one if the most infuriating and unfair bosses in the game imo ( and thats saying something cuz the game has a lot of them lol)
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Same. I stopped at that same section because I hated it so much.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,The Water Temple is great because it really makes you think and solve a complex puzzle.  It's also bad because of that same reason.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,ChatGPT
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"You don’t have to, though. You can just dodge/block his attacks and avoid stepping on gloop."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Yep.  I even bought it as full price game called Pipe-Mania in 1989 for my Atari ST.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,The pipe one in BS1 is my favorite minigame of all time. I was thrilled to bits when I discovered a version of it was in Spider-Man 1. I've wanted it as a phone game for years.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Oooh yeah, I really like those!"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,The hacking ones? No. The sequel really improved that.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,There are an infinite amount of autohacks you dont even need to do those puzzles
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,I thought he dodged the tank shell like the also super unnecessary backflip to dodge ocelots shot during his introduction. He did jump off of a missile fired at him from a helicopter to mid-air shoot it with a stinger missile launcher. I prefer the more grounded approach to the original but when I'm in a mood i can totally get behind the Twin Snakes' utter and complete nonsense.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Do you mean the ME1 DLC on the asteroid, where the batarians shoot the woman's brother, and it's completely irrelevant. She's like 'my bro died... anyway"""
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Headcrabs!!?  Sacrilege!  They’re called facehuggers and headcrabs wish they were as cool!
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"Difficult to learn, rediculous to play, I’m glad the game of it only lasted a few minutes and you didn’t have to really do anything."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"There's so much cool stuff on the other side of that bullshit. It really is a good game. If someone were to mod it so that mashing challenge was a little easier, or make it a fight instead, I'd play the whole thing again right now."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,I used a D20 running it back and fourth over the buttons I need to push. Works like a charm.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,Lol holy shit that is amazing.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,What the fuck and why the fuck
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"And they do it again in Fable 2 when you go undercover in the Spire for 10 damn years. Love those games but I really don't understand what's up with these sections, lol."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,I assume you meant drinking margaritas (or eating fajitas) but drinking fajitas is a hilarious thing to imagine a villain doing
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,Drinking fajitas? Impressive.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"That drell, though. 🥰"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,To be fair to Kai Leng. That drell WAS Thane but
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"I feel like the human reaper would’ve been less silly if they had followed through with having different designs in ME3. Like it would’ve been cool to see Reaper ships that maintained the look of the species decimated to make them. Like some macabre puppet. 

Instead they went back to all Reapers being leach-ticks. And gave some lame excuse as to why there was a giant skeleton for the human one."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Absolutely! Honestly I love ME2 and the Suicide Mission is amazing, but the human reaper is a really big wtf moment that doesn't make any sense."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,*edgy cringe echoes through the galaxy*
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,I wish I could say it was a pleasure.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"The end ""boss"" of dying light is just some dude with a knife. I've killed hundreds of some dude with a knife, the game has you face several at the same time in the tutorial, you just hop skip and slide all over those clowns as is intended and it's a lot of fun.

Not this particular one dude with a knife though. After a really long vertical chase using most of the game's mechanics, finally catching up to the dastardly fucker he has the audacity to be a series of fucking quick time events with no actual gameplay combat at all!

When I reached the top I was fucking salivating at the chance to finally drop kick, smack, block, parry, throw knives at, and finally head stomp that shit like I had practiced and speced into from the start. Nope. 
Not allowed to hit because it's his turn to stab me, to up the stakes you see, but I didn't press a at the right time so now the dude I thought I was playing as pulled out a banana peel from his pocket and fell to his death trying to tap dance on it.

They didn't even pump his health up or give him any gimmicks, just made the fight hard in a cutscene you can fail"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,Holy hell but that is a fantastic narrative choice that I am now pissed they didn’t go for. Would have taken some hardcore hand waving to explain how their body survived the nuke though.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"He's simultaneously incredibly annoying and incredibly forgettable. I usually forget about him until someone else brings him up, then I'm mad lol."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"Yes. I've done it both ways, but ONLY if I have a lot of ammunition.  It cannot be done without a pretty full arsenal, and even then you might have to kill a few by hand.  What got me the first time (I ran) was that the whole time I'm connecting it I really was thinking ""what am I going to do"" and coming up with a plan exactly like Joel would have had to do if all of this was real.  After that, the scene lost a little charm for me because I know it's coming, so I can plan hours in advance and get all my stuff if I want to fight."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Its only saving grace was FINALLY Flying a pelican. And even that was underwhelming.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"I played Halo 4 back when it came out and found it alright but pretty forgettable.

Played it again recently on MCC, and realized... *""WOW I actually kind of hate this game.""*

lol it's so bad, just fucking up SO much of what made the originals great."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"I will admit though, Wonderful 101's ending where after a long fought battle against the final boss, the final blow is a lengthy button mashing QTE while the main character calls out an insane and ludicrously long attack name, the main cast are also button mashing, and even the Earth itself joins in to help with the attack, was certainly memorable."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"Lol. It's so easy they had to do *something*

Are you using the run button to activate the boostpack while you're floating around?"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"It's probably due to the fact that many people want to grab every power and there's like 24 of them possible, so it gets super tedious. I wish they had done it once for the spectical, then treat them like the word walls in Skyrim.

Major Spoiler warning: >!Plus doing them all over again in NG+ to get improved versions of the powers adds even more, with some people trying to do all of them all the way through NG+ 10 or more for all the secret beginnings. So some folks are doing them 100+ times to get every power maxed out since fewer spawn on some runs.!<"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Same goes for literally any game because every game has something that's bad or boring.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"I just did last night. Got to ng3 and thought, What the Hell am I doing? It was barely fun the first time.

Skyrim, Oblivion and Morrowind have never been uninstalled"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"After FO76 and now Starfield, I have zero hope, hype, or expectations for the new elder scrolls and fallout games. Bethesda games have been getting worse and worse with every entry."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,Bethesda is one of the studios that seems to never build upon great features in their games. It’s truly baffling.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"I've never liked Bethesda visuals. Their games always look washed out and low poly. This hasn't changed at all, except now the last 10 years has seen leaps and bounds for artistic design in games. Starfield looked visually terrible. The characters look forgettable as fuck, colour is non existent, everything looks cobbled together. 

They desperately need an overhaul."

17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,The Iraq war + 80s nostalgia made the 2000s a perfect time for that sort of ‘oooh rah!’ military cheesiness.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Yeah, Halo 3 gets most of the nostalgia love but Halo 2 is better in almost every way lol"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Yeah, it kinda is, isn't it."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Which is terrible, because the most badass line was in Halo 2. I don't want to mangle the quote, but it was about giving the covenant their bomb back"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"It’s all vibes and they were my kinda vibes in 2007

It’s pop corny fun. A narrative that takes itself seriously enough to build a cool world, but it’s dumb in all the ways that would not\* make it a good story to non-game literate folks. I’ve loved the books, but they were nothing more than boredom cures while I was in college

EDIT: a word"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"Hah! YouTube algo fed me a video just yesterday called something like ""Why was Halo 2 so fucking hard?"" And I had no idea of the baked-in disadvantage we all suffered through.

Enemy reaction time: incredible.  
Master chief health and shields: shit.  
Enemy spawns: ambush, no cover.  
Our time to kill: high.  
Their time to kill: low.  
Checkpoint soft-lock/RNG: allowed.

It was a horror game even before the Flood show up."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"I do the same thing to this day lol. I'll yell the protagonist's name when they don't do what I tell them to. Lately, my man Shay has been driving me up a wall."

17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,There wasn't even an awning in the way...
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Yeah AC1’s gameplay is very dated but I will say the targets had some really cool monologues if you let them talk long enough before striking. Also their death cutscenes were way more interesting than the Ezio trilogies imo, because AC1 embraced the moral greyness whereas AC2 onward was very much Templar = bad and Assassin = good"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"AC1 was a great proof of concept, but not a great game."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"It's like if those ""follow that car"" scenes had the taxi driver say ""over here?"" as they veer into every alley"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,Task failed successfully.

17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Yeah it's a scripted event when the hunting party gets close you're done for. You can get away from them by heading off road or very high up in aircraft. If you're too close to them in an aircraft it will still trigger.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,That’s what happened to me when I got kidnapped the first time in my first playthrough except I was flying an attack helicopter while chasing down some Peggies. I love FC5 but the kidnapping part is annoying as hell.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,intentionally hard and bad design are not mutually exclusive
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"The first star, yes, but then there was another star that requires you to jump 100 times.  I know because it’s one of the two stars that kept me from 100%ing the game."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"From what I've seen of the volleyball one, it seems extremely tedious and takes too long to do 100 hits.

It's like 5 secs per cycle, so 8.5+ mins of perfection doing something hard and boring."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"It wasn't hard, though. It was time consuming."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"There are at least two missions with Bonnie where you do that and one at the end of the game, plus one horse herding mission."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"At least the horse bucking I recall would continue to show up as an optional job for extra cash if you'd like. Didn't pay very much though, I always preferred just doing the night watches."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"It was the silly space cannon but with different sized asteroids flying at you in first person mode. Left and right triggers each operated a cannon, and the goal was to pretty much reduce the size of the oncoming asteroids, as each asteroid required multiple hits. It took me a lot of tries both times I played it."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Man, it's been 20 years and this comment still stirred some deep flashbacks from that mission!"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,And the weapon where you can only get by dodging 99 bolts of lightning without being hit.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"I absolutely hated it when they changed the game play. When the standalone originally came out it was exactly like game, but then they changed it to the format it is now and it just isn't the same."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Evil run in RDR2 is hilarious when presented with the scripted moral issues.

The town of Strawberry and the rest of West Elizabeth was deep red with max bounty because it was just the place to go and be deeply evil, get constantly chased by bounty hunters and deputies who give a lot of ammo and jewelry for money. Just murdering and robbing for fun.

But let's make Arthur really struggle with being the bad guy by demanding money from poor people on behalf of Strauss. ""How dare you milk those poor people for their last dollar by being a loan shark?!"" Meanwhile Evil Arthur had just murdered an entire family and ransacked their house for no reason at all."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"That's honestly why I miss the silent protagonist for Grand Theft Auto.  I'm supposed to listen to the drama of my characters personal life, their drama, their strife...

...Then see if I can use pedestrians as a ramp once I get control back."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,That opened up New Austin part of the map would've been prime space for a single-player DLC/Expansion. But for whatever reason Rockstar just doesn't want to do that anymore.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Honestly with how much content there is in RDR2, it didn't really matter"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,And also not being able to come back in the endgame or online
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"I love Guarma too! It's probably my second favourite chapter in the entire game, it's fast paced and really different from the other chapters!"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Yep. Also why am I working so hard to dispatch bad guys as Spider-Man when I could just one hit them with MJ’s stun gun 😂.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"I really never got this argument….I mean yes I understand it’s comparatively way less fun to do things not as Spider-Man, but the intertwining of Peters life with being Spider-Man is crucial to the character. Insomniac understands and is trying to emphasize that by making you actually be Peter too. 

Slower sections in games to dump exposition are extremely common - god of war and last of us and uncharted all immediately come to mind as doing similar things. People would complain if it was just really long cutscenes so there’s no winning here. I think the action in SM is so much more explosive than the Peter sections that maybe do drag on a bit that it gets some undue hate for it. But those slower sections make the Spidey action that much more appreciated imo."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,All of the things you’re saying are correct. It’s just that the bike handles like ass and you have to spam the X button just for it to go extremely slowly. I’d literally rather just walk.

17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"I wanted to see where it went, next time I will indeed shoot him in the face..."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,The cars wait for you to hit invisible checkpoints to start driving and if the chase car gets farther than 50m you fail the mission.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Combat was never a problem, it was just the annoying drivers."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"> Once you got all your stuff you’d actively avoid fighting any fodder because it would be a waste of time 

Actually what happens on Master Mode, though. Unless there’s a very specific thing to get, it’s absolutely optimal to avoid enemies. And even then, your go-to should be stealth and not assault. 

Weapons go faster on master mode and the enemies hit harder. You’re absolutely incentivized to avoid *because* of the weapon durability system. 

It’s also why I just don’t play master mode, I enjoy the game way more on the regular difficulty."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Dying light is easily 10 times better in that department. You can repair the weapons and it is insanely easy to get powerful weapons in the first game. The second game sucks I wouldn't recommend it

17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"What a dogshit take.

Starfield has it’s issues, and it’s certainly my least favorite Bethesda IP. But calling it a mediocre Fallout 4 reskin is just asinine. Of course they feel similar, all Bethesda games do, it’s why people like Bethesda games, they want that classic Bethesda feel.

I have plenty of complaints with starfield, but to say it’s a bad game is hilariously stupid"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"I forgot about having to just dick around as Roxas for like THREE HOURS doing absolutely nothing worth anything. I don't like the island, but yeah fuck this shit in particular"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Agreed. I can get why it is frustrating in the beginning, but once I did it a few times, I rarely ever miss a bite. I think people really ignore how good food buffs and tackle can be for fishing.

I like it a hell of a lot more than games where you just press a button once when you hear a sound or see an animation."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,I disagree so much that I installed a mod that removed the fishing Minigame. I could never get a hang on it. 🥲
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,Good thing you aren't mortal enemies. Or you might have to fight to the death instead of just disagreeing.

17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Definitely not true. A lot of games have something boring in them but there are plenty that are just quality games the entire time
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"All due respect, I don't see how one could find the task to be anything *but* tedious. It's like trying to make a U-turn in an 18-wheeler. I used the jetpack, I learned how to time it out, but every experience left me wondering why I had to keep doing the same boring thing with no variations whatsoever. Walking from a quarter mile away, waiting for the gate to slide down, slowly bouncing from orb to orb, killing the single enemy that spawns outside, and searching the menu for the new power, only to ultimately never use it because of how unintuitive the power menu is. I'm just ranting now, hahaha"

17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"Yesss thank you! Also so many more levels and tons of level variety. When Halo 3 came out, besides the graphics (shiny cars = groundbreaking tech in 2007) I was kind of disappointed by the single player coming off of Halo 2."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"I remember when they introduced Brutes, Drones, Prophets, etc. in Halo 2 people lost their shit. *Where the fuck were they in Halo CE?* They weren't even *hinted* at in the original game. I don't think **most** people cared, but there was definitely a vocal group about it.

&nbsp;

Then Halo 3 introduced more things that were never even hinted at in the previous games. Bungie was *really* flying by the seat of their pants when making those games. I've watched all the documentaries and listened to all (or most) of the podcasts of Bungie when they talk about the development of the original trilogy. Spoiler Alert: >!Halo 2 had a hard deadline that was impossible to fit everything they wanted in, and the Campaign/Story arguably was hit the hardest.!< But look at Halo 2 and Halo 3 multiplayer. One of the greatest multiplayer experiences **ever**. I am deadass serious when I say I am still playing Halo 2 and Halo 3 multiplayer to this day, and as recently as last night. Halo MCC is a godsend."

17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,This is honestly why Rouge has become my favorite in the series. (Currently trying to finish it for the first time and 100% everything.) I love the implications that the Assassins and Templars aren't so different or good and evil as we've been led to believe up until that point. Would love another game like that but that's a pipe dream.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,Odyssey focused so much on moon variety that it completely forgot about the completionists. It's one of the only huge complaints I had with the game
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,I just used the glitch to get this one ngl. Can't remember if they eventually patched it tho.

17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"Oh!  I do remember that.  For some reason I was alright at that, and also with the space junk thing in 2.  Probably because I spent unmentionable hours getting good at the castle thing in Super Munchers.  Dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge!"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,I think it's 200

17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"No no, it's because MJ takes them by _surprise_. And when you're surprised you're less grounded, right? So you conduce electricity better. 

That's the only logical explanation."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Yeah It’s a bit odd logic at times. However I did finish the game this weekend and despite a few minor flaws I absolutely loved it.
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"I mean, you could also one-shot enemies from stealth as Spider-Man. It works the same as MJ - the only reason why she can also one-shot them when caught is because the alternative is to either design a whole new hand to hand combat system just for MJ or to give you a game over. From a game development POV just letting you get out of being spotted by one-shotting whoever spotted you is by far the neatest solution."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"It always felt super weird to wail on average Joe people and absolutely curb stomp them, then later in the game they suddenly tank so much more and take 2 long combos to go down."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"I was never into racing games, so the entire mission was a huge eye roll for me, both 20 years ago and now. Glad at leasty you enjoyed it!"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Know that exact mission and can even pick the cars out of a lineup if you showed me some screenshots. What's makes it even dumber is that the car you're chasing rubber bands to you so u can plow through all the npc cars, spin around the opposite direction,  and still manage to catch up before you hop out under the overpass. 

So not only is it tedious and annoying, but it doesn't matter anyways removing all stakes and immersion to get it right. Should have just had the npc in the car driving if it was going to be pointlessly scripted"
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,Maybe I'm confusing missions then. Thanks.

17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"You seem insulted. No need for that, it won't change my opinion.

Problem here is it doesn't even have a classic Bethesda feel. It's like a watered-down version of space Fallout, without the great atmosphere, since that was inherited from the og Fallout games anyway. Bethesda really had to try to fuck that up (although the best in the series was New Vegas, which was Obsidian all the way. No surprises there) 

Taste is subjective, but if you feel ok supporting a company that feeds you half-baked games with outdated mechanics and an even more outdated game engine, go ahead."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,It is actually pretty simple....if you are using mouse then use the c key if I remember correctly. Also fishing is lucrative once you get higher level and sell for more. Also I like fishing mini games. Even in Skyrim.

17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"It's there in the original, but as a ""blink and you miss it"" detail.  In the 3DS version, what they actually did was extend the cutscene to really point out that there is an opening underneath"

17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"To be clear, they didn’t bail on that idea. They just didn’t do a good job of explaining it. Every reaper *is* like the human one where its form is that of a harvested species but they’re encased in shells that all look the same."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"No they rewrote the story or rehired the writing room between each game. The plot changed drastically between 1 and 2 and while they stayed the course on some things for 3 they definately had to cut costs on some stuff, like cutting and pasting all the reaper designs in 3 when we had a cut scene in 2 with hundreds of different styles of reapers."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"There's a mod that makes him shut the hell up, gives him a helmet instead of that dumb mask, and changes that message to a different one (if I remember correctly, an Asari Matriarch berating you or something of that sort). 

That boss fight was still nonsense, but overall in my second playthrough these changes made Kai Leng come across as kind of interesting in an OT Boba Fett 'what even is his deal?' sort of way."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"And yet people think the idea of him coming back on 5 would be too unrealistic. Like....after Citadel, isn't it pretty clear they can just clone him without a corpse anyway?

Sure you'd be missing memories from whenever your last sample is from.... but even that could be handwaved by having a ""black box"" built into Shep's skull by Cerberus. And would this ruin the narrative? No, not at all! Because the stakes are never about the Commander's life, the stakes are the galaxy as a whole.



An increasingly cyborg and inhuman Shephard could have been an interesting direction to take things in. I still wonder if we're going to see some sort of Shephard AI like SAM in Andromeda; the last vestiges of the Commander still traveling with an aging Liara as she tries to save the galaxy."
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,Except New Alexandria was a fun mission
17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"A mod shouldn't be required to remove a bad fundamental mechanic to the main story of the game. It should have been noticed during testing that players would get tired of such a tedious thing. Obviously this is anecdotal, but I have not seen anything positive about the floating mechanic for powers.

Also, ""just install a mod"" is useless to people who play on console. Not everyone can afford to play on a gaming PC or even wants to, they also deserve a good experience."

And the whole point of the game and Shay becoming a templar wasn't even ideology driven, it's just the Assassins were stubborn, were about to make a huge mistake and refused to listen to Shay.

I'd say AC3 does a better job painting the conflict in grey."

If you get shocked on the finger but there’s no path to ground through your body, you’re fine. If you get shocked and there’s path to ground through your foot or the same elbow, you’re probably fine. The real trouble is when the current has a path through your heart, ie you get shocked on your right hand and you’re holding ground with your left, because the current passing through the heart can cause arrhythmia.

I think the availability of gliding around the city so fast kind of backfired. I could be anywhere on the map within moments, not even using fast travel, which I think may have “shrunk” the map, at least in my mind. When there’s almost no obstacle to getting across the city, it kind of gets a little too easy.

17ucwqb,2023-11-13,2023-11-13,"Hmm, I think this is dependent on how you quickly you expect to find games. I don't know if you played Halo 2 or Halo 3 back in the day, but finding games would typically take anywhere between 2-5 minutes. Sometimes longer if it was a playlist that didn't have a lot of people in it.

&nbsp;

While I love all gametypes, SWAT for Halo 2, Halo 2 Anniversary, Halo 3 and Halo Reach are the fastest I find games. I don't play any Halo 4 at all, so I have no idea what those queue times are like. If SWAT isn't your thing. I've also played a decent amount of Snipers playlists, Team Slayer, Precision Slayer and Objective games. Those have a longer wait time than the SWAT games, but honestly not by much.

&nbsp;

I think with todays games, we are expecting *instant* matches found. Those games are better optimized, and they simply have much larger playerbases. The older Halo games always took a while to find games, but I honestly don't feel like it's any longer than what it used to be. If it's taken longer than 6min I usually back out and restart the search (same thing I did in 2007) and it usually works.

&nbsp;

It's funny because all those things you used to do to get around the way they coded the games back then, you completely forgot about. But if you remember, and do them, they still work, lol.

&nbsp;

TL;DR: Sorry for the long post. I'd recommend you select H2, H2:A, H3 and Reach. Then do Slayer, SWAT or Snipers. I play Halo MCC very casually (and still get ~+15 or more, lol) so whenever it's looking for games I just dick around on my phone until the game launches. I'm not playing to rip out as many games as possible. Just looking for some mindless fun for a few hours."

And when I came back to it later and actually finished it just feels fucking perfectly awful, like the ending turns the best part of us into the worst.

I was severely surprised that one of the big complaints about the sequel was about a certain tragedy in the story (the death made me sad too) because the genre is post-apocalyptic tragedy, right?

xfx774,2022-09-16,2022-09-16,"MAJOR SPOILERS:

Obviously subjective, but it felt extremely contrived and unsatisfying.  The game had very clearly been trying to get the player to see that Ellie and Abby weren’t that different.  You play as Abby, see her past and completely different perspectives of events you’d already experienced.  By the end I think the goal was that the player would no longer want the revenge they’d fought for since the beginning of the game.

And it worked, at least for me.  I didn’t want to kill Abby.  I’d seen both perspectives and I didn’t want revenge anymore.  But that was because I the player got to experience and see those events from Abby’s perspective.  

Ellie did not.  Ellie didn’t see anything like we did that would cause a change of heart.  To her Abby is still the monster that brutally beat to death the person she cares most about in the world, killed Jesse, shot Tommy, beat her up, almost killed a pregnant Dena and just a few moments before bit off Ellie’s fingers.  There is no rational or logical way that Ellie has a change of heart and just lets her go after all the dozens of innocent people Ellie has killed to get to this point for revenge.

After this she goes home to find Dena has left which just further reinforces the feeling that everything the player has gone through was completely pointless.  Especially everything past the theater.

Revenge is bad is pretty much the central theme of the game.  A more impactful ending while still sticking with the main theme would’ve been for Dena to have already left Ellie because of her choosing this path over her, Ellie tracks down Abby and kills her and the game rolls to credits while she’s kneeling in the water.  In this moment the player and Ellie would feel exhausted and empty from the journey and probably having done something the player didn’t want to do.  She got her revenge, but it was a hollow victory that cost her everything in the process.  When you seek revenge you better dig two graves.

Instead we got a hollow ending that changed nothing.  What was the point of the game?  What was the lesson?  The game asks a lot of questions and hits a bunch of morally ambiguous notes, but it never even tried to give an answer.  

This was the exact opposite of the first games ending.    An ending which I consider to be one of if not the best in video game history.  TLOU1 laid out it’s cards and let the player decide instead of trying to force a point.  Life is not always black and white.  TLOU2 tried to lay out it’s cards, but all it had was an empty deck."

However, due to the fact that OP's personal preference can not be disputed (people can voice their objections, but they cannot dispute as they have no grounds to do so) that means that it can't be a ""hot take"" as that would require the presence of a ""popular opinion"" which can't exist, as only OP can decide what he likes.

So for OP to claim that his indisputable post is disputed would be objectively wrong, and thus, stupid

xfx774,2022-09-16,2022-09-16,"First of all, I mean no ill will, you explained your point in a civil and logical manner, I would just like to suggest a different perspective.

I think you, having experienced Abby's story, instinctively believe that the choices Ellie makes are based on events that took place within the game's plot. In this case that creates a logical issue, because Ellie has not experienced a huge chunk of the game's plot. But she did develop in her own way. I recommend replaying the game and checking Ellie's journal routinely. She writers down her thoughts, fears, poems etc., and especially in the last chapter she clearly writes about how she doesn't even care about Abby anymore.

So the reason for her changing her opinion has nothing to do with developing empathy for Abby, she is struggling with her family's reaction to her vengeance, and also her inner guilt about not avenging Joel (reinforced by Tommy, who clearly hasn't moved on and hates her for giving up on Abby). There are reasons for Ellie to make the decision she makes, even if you only consider her perspective. It's just hard to do, because this game confuses your emotional intelligence way more than most games do.

As for the tone of the ending, it's definitely not a happy one, and not even necessarily a satisfying one. I guess that's up to you to decide, just like the ending of The Sopranos or No Country for Old Men. But if you say that this ending made the journey worthless, then you also have to say the same for the first game. Because Joel also undid everything they worked so hard for. The difference is that the first game still left you with the relationship of Ellie and Joel, while the second game only leaves you with loss. It's harder to swallow for this reason, but thematically it's not that different."

He never explains that, but for some reason he keeps going back to that like there’s a problem.

Also he seemingly thinks that Dina and Ellie kissing doesn’t matter? But in the context of the trailer it’s literally the most important story beat that they show.

Also why does he disagree with a tweet of someone complaining about sexist people? What does that have anything to do with him? If he’s not sexist then he shouldn’t feel personally attacked by it.

It seems like he’s only okay with diversity if it’s of the side, but if the main character is a minority that is forced? What’s the difference? He never explains that.

He says that he likes playing as female characters but only names one, why doesn’t he name more? Surely there has to be more than one notable female character.

The video seemed really promising but he makes many hypocritical arguments and it just seems like he‘s either dumb or has his own agenda."

17xuhsn,2023-11-18,2023-11-18,Great! Any word on the remaster for the remake from last year?  I’m concerned that Part 2 will look slightly better now and the transition will be too jarring.

If you can't be someone worth rooting for, at least be someone interesting to watch. Ellie alternates between making the worst decisions it is possible to make and hurting everyone around her, and being just boring as hell.

I'm not trying to be contrarian when I say TLOU2 was the most miserable gaming experience of it's era, and polishing the turd a little more won't make it not a turd."

Getting hurt a lot, being sad, doing morally questionable things, and/or being a member of a minority don't make a character deep or compelling.

They devote long cutscenes and excessive dialogue just to confirm how awful Ellie is, even switching to the antagonist's perspective to drive it home.

This game is just unnecessarily long, and most of that length is either miserable or boring. You could cut out seven straight hours of ""gameplay"" and lose nothing of importance.

1xjv8e,2014-02-10,2014-02-11,"Remember Mass Effect DLC controvercy? Forbes did a good article about this called ""Why the Exploitation of Gamers is Our Own Damn Fault""

*""What EA, and many of the other companies are doing, is a simple economic experiment. They know gamers are a loyal group, and they want to see just how far they can push you to shell out money for the “complete” experience of a game you love.
The truth is, if items like map packs, DLC missions and pre-order bonuses didn’t sell, they wouldn’t exist. Plain and simple. With each new bold “affront” to gamers, these companies are testing the waters to see just how far they can go with an a-la-carte model. Do you think if no one had ever bought the first Call of Duty map pack, that they would have kept making more? Now the game sells $1B worth of $60 copies in two weeks, with every player knowing full well that twelve more maps will be coming in another three packs for an additional $45.""*	

*""All this said, there is a limit. Eventually companies will find a breaking point where they are simply taking too much away from games and charging too much on top of the original price so that it drives consumers away. As soon as the numbers stop adding up, the practice will reach a plateau. The problem is that we're not there yet, and though each new step forward takes us a little closer to that cutoff line, we simply haven't shown these companies that what they've done is truly that hurtful to us. If it was, these products and games simply would not sell, and the practice would be scaled back. And that isn't what's happening.""*	

Short answer is: Don't support this shit.

But offer me the unlocked version that has no pay wall for $9.99 or $19.99 and I'll buy it if I like the game.  I rather not be bothered with having to pay here and there for things.  

But I'll tell you why they won't ever do it.  Because they make more money with tons of these micro in-app purchases than a one time fee.  A lot of people see nothing wrong with buying coins, and gems, and one time use items for $0.99 each and end up spending $100 or so for the game.  Offer it as a full priced game for $10 and they just lost $90.  But man it pisses me off.  I will never support this model, ever.

The only in-app purchases I'll make are for additional levels after completing the first ones - to me, that's the same thing as buying a sequel and I don't have any problem with paying them for their work.  As far as I'm concerned it is completely unacceptable for a game to expect you to buy game tools *during play* that *affect the game in any way* (obviously that refers to real money, not game coins you accumulate).

I'm wondering if they rolled out different versions for different platforms? OP, what are you playing it on? I'm in USA playing on iPad.

Personally, if they are only charging 2000 coins per lawnmower, that isn't that big of a deal to me. That isn't real money. That's money you get in the game, and it doesn't take long to get. It's a free game, they give the coins for free, and the only purpose of coins is to spend them on powerups, plant food, and now lawnmowers. I guess I just don't get the complaint people have with free games. Numerous games you pay for have in-game currencies that the game tries to make you spend."

Here's my opinion on DLC/IAP (In app purchases)

If you make a game with DLC or IAP, you should make it so the whole damn game can be enjoyed without DLC or IAP.

Example:

Lets say i made a mobile game called: SUPER DUPER REDDIT ADVENTURE

You would play as the reddit alien going through levels and collecting upvotes and fighting evil downvote monsters.

Anyway, to get to the point. The list of in app purchases would be this

1: Turn snoo into a cat!

2: Extra in game currency (upvotes)


Both of these things are optional! The extra currency is only if you want to spend money on any extra stuff, and AT NO POINT would currency be needed to progress.

I think this is a good idea for any mobile game developer

As soon as I heard the news that PvZ2 would be free, I knew it would be crap. I installed it and played a handful of levels just to give it the benefit of the doubt (since it was PvZ, after all), and yeah, it was F2P exploitative crap and I wouldn't put up with it.

As you shouldn't have.

I think people are way overdue in realizing one simple truth: **ain't a game more expensive than one that is free.** 

There is NO free games. It's smoke and mirrors. There are two ways to make you pay: either you do it upfront, honestly, and you receive a complete, integral game that you can enjoy from start to finish and be done with it, or you do it after downloading it, ir order to have the right to play the game the way it should have been in first place, without annoyances. We are paying to not be annoyed by a game. It's CRA-A-A-A-A-Z-Y, as Dave would intelligently put it.

This free to play shit and the vast number of shitty clone games on both app stores is going to bring about another video game crash like in 1983.

The crash was caused by exactly what is happening now.  From wikipedia.  The main cause was saturation of the market with hundreds of mostly low-quality games and a lot of clones of popular games that were sold at cheaper prices, which resulted in the loss of consumer and retailer confidence.  Sounds exactly like what is happening now right?  How is the average consumer going to know the difference between Flappy Bird and Flappy Bee?  How is the average consumer going to know that you can just buy games, and not spend hundreds on micro transactions to buy back lawnmowers or whatever heinous thing they come up with next?

I think the industry is too big to completely crash like in 1983, but it might happen to a lesser degree."

EA Need For Speed racing games, in which they basically force you to watch advertisements for car companies in increasingly (and purposely extended) loading screens. I stopped buying into the NFS franchise after watching what I counted as many hours of BMW commercials in the form of EA loading screen audio/video. "

1xjv8e,2014-02-10,2014-02-11,"I'm torn about this. One, because I have many friends at popcap and know that if a big game like this doesn't do well, EA will start laying off the hard working and talented developers on PVZ2.
But on the other hand, monetization methods are being pushed too far toward evil than I'd like. Meeting monetization goals and making a good game sometimes do not line up."
1xjv8e,2014-02-10,2014-02-11,"I purchased the first PvZ 6 times - Xbox, PC, PC steam, and all three mobile platforms as I switched phones.  It's a great game and I have no problem paying for it so I could enjoy no matter where I was gaming.

When I heard PvZ 2 was free to play, I had serious doubt as to whether it would be a worthy sequel.  I installed it, played for a few levels and determined it thoroughly was not.  As expected, the free to play mechanics had changed the gameplay to the point where it was a grind and not fun or relaxing. I uninstalled, mourned for the lost opportunity of a good game, and moved on.

I paid them many times over for the first game, and would have done so for the second as well.  In a case of actual irony, by trying to squeeze some extra cash from me they have guaranteed they will receive none at all.  Not one damn dime will I pay for garbage such as this."

>especially as someone who has been **supporting** these games and the franchise since it's birth.

To me, in the context of a free to play game, ""supporting"" means ""buying stuff"". Have you bought other stuff in PvZ before, and are reneging now because you think the lawnmower stuff is too egregious, or have you always exclusively played for free?"

And as much as it sucks when dlcs do come out and you're so consumed by the game, you cough up the dough... dont lie. However, if, as a consumer, I were to cough up the dough lets say for pack openings on Fifa 14, I'd generally want my money's worth and I feel like that is where EA is lacking and losing customer satisfaction; I don't want to pay up and literally get nothing in return.

1xjv8e,2014-02-10,2014-02-11,"Just my two cents here...micro transactions should stop when they actually affect your ability to play and/or finish the game. Purchasable variant aesthetics or bonuses are perfectly acceptable micro transactions in my opinion. However, the CEO of EA was mentioning paying to reload your weapon in battlefield. Is that it then? Is it LITERALLY pay to play? No money no bullets? That is where a line is drawn and where price gouging occurs. You can empty a magazine or a clip in a matter of seconds. Imagine paying $60 for the game, playing for 30 minutes, wasting all your ammo, and then begin paying $0.99 every 3 seconds. Of course that's a very exaggerated example, but clearly within the realm of possibility judging by the CEO's comments. I don't believe there are currently any laws preventing unreasonable charges for luxury goods/services but I do know apple has had to readjust prices before due to consumer complaints and I'm sure if EA continues down its path it too shall feel the fury of the consumer market."

1xjv8e,2014-02-10,2014-02-11,Posts about fuck this developer or that developer due to micro transactions always show up. The only problem is people continue to purchase their content. The only thing they recognize is $$$. The masses need to stop buying content for them to realize its a problem.

One thing that hasn't been mentioned all that much is that YOU ARE PLAYING A SINGLE PLAYER GAME! (this goes for any computer game with micro purchases.) Just go into the .dll file and give yourself whatever modded content you want to... If it's a single player game(read, not multiplayer with anti-cheat measures) than guess what... You can cheat. 

""But Stwjester, That's cheating."" ""Uhh, YEAH!"" I'd rather cheat at a single player game than lose real Life Money getting ripped off by one. Hell Single player games use to go out of their way to add cheats into their code for players(And they still do, UpUpDownDown Bitches!)

1xjv8e,2014-02-10,2014-02-11,"Only title I am still buying from EA is Battlefield. and thankfully the business model in Battlefield series is not that bad (for me atleast). Yeah you pay the price twice (one for the game one another for the DLCs under the name of Premium). So I think of Battlefield games as not 59 dollars but 120 dollars (more or less). And I am happy with all these maps and new weapons,vehicles etc. 

I hope they wont fuck up upcoming Battlefield games and Battlefront games with micro transactions or other shitty stuff. I can buy premium for Battlefront if the base game is good as Battlefield. I am sure they will add new planets (Endor,Tattooine,Mustafar etc..) with the DLCs for Battlefront and I can pay for more maps. Or just buy a Battlefront Premium pack. 

other than that. I am happy that I am not a fan of their other titles thats fucked up with micro transactions, especially mobile titles. 
"
1xjv8e,2014-02-10,2014-02-11,I already stopped playing the game because of how bad they botched it. Going to go ahead and uninstall it now. This is fucking stupid. Knew it was going to shit when EA acquired Popcap.

The mechanic is that if you lose a mower in any level it is gone in all levels until you rebuy. So if you loose the 2nd from the top - every map will have this missing. OP got owned and lost all his mowers in one map, thus no mowers in any map - until he pays. "

Instead EA has got nothing from me."
1xjv8e,2014-02-10,2014-02-11,"This isnt the only patch which has ruined this game... Not that it was that great to begin with. A couple of months ago they changed this from a map setup where you could earn or buy ""keys"" through gameplay or money to unlock additional levels and plants. A patch made it a line and pushed those challenge levels into the line as a ""you must beat this level to proceed"" sort of thing and allowed players to earn the plants without keys. Great you may say, and in theory yes it is. However in practise it made the difficulty go sky high as players were required to do all 3 star levels before proceeding with the game. Now while I have no clue if this is still the case (as I swapped from the official free2play game to an old apk version) this was still pretty shit of a change. "
1xjv8e,2014-02-10,2014-02-11,"You know what, I didn't mind when they released it for free but had a few plants as in-app purchases. I felt like this basically brought it to free if you want, or normal price if you want everything. 

This is just EA really starting to cash in..

1xjv8e,2014-02-10,2014-02-11,"What I have noticed is this update is filled with bugs. I have no lawnmower problems on my galaxy s2. Besides, if you're having a hard time getting coins go refer the game to some friends and watch the mulah roll in. But seriously dude. Are you positive this isnt a glitch?"
1xjv8e,2014-02-10,2014-02-11,"I beat all levels of the game,but it took me ages to do it,the difficulty level was ramped up so much. Many times I ragequit or got too annoyed with  the repetition and unfairness of the game design & didn't touch it for months. A lot of the time you simply CANNOT win without power-ups,that can only be obtained thru' real world coin or re-grinding levels. I really only beat it because I had a lot of extra keys from grinding levels,and these were converted into game currency in the last update,so I could finally 'buy' those power-ups without sending real world money. Bear in mind that I own PVZ1 on ipad,android and pc and beat it on all 3 platforms many,MANY times so I do NOT suck at the original game.The only good thing about recent updates is that they got rid of that shitty star system which constantly penalized you if you didn't play the game exactly in the way they told you to- e.g no kills for 90 seconds,don't lose any lawnmowers and don't lose more than 4 plants or oops! no progression for you. God,that was infuriating. Even if you beat the zombies,fail ANY of those requirements,and you didn't progress to the next level.I wonder if that's why they sacked George Fan,creator of the first game-because he objected to these changes.  Not sure I'm going to play the 'future' map because the other three weren't the hugest fun to plough through.And now you can't use any lawnmowers or you have to buy them back? What the hell are they THERE for,then? A shame,as underneath the shitty financial model,there is still a good game buried in there somewhere. They just won't let you play that game. A sad outcome for what was one of the greatest mobile games ever created."

1xjv8e,2014-02-10,2014-02-11,"What EA and other studios don't seem to understand is that this model is not sustainable.

While its new, people can get ""Lost"" and suckered into spending vastly larger fees than they would using common sense.

I.e plants versus zombies is not a $60 game, so no one should spend anywhere near that on transactions etc to have ""fun"", yet i suspect many people unwittingly do.

however as time goes on, and people realise what they have been doing, and it becomes common knowledge that games such as these try and charge $100+ for you to even have a borderline enjoyable time, people will be turned off by it.

free to play is generally apalling value as an actual game. if you look at the work and features of a AAA game like fallout or skyrim etc, and how much there is for a one off fee, that represents good value.

imagine fallout or Skyrim where each location on the map costs $5, suddenly the game is appalling value and actually a poor game not worth playing (as you would be a moron to play it in the same way as when its all free) 

personally i actually detest the concept of customisable content in a game with micro transactions and buying custom cars/weapons etc.
not just for teh money but because a game should be finely tuned to be an experience and the same experience for each player.

E.g. A game like ""The last of us"" would not be the same if you had a paid content of a super machine gun.

No player should be wondering if his lack of fun is due to the game itself or his choices of purchase of game content. that is a disgrace to gaming and ruins the industry"
1xjv8e,2014-02-10,2014-02-11,I haven't spent any money on the game and I enjoy it for what it is. I think it's fun beating something they are trying to make so difficult that I have to pay them in order to play. People these days are just used to games being too easy.
1xjv8e,2014-02-10,2014-02-11,"I'm more pissed that they seem to have added a lot more zombies to each level.  I don't recall 5 giant smasher guys in one stage before, now there are.  And 20 sand spinny guys.  I also don't know if I'm alone in hating this part, but it took me searching google to get rid of their notifications.  I moved it to ""do not include"", but saw one the other day, didn't realize there was also another option for ""show alerts on lockscreen"".

You can just as easily send a message by not purchasing those in-game things they want you to buy. It's that simple. In fact, that seems like a better solution to me. If you don't download the game all together, EA might just think you aren't interested in that particular game, which may not be the case. Instead, don't pay for any in-game shit, and they may realize, hey... no one is paying for this shit. They must not be interested. I'm not going to avoid playing a game entirely because of it, but I sure as hell am not going to pay for in-game content. That's my thought process..."

I downloaded Deus Ex for iPad, started playing it and enjoyed it a lot, until I got past the 1st level and noticed spots where you can pay to get new guns in the game using in app purchases. I haven't played it since, and it makes me hesitant to buy any other games in the app store unless its a classic from another platform which I know won't be able to do in app purchase (I.E. The old Final Fantasy Series). 

Gaming is getting more and more disappointing every year, its also why I am hesitant to buy into the next gen gaming consoles, spend $600 on a console, $60 on a game, and still get told ""to get this feature give us $5 more."" No thanks. I am at a point now where I put more time and effort into Indie games, lately my favorite game is Starbound, because its endless; I only paid $15 for it, and there is no in app Purchase shit. "

I keep hoping that all of these expensive IP acquisitions will eventually lead to their downfall, once the debt comes due but they become unable to bring in enough dough to stay afloat. Then they might be forced to sell off some of their valuable IPs to some company that actually gives a damn.

But then I remember that all they have to do is change the player rosters in last year's various sports games, increase the number on the cover by 1, release and bam: $60 million.

Both myself and the GF got through the game without the need to pay or wait for anything. I thought they had done a really good job. The only pain was those key doors, but even they weren't a big deal. Fast forward a few months of not playing and I read they updated the game and did away with the key doors. I thought this was great and gave the game another crack. Sure enough, the key doors were gone, do I resumed a previous play through I had started earlier. I entered the level, started planting my plants..but it wasn't working. The zombies were still getting through. I KNEW the game wasn't this hard before, I had finished it already. I'm guessing they decided that no one was using the power ups (which defeats the whole strategy element of the game), so they cranked up the difficulty so more people would have to rely on power ups, which of course use the in game currency. 

TL;DR - They turned the game to shit quite some time ago by artificially raising the difficulty level. "

1xjv8e,2014-02-10,2014-02-11,"For the first time in my life i think gaming could be damaging - purely because of the shift to create addictive gaming patterns.

EA's CEO is on record as saying the games are specifically designed to be addictive and that they should push to use that model.

I think that if we want to mess with EA we should be petitioning government to legislate these purposefully addictive games as if they were gambling, alcohol and cigarettes?

Should the games have massive labels on it? Similar to alcohol and gambling should there not be education drives to teach parents and kids about the dangers of this type of gaming.

I like the idea of EA having to label their games with warnings like cigarettes and have to do educational TV adverts about how dangerous gambling (er I mean their games) are and that they should only be used by responsible adults.

I mean as a starting point, we have the CEO of this company admitting what took cigarette companies years to admit - that they know their products are addictive.

I dont think any government will actually pass these laws and hell, I wouldn't want them to. '

BUT what I do think is that this is the kind of story that the media loves and it can be used as a PR method to raise awareness of the dodgy business practices. The average gamer and parent really just dont know about this and this could be an effective way to get them informed, and annoyed with these kinds of things. Having to have the CEO of EA come onto prime time TV to explain / justify his comments on willfully fostering addictive behaviour on gamers - many of whom are minors - would be a win for gamers.

That hat in TF2 may only be $2.00. but the majority of people view $2.00 as a negligible expense.  That one time purchase becomes 50 times.  Suddenly the customer has spent well beyond the face cost of a product.

Keep in mind, this is a large corporation run by a board of directors who's primary objective is to constantly find new ways to generate revenue.  If there are people willing to buy any type of addition or add on in to the base product, than they have achieved their objective.  When the product reaches a point that the majority of it's consumers are not willing to make that extra purchase that this will stop.

It's February 2014, BF4 came out in late October 2013... the game still has massive bugs which can end your session entirely. (seriously, spawn in a tank gunner seat....)  Also, last night, an entire server crashed. The game is great, when it works.... more often than not, it doesn't work and that just ruins the experience.  The only answer to why is EA.  Previous BF titles have been stable... this one has been outright awful from the start."

I was so excited for the new one but the Free to Play model where the game is so hard that it would be extremely difficult not to pay for upgrades is a trap. The difference between paying for levels and extra content on a console game is this is PAY TO WIN. The game is unplayable if you don't pay. No thank you. Next time, charge me $4.99 and give me a good solid game. "
1xjv8e,2014-02-10,2014-02-11,"and yet, most of these people will still buy EA products."
1xjv8e,2014-02-10,2014-02-11,"These people are running a business, and the only thing huge corporations care about it the bottom line. Simple fact is all IAP stuff is just a repeat of the 'Casino' formula. Put your money down, get one more round, one more chance to win, higher stakes, etc. They avoid regulation in that regard because there's no way to actually remove money for the equation; The free app just serves to raise the 'value' of the content in the consumer's mind, then the gambling/play purchase element starts in.

It is good psychology really, because they slowly increase the difficulty, costs, whatever. At first, paying any amount of money for an advantage seems ridiculous. But once you're facing enormous amounts of time, crazy difficulty, etc, they start to seem more reasonable. You struggle with something for hours, and then a well-timed ad pops up: 

*""Oh, just 2$ for this and it'll help me? Sounds good.""*

A lot of us say we'll quit games with IAP, but traditional gamers aren't really relevant. IAP game players are the fastest growing group of gamers the industry's ever seen, stuff like Candy Crush branching out to people who wouldn't ever dream of bothering with a PC game. Every PC gamer that boycotts EA just gets replaced by ten IAP people who will spend a hundred bucks over the lifetime of their play of an individual mobile game.

So that's why I think they really won't give a shit. They are legally obligated to take the actions that make them the most money; doing 'what's best for gaming' isn't relevant to that. You might think that people will burn out of IAPs, but gambling has never burnt out and never will. As long as they can establish value in the game's structure to the end-user, they'll be able to find people who will IAP. And if it makes more money in the long term for companies than the traditional format, they're obligated to produce them.

We'll naturally see IAPs added to triple-A non-casual gaming experimentally. Hopefully we reject them and they don't bother repeating the experiment, but I doubt it'll be rejected. Gambling is addictive. I know people who spent thousands of dollars on Mass Effect 3's multiplayer, buying boxes of random weapons, for example. Just shows the powerful psychological effect it can have; It finds those people with cash they can spare and drains it as long as the user cares about the game.

I've beaten the entire game, and they have not yet come close to tempting me to pay. In fact, by the time they made that big update that changed the level layout, I had already beaten it. But lots of people came out to talk about how horrible it was, and that EA were money-grubbing bastards who made the game harder to get them to sped their coins. But, I never understood that. The update made the game drastically easier. Sunflowers started giving twice the normal sun... Being able to buy back lawnmowers (if they do not go away forever) adds to the further. Making the game easier. *shrug*

Anyways, back to the topic, lawnmowers do not go away permanently for me. If I wanted to spend some of the 100,000+ coins, I could buy them back instantly.

The issue is western companies STILL haven't figured out how to properly implement microtransactions. King finally has with the prices for gold bars being pretty good, but still is extremely evident in the Angry birds racing games, PVZ2, and atrocious in Dungeon Keeper.

The whole idea in the east for players to pay for microtransactions was to either make you look more beautiful with upgrades to your avartar look or weapon look, etc. and to give you a small competitve edge. These competitive edges were suppose to be very cheap so that gamers could try them out and not feel cheated or pay for their use. These were about 5 to 25 cents to use and so you didn't feel cheated when you paid for them. 

This however isn't working as Dungeon Keeper allows you to pay $100 for the gems. Who is paying $100 for one mobile game? I can see a small percentage, but most gamers won't pay more than $10 for a mobile game. It should be the goal to get 10 people into the need to pay $10 than try to get 1 $100 player.

1xjv8e,2014-02-10,2014-02-11,">  I bet EA is really hurting financially

Of all companies in the entertainment industry, EA is probably the least likely to be in financial trouble. Quite often you'll find many companies do this sort of thing to boost their gross margins in areas that are easy to exploit - the same idea is applied not just in gaming but in all types of business. It's something to boost income post-purchase (okay I know it's a free game but they definitely are making money off your download). It's a simple way of generating income from parts of the business that don't make cash from your purchase (remember - cash and revenue are different). Cash generated in this way is vital for a company like EA in terms of post-launch development and upkeep.

But I agree with you, it's not a customer-focussed way of generating money, but many casual gamers (ie stay-at-home mom's playing with their husbands' iPads to keep themselves entertained before they go and pick up their little darlings with their gas-guzzling 4x4s) - these are the types of people EA expect to provide them with this short-term cash, as they don't have the same attitude towards gaming as you or I...or anyone else in this subreddit for that matter."

1xjv8e,2014-02-10,2014-02-11,"More money for them = better industry (in their minds)

Think about if this came to MMOFPS games (massive multiplayer-online-first-person-shooters)? I'm sure they have brought in financial experts to gauge how much money customers would be willing to spend vs. how many players they would lose.  He's right in saying if you're deep into the game, you're not going to care about shelling out a buck here and there. Hell, you might even drop 5-10 just so you think you won't have to worry about it for awhile. Say you spend 5-10 a month on reloads, different guns, new armor, etc. They might even introduce more powerful weapons, stronger armor, more rounds in a clip if you drop 20 bucks on one( I gaurntee people would be spending 100s) Take that, compare how much money you make off of a $60 one time purchase. The poorer players or those unwilling to spend money on principle would be coming in last, getting owned, kind of forcing their hand to buy upgrades. They would make a killing. Not to mention people wanting a gun, just to be one of the few to have it. LIMITED EDITION M4A1 +15 DAMAGE +10 EXTRA ROUNDS IN CLIP IMPROVED ACCURACY! ON SALE NOW FOR ONLY $19.99 How many would drop that much for it? Open up a gun marketplace where a player spends $10 to transfer a gun to another account. It's a way to capitalize on the competitiveness of the game. I don't care if you ""just play it for fun"" after 2-3 hours of competing against other people, you'll be bitching and moaning about that random grenade that just fell in your lap out of nowhere. 

I've played a computer game like this. People have spent hundreds (some spend upwards of $1000 I'm one of those idiots) just to get new guns or a rare gun. They won't be that much better but can brag they have it. If it is a better gun, people will clamor even more to get it. Because people invest money into a character or account, they will be less likely to move to a different game. Therefore, they won't have to make a new game every single year. They can spend less money running servers, making the gameplay less smooth because, hell, you've dropped 200 bucks on this game so far, you're not going to leave that investment behind so easily. 

The gaming industry is a prime example of how greed in these giant corporations ruins products and creates cynicism in their gaming populations. Everyone complains about EA because of these micro-transactions; yet they still buy their games, still spend that money, and EA is still around and hasn't changed one bit. If you don't want to deal with that kind of stuff, don't buy the game, even if it's ""free"". 


EDIT: EA Games Inc., if you decide to enact these kind of policies, game options, promotions, etc., in any way, shape, or form, I'll charge you $15,000,000.00 for consulting fees and a 5% royalty for every item sold for the next 25 years."

2. It's their free game. They can do whatever the fuck they want.

3. Stop spending so much time bitching and do something productive, asshole."
1xjv8e,2014-02-10,2014-02-11,"Okay, I hear this argument a lot. I mean a lot a lot, I mean every single time this conversation comes up and while I completely understand it from a logical stance it doesn't take into account the emotional side of it. The companies putting these kinds of practices forth are at fault for exploitation of their customer base. Just because that customer base takes it does not make them less culpable.

The fact is that the gamers being abused here are also not really in control of the fact that money is being spent on microtransactions. It's been shown that most of the money for the microtransaction games come from a smaller group of players frequently referred to as whales. Many of us don't support it and yet the practices continue on and expand.

The reality is that most gamers when talking about this stuff don't want all additional content to be free so it isn't an issue of entitlement as some would argue, we just want games to be released to us finished. Did you hear about the newest Batman: Arkham Origins game? The company behind that released a statement saying that the people working on the game were prioritizing finishing the DLC and trying to fix the progression blocking bugs, anything that doesn't block progression simply won't be fixed. Are we just supposed to expect that out of developers and publishers now? Hell we're willing, and always have been, to pay out extra for solid content expansions. It's not the DLC that's at issue here it's that some members of the industry are clearly doing everything in their power to not give a fuck about the people who consume their product.

Furthermore, what exactly are we meant to do in situations like the one presented in the OP? Where a company took a mechanic from a previous game, the Plants vs Zombies Lawnmowers, implement it identically in the follow-up, and then later (6 months later in the case of PvZ 2) change it for something else that's a clear money grab. A lot of us have already put a bunch of time into the game or gotten into it and now are potentially screwed out of playing the game we originally picked up.

Yes, companies are obviously doing the things they're doing because it's been shown to be profitable, but how exactly are we as a group of hobbyists supposed to be reacting when it seems as though no matter what we do to try and fight off the industries practice it's rendered moot because as a result of the industry's explosive growth due to it's introduction to the mainstream we no longer have the power that we once did. At the end of the day *we* the hardcore gamer, the hobbyist who's been playing for twenty years simply don't have the combined purchasing power that the mass public who now plays game has and as a result we can't compete for the attention of the developers who are screwing with the stories and games that we've loved. It's bigger than just us now."
1xjv8e,2014-02-10,2014-02-11,"Companies want to make money. Simple as that. They test new ways of getting it, and if the customer bites the hook, then they go with that method.

1xjv8e,2014-02-10,2014-02-11,"Man... I remember when the idea of an ""a la carte"" style was first brought up. People were talking about purchasing the single player and multiplayer sections of games separately for much lower prices.

The ability to buy the single player game I want and not the multiplayer game that I don't would be fantastic both for my wallet and for sending the message that multiplayer shouldn't be shoved into games where it doesn't fit."
1xjv8e,2014-02-10,2014-02-11,That explains the situation very accurately 
1xjv8e,2014-02-10,2014-02-11,"I used a story on another post that I'll use here. It's like if you owned a restaurant and you charged money for every tiny thing from forks, to knives, etc. Suppose everyday you make 1000s of dollars and you're doing well for a restaurant business. Then suppose everyday you get 100s of customers coming in, and let's say every customer that leaves have complaints about being charged for every tiny thing. However, looking at your revenue report, you see that you're making a ton of money and it appears even though people are complaining, they're still buying it.

That's pretty much EA. They do this because people ARE buying the lawnmowers or whatever tiny transaction. Just to put it in perspective, I once fell into the EA's microtransaction feat. In Dead Space 3 when they had points for MS games, I bought one of the packs that gave you a random weapon and some parts. I did this about two times in the game since I had excess points that I couldn't carry over.

So just imagine. I did it twice for a game. Now multiply that by a few hundred transactions, you got quite a good sum of money.

Overall yeah, I do dislike it but only way it's going to stop is if everyone stops playing the games. Until then, expect this to continue regardless of how many people complain because no matter what, it only takes the ""here and there"" approach for them to be successful with this scheme."

edit: This comment is perhaps misleading, people think I am talking about DLC. Specifically for Forza (not entirely sure about GT's microtransaction model) I am talking about the purchase for in-game credits that allows you to unlock on-disc cars. Earning credits is a massive grind, much more so than earlier games in the series (according to reviews at time of release). You are able to purchase credits for real money.

When the update first came out a week or so ago, I used a lawnmower in a pinata party and I got the prompt to pay coins to get it back which was still there when I tried playing a normal level. I never lost all 5 lawnmowers at once like what happened to OP, but it was still enough to make me not play the game until I saw this post. 

I played a few times tonight to test it out, and every time I used a lawnmower it would respawn even after a pinata party when I was trying to recreate the problem. The only explanation I can think of for OP losing all 5 lawnmowers is merely a glitch.

I'm playing on Android by the way."

EA is a company, not a singular person. It doesn't lose sleep over making people a little upset. 

The only concern for a company is money. EA is making money. They are powerful and produce an incredible amount of established titles. Even with all of this shouting and crying, EA games are sold in DROVES. People are definitely paying the little micro-transactions. For every person like you or me that puts up a fuss, there is a creature like my dear mother who will pay ten dollars for extra lives in Candy Crush or Pet Rescue.

Now the goal of the company at a very high level is to make the game annoy me. Not challenge me in a fun way. If I'm enjoying failure then why would I pay? No, the goal is to Bother me in a way that makes me want to pay for a different experience. 

Now core gameplay mechanics depend on my decision. If I spend $10 dollars the game might be fun. If I spend $20 it might be trivial and boring. Or maybe $7 dollars is the right answer. I don't know.

1xjv8e,2014-02-10,2014-02-11,"The 1.0 launch of the game was actually pretty great.  The in app purchases were just extra plants that definitely were not required.  Currency was plentiful and not particularly necessary.  Most reviews from that time would be  complimentary.  
  
About a month or two ago they put out an update that ruined the game in a lot of ways, and I guess they doubled down.  You're story is making me question whether I want to buy Garden Warfare.  They shouldn't be rewarded for ruining such a promising and iconic IP."
1xjv8e,2014-02-10,2014-02-11,"After seeing how many poor games got good reviews from the large companies like IGN you've gotta learn to ignore their opinions and only trust what few facts they give.

DK1 and 2 were two of my favourite games of all time.  Bullfrog did well with them and sold to EA 15 years ago (or close to).  The name now is crap, the game they released is embarrassing and unplayable.

Do yourself a solid and go back in time and play Dungeon Keeper 2 BEFORE EA owned the franchise, and you'll have the same feeling as comes from PvZ 1 to 2."

I preordered the collector's edition. I've never experienced a feeling like I had while playing ME3. Unbridled enthusiasm slowly, agonizingly transitioning to dread over the course of 20 hours.

You're doing better than me, I stopped after I bought BF3 Premium, played the first map pack then stopped. I still haven't touched the game since the other packs came out.

And then I was an idiot and gave EA another 50 bucks when I got my new computer about a year ago, only to realize that BF3 was shite on PC. How do you go from the amazingness that was BF2 and 2142 to BF3?

I kick myself but I resolved to never pay EA again. Fuck Battlefront, fuck Mirrors Edge 2, fuck whatever other cool looking games that are coming out. I know they will try and screw me over like they did. 

Fool me once shame on you; fool me twice, you know the rest."
1xjv8e,2014-02-10,2014-02-11,"Meh. I still think taking out one of the plants many people thought ""quintessential"" to the first game was a crap move.

There is only ONE f2p model that is actually inherently ""not corrupt"".
And that is the ""purely cosmetic as thank you for tipping us, because you actually like to play the game"" type.

There is also the ""well you can farm a bit, which shouldn't be a problem since you like the game"" type, but that inherently just begs to explore the border of ""just that bit annoying to make you pay but not enough too make you leave"" maximisation game.

EA is testing our limits. And for a system that is whining about money being tight, and everyone experiencing tough economic times, a surprising amount of people still take it up the bum by the truckload.

Just say no to EA on grounds of not being their guinea pig.
And don't just say no to those experiments. Say no to the company."
1xjv8e,2014-02-10,2014-02-11,"I, too, miss the old map with the extra paths you can unlock by collecting keys and shit. I will say, though, I racked up a ton of coins through cashing out all the spare keys and just general playtime back in the PvZ2 golden era. Even now I still have 210k gold stocked up, though I do find that I need to ""cheat"" and use powerups for some of these party missions, whereas in the past I could complete everything without them. I had started to question the practicality of actually playing this game without spending coins lately, and now they are giving *fines* for losing? Really?  

They have core gameplay mechanics, and they have cheat-mode powerups, which I've seen in other games before. But now, they are blurring the lines a bit, and making the powerups an almost-necessary mechanic. Pay-to-win at its finest."
1xjv8e,2014-02-10,2014-02-11,"I really wish ALL casual games mostly played on devices like phones or flash would adopt an in game currency system more like Bloons TD 5.  You can play the whole game without ever paying anything extra and work towards tons of neat upgrades for towers that change the game.  If you want to pay a few bucks, there's a few interesting upgrades that are really cheap, and if you really hate unlocking new content through gameplay you can always buy the currency.  But it's never necessary.

What they did here is kind of like making it so all your buildings you worked towards in BTD5 get ""locked"" after every battle and require you to give them a dollar to unlock it for every stage you play.  It's crazy, and I can't believe there's still going to be people who will play PvZ2 after this change.

If everyone stops supporting them, this bullshit will stop.  If people continue giving them money and supporting them, other companies will see the profits EA makes and start doing horse-shit like this.  I for one do *not* want to see this pay to play crap get any worse."

There are not enough people out there that can afford to be ""invested"" in a game under this business model. Not only that but that's just out right not a fair mechanic to those who can't afford to play by paying for every little boost.

They were the *only* thing you could buy with in-game currency. I also found the whole prize/random box thing to be genuinely exciting. The ability to purchase in-game currency with real money is not something to complain about if it isn't forced or advertised too much, in my opinion. Surely you're on some sort of track where a different example would have served you better because ME3 multiplayer was 100% free, including the map packs. "

I was all up in arms about it when I wasn't going to play the game (I refuse to give EA money based off of other issues), but I ended up getting it through the humble bundle so EA didn't profit.
It was only in the bench for modification and just saves a little bit of time if you're too lazy or dumb to know how to use the scavenger bot (explained in game). I had a really good setup for my weapons to the point they were max power (including some I never used) without playing multiplayer at all, without going back to farm scavenge spots, or doing anything else stupid.

If it didn't involve giving the video game company equivalent of satan money, I would say it was mostly harmless.

1xjv8e,2014-02-10,2014-02-11,"I disagree.  I never pay for micro transactions.  Ever.  The idea of treating a game as a never ending expense is impossible for me to wrap my head around, have been gaming for 30 years.  However, the emergence of this free to play/get started model has allowed me to play tons of games and have good experiences, then move on to others all without ever paying.  In not saying that ea isn't evil, they are, but some good has come out of this change in business models."
1xjv8e,2014-02-10,2014-02-11,"To be fair, the concept isn't that far a departure from your typical coin-op arcade game, and in certain demographics that can be both wildly popular and successful.  Perhaps in the future the whole concept of ""Free-to-Play"" simply becomes ""insert another coin"" to continue.  Up front ""box"" sales may just turn out to be a starter kit for another otherwise ""free-to-play"" model where you simply start out with some pre-determined number of bulk credits afforded at a discount, but once you're 20 hours in and your credit runs dry, ""insert another coin...""

What I'm describing is not the death of the gaming industry, it'll be the death of the relatively small but very vocal spoiled hardcore/competitive gamer demographic (of which I consider myself a part, mind you).  Think of it in terms of value.  A casual scrub that buys BF4 and plays maybe 4 hours over the course of a month gets very little value out of the game, whereas the hardcore gamer with 100s of hours in the month would get comparatively vast amounts of value out of the same expenditure.

Switching to a ""coin-op"" model simply equalizes the cost/value equation for both demographics.  This becomes particularly important as more and more companies start to assume complete ownership of server software/infrastructure and the operating costs thereof.  Envision a future where pretty much every game out there comes with some kind of ""coin-op"" / ""subscription"" mechanism to keep playing  (MMOs have been using this model for ages now, incidentally).

The casual crowd will continue to embrace this model so long as the perceived cost/value is good enough and financially they greatly outweigh pretty much any kind of clout that a hardcore/competitive demographic could ever hope to muster.

Honestly I'm less worried about that model of payment and more worried about the devolving state of ""release quality"" software.  The same demographic that said payment model attracts, the casual gamer, have a much less strict view of what constitutes ""release quality"". So long as nothing catastrophic happens like crashes/lost saves they're generally tolerant of the more subtle gameplay bugs/imbalances that only get squashed (if they ever do) after considerable testing in real world circumstances (i.e. after release) and cost to the developer.  Patching is clearly necessary to address these problems, but it opens up a huge pit of temptation for developers to release and ""sell"" the game in increasingly less developed/tested stages because the casual masses are still more than willing to pay for an unfinished, but somewhat fun game now rather than wait for an ultra-refined masterpiece later."

1xjv8e,2014-02-10,2014-02-11,Nearly all recent DLC is also much cheaper than any expansion pack ever was. 
1xjv8e,2014-02-10,2014-02-11,"Depends on the game:

Skyrim had all DLCs big enough to be expansion packs

Borderlands 2 DLCs came in all sizes. Expansions, characters, smaller stories, etc.

Batman Arkham City/Origins have very shameful DLCs. Most of them are character designs or those challenges that people don't play."
1xjv8e,2014-02-10,2014-02-11,"Well I mean one of his examples was Elder Scrolls.  The game was complete and was on the market for a considerable amount of time.  The designers went back and said  ""hey lets see what we can do to make interesting dlc content.""  I have no problem paying for that, I just don't want to have to pay over and over to play solitaire on my phone while i'm waiting in line to order food at McDonald's."
1xjv8e,2014-02-10,2014-02-11,"I see that argument, about making DLC while there are still broken things in the game, and it's largely wrong. The skill sets needed to make new content and to squish bugs have little to no overlap. So the content guys make new content and sell it to keep paying the salaries of the big squishers. You can't just have your entire staff work on bug fixing. "

Skyrim had $50 of DLC.  2 decent ""campaign-like"" superquests with new zones and new gameplay features, and a home building feature less robust than the mods it enabled.

then they just ...stopped.

They didn't reach the end of the market, or begin to see depleting consumer appetite, they just stopped.

""That game is no longer in development.""

Well, alright, but you know...I would buy more stuff....just so you know.

I am comforted by the idea that Bethesda Softworks is currently hard at work on FO4, and by the time ESO explodes on launch, and they are allowed to have the spotlight....they will be well into development, and have much to show."

While also acknowledging that there have of COURSE been fantastic games released in the past generation.

It's not binary. And we can be glad for the positives while still acknowledging the negatives and calling on companies to improve."
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"This is why I bought sea of stars Even though everyone is calling it mid, Gor a complete Game, without microtransactions, acceptable storyline despite the predictability and the cliches and a solud 40+ hours of gameplay that don't require me to have an internet connection

I know this is beating a dead horse but the customer can speak with their wallet, just stop supporting live Service games and start supporting people like concerned ape or the Terraria devs, and whoever Made spelldisk and crosscode, and no, i don't mean every indie, i mean those devs and studios who've already proven that their priority lies in delivering a high Quality Game instead of squeezing every grain of profit.

Like hell Even Pokémon infinite fusión (a friggintastic fan Game) and Pokémon reloaded (another frigging fan Game set to be released on the 11th of April) are way better than a Lot of the live Service games."

1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"2023 was the best year in gaming in years . Last years GOTY was CRPG that actually plays super well in consoles.

IMO this wrong view of this generation being a dud is more on part of games still being launched on last gen that IMO is also a good thing because it has been causing most  games to release at 60fps on currant gen and the lack of exclusives. Microsoft is on life support on this regard and Sony had a handful. 

But this generation is being awesome and even live services games are showing signs of being good like Helldivers 2."
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,I actually love this gen. Because finally we get 60fps as default. And games have been good as well.
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"Sorry, but there are more games now than ever before. Ignore the stuff that sucks and play one of the thousands of others."

You're focusing on a few high-profile live service bad games and forgetting the large list of fantastic games constantly coming out. 

In 2023 alone, I can think of the following great games off  the top of my head. 

Baldur's Gate 3, tears of the kingdom, Alan Wake 2, Spider-Man 2, dead space remake, Resident Evil 4 remake, Talos principle 2, Super Mario wonder, hi-fi rush, Lies of P, Sea of stars, Armored Core 6, Hogwarts Legacy.

1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,Hot take: this generation has been good.
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"A lot of these big studios and publishers are willing to throw more money into live service projects until they go bankrupt. This is what we can see. Look at Warner Bros Discovery, they are bleeding a fair amount of money last quarter, and their gaming division is doubling down on future live service games. Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League failed miserably, but they will try to support one season. No official budget was released. Theoretically in development after 2015's Batman Arkham Knight, official announcement was in 2020, so the game was in production pre-2020. Four plus years of development. Possibly, Suicide Squad was a $100 million+ game without its marketing budget. WBD did not describe how big this failure was beyond ""...fallen short of expectations..."" 

Correct, a successful live service game is too much for these corporate clowns to pass up. Fortnite, Call of Duty Warzone, Apex Legends, GTA Online, Palworld, and Helldivers II are too alluring, but can these bloated studios replicate these success stories? We do not know now, but in a few years, these studios will launch their live service games. If they fail to launch on time or sell poorly, these studios will fire workers and shut down. The ultimate price of failure is death. How many studios will die?"
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"I've enjoyed it. I've played raganrok, forbidden west, elden ring, final fantasy rift apart demon souls and way more. I get what you are saying but I think it's been a pretty good generation. I just think some like to complain when we had covid and everything too."
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"Ah yes the classic “if you don’t agree with me you’re delusional” argument. If having a blast with some of the new titles in the past few years means I’m delusional, then so be it."
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,When people come at you with legitimate points and examples of great games that far outweigh your paltry list and you call them the delusional masses instead of properly responding - you’re gonna have a bad time.
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"Honestly, I reckon we're not facing a decline, just a change in trends. Can't forget the gems amidst the rubble. Live service games have their shine too"
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,Sounds like you have a bad taste in games. Last year and the first part of this year have been amazing for games.
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"This whole narrative around gaming these days is starting to get old. Try other games and maybe you'll find out that maybe, just maybe, gaming is in a fantastic spot these days because there is so much more than just live service."
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,I think its far more that they launched during a pandemic and were basically unbuyable for ages
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"Yea, it’s one major problem among others. Thankfully we have the AA and Indie scene that is essentially what AAA studios use to be for the industry….. the backbone and lifeblood of video games. So just ignore the AAA scene and if we’re lucky the studios will go bankrupt and we can be free of their bullshit for a time being. For it’ll only be a matter of time when another studio becomes the next AAA studio."
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"Dude. There are more awesome games available now across multiple platforms than have ever been available before. Sure there are some stinkers, but there are epic masterpieces also."
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,Last year alone shows your looking at duds and not the actual quality of games that game out but go off I guess.

""Capitalism makes everything more and more shitty over time!!"" The voice yelled maniacally."
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,Redfall isn't a life service game. The pandemic had a far greater impact on the development pipeline for this generation than live service games did.
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"Lot of execs were chasing the Fortnite dream, but that can only come from having a fun gameplay loop and ungodly amounts of resources. I can't necessarily blame them since live service games can make so much money, but for every triple A game to try for that model was incredibly short-sighted or just had unrealistic expectations. Glad that live-service upfront premium triple A games are failing lately (Suicide Squad and Skull & Bones namely). To charge full price for a game, as well as a premium for all the post-launch content, on top of microtransactions is baffling, even more so that it's gone on so long. I'm no saint though, I supported Destiny and Destiny 2 for a while until recently. 

Point is that a live service works best in a free-to-play model supported with seasonal and microtransactions (Fortnite, The Finals, Apex Legends); a very small upfront premium with limited microtransactions (Helldivers 2, most recently); or a subscription based model (WoW, FFXIV). 

As for graphics, I think we've reached a critical mass where visual fidelity isn't going to get much better. Art design and load times tend to be where we see the bigger leaps between generations. Like I noticed less texture pop-in on the PS5 Spiderman game vs the PS4 version.   I can see later generations (or the console refreshes coming this generation) will have more support for features like ray tracing, increased storage spaces and read-speeds, and other background things like that."
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-06-16,Yes i agree
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-08-23,i know this is a few months late but its legitimately unreal how its been almost 4 years since these consoles came out but it still feels like the first few months where all we have to play is the launch titles.
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"Lol. Live service games are not ""extremely expensive"" to make it. It's more like the total opposite. They make all the content before the games even out then push out only the bare minimum only to release what should have been there at launch, at a later date. Server costs are minimal for 99% of these games. 

  
This generation is a total dud though, but thats due to things like still supporting last gen, greed, lack of console supply early on, no imagination. Game industry has basically followed tv/movies. They're hiring from a generation that lacks any kind of imagination all while cutting costs."
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"I don't understand how with such massive advances in technology and means, that in this day and era, so much time is spent creating the most dog shit video game titles since the inception of video gaming as an industry. 

There have to be compounding factors including poor business decisions, unmotivated workforces, high levels of ineptitude at every level, and just pure abuse, embezzelment or misrepresentation of the actual resources spent on these projects."
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"I don't think this generation is a dud, I think is more a thing about the amount of games that get released nowadays, back in the day failures weren't common, but so we're big releases in general. 

Now we hear of failures frequently but we hear about massive successes constantly. 

And also, the internet in general might distort one's sense of reality. It's easier to make a clickbait article thrashing the current media flop that to make an elaborate review about a hidden gem or just an otherwise unknown piece of media."
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"AAA is in a slump, but there's still good stuff coming out from smaller studios.  Also there's AA devs that are entering the AAA quality space now like Larian with BG3.  "
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,I expected having a steady release of 60fps games but we can't even have that. Let alone games that release without issues... Imagine buying a fucking Nintendo cartridge multiple times or having to exchange it for a new version....

Yeah if you're wondering what the OP's thinking that's it in a nutshell"
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"Commenters seem to miss your point was about AAA games. I don't know if I completely agree, but we definitely have far fewer AAA titles because they keep chasing that continual growth and shop money. There's a reason people adore baldur's gate 3, and it's for the reasons OP says. I'm surprised most of the commenters missed this."
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17," xDefiant will die if it doesn’t have content coming in. That’s the expectation for multiplayer games in the current era. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, just our reality. They’re competing with CoD for their user base.

Just look at Halo Infinite. Great game, arguably some of the best mechanics in the series, pop fell off a cliff due to lack of content. Only started going up as the content kept up with demand (and forge).

If they don’t have a plan post-release with seasons ready to go it may as well be dead.

Same with Helldivers, even as a PVE mp game it needs to stay engaged with players to keep them playing."
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,Redfall isn't a live service game.
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,i play the main stream games but i also play alot of early access/ indie games. i enjoy them all tbh. skull and bones has been fun for me and thats all that matters cause i bought it cause pirates. not cause i was looking for bf2. this week i played stolen realms and hell divers. next week bf 2042 and probably dota ranked push. i dont no life games cause ive found that a bit of variety goes a long way in keeping fatigue at bay.
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"I mean, I've had a great time with my Switch and PS5, and have a number of games lined up that will, I expect, continue the fun.

Have you considered that maybe you're letting your totally reasonably distaste for live service games skee your view here, a little? Or, like, how many games do you need to play and enjoy to consider a generation good?"
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,Xdefiant? How is this game a flop?
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"It's been a few great past years for nintendo and ps5 and PC, can't say the same for Xbox unfortunately"
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"I think there's more to it than just that. 

Alot of Games take alot longer these days to produce. So alot of the more ""true next gen"" games won't be coming until closer to the end cycle of the consoles, like it has in the past. 

That, and people were more reluctant to give up the previous generation. With how crazy the shortages were back on launch (if the chip shortage was an actual thing) and scalpers too, not as many people were able to get into this generation as fast. Plus the fact that backwards compatibility to the previous gen was also a big selling point, it probably made alot more people hesitant to getting into it. Because why invest into the new gen when most games will be coming to previous ones? So that goes for the devs too, because why invest solely on a new generation when most of the profit will be coming from the already established previous generation?

I just remember how divided people were when Ubisoft announced that a year into the ps4/Xbox one, they were already ditching 360/ps3. That was the right move, and more devs should have done the same with the PS5/ Xbox Series. You could argue that only the Sony/Microsoft would be profiting, if a majority of their devs went only for the new gen for games. But at the same time, we bought these new consoles and we need good reasons to use them right? So why not have games that push the powers of the new consoles instead of ports of older hardware that were really outdated even at the time of launch? Now that we have consoles that were decent (not high end though) at launch? It's just crazy that we barely get games that can do 120fps, and even some can't even do 60fps (or even 60 fps with good resolution/graphics). 

It's going to get worse as consoles go on. It's the fault of both game companies and consumers. It's probably better to go with PC at this point, but even that can lead to other issues like optimization and such. And in my personal case, consoles are just easier and better for me."
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"i honestly think the problem is the success of some live services, genshin, fortnite, destiny they all want that a game who can idefinetly updtate and got revenue, the issue is they dont invest the money, the design nor the human resources when mihoyo and epic got an army of developers updating there games so thats the issue"

1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"The trouble software is facing is monetization, not just live service. Some big Pub's no longer think buying a $70 game is enough. Look at Capcom, specifically RE4r and SF6 (both excellent games btw).

Capcom introduced ""time skips"" to RE4r. It's not ""buy this for 500xp"", but rather ""buy an extra treasure map to level up faster"". SF6's Battlehub uses avatars as blank slate that Cap uses to sell advertising space. Walking around in a $15 TMNT skin is a form of monetization/advertising. 

I don't see Capcom as scummy for this, but it's frustrating to be nickeled-and-dimed at every step. Premium currency packs piss me off the most b/c vg's aren't a foreign country w/ their own exchange rate.

I fear for MGS3r. Konami is a scummy Pub. Why earn Foxhound rank when you can buy it?"
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"For me it comes down to 2 things. 

The new generation had an extremely rocky start, impossible to get one for the first year, and if you did, it was way too expensive. 

Now it’s actually possible to get one, but they’re still way too expensive. 

And because it took 2 years to be able to get a new console, something else has become blatantly obvious; the last gen consoles are totally fine. There’s nothing on the new gen that is a must. No exclusives (that I can think of) or hardware upgrades that makes the expense worth it. 

Right now I only see 2 ways I’m going to buy into the new gen. Either the price needs to come down a lot (like 40% or more) or the switch 2 has to be a disaster. 

If not, I’m probably waiting for the PS6"
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"What do you mean? 2023 was the best year for gaming that has ever been, and by a very clear margin! 2024 also already has several great games"
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,There's also that they refuse to make the jump to the 9th gen fully because the 8th gen has such a huge userbase and because making games by using a PS4 or Xbox One as a base gives you the chance to downgrade the game and release it on the Switch too.
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"They wouldn't do it (or anything really) if it wasn't making them money. Its (live-service, battle pass, seasonal bullshit content) not going to stop until it doesn't make enough profit  anymore or until they find something else that makes more money. I think it's as simple as that. Most of them couldn't care less what the players think as long as the shareholders are happy. There are outliers, sure, but it seems to me this is the mindset of most of the big devs/publishers anymore."

1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"I disagree.  They could have a good live service game but it gets rushed out then torn apart by the players because the games are shit   Red fall could have been decent  but they rushed it out. 
New world from Amazon could have been really good as well and they messed it up a month after launch and lost 80% of the players   Same with Diablo 4 game had a decent launch then first patch was a slap in the face of players  

They can make good live service games but they consistently do something to screw up the games  or release in such a shit state the players leave"
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"Given the sheer volume of games produced these days, your small list of examples does nothing to tarnish the consoles themselves. Nvidia 3000 series, X1/PS5 consoles are all great hardware.

Also, Helldivers 2 came out and pretty much makes up for every shit live service game this generation.

It's simple, really. If a game is ""live service,"" wait for and examine the initial content offering before purchase. If the initial offering is fine, who cares if it's live service or not."
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,it’s the realization that you don’t need really new gen consoles or PCs to enjoy high quality low end games and pay $70 for triple A mediocrities

1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"I think OP is ""half"" right in saying this gen is a dud. 

If you compare this gen to last gen. During the XB1/PS4/Switch era it felt like we were having a 85+ metacritic minimum AAA blockbuster banger every other month. 

This gen it feels like we only get 1 or 2 if we're lucky big blockbuster AAA bangers."
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"It's kinda shitty indeed, but I think the main issue is time, simple as that, everything is so goddamn slow. Two, three years ago, I was overhyped to play Horizon 2 for example, but after waiting so many years for a sequel to show up, then a couple more years for the PC port, I'm just uninterested right now. So even if the quality remains solid (we just had the best rpg ever made, Zelda improving the sandbox genre and so on), everything is so fucking slow, Zelda itself, a direct sequel who recycled 90% of the assets, they took 5 years to polish the game, implementing all the new crazy physiques and etc... so even a game like TOTK who doesn't feature state of the art graphics or anything, the engine is so complex anyway, Nintendo took forever to develop this game. Then you have Horizon 2, Spider-Man 2, FF7 Rebirth, etc.. all taking forever as well. So it's disheartening, even direct sequels takes forever to show up. As a Splinter Cell fan, IF Ubisoft really reboot this series in this generation, we will have a single Splinter Cell for the entire PS5 cycle... meanwhile in the PS2 generation we had four Splinter Cell games, this kind of contrast is what pisses me off about the industry right now, the quality of the product is not improving (like I said, they are just sustaining the quality), but the product takes forever to be made. If the industry remains that way, if Horizon 3 only shows up in 2028 and so on, most likely this PS5 generation will be my last, I am already saturated of the hobby, everything is so expensive, the development walks at turtle speeds, etc... hard to point a legit reason to keep going with the hobby"
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"Game companies are companies, and the purpose of companies is to make money. Quality is an accidental byproduct that could happen, not their target.

1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"I feel like this and the other post complaining about sales are just trying to avoid the elephant in the room which has been pointed out for decades now by pc players.

Consoles are far too reliant on very few very samey big budget games leading to not too much variety.

which means if those games fail you are pretty much out of luck for anything else to play, as opposed to the 12000 games that comes to steam each year, while absolutely a % of them are just cheap garbo, and a % of them are the big games, there is a really solid indie and AA scene to play from eg my last few games played has been ""the finals, last epoch, spell disk, deadlink, enshrouded, deep rock galactic survivor"" so i havent noticed all the bad launches."

1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"Yea this is dumb.

The reason it's a dud is simple: this is the first console generation with immediate **100% backward compatibility** with the previous generation.

So most publishers were hesitant to publish a game that ***only*** works on PS5 or Xbox S/X because they'd be losing all of the potential sales from PS4, PS4 Pro, Xbox One, Xbox One X, etc.

This has literally never happened before, unless you count the PS2 having a PS1 chip inside it, but that was such an absurd graphical leap, that publishers had to release PS2-only games to stay competitive.

Also the PS1 and PS2 had completely unique architectures. It's not like now, where developers can release a game that runs on base PS4 but looks better on the PS5.

Every previous generation change was dramatically new hardware architecture. The Playstation 2's chipset is nothing like the Playstation 3's which is nothing like the Playstation 4's, etc.

This is the new reality.

The Switch 2 will probably run into the same issue."

1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"Then again you look at a game like Hell Divers, that is allegedly a great game because it has a lot players right?

Wrong the game is full of bugs that make the game unplayable right now.  Also, the game is extremely repetitive.  You have played the full game after 2-3 missions.

Which again points at great marketing rather than a great game.  Just watch the game will be dead in about a months time.  But it doesn’t matter because they got all the suckers to buy it.

Rinse and repeat.  No need to make a good game."
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"2023 was easily one of the best years in a long time. There was a lot of great games across more genres than any other year I can think of. Indie games also has a bunch of great hits.

Zelda, Baldurs Gate, Spiderman, Armored Core, Against the Storm, Hogwarts Legacy, Alan Wake2, Talos Principle 2, God of War Vahalla, Pikmin4, FF16, Street Fighter 6, Mario Wonder.

1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,Performance alone is worth the switch but regardless there's plenty of great games that aren't available on last gen. Last years GOTY being the most notable.
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,It's sad you refuse to play great games because they aren't a shitty annualized franchise.
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"The enshitification continues, I'm just disappointed so many people are making none arguments like ""but there are still great games"" and ""this is still good you should be happy"" without realizing just how stunted the medium has become in the AAA space."
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"That doesn't quite track to me.


Hyped games that were good - ff7re, Tekken


Hyped games that were bad - suicide squad, pirate game


Games I don't think were hyped, but were on my radar and have a strong release - helldivers 2, like a dragon, overlord unicorn


Plus dragons dogma 2 is releasing pretty soon. Yah suicide squad and the pirate game sucked. But it's been an open joke at this point that the pirate game has been delayed another year or two, and it's been a known things for at least the last year that suicide squad didn't look good, surprise surprise it wasn't good at release either."
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"Agree this gen has been shit (for many more reasons than what you posted), but we are 3 years in. Nowhere remotely close to twilight years."
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-18,"Yeah, like if you don’t count indie games, there have still been so many great triple A games released recently, and if you do count indie games, then there’s basically an endless stockpile.  I feel like gaming has gotten to the point, where we have amazing games at the same time that we have really bad ones. And I can understand why people are concerned at that, especially if they play shooter games a lot, which is frankly where a lot of these bad games have been released."
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"Yeah, the problem is OP isn't acknowledging the good. Everyone is well aware of the bad games that have been released, but there have been far more good than bad."
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"This generation of consoles doesn't have a game good enough to define it. PlayStation had FF7, N64 had Zelda, PS2 had Tekken and GTA 3-SA, Xbox had Halo, Xbox 360 had GTA V,

What does this generation have? Another CoD cash grab? Subscription-based versions of PS2 games?"
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,">  This console generation is far away from being a dud. 

Depends by what metric you define a dud.

If, for instance, you care about exclusives, this was the worst gen ever. Barring Nintendo, Xbox and PS5 have barely anything to offer. Xbox has no exclusives at all, and PS5 has https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:PlayStation_5-only_games, which is a miserable list (and some of them will come to PC anyway).

Many AAA companies like UB, EA and Bethesda have also failed to release good games. There's even more buggy, unfinished games coming out. And so on and on."
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-18,"Fair point on OP flaming.  I mean, defensive posting is like reddit bread and butter, it's rare for people to back down when confronted with a bunch of ""fuck you, you're wrong and stupid"" replies
(Not excusing when OP flames, just that constructive criticism here usually gets drowned in hostility from every direction)

My point is that
 1: I don't feel like every time someone wants to gripe about a legit concern they should have to preface it by including all the positive in it just to remind people about balance.
2. Sometimes people don't communicate things they're hyped up about perfectly,  but often times redditors will hyperfixate on the imperfections of someone's post in order to dismiss it, rather than acknowledge the general sentiment behind it.
(Apparently OP backed themselves into a corner, and are swinging violently from it, but I think the point still stands)"

1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"I haven't played it myself but I think pretty much everyone considered it one of the big Indie darlings of last year. The usual ""pixel art/turn based bad"" crowd griped,  but most others seemed to like it"

1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"I played it pretty soon after it came out, was looking forward to it for ages. I don't mind the cliche predictability, I don't find those bad. I did find the story to be pretty good.

What really made it 'mid as mid can be' for me was how flat the characters were, mainly the main 2. They aren't devoid of enough character to make them a 'character to place yourself into' but they have no other traits which make them good or memorable or even unique from each other. A good character can absolutely carry a mid game and they had a brilliant opportunity to make 2 interesting characters with interesting dialogue but I don't really remember any that they made to anyone.

Their art and the few trailer clips teased before release made me really excited for the characters but I was dissapointed. 

Garl was at least funny, but... Ya know... And  I did find the 2 teachers interesting despite their lack of screen time."
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"I havent heard a single person call it mid. If you care about such things, it won best indie at the game awards."

1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"But a lot of those ""biggest and best games"" have been great games as well. This person is just picking out the ones that flopped."
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,Also don't try anything that isn't exactly like every other game they've played. The amount of people I've seen who wrote off Baldur's Gate 3 because it was turn based is staggering. So many narrow minded gamers. If you limit yourself to only a small fraction of modern games you're obviously not going to find as many good ones.
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"I mean, even if we just use the ""biggest and best"" games 2023 was one of the best years ever. The only real criticism I can understand is too many remakes."

1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,I think a better point is these games are all from existing IPs. We didn't get a lot of new IP yet that is associated with just this console gen.
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,The PS3 initially had a PS2 built into it. I think it hit some of the same issues.
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"This generation doesn't have ""100% backwards compatibility,"" not sure where you got that from, because the claim has no basis in reality whatsoever. It's amazing that you got upvoted for it.

Currently the XSX does *not* have backwards compatibility outside of a handful of games that were emulated on XSX. The vast majority of games were not emulated. You cannot play most Xbox One games on XSX, flat out. The Xbox 360 generation was the exact same way.

Games have always had releases on older consoles in tandem with new ones. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 released on PS1, PS2, N64, GameCube, Gameboy, GBA, Xbox, Windows and Mac. That's 3 generations of hardware sharing the same title. This has always been normal for every console.

The PlayStation 3 also had a PS2 chip in it when it was released, but after the first model run they removed it; as it would've prevented them from selling as many games as they did on the PS Store.

In fact, we're moving towards a trend of having *zero* backwards compatibility. The new Xbox doesn't even have a disc tray unless you pay $200 more. I doubt the next one will have one at all. Microsoft doesn't want you playing Xbox and Xbox 360 and Xbox One games unless you buy them from the Microsoft Store."
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-18,"what? no...

no one looks at helldivers and alleges it is a great game because it has a lot of players. where on earth did you get that from?

and yes video games are repetitive, ever heard of tetris?

what marketing? the dev's have literally come out to tell people to wait on buying the game while the update and fix it's issues

I've never seen someone just blatently talk about something they know nothing about..... damn dude"
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"Agree with you. Last year was a great year for single player games with no mtx.  

Played also Zelda and BG3.  Finished CP: Phantom Liberty this week.  Somewhere in between I dove into Palworld and lately into Helldivers as the only multiplayer title. 

I cant complain and the success these games had shows that people still want those games instead of that live service AAA bullshit."
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"Depends on what games you like. Single player linear narrative focused titles? It’s only like 2-3, some of which are horror which is not to everyone’s liking. "
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,All of the titles mentioned here prove OPs point. This generation is a dud
1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"I believe is the appeal of 60fps. A lot of console gamers finally got a taste of that and it's something that when you get used to , is hard to go back to 30fps and devs/companies are aware of that."

1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"Agreed, and yet, proves the point that as long as your game focuses on the core element of gameplay, everything else is secondary. Extra processing power for better graphics and performance is always welcome though, but isn’t essential to produce great titles"

On PS5 I can go from playing one game directly into Valhalla in less than 20 seconds. The difference is staggering. No clue what this guy is talking about. Most games load extremely fast."

It was cross-gen, but so was everything else for the first two years of the generation. Unless you want to say the cross-gen period means none of those games released from 2020 to 2023 really count. In which case no wonder you think this generation has nothing to offer lol"

My problem with Chained Echoes was that I loved the first 70% and then it seemed the story started tripping over itself trying to explain and tie in every aspect of the itself, losing me before the finish line, then felt like they rushed a key characters redemption arc at the very end. 

I enjoyed the story presentation of Sea of Stars more. The overall plot didn't seem to overbloat with details, and I ended up enjoying more of its cast as characters. My grips with Sea of Stars in terms of it's writing is that not every character in your party gets the same amount of love and progression as others, one in particular not really given anytime to really make me care about them despite how interesting their concept was. Some story threads didn't get a satisfactory conclusion for me, and one story beat felt like it came out of nowhere with Garl. 

(Man, it's hard not to spoil things but still try to make it obvious what I'm talking about to those who played).

And last year is probably the best we're getting this gen, that's actually really, really sad.

You look at the last gen the top games meaningfully moved the medium forward, even sequels like God of War and Metal Gear Solid were tangibly special and different to their predecessors. 

This has been true for every gen except this one, the games poeple get excited about are just last gen games but slightly shinier. When you look at it like that you realise this new gen is a dud because nothing really happened."

The lack of backwards compatibility is why I never bought series x. It was a deal breaker for me. When I already own all the launch titles, but can't play them because they're not compatible, there's no reason to upgrade consoles."

Well done! Now read the rest of my comment. Where did I say *literally anything* about BG3? I like it, I own it, I put 300 hours into it.

I said I don't like Civ games, so why would I buy another Sid Meiers game? Now let's use that example as context like a normal logical person... If someone played a game like BG3 and decided not to buy it based on that experience it makes perfect sense.

Not liking slower turned based combat is 100% a logical and real reason not to buy BG3."

Like Star Wars the force unleashed was fn horrible for ps2, but was a pretty good game for ps3. Gave a reason to gamers to get the new tech. 

I still think dlc is just a way for developers to release unfinished games. Expansion packs use to feel really important back in the day with a lot of hype. Today new dlc feels like something that should’ve been in the game already.

There are definitely issues with games today that were never present 15 years ago and more. As long as gamers keep handing out their money for everything things won’t change for the better. Sadly…"

Unless you’re talking about the 360 disc, in which case that limitation is Rockstar’s choice designed to force you to buy the newer version. Xbox would support it if allowed.

Same goes for NBA. I think they make them for one console, but that’s on 2K, not Microsoft. The console fully supports it. Be angry at 2K.

Not that you’ll understand any of this since you’re probably too high."

We're at a point where all the publishers have made a conscious decision not to invest in technology and innovation, and because it's a collective decision there's simply no one to call them out on not pushing the art forward on the top end.

I appreciate what you're saying about price comparisons but this is not that discussion, the current gen of consoles can do better and are extremely under utilized.

I'm obviously not talking about people who played very similar games and just didn't enjoy them. Like if someone played Divinity Original Sin 2 and didn't like it, then yeah they probably wouldn't like Baldur's Gate 3 either. But if your only experience with turn based games are board games and/or old strategy games you haven't played in years, it's completely narrow minded to assume you wouldn't enjoy Baldur's Gate 3 just because it's turn based."

1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-18,"The real issue with 60fps and next gen graphics is that those settings are currently beyond consoles, optimizing them will be an even bigger pain. Cyberpunk on max settings and ray tracing will require PCs better than what the average PC gamer currently has to run consistently on those frame rates. So this severely limits the market reach those companies will have.

Then factor in the man power and labor costs. AAA games are already taking around 6 years to produce, so you can imagine how much longer/costlier it would take to achieve next-gen graphics and 60fps.

Keep in mind that studios are only ever earning back and offsetting these costs when their product is on the shelf and ""bought"". So it's still much easier and safer to make one live service game that will last them years, rather than starting the whole development cycle all over with multiple single player titles.

GTA VI next year will definitely impress but do note this is R\* we are talking about, that game will definitely be the most expensive to date and the crazy thing is they will definitely earn that back with ease. Other studios won't have this luxury."

Ultimately, you can't know you don't like it before you've played it. If you want to be narrow minded and just write off everything that isn't identical to what you've come accustomed to that's fine, that's your own problem and your own business. But stop acting like it's reasonable to just completely avoid everything outside of your comfort zone and assume you won't like any of it because you didn't like a specific game from a specific genre in the past. In any genre there are a massive variety of games with different mechanics, different quality, different visual style, different stories and characters. Not liking one thing from a genre doesn't mean you'll never like anything from that genre. To say otherwise is the definition of being narrow minded."

1bglos5,2024-03-17,2024-03-17,"No one is suggesting you should. Personally I think there's no reason at all to buy games at full price and I actively avoid doing so as much as possible (Baldur's Gate 3 was the only game I paid full price for since 2018, i rarely buy new games, and I'd still encourage people to wait to buy BG3 despite how much i like it because they'll probably have an even better first experience once Larian finishes patching it and adds mod support). You're arguing something different entirely here. No one is saying you should throw caution to the wind and drop $70 on something you're not sure about. Just that you shouldn't write off anything that doesn't perfectly align with your preferences just because you didn't like something similar previously. Especially if you're in OPs position where they're apparently struggling to find games they enjoy possibly due to how limited their preferences are.


If you want to wait until it reaches a more affordable price, that's understandable. But committing to just not even giving the game a fair chance to see if you'll enjoy it is not understandable. Unless you just have a backlog full of games you're constantly enjoying and simply don't feel the need to try something different, but again that's a different thing entirely, since I'm primarily talking about people who claim games are getting worse and are seemingly not enjoying what they're currently playing but also not trying anything different."

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I've discovered a new hobby while roaming the city in my helicopter.

I roam the skies of Los Santos looking for police chases in progress and do my best to interfere on behalf of the criminal.

This typically involves physically inserting myself between the victim and the police to halt their pursuit. Or crashing into/diverting police helicopters. Once I see that the perpetrator has some distance from the Law, I fly off into the city to find more justice to obstruct.

I like to think of myself as a vigilante for injustice.

I doubt the other parties understand what's going on. They probably just see a Trevor trying to dive-bomb their cars. But I don't do it for their thanks. I do it so that chaos might reign supreme on the streets of Los Santos."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Yesterday I was playing free roam. I've got no moral qualms about shooting other people (because like your experience shows, that's pretty much all people do). This one guy, though. I walked up to him just to see what was up. Shoots me in the face. I respawn. He finds me, and shoots me again. One more time. Same thing. Finally, I see his car he abandoned. I take it, pull up to him, and finally get the drop on him. I kill him and drive off, and you know what he does? Kicks me from the session. Some people, man..."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I thinks it's a sort of chain reaction. If a few people online are a 'Trevor', then everyone has to become a Trevor, or else theyre going to become a Mr Rasberry Jam"
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I've unprovokingly killed someone once: I was flying in a helicopter, and some poor soul was peacefully parachuting high above the city. I chopped up his parachute and watched him fall all the way down to his death. You don't get that oppourtunity often, and I don't regret it. 

It counted as a suicide and I don't think he saw my username.

Driving on a motorbike I stole to the closest white dot, I noticed someone was robbing a convenience store. First thought to cross my mind was to kill him and take his goods. I immediately came up with a better idea.

I pulled out my sawed-off shotgun, and blasted his get-away car's tires. Just the sight of slowly driving off in the distance with the cops on his tail filled me with evil delight. "

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Part of it is fear. When I'm in free roam, I don't necessarily want to go around killing people, but after experiences like yours when I see somebody approaching me I automatically assume they are going to kill me so I go on the offensive straight away just in case.

Guaranteed, those first 6 or 7 people who shot you and took your helicopter automatically assumed you'd flown to them to kill them and killed you in self ""defence""


Or maybe because they really just wanted a helicopter."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"This guy killed me as soon as I completed the first mission after the initial race you do when you land in Los Santos.

I respawn.

I'm about to walk into the liqour store and I see him walking out. He runs off and into his car, so I follow him. 

He's in the thrift shop buying clothes. I look through the window, ""Is this the cunt? Kinda looks like him. I'm not sure..."". I stay crouched behind his ride. I see him finish off and start to walk out the store. 

He gets into the car.

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"This just made me laugh outloud. 

I'm having a fucking *BLAST* with the online. It's buggy, for sure, but it's so goddamn fun. 

I was flying around in that army chopper (the two rotor one) and following some random player around - and then he stopped. I flew low and he tried to shoot me for my chopper. I wasn't having that - but rather than kill him, I used the winch to take his car away from him and drop it in the ocean. 

I hope he learned his lesson. I wish I could have seen the disbelief on his face when he saw his beautiful car flying away. 

Lots of people I know have complained about being killed non-stop. Maybe I've just been lucky, but it's only happened a few times for me. Generally most of the players on whatever Xbox server I wind up on do their own thing. Sometimes there's some beef and random killings but so far it's been pretty tame."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I was playing some GTAO today, and no one wanted to rob a liquor store with me. I eventually ended up walking around aimlessly. I looked into my reflection in the water of the Los Santos sewer, and I realized I was beautiful. It was then that I realized I was Lamar. We **all** have a Lamar within us. Don't let anyone hate on you because you're beautiful, *neeeey-gga.*"
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"The very first time I got a helicopter, I landed it in front of the first guy I saw, and he jumped right in.

I flew over the Maze Bank building and he jumped out and parachuted down through the city.  I found him and let him get back in, and he did it again.

On the third jump, I tracked him down and crashed the helicopter into him while he was parachuting, which caused him to plummet to his death.

Now he has a proper respect for gravity."

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,This might be the best r/gaming post I've ever read.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"One of the first things that happened to me in free roam was having another character pull up next to me, get out of his car, and immediately shoot me in the face. I had barely taken my first steps.

I laughed my ass off."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,Its basically The Purge. 
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I was playing with some friends last night. There were four of us, and two of us went to grab two choppers to do an attack on the military base. While I went to go pick up the other two, some random jagoff decides to kill me. He gets in the chopper, spins up the rotors and begins to take off, only to meet a bullet from one of my would be passengers. As I get back into the cockpit and my two friends are loading up, he respawns near us and tries to kill me again. One of my buddies gets out and blows up his personal, expensive, customized vehicle with a rocket launcher. That's the end of that guy, we think. 

Not so. 

We do our little failed raid on the military base, three of us die and our other chopper airlifts us out. Few minutes go by, we notice that guy has followed us to the vicinity of the base, and is shooting at us with a minigun. We are surprised, but not entirely threatened. Here's where it gets interesting. 

I'm flying one of my friends around helping him look for one of the big redneck 4wd trucks, when I hear a lock on alert. This motherfucker went and got a fighter jet and is hunting us down. Then ensues ten minutes of a cat and mouse game, I'm flying between mountains, around buildings, dodging missiles while this guy is constantly trying to blow us out of the sky. He eventually catches a successful lock on us. We bail out over the city, and parachute down thinking we are safe. Well here three of us are, parachuting through the sky, when whaddya know... A rumbling jet engine approaching in the distance. He blasts me out of the sky with his cannons, and comes back around and crashes his jet into my two remaining friends on the ground as they make their escape in a Trans Am. This was all over the course of about an hour. And the most fun I've had since the early days of gta 4 online.

Tl;dr:  Guy gets killed trying to steal our chopper, comes back with a fighter jet to enact revenge. Succeeds."

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"This game has been a fucked up experience for me. I have never really played console games online but i have heard how bad people talk to other people on games like COD. Now i'm old school i come from quake/cs days before people used mics. When people typed GG at the end of a match and always said ""Nice Shot!"" after you killed them.

Man are people fucked up. I just bought a garage and then finished tuning up my FUTO. I made a horrible mistake and spent all my money before installing my tracker and insurance. I left the shop thinking hey should be no trouble at all to drive to my garage. I almost get to my ghetto two car garage when i pass a beat up banshee smashed into a poll. As i pass him i hear a ghetto voice say ""bitch!"" then gun shots, then smash. dead. I respawn to this guy saying ""bitch suck my dick, where you at, fucking bitch""

I get it, i'm just playing a game. But this is a grown man saying this. It's so fucked. Fucking world is full of sociopaths and main stream gaming is showing me this."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"God that reminds me of when we raised meat pigs as a kid. I had a favourite pig (named Babe because of course) and because my dad was a nice/crazy guy before we chopped him up into babe steaks we took him around town and showed him all the cool places. I even bought him a snickers bar.

Then dad cut his throat, I helped put his body into the hot water to melt off his hair.

RIP Babe."

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I always try to feel out other payers, rather than just shoot them on sight. This usually leads to me getting killed instantly, but every once in a while, I meet someone cool and we get into some Jolly Cooperation."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Actually... I kill other players on sight because I don't want to pay the medical fees of getting killed by them. It is much cheaper to NOT die. I watch my minimap with StarCraft like furor and if I see someone approaching my location I get off the road, and find cover, and wait. 9 times out of 10 they ram into my car or the area I am standing, trying to kill me. So I kill them."

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-09,"I had one of my most fun moments last night with my first Impromptu Race. I stole an Infernus which I couldn't claim as my own, so I figured might as well have a little fun with it. I found a dot fairly close and challenged them to a race. The dot accepted, and when he shows up he's driving a fairly sup'd up Mercedes AMG like car with crazy purple and orange paint scheme. He lines up against me, doesn't try to shoot me, and then I'm like oh shit this is really happening the way it should...I hit start and we embark on a p2p race from the airport to the alamo sea. We had an awesome back and fourth but after too many collisions with traffic he pulled away and toasted me. I met up with him at the finish line, he honks his clown horn, and I decide to get out and entertain a bit. I stand on the car and kick dents in the roof, bash the windows and shoot a few shotgun blasts into the body. After enough shots the rear engine, it explodes. I run through the flames, catch fire, survive...then start to pound bottle after bottle of pisswater beer. We text each other on a good race, no one died, and he sped off into the sunset....race bros for life."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I haven't played GTA V online yet, but in GTA IV I would always try to pick people up in a helicopter, fly up to a tall building and land. I'd get out, and wait for my passenger to get out too. They usually do because they are intrigued by you doing something other than just blowing the shit out of everyone. As soon as they got out, I would jump straight back in and fly away, leaving them stranded and contemplating why they trusted me in the first place. Good times."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Ever since I bought an apartment I've had a new favorite past time in GTA online.  I watch t.v., which lets you watch other players in free roam, I flip through all the players untill I find someone griefing and then call Lester and put a bounty on their heads, the only problem with that is, most griefers are too low of a level to put bounties on, less than 10. So sometimes I do some griefing of my own by putting a bounty on a random person and watching them play, or I find 2 people playing together and put a bounty on one of them and see how much their friendship is worth, will the other person protect their friend or betray them for the bounty? Always fun to watch."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Last night I was playing free roam. A guy picked me up in a chopper and drove me around for ages. I'm a polite and well mannered guy so I just tagged along. But, boy, was I bored. He even took me to see that wind turbine farm thingy, uhf. Finally when we stood in awkward silence on the top of that tall building in the centre of LS, I was like: Kill...me. And he did, so I guess all in all he was a pretty decent guy."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Yesterday, I saw a guy at the ATM. So I snuck around his car and shot out his tires and ran back into my car. I got cocky though. I drove back around and he blasted me with his micro SMG. I deserved that. He then hunted me down and killed me another 5 times. Sorry guy. "
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I remember playing Battlefield 1942 on PC. There were 8 of us at the airfield waiting for an airplane to spawn. Finally one spawned and we all raced to it. Someone got in and started to take off. Everyone else, out of sour grapes, starts attacking the plane and blows it up, killing the pilot.

This happened every time a plane spawned without fail. Nobody ever came close to taking off in a plane. Everyone had the mindset of ""Just let ME take off and I'll stop being a jerk"", so everyone never stopped being a jerk."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-09,"My monster moment in this game was fairly early on. I had a helicopter and was flying around just watching what other people were doing and saw two guys running from the cops. So I decide to try and help them, the stop off and hide somewhere and I move in with my helicopter and go to land in front of them. I am quickly shot at and nearly killed. But I chock that up to the animalistic mistrust everyone has and go to land again. This repeats three more times before they finally get that I wasn't going to murder them. So they get in and I fly them away. Now it's important at this point to say they were low level enough not to have the parachute, and that would be their downfall. Anyway I take them to the top of the highest building and let them out, they must have thought there was something there as they got out and looked around. At this point I simply circled the building from a safe distance and watched as they scurried around looking for any way down. 15mins they were up there, shooting, sending me messages, doing laps around the top, waiting and praying for some one to save them. But because when we first met they tried to murder me I allowed natural consiquences to take place and I laughed maniacally as they plummeted onto the cold streets of Los Santos.

Tl;dr left two guys without parachutes at the top of a tall building and watched them till they jumped"
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,I'm not a Trevor. You're all dicks.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Ironic that you had to take him to the top of the tallest building, only to realize, that in that exact moment, he had pushed YOU over the edge."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I actually started off by being the guy killing everyone for no reason. But when I actually started playing and got killed a few times by some asshole I realized how much it sucks. I try to play nice now. But it seems like the karma is coming back to bite me in the ass. I had this nice Land Rover type vehicle I just took and was about to make my way to sell it and some asshole comes careening towards me, he went out of his way to smash into me at top speed. gets out and shoots me. $9000 gone, I'm done being the dick. I know the feels. "
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"A pretty similar thing happened to me, on the other end.

I had a $5,000 bounty on my head (no idea why). A helicopter lands right next to me. I assume he is here to kill me, and I'm at peace -- only the driver doesn't leave the chopper. He waits for me to get in. He flies me to the helipad so I can get my own chopper. We were chopper buddies. After 10 minutes, I land my chopper and steal a car. He immediately lands on my car, jumps out, and shoots me in the face to collect the bounty."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,I cannot stand the online for this single reason. I was simply shopping for some guns and this dickhead runs up into the shop and shoots me in the back of the head. Gee thanks. I watched my BF play it and he was robbing a convenience store and this guy runs in and starts punching him (my BF got the last laugh by pistol whipping him to death though). Every single one of them are jerks and when you're randomly killed by some asshole while trying to have fun only to get charged by the hospital for a respawn is salt in the wound. 
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"We all wish we could be as free as Trevor, I agree. I remembered admiring his genuineness so much in the game and thinking ""wtf why do I like this character so much?"", I envied his freedom.  "
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"i have a story of true altruism;

my friend and i had just robbed a liquor store in a desperate attempt to pay for new shoes, and in our escape we had to eliminate a few witnesses. our escapades alerted the attention of several cops, who began chasing us down the freeway. We shot out some cop tires, and brought ourselves up to 4 stars. A cop shot out the back tire on my motorcycle, and we flew off the freeway and landed on the beach. With no transportation, we were stranded and completely surrounded by police. We fought bravely, but the police gained on us.

Suddenly, a hail of missiles descended upon the cops, destroying most of them. A player flew over us in a jet, raining fiery hell upon the police. A helicopter arrived and landed next to us, and two other players jumped out armed with grenades. They blew up every cop they could see while my friend and I stared on, stunned at our luck. 

I then got a text from one of the players, telling me to get in the chopper. My friend and I hopped in, and we were taken to the observatory, where several very nice cars were parked. I got another text telling me to take my pick, and the copter left. We never saw those players again, but their exploits will live on in history forever.

Then I got home and played GTA5."

We run over, get in, and immediately my friend says, ""So when are we going to kill him?"" I was like ""no, this dude's cool. Let's see where he takes us."" 

The whole time we were in the chopper my friend was listing ways in which the guy could potentially fuck *us* over, but in the end he dropped us off at the army base next to a jet, and I had a blast in that for a while. I guess it's just a case of having some faith in people sometimes."

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I was actually surprised at the *lack* of random murdering in GTAO. I've only been randomly killed on freeroam by another player once, and that was because he wanted my car. IDK, maybe it's because I'm on PS3 and there are considerably less annoying 13 year olds."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-09,Yeah except you're way worse because you actually developed some emotional partnership with eachother before you executed his ass instead of just killing him on sight. That must have been really sad for him. :(
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-09,"As a seasoned Day Z veteran:

Welcome to hell, where people will kill you for a can of beans. It's not the beans they want, it's the principle of the matter. They want you dead for the sport of it."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,I find myself 80% Michael 20% Trevor.  but for the most part I want to be helpful until I get a bounty on my head then I am 100% Trevor. 
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,What you did is worse than just shooting on sight.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Because some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned, or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch the world *burn*"
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I never deathmatch (term taken from San Andreas Multiplayer) randomly, unless they have done something to provoke me, such as randomly killing me, where I then make their life hell after hunting them down so much. Last time, I saved a guy from police and was signalled to get in his car and he kindly showed me how to get into Fort Zancudo and get a jet...the jet is a 1 seater... He took the seat... Life was sad and confused that day."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,Red Dead Redemption had the exact same issue.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"My experience is that if I ever see another player near me, I try to avoid them.  If we cross paths they usually try to crash into you and shoot, but if you can drive away they typically don't pursue.

Also, if you don't keep your gun out I feel like people attack you less."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I *am* more of a Michael, but assholes like you force me to play like a Trevor. It's actually starting to reduce the amount of fun I am capable of having in Online."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,I've yet to intentionally kill another player. Once I hit a lag spike going like 100 mph through an intersection and this guy on foot 10 feet away went flying and it said I killed him. I felt bad.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Day 1 I kept pulling up to people in my car, stop with them on the passenger side, honk the horn a couple times. Universal symbol for *get in*. 

Shot in the face every time. I haven't been back."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"the other night, my brother, a friend and I were flying a helicopter when some dude kills my bro and I. It turned into a battle to kill each other, then a chase, then a race, to a must kill him mission to the death/exhaustion. This went on for about 90 minutes.

Eventually he got a random person to join his cause, and they wound up hiding on the moving train. We couldn't figure out where he was for a while, so i took to a jet, my bro to fast car and another massive chase ensued. This started at 3 am and we loved EVERY SECOND OF IT, it was visceral.

tl;dr: GTA online should be played as hide and go kill. "
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,I got in a session late last night where everyone helped each other out dropping off players in the military base with the chopper so we could all steal the jet. Late at night is the best time to play imo. Prolly cuz everyone is stoned.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,Shouldn't have killed him. Should've just left him there.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"You're wrong! I did the same as you, I took a chopper and I actually made 2 friends right away! one is Russian to make it more awesome. I land, they get in and I take them both to get their own choppers. We fly around a while and end up at the same place as you did (which was hard with 3 choppers landing on that tiny spot). Instead of gunning eachother down, they started taking selfies with me in the picture. Thats where I realized these guys were alright. Since then I've been hanging out with them almost daily. The Russian doesn't understand a word English, but we became good buddies! even in GTA races we don't bash or shoot eachother of the road.

We cruised around in airplanes for a good 30 minutes exploring Los Santos while trying to get other people into our awesome trio but no luck so far.

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"i just wanna say that i managed to play a civil 9 hole game of golf with four players, and a 3 set game of tennis both took up 45 minutes of my sad sad life.  Pretty fun though, everyone was nice.  But yeah this isnt the norm...it's GTA...."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,I put passive mode on and proceed to have a guy shoot at me to no avail..... I stare at him blankly.. Dressed with a hockey mask on like Jason Vorhees... I was down on the bottom of the hill he must have found my personal vehicle and destroyed it. The world is cruel... I then put a bounty out for him haha
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Had a situation where a guy was getting shot at by the police, came and killed a few to help him out. Jumped in his car because at this point we had a 3 star rating. Following this was what must have been a 10-15 minute car chase, with some hilarious driving and crazy jumps.. Finally got away from the police after hiding under a bridge and felt a real sense of comeradery with this guy. Before i knew it, the prick has gotten out of his car and shot me in the head. Motherfucker... I could only laugh though, as I imagine he was as well!"
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"This sort of stuff Is why I've never liked any games like COD, GTA, ect because you can't ever do anything if you don't shoot everyone you see, it really ruins the game for everyone."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"The problem is because you get a few people who do it, most start doing it in self-defence...Rather than be one shotted they'd prefer to get the shot in first."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,10/10 would read again
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,This is a really good case against anarchy.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I don't kill anyone. I like to roam around and mess with people but that's it. My k/d is .22 haha. I just go get the cargo bob and pick up people's cars and drop them in the ocean or from real high. Last night I got two different people while they were in the pause menu, picked them up, flew them deep into the ocean and waited. When they start shooting me I drop them. It's hilarious. "
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"That's why it's always fun to play with a group of friends. They'll get your back if someone decides to mess with you.

I wish I could agree with your post in saying that everyone is like Trevor, but sadly that's not the case. They don't try to kill you because they're psychotic, they do it because they're annoying little kids who were programmed by COD to think that constant killing is the way the game should be played."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,I have barely tried to shoot anyone in free roam and it has been to my detriment. I have a mic and am constantly trying to invite propel to do anything but kill each other and all I do is get killed. So I guess I'm Roman?
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"You're way worse, those other people just robbed you of your shiny toy. You *betrayed* someone you engaged in a trusty relationship with."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-09,"Just an FYI and a shameless bump for /r/Games. Not as much fluff there, self posts are more accepted."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-09,"Once I was cruising around on my bike that I spent hours getting the money for. I'm riding along a store, and I see a guy holding it up, so I said ""fuck it, I'll help him"". He had no getaway, so he hopped on my bike and we spent 15 minutes with 4 stars. After that was all over, I dropped him back off in front of the store, not even asking for a cut. He immediatly turns around, shoots me in the head, and takes my bike. 10 minutes later I track the son of a bitch down and kill him as he was walking out of a clothes shop."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-09,"I have an awesome story! I'm pretty low on cash, so I decide to go rob a liquor store. I've got no shit, just a really crappy pistol. So, I take the store and just get to a really shitty sedan but, all of the sudden, this guys pulls up in a faster car that was clearly just stolen (blood stain on the window) and he just starts honking at me. I get the three stars and there's already cops swarming the place. I'm just thinking, ""Well fuck, this guy's gonna kill me and the cops are too, there goes my 1k."" Then this guy just drives up to the cops, blasts em all, and then reverses to me and starts honking again. I get in, and he drives me away to get rid of the wanted level. Awesome. I gave him all of the money.
TL;DR Awesome random guy online saves me from getting killed after liquor store robbery"
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-09,There's a friendly free roam... If you didn't know.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-09,Day-Z taught me pretty well not to trust anybody you don't know in real life. 
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-09,this made me genuinely sad.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-10,People need to stop playing this like Call Of Duty.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-17,"I expected most people to just immediately murder me on sight when I started playing online but there are a handful of cool players out there. For example, I was just driving around the other day when i noticed a player with the same car I had (we both had Gauntlets). Instead of killing him, I pulled up next to him and revved my engine a few times. He answered with a few revs of his own and before I knew it we were racing around the map at top speed just for fun. Neither of us had a mic, we weren't playing an actual race, we were just having fun with another player. We even stopped and waited for each other to catch up if one of us happened to crash. So yeah, the majority of people will want to kill you instantly, but there are some really cool players out there if you really look for them."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-23,"I sell a car at the Los Santos Customs near the airport. I start heading to my Akuma when another player comes barreling at me in a sports car. My first reaction has become ""kill or be killed"" so I whip out my assault rifle and headshot him, his car still runs me over but I am alive. He has a mic, I hear ""shit, I wasn't trying to hit you on purpose... Why'd you shoot me"". I continue on my merry way when I hear ""guys, hold up, I gotta kill this bitch... I got some business""... He is heading towards me. I take cover, he approaches, so I kill him again. ""Oh you little fucker, it's on now! You are dead my whole crew Goan be up your ass, son"". I shoot him a text (no mic) ""only reason you died is self defense"" and I proceeded to my garage... Only to be ran down, respawned and instantly shot three more times before just quitting. "
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I haven't played much yet, but I like the idea of committing the crimes with someone rather then kill each other. You can do that in pretty much any other game."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Woah. Is that you? I think that I might have been the guy who got in the helicopter with you. Did someone ram us with a jet while you were flying around? Also, were we chased by the cops at some point?

Edit: I just realized that I basically summed up everybody's typical helicopter experience."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I was playing a random guy came running, thought we both are GTA V fans, I honked the horn and stopped to gave him a ride and he shot me.... Fuck this DMing motherfuckers, they don't understand online is not only about Deatmatch"
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I've been doing a very similar thing, but with a much more optimistic success rate. We usually bump off a few stores together before I fly them to the top of the map to skydive into downtown LS.

And I don't shoot them at the end, you sick fuck."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I like when I go on reddit and someone posts wonderful writing, your words just inspired me to put down the phone and hop on the Xbox. 

Thank you. 

Have an upvote. "
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"when i had Red Dead i didnt shoot people unless they shot at me all i would do is go unting and do challenges and stuff like that(like riding your horse an ungodly amount of miles) but if you attacked me you brought the hand of god down upon you, for i am a crack shot with the springfield."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Last night I met a friend in GTA5 online. He took me on a city tour in his helicopter.
The places he took me to were wondrous and I actually had a great time. As I was standing there watching the sunset with him I was thinking to myself ""To think I was going to kill myself today. I had no friends and nothing to look forward to. This is a tru-"" "
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"The other day I did a drug-collecting mission with two other people. After it ended we voted to go back to freeroam, which put us all outside the apartment you deliver the drugs to. As I loaded in I saw one of the guys I just did the mission with shooting the other, and then he killed me."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,Dammit Trevors! 
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,You lose waaaaay too much money when you die.  I saved up around 70 grand which took hours; then in about one hour of having fun and just going around doing crazy ( with cops/other players) stuff I was down to 22 grand.  Not worth it.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"The only way thus far I've found to get these legendary periodic rewards for good behavior is playing alone in a private session where I'm not forced to constantly fend off higher level players who are bored of missions and just exercise their trigger fingers. 

I mean, I want to be a Michael for god's sake but I often feel I'm forced to be Trevor. If that makes any sense."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,This is exactly why I play in mostly private sessions. 
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,You are a LEGEND
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,I'm getting Dayz flashbacks here. 
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,I got my Psych professor into the story and the ideas behind GTAV both the story and online. Even brought my Xbox into class so he could see it for himself.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"In reality, what you describe is worse than Trevor."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,This post simultaneously makes me want to play the game and makes me glad that I don't have it.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,This was a beautiful read.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I'm more of a Wade, I just want ice cream."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I love this monologue.  I haven't played this game, but I've seen enough trailers to understand the dynamic of each character if only at face value.  
Great writing.

EDIT: changed ""any of these games"" to ""this game"""
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,You should really try /r/truegaming with posts like that.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Yes we're all Trevors, except for that one guy, he was the one franklin and you killed him.

The fuck man?"
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Reminds me of 'Of Mice and Men'.

""No, Lennie. Look down there across the river, like you can almost see the place.""

"
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"A very dark realization, but it is a game, after all..."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I must be lucky. I find a lot of people willing to play together in free roam. 

Just today I was leaving a robbery when some dude drops down in a helicopter, and flies me around until my wanted level went away. 

I found his profile in-menu and commended him."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I expected nothing less from this game to be completely honest.I expected players to be as cutthroat as possible and kill all who stand in their way, and as a result I haven't had too many issues with players. First off, I do my best to avoid players whenever I can, and if I do run into one, I will never open fire until they start shooting at me.  I'll get the occasional asshole sneaking up on me when my head is turned and shooting me before driving off, or my personal favortie: The one who stands directly outside of a store waiting for you to come out unarmed.  But anytime some idiot wants to play like that I immediately hunt them down, kill them and blow up their cars. I've done it about 6 times already and it's an amazing feeling and that's why I love this game. Let players be as brutal as they can, let the races be nothing more than sabotage efforts, let everyone do their thing and fuck anyone who dare threaten them. 

Edit: I think of myself as a Franklin. A much whiter, east coast version of Franklin: I'll defend myself and stand my ground but I won't be fucking with nobody who don't deserve it. And on a mission I'm your getaway driver. "
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,This was hilariously beautiful. I have yet to experience GTA:O but I figured it was going to be a mass killing spree. Does this take away from the enjoyment of online? I can see myself getting pretty frustrated by constantly getting killed while just roaming or doing missions.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Beautifully written and told, OP.

I like how you took us in your story and ended it abruptly, realizing that, you're as evil as anyone else."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,GTA V Online sounds a LOT like the bad old days of UO.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,I think trevor was clearly the most sensitive character out of the three. 
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,I thought there was a glitch that turned everyone's character model into Trevor
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,I am proud to say that im not a Trevor. I only revenge kill people or collect on bounties. I never kill random people for no reason.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,This was beautiful. 
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,This is strangely beautiful.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,TIL GTA V online is just like DayZ.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Haha, welcome to DayZ."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Not going to lie, GTA Online kinda sucks."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,Why can you still get ran over in passive mode or shot at(in a car) in passive mode? There's really no point  in turning it on.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"This feels like a self-fulfilling prophecy. Everyone acts like Trevor, because they're afraid of everyone else being a Trevor, so they Trevor first to avoid getting Trevor'd themselves, thus creating the very Trevor they were seeking to avoid."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Every time another player gets even remotely close to me I get out of my car, take cover, and prepare to blow his fucking head off. I never shoot first because I always like to give them the benefit of the doubt. And maybe because I'm not as big of an asshole as some people in that game."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I kill players for 3 reasons:

1)  bounty hunting

2) self defence

3) revenge

I don't do it for shits and giggles. I like to think I'm a good person."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"This is like Journey, but with guns."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"> I learned that really, we're all Trevors.

Except for the dude you shot"
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Whenever I go free roam I always have passive mode on. It's just too fun to see everyone get so pissed they can't kill you. Except this one time. Guy walks up to me by Lester's factory and toes to shoot me. Gets pissed and steals a car to try and run me over. I just casually stand there and walk or jump outta the way for a minute or so. Then he drives off whips a u turn and promptly gets the police on him. He's driving at me straight on just at the last second I jump outta the way. But not fully, he clipped my leg and brought me down. Before I even had time to get up a cop speeding at him the other way runs me over and kills me. I have terrible luck with the cops in this game."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"You ruined a perfectly good friendship. The deepest wound is inflicted by those we trust, and trust is a rare thing in GTA. "
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,This bothered me for a bit. I seem to always have the drop on players but choose to let them live because I don't want to start shit but as soon as they see me they unload. I wonder if they even know I let them live. After this happened endless times I have become a soulless bastard. Kill or be killed sadly is the mindset you have to have. The worst thing about it is what if one of those people I kill is like how I used to be and just thinks I'm another instant killing asshole... It's a vicious circle. 
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Man, you would really hate DayZ"
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I've literally had only one person kill me or even try to.  
Although once I pulled up to some dude on my motorcycle and he got on the back (I have no mic, he just knew shit was about to go down) and pulled out his shotgun.  We rode around Los Santos PKing, hunting down cops and blowing shit up until we got blasted.  
Annnnnd one time I popped some dude in the face.  
Other than those 3 incidents though, really haven't had or seen too much random violence in my play sessions."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"on GTA Online last night, the same guy tried shooting me in my car about 3 times in a row. Each time I promptly turned my car around and implanted him into a wall, before getting out and giving him the bird before he got to the respawn screen
"
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I honestly just wish there are more players who are against that.  Too bad it's not that way, and I just got to enjoy what's given to me."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Do you play on PS3 or Xbox360? My friends and I play on PS3 and play invite only sometimes, so if you want, you can add me and we can do some non-trevor gameplay.
"
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,I did the same. He got in and we flew around. I stopped ontop of the tallest building and got out. We both looked over the edge and before I knew it he was in the helicopter lifting off. He flew and turned the helicopter around and face me. I popped him 4 times as his copter crash into the building tumbled & exploded.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Aren't you placed on servers with people that are like you? I read that in the tutorial. If your a good sport, you get to play with other good sports. If your a bad sport, of course you play with bad sports. So far in my experience, most people just ignore each other, no one shoots any one else. I've only been shot at maybe 2 or 3 times since online came out but that's not much."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,I've only been online for a few hours but I make myself a reverse Batman kind of. I spent a hearty amount of time last night using a chopper to pick people up who had 2 stars and fly them around to get rid of wanted level. People seem to appreciate it. No one randomly killed me. I do have a headset that I use to announce my intentions though.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,I am Trevor myself only if someone shoots me though 
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I wish there was more incentive to be friendly to others and less punishments for being a douche.

Right now its just DayZ without zombies and with trevors"
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Last night was my first time online, I had to go to the clothes store as I was walking in I got shot at, so I hid in the back. After about 2 minutes the shooter walks in and I charge towards the door, steal his car and drove like hell out of there. It was the best time I have on a video game in awhile."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Wait for the game to age a little bit.

I got GTA 4 2 years late, but the community was still ripe. Most were Trevorclones, but some of them were pretty cool. I remember picking up 2 randoms in an armored car, and we basically went on a 20 minute rampage without teamkilling."

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,Does anyone else think that we lose too much money when we die? I put all my money in the bank so that people can't rob me but it seems like sense we are all Trevor's we all die pretty quickly especially because when you die you respawn around the corner where another Trevor can come around and kill you easily.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I respect the OP. I gave Online about 20 minutes before I asked ""WTF is with the gas station that never reopens?"" and ""where's the fun stuff, like motorcycling off of mountains?"" and then hung up my sticks.

The fact that you played enough to write a story, and a fairly funny story, is worth much respeck."

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"> After about 6 or 7 times of this happening, someone finally decides not to shoot and rob me. Instead, very timidly and cautiously, they approach the helicopter and get in with me.

Yeah, that's a big problem I've had with Online. As it is right now, players are treating other players like they are unique criminals that go about doing their thing rather than another human. If they would stop instantly shooting every other player on sight and realise that the helicopter landing gently right next to them is actually inviting them to join in then they could have a brilliant experience."

Rinse and repeat for a good 10 minutes.  Eventually they stopped trying to kill me, all piled in a truck and took off.  Unfortunately there was only four seats and five players on their team.  I stopped, the stranded player hopped in my ride and I tore off after the group.  After following them for some time (and them being unable to lose me) they stopped.  I stopped...

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Going a bit off-topic. But I always love seeing unspoken cooperation. Whether it be Battlefield, where some guy just gets in my tank/heli and racks up kills with me without ever communicating and then joining up again for another ride after the first rampage came to an end. Or in DayZ, where you find a companion without ever uttering a word who legitimately has you back i.e. he is putting bullets in the guy shooting at you rather than finishing you off. Or old school MMOs where you would just group up and kill some rats without exchanging even a 'hi'.

I love it when I am playing a game and I find a mute buddy like myself.    "
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-09,"I don't try to kill people. I try to improve their evasive driving. I chase them in my fairly fast Dominator. They don't know I won't hurt them, so they run, and I chase. A lovely game of cat and mouse. Or ""I'm like a dog chasing a car. I wouldn't know what to do if I caught it."""
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-09,"Sounds like the easiest way to fix this is to increase the penalty associated with dying (just like real life sorta). People would be less likely to be the first to fire off a shot in case they catch a ton of lead in return. Perhaps even increase the penalty for players who ATTEMPT to kill another player but end up themselves dead. So you'd think twice before engaging. I'm surprised there is no 'gang' (team) mode of some sort, all sounds like deathmatch to me."

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-09,"Great story OP. I had my own experiences with some Trevors last night as well.

I was driving my car, pretty erratically I must admit, and I crashed into a gas station & blew the place up, including myself & my car.

I then call the insurance company and make a claim. I start walking, unarmed, to my car. I'm about two blocks away from it when I hear an explosion. I then get a notification telling me my car had been destroyed & to call my insurance company again. So I did. See the car on the map again & start walking again, as I get around the corner, I can see my car, I get shot. Re-spawn, start heading to my car again. About a block away, again, it's destroyed. I make a claim, turn the corner & get shot again. This time, when I re-spawn, I don't call the insurance company right away, instead, I head to the depot, where my car will be, find a corner to hide in & just wait. I see this guy doing laps around the block. I call the insurance company & make another claim, they drop the car, this guy doing laps sees my car, hurls a sticky bomb out the window & blows it up. So I make yet another claim, wait for this guy to come round the block again & I take him out. I though, ""phew"", I can go and get my car finally. How wrong was I? This guy re-spawned right next to me & shot me! This went on for about half an hour, I must've spent $10-$12k, just on insurance claims! I quit online at that point & went back to story mode for a while."

I join an online game. Immediately I seek to murder the nearest player. Even I am a little bothered by this tendency, but chalk it up to novelty.  
Several days later, it is only after reading this thread I realize I haven't even *considered* cooperative play online in free roam.  Other players are threats to be eliminated. "
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,I sold my copy of GTAV and my PS3 yesterday - I forgot console gamers are all kill-kill-kill.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Actually, one of my biggest complaints so far about GTAV Online is that there's almost no free-roam dynamic stuff, way too many lobby based things, which I guess in their formula works pretty good, but there's not enough opportunity to build or break trust with people on the fly - which in my opinion is part of the intrigue of underground crime, also the fact that you spawn 20 meters away from where you died means that in any given play session it's going to devolve into a full on death match. 

When you mix that with the fact that everyone I've faced online is a screaming underage wigger, it makes the experience of random death match that much worse. Arma 2's Chernaus Life had a role play element and penalty for acting without regard for the rest of the server, and that game ended up having a far more rewarding feeling despite a huge lack of polished features. That being said, GTA5 is still a bunch of stupid, polished, beautiful fun. "

step three: problem solved"
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Look, everyone is going to blame the people playing, but this is a reflection of the games industry in it's entirety, not one game. Where are cooperatively based, resource driven games that we so badly need? Like Minecraft's creator said, they should be heading towards board games, not action movies. I noticed no one has a problem with competition, or an environment in whcih one is considered better than another. No, it's just ""that guy over there""s fault for messing up what would have otherwise been you having a perfectly good time.. erm.. dominating everyone else? 

99.99% of gaming is run on the idea of one person winning and the rest facing consequences. Shit, most spectator sports are too."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"In the simple *ADVANCED* 13 year old's mind (OLDER THAN 12, OMGGG), they tend to associate EVERY game with killing. Have them go play Minecraft, they will go out, try to kill all the mobs, and get killed, then quit. Have them play Sub Rosa. They will try to KOS everyone for money and disks that they don't even know what for, and die, then quit. Any game that isn't playable or solved by simply killing everything, is going to be ruined by these kids.. "

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I had a similar experience. I picked up a brand new player in my heli and brought him to just about every gas station and I would wait in the chopper while he robbed them. After a couple hours I decided it was time for us to do our last job together. He went in the store but this time I got out and stood in front of the chopper. When he came out of the store I had my shotgun out. He stopped a few feet away and just kind of stared for a moment. I think a part of him knew what was about to happen. Poor boy didn't have a chance.

I don't know how much money I got off his corpse because that wasn't the point. The point was to welcome him to the mean streets of GTA Online."

We'll rob a few liquor stores, go shopping, even get some bicycles and race down mountains. But we both know that at one point, one of us will die. It just depends on who snaps first. So I usually jump out of a car as it heads for a cliff. They'll most likely live, but we're a safe distance apart to know that neither of us will have to make such a gruesome decision.

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-09,"I joined a lobby at random and overheard some French guys talking. I was roaming around for a while, and drove by some people. One of them shot at me. I turned around, and missile'd the vehicle in his direction and killed him. As it happened, I heard the French voice again but mad. After figuring out it was him, I began swearing at him in French (about the only French I know) and killing him. Shortly after he challenges me to a 1v1 deathmatch. I destroyed him in it, not once, not twice, but four times.


He was so mad. I wish I could speak French so I could have better understood his frustration and rage. "
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-09,"I did the exact same thing, but with one or two exceptions. One, I wasn't trying to pick him up. And two, I didn't kill him, yet he still died. But I'll get to that. It started like any other session. A few jobs were under my belt when I decided freeroam was as good an option as any, so I went exploring. As I wandered around the city I eventually found myself near the helipads. Initially, I didn't think I'd find any helicopters. I was at a rather low level and there was no evidence to justify that a copter would be there. But I thought for a moment and figured it wouldn't hurt to check the helipads. Heading into the area from the parking lots, I quickly scanned the area, and to my surprise, one beautiful helicopter lay untouched on its pad.  It was surprising to say the least. I mean, how could no one have touched such a majestic creature? I mean, it was just sitting here. In pristine condition. Ripe for the taking. Well, whatever the case, it was mine now. 

As I start up my copter, and begin taking to the skies, my first thought somehow becomes to mow down the first unsuspecting player I find. Great, now I'm a Trevor. Anyway, unfortunately for me, my plan fails miserably. Barreling down on the first unsuspecting player I see, I overshoot. The blades of my copter completely miss my target, hit the road, and nearly sends me into a spin. I suppose the aforementioned player, no longer unsuspecting, is laughing his ass off at this point. And I don't blame him. It was warranted. But now suddenly, as I'm regaining control of my copter, a harsh realization looms over me—I've left myself open to attack. I quickly adjust my camera, and just as I suspected, he's running towards my copter, presumably to riddle me with scorching bullets. But, for some reason I have yet to figure out, he doesn't. He doesn't even take out a weapon. Instead, he jumps in, suddenly forcing me into having a co-pilot I didn't want in the first place. After regaining my thoughts, and against my better judgement, I take to the skies yet again. Now, there's no way to kill this guy without killing myself, so I wager my best option is to find a high building and leave him and, shortly after we take off, I spot the Maize Bank. Perfect. Admittedly, the landing was a little rough, but the copter sustained little to no damage and we were alright, so it wasn't a problem as far as I was concerned. Sitting there, I half expected him to get out and shoot me. But, for the second time, he doesn't mirror my thoughts. No, this time he simply walks over to ledge and he begins to admire everything. He admired the city scape, the lights, the passing cars below, and he enjoyed it all. Thing is, a split second ago, he was in my cross hairs. I was going to take him down right then and there, but I couldn't bring myself to pull the trigger. However, fate, on the other hand, had other plans. He began to turn around and return to the copter, but his foot caught the ledge and he fell off the side. I tried to fly down and help him, but it was too late. He didn't even know what hit him."

Especially if they do it repeatedly. There is a consensual Deathmatch option for people that are into that. I saw a crew member get banished to a Bad Sport server for 48 hours from a fight that broke out in the city that lasted for 10 or 15 minutes, not on a job. Also, *fuck* anybody who shoots someone that is clearly paused or shopping unarmed in a store. I hope they increase the ""sentence"" each recurring offence."

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,So basically is the only way to have a good time in free roam to form a crew and stick with them? Can't imagine too many players will attack a group of 6 or more guys.

I don't know if there are ways to interact with people online without being one-on-one deathmatch or through friend request. I just want to cause chaos without killing each other. I usually approach people and don't do anything but I end up killed. Then I get pissed off. But well...  The other day I found a guy that was just messing around with a car and didn't kill me. We ended up going around in two big semis and it was the most fun I had so far in GTA online. Thanks YEARBZ. "
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,It's like Journey suddenly gets a twist ending.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Great story haha. But this sounds a lot like Red Dead Redemption to me. My brother and I liked playing online together doing the missions... but everyone else just wanted to just kill each other. It got really old really fast... We'd be doing some missions, next thing you know we are being hunted. It never stopped. And then we'd get tired of their shit and just hide out in some fort and kill the same few idiots over and over who were hunting us until we decided to just leave. 
"
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I feel your pain - without a Mic you're pretty much reliant on the other person. Yesterday someone picked me up from a 3 Star wanted level in the helicopter that can hook cars under it - and i was very thankful. He put me on a small building and wanted me to drive off the roof but I didn't - hoping to go bigger. 

The nice guy that he is - he instead put me down on the ground thinking I didn't want to damage my car that was already barely driving. Well... That Kinda killed the fun and he flew away.

But to be honest - I think we're all Trevor's in the right situation. I'd want to shoot him off the highest building too - and then I'd probably jump after him."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,Everyone is Trevor or Trevor is all of us?
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Idid the same thing as you. Found a choper, rode it around, found a guy robbing a store, parked out front, waited for him to exit, the yelled in my best Arnold impression ""Get to tha choppah!"", which actually worked and we got away scott free. I also like to play nice. We're not all Trevors. "
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,Sounds like a nice date. 
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I've tried this too, mostly on GTAV, but I did a bit in GTA4.

If someone looks hostile - ie driving erratically, doing dumb stuff, holding their weapon, or even just watching me - I avoid them and let them do their thing.

If they genuinely look like they have no reason to kill me, I see what they're up to without startling them and I try to bond with said player. If you're holding no weapons and walk towards an unarmed player, you'd be surprised how well it works.

They're like wild animals, really."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,Ice cold.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"i am franklin. cool, calm, collective and here to help, i just want paid for it."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I usually live and let live, but yesterday I became Trevor for a bit.  Parachuted to the top of a building and started sniping a few players.  One guy stopped in his car, I sniped him, he respawned and ran back to the car and drove around in circles and stopped again, hello bullet to the head #2.  I don't think anyone figured out exactly where I was...  

I was high enough that I couldn't see them, only cars, which disappeared if they went very far at all.  I could only hit them when in their cars by aiming at the windshield where the driver's head should be.  Then I found out that parachutes are one time use only, so I was stuck and had to try to walk across a beam to the crane (which had ladders), but failed and fell to my death..."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"People were massive dicks on GTA 4's online mode too.  It's a game about stealing, murder, sex and drugs.  Team works is the last thing I expect from randomers online."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"This is funny: I literally do the exact same thing, only I wait until people have a 3 star rating or so and then I land next to them in the chopper and try to airlift them to safety. Out of the twelve or thirteen times I've done this, only once was I not killed by the player immediately. I airlifted a guy, lost his wanted level, and dropped him off. It made it all worth it."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,I don't game at all. Or read this forum. But I love this post.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Hey I had someone come and land a helicopter in front of me last night too, I wanted to just get in and go for a ride but not knowing the controls all that well, when I held triangle to get in I wound up just stealing the helicopter on accident. I really didn't mean to steal it I wanted to just go for a ride so if that was you, my bad."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I tried this *exact* same thing with the same damn results. I tried about three times with random people and each time I was shot at or wasted. 

I can't walk in to, or out of, an ammu-nation either without someone waiting for me outside to try and gun me down. "
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"There really is no need to kill anyone unless their dot becomes red on the map or they try to steal the ""high priority vehicle"" first.  

Most players bank their cash as soon as they get it so you get no or very little 'reward'"
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"It was great to read this, really. With a sad and deep ending. Wow"
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"This is why I never play online games any more; it's been like this for a decade or longer. If I want to just shoot other players, I'll load a goddamn bot map and have at it."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"this is the biggest problem with the online. There is no finding other players to go do fun things with them. Online is just a giant cluserfuck deathmatch. It's only fun playing solo online, or playing in an invite only game with a few friends. 
 "
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,I tried to be the friendly guy that wanted to hangout in a helicopter. Until the guy that was flying it went up as far as he could go and jumped out. He had a parachute...I did not.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"It's a self perpetuating cycle.  Few start off as a Trevor, but after getting killed maliciously enough times (like when I was trying to evade the cops after finding a car that Simeon wanted, and I very carefully drove to the docks by Vespucci Beach...and sure enough, here comes the same asshole that has been killing me for the last 20 minutes, and in an attempt to get away, I land the car underwater), you eventually get fed up and kill preemptively. "
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"In the offline game, I just started the Trevor part of the story today, and can see that things are going to get really fun now "
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I used to kill people for the hell of it, now I pre-emptively kill anyone who comes near me. I found I die a lot less if I assume everyone is out to kill me."

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I have nearly no desire to play GTA multiplayer. I understand why some people would, but to me it just seems that it's going to be a shitty version of a third person shooter. With everyone killing each other on sight and stealing cars, how would this be entertaining for more than a couple of minutes?"
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I have very rarely had good moments, but when I do they shine. I saw this guy running out of a shop he just robbed, so I beep my horn and he jumps in. 

We run from the cop, rob about 3 more places, and then we start mucking about together, eventually we find another person, and another, and soon it's 5 of us running around in 2 cars and 1 helicopter just having fun doing anything.

It was great fun, but most of my experience has been seeing people and being shot, but every time I see someone, I beep my horn and give them a chance to get in, and see where the journey takes us."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,I tend to avoid being a Trevor. The only times I kill someone out of a job is if they are being Trevors to me first. I'm even a kind enough person that if I kill you by accident I'll send $1000 your way. I really hate free mode sometimes everyone is mostly an asshole or just cautious of everyone else because everyone else is an asshole. 
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,It isn't free roam as people can level up in it this changes the whole mindset of players. They really need online modes that do not revolve around career characters and are just drop in drop out modes like GTAIV
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I haven't played the game yet, but your moving testimony has sparked an urgent need to do so. You have somehow simultaneously managed to both earn my loving respect and my revolted disgust!"
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,I like to think of myself as Trevor
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,As someone who just started playing this game a couple days ago. This was an awesome read. Try breaking into the military base. Its a good time. 
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,That ended so unexpectedly. And it's so GTA.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,Bravo!
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Yesterday, I got into a lobby full of cool people. We got a bus and went around robbing stores and I played as the getaway driver. And we all split the money. When a new person joined in, we went and picked him up and continued on our way. All without a microphone. "
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,It's a little better if you have a mic and can tell people what you're trying to do but it's basically Day Z.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,You showed him heaven before you took him to hell. You should be proud.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,You are evil..
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Since GTA5 has become attack on sight, I wish they had the option of turning the player blips on the radar off."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,10\10 would read again 
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Great story, but you bring up a good point. It's really annoying that I can't interact with anyone in the game because they instantly try to kill me on sight. And for what? 100$? I lose more than they gain. Every time I die I lose 1-2k.


The multi player doesn't FEEL like multiplayer. I'm basically driving around alone, or with 1-2 of my RL friends trying to rob stores and avoid everyone else.

Should give you a 3 star wanted level if you kill another player. At least give a little deterrence. "
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,That was beautiful.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,Welcome to the Game.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,wish i could get online!!!
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,I've been a Trevor before I even knew about being a Trevor ( I've made it my personal mission to hit every motorcyclist in every sandbox game)
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,I had a similar experience where me and a silent stranger robbed liquor stores together. We even shared 50% of the cut with each other.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I found myself, the other day, wandering around looking and hoping for someone to kill me, just so I could put a bounty on their head, and have the satisfaction of them being hunted by strangers... that's normal, right?"
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"GTA Online - Rockstar has stated that if you grief other players/play like trevor (as you put it), you will be matched with other people that play like you.

Same goes for being more civilized."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I only do missions and when freeroaming put on passive mode and walk slowly towards people who are shooting me, while giving the the Bird"
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"""Buying everyone whatever the fuck they desire, even Trevor. And Lemondrops was even cool for a change."""
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,This was well written. Nice job OP.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,I avoid everybody. I don't use my phone unless I'm in a car for example. If I have to plan stuff out before a job I do it as far away from the city as i possibly can. I like it because it adds a level of paranoia to the game that by all rationale one should feel operating in a crime ridden-hyper violent sewer like Los Santos.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,I did this to a guy next to me. I had just gotten a 7k bounty put on me and 5 minutes later a helicopter comes flying by and the guy lands. He didn't get out to shoot me but I was scared so I did what I had to and killed him and took the heli. 20 minutes later after id been killed for the heli I'm just driving along from PB and out of nowhere rockets rain from the sky and next thing I know I see the guy who's helicopter I took fly in front if me in a jet and torment me for like 10 minutes on my way to the city. It was hilarious!
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"My friends and I never kill people unless they try to kill us. Honestly so far about 85% of out GTA online time has been spent stealing a crappy plane, landing it on the street in front  of a convenience store, robbing said store, then trying to take off from the street and lose the wanted level. Honestly, it's fun as hell and it looks hilarious running out of a store you just knocked over, getting into a Mammatus, and taking off from a side street. "
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,Did you expect anything else out of it? If you want a real GTA gaming experience...get GTA:SAMP for pc.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,I just want to know where you get easy helicopters.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I have no problem with people trying to kill me, because no one in this game can actually drive for shit.  Every time someone tries and chases me down, I can lose them after a couple of turns.  Kind of a joke really."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Last night I found myself in a firetruck and I amused myself to no end driving over to all the white dots, pulling up slowly and non aggressively, and then, as the other player would cautiously approach me, blasting them with the water turret.  Then letting them get up.  Then blasting them again.  over and over, until they died.  "
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"One time, I was stealing a jet, and some guy shot an RPG at the jet. I survived the blast, but it propelled me into the wall where i died."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,at least you helped him complete his bucketlist.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,I honestly would cry if someone did this to me. Real tears. Not game tears.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,Thats fucking deep man. 
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"im glad this is at the top of my reddit, thank you OP and community"
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,He was out of ammo.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,">He goes to the edge and looks over the city. It's sunset, and it's beautiful. He's enjoying the view. It's serene. Before I know it, I have my pistol out and pointed at the back of his head. I ask myself ""am I really different than all the other animals playing online here?"" And as his limp body tumbled off the roof, I chuckled to myself and thought, ""no, no I'm not any different."" 

It's good to know what I am now. I found myself laughing like [Show Bob by the third sentence. ಠ⌣ಠ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayO1wtXbh_Q&hd=1)"
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,Did you tell him he was going to be tending the rabbits?
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"In the early goings, people constantly killing you can seriously hinder your ability to make money and thus progress.  The fact that they spawn you near the person that just killed you doesn't make things any better.  

I had like 45K in my bank and one person killed me like four times in a row and I lost over 10K.  How is that even fair?  It's not like you get the money when you kill the person, you get 100 bucks.

I get that killing people is part of the experience but dayum, don't make it so punishing when it happens."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"10/10.  Would read again.  

[And then](http://i.imgur.com/ptZ39F9.gif)..."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Baseball bat, guns are so impersonal. I like to get close and beat the shit out of them, a good smash and a nice swing and I walk away a spiritually fulfilled man.

Its not easy getting close, so many guys like to light you up straight away. Buying armour does help but using vehicles to close the gap is the professional way. 

I always wait around for the victim to come back, everyone deserves a second chance.

Giving a second chance lets me think I'm better, that I'm not an animal but its a lie, a facade. I'm a monster, I don't gain anything from killing anyone but I cant stop myself doing it. As soon as I lay my eyes on the guy my finger is on the left bumper and I'm speeding towards him. Next thing I know I'm above the guy and beating his face in, what am I? Is the game just highlighting the inner me? Is this some primitive instinct shit?

We are all Trevor deep inside, Trevor is just us without the social fears and anxiety. He acts in the second, he murders in the moment.

"
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Am I the only one here that remembers that GTA IV had a multiplayer and it sucked?

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"This drives me insane. After days of not being able to connect and having my character deleted. Joined my first real session. First time I'm on a job with a guy he pulls the car over and blows it up. Then I killed him in retaliation and got instantly kicked. I went to the dashboard and was like.

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I normally play on invite only sessions with my friends to avoid these annoying players and to avoid connection issues. I might hop back into random servers since I have both bounties and mercs unlocked, intimidation ftw"

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,This post took me on an emotional roller-coaster that I was not ready for.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,There's a little bit of Trevor in all of us. (I apologize for that mental image)
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"The problem i have is , if you don't shoot , you get shot.. I'd like to do some mission with my crew, in a public server but we always endup defending ourselves and not actually gaining money. The map should actually hide players from one another , that way it would not be a race to the next victim at least!"
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I'd agree we all are predominately Trevors. That being said I had an interesting thing happen, this guy kills me so of course I seek revenge. This pointless circle of vengeance goes on 4 or 5 more times till we both decide its getting us nowhere, and go on a liquor store robbery spree, splitting the cash 50/50 and making decent money. So we are all Trevors but we don't have to constantly murder each other, Trevor has friends too ya know."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"People are jack asses online. I found a patriot last night. Went to the LS Customs to get a nice looking vehicle. Just before I open up the garage door this dude just hops out from behind the building, shoots me in the head then continued to blow up the patriot and just drive away. No idea who he was either. Just a random guy needing his fix for killing. "
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,This is the most annoying but sometimes fun aspect of online. Most of the time I want to be left alone but some ass hat comes along and kills me. What's the fucking point?
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I was extremely disappointed in the online mode. But honestly, I don't know what I was expecting."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,They should take the DayZ approach. Yes most people kill each other but there is great reward for working together.

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"With GTA Online, I'll do my best to avoid killing people for no reason, the cash reward isn't worth going to the effort of killing someone and potentially dying. But the second somebody kills me, that's it, their username is etched into my brain and I do nothing else but hunt that person down. If I kill them, I simply go to where there spawn and kill them again. I rinse and repeat this until I get bored or they get annoyed enough to leave. Sadly, since everyone is a murdering asshole who shoots anything that moves, I can't have vendettas against several people at once..."

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I was going to rob the gas station in Sandy Shores. I went in, and looked around for the ATM. Just them, another player runs in, shoots the clerk three times, takes the money from the register, and runs out. I got three stars, you bastard! I didn't even do anything. I could've been a witness if the police wouldn't have shot at me. "

I planned just to take him back into Los Santos. On the way I spotted a convenience store open for robbing, so I of course pull up to the side of the store and get out of the vehicle. I put on my mask, and we both walk in to the store. I immediately take out the cashier and start taking the cash, wasn't much, only about 1300. Once I'm done taking the cash I look up and my new buddy is gone, so I run outside assuming he's waiting in the getaway car. Motherfucker stole the Infernus, and left me with no vehicles in sight and a three star wanted level. I still gave him his cut, but I thought we really had something there..."

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,Worst ending to a date. Ever 
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I think you and I share a lot in common. I too try to exploit the less obvious opportunities in online multiplayer gaming.

I think it was COD where there was a map where the single choke point in a small village was the underpass below a stone bridge. After a few rounds that ended up in stalemates I pulled out my sidearm and found a team member and pistol whipped him with it. Team damage was off so no really harm was being done.  Seemingly aggravated, he pistol whipped me back. I paused for a moment as he stared at me and then whacked him over the head again. And thus it went for the next few minutes, he and I standing there beating each other over the head with absolutely no consequence. 

Meanwhile team members would run past us on their way from the spawn point back to the chokepoint at the front line. Eventually one ran passed us around the corner and came sauntering back to look at us.

 Then another team member stopped to join him then another and another. Eventually members of the growing crowd of spectators slowly turned into participants until we had pretty much the whole team standing in a big group smashing each other over the heads.
With the choke point now abandoned the other team invaded our territory. But they didn’t mow us down in a hail of machine gun fire. They just stood and watched us for a while mindlessly beating ourselves over the head. Then one of them pulled out his pistol and whacked a teammate. Then another then another.

Eventually someone got board and blood was let. At least it wasn’t at the bridge.

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"About the helicopter part, I was playing a while ago and found some helicopter spawns just like you did. I found a guy driving around, landed in front of him and eventually he got in. I joined his party and we spent the whole night flying around the map robbing stores and jacking things from the military bases. There are still decent people out there!"
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Players in that game can be jerks. I had stolen my motorcycle back from the impound and was running from the police, when I misjudged a turn down an alley and drove into a dumpster and flew over the handlebars. Another player witnessed it and jumped on my bike and took off while the police killed me.  
Jokes on him though. I had tracking on that bike and found him hiding from the police in a cargo container. I killed him and took my bike back, and drove off into ~~the sunset~~ another dumpster."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Good guy me:

- Snipe wanted players (This is by far the most fun, staked out on a roof waiting, pressed against the wall) No autoaim on snipe = rewarding

- Driving dangerously with my bike, shaking off all the cunts in their stolen coupes

- Popping wheelies next to guys from my most recent job, where we don't blast eachother in free roam



Scumbag me:

- Shoot out tires while someone else is robbing a store, have fun with that getaway

- Snipe players without a bounty

- Snipe players running from police

- Steal player cars and beat them within an inch of their life without totalling them (more expensive to repair).

- Grenade the 8 year olds who constantly spam the mic with ""let's go to the military base""

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,I've never despised someone so much for such a stupid reason.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,I thoroughly enjoyed that story.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,I played a passive game of online last night. Only shooting back at people who had serial killed me... usually too dumb to notice me crouched behind a wall. Didn't take long for those folks to end up in a different session with other assholes. Ended up with four or five friendly folks.  
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I wish I had known you could kick people. Last night I played online for the  first time and had some jackass follow me around and kill me every chance they could. It was ridiculous. They were like a level 50 or something, so they had a bunch of guns that I didn't have access to. A pistol is no mach for an SMG. I could barely get two shots off before I was dead. I would have kicked that person the third time they tracked me down and killed me, if I had known you could do that. I'll definitely be kicking anyone that does something like that next time."

History of the world, basically!"
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,It's like GTA 4 multiplayer all over. Free roam was exactly the same. Kill on sight.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,I've seen many player on here talk about how they don't shoot people on site....I've just never met any of them online yet.  Everyone shoots me immediately and I've never even provoked one person. I find it hilarious none the less
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,you know theres a passive mode right? 
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,I came across two people under a bridge trying to escape the cops. I pulled my car up to the bridge and waited for them to help them escape. I helped them all right. Right after they killed me and stole my car.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Yeah, I hate online multiplayer in most games. Genuinely very few people I find it fun to play with.

Besides, if I want to go on an indiscriminate non-competitive killing rampage in a GTA game, I'll play offline. Online it's a lot more fun to creatively fuck with people."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,Brilliant
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,">So I take my new friend/guest/hostage around the map with me to all the cool places I've found. I show them how to rob liquor stores super easy and escape from the cops in my helicopter. I take him to the top of a mountain, to some construction sites, to the wind turbine farm, to the amusement park, we go all over and he genuinely seems to enjoy the experiences. At each stop, he gets out and politely looks around, as if in appreciation, and then gets back in the chopper with me. No words are exchanged at all since neither of us has a microphone, but nothing needs to be said.

Sounds like a lovely man-date."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Man, I'll never forget the first time I died in GTA V online. Shot in the back by my ""partners"" coming out of the very first mission. I respawned with only my pistol left, and decided I should get a car. Nope, shot dead doing that too. I ran from the players, they hunted me until I was a sniveling wreck on the roof, then put a bullet into me and stole my car. When I respawned again, players were already trying to kill me. I had had enough, I wasn't having any fun. I couldn't get enough money to get a hat because I had died so many times, the game wouldnt let me progress. I had had enough, and stole a large SUV. I was going to make those bastards pay.

Eventually, I ran them all over. I collected my money back and got myself a nice little truker cap. When it came time to buy new weapons, I got my very first sawed-off kill on one of my partners from a car mission. I realized I had come full circle, and turned into the very thing I hated.

GTA V Online is the best thing I have ever played."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Wow that's hilarious I really hope I run into you haha. But I did somewhat the same the first time I played I wanted to get a feel for the atmosphere. I got killed by every single person, it's pretty clear that everyone's out to kill you and with that settled I love it. Any one I see ill kill and no matter how little I get I feel satisfaction. But now I just steal cars I like that rush."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"This is not really a GTA thing. Same thing happened in Day Z. Initially, many people tried to play nice, then got sick of getting shot by people who may or may not have announced to be friendly and eventually everything devolved into a free for all. The thing is you don't want to risk getting shot yet again and a simple way of achieving that is shooting the other guy first. It's as simple as that."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I have *never* killed anybody that did not assault me first. I have also done what you did, try to pick people up in a Helicopter. I used a mic and had about a +50% success rate. Although I do get killed a lot after missions and when I'm just silently free roaming. I don't understand people sometimes."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I go on passive mode most of the time. I hate how gta online is like call of duty, and people kill each other on sight. No reason, little money, everything OP said. I do missions and partakr in group stuff, but other than that I stay on passive mode. "
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Most evil thing I've found to do so far is get in a Cargobob and wait until someone goes into a Los Santos Customs. Get a friend to go in and out so you can see where the car spawns when someone exits and position your Cargobob above it ready to pick them up as soon as they come out. As soon as they come out attach the hook to their car and fly off. Now you have a few options: 

1) Just drop their car out of the sky. A bit boring, and it can destroy their car which isn't very nice for them, though if they rotate it so it lands on the wheels it should be fine.

2) Fly them all the way up to the top of the maze bank and then drop them, leaving them stranded with the only way down being to drive/jump off.

3) Fly them all the way over to the top of Mount Chillead. Takes ages 'cause the Cargobob isn't very fast, and they can just shoot at you if they're actually pissed so you might not get there, but it's more of an inconvenience."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"i don't like to kill people untill someone puts a bounty on my head, then it's game on bitch!"

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I find it immensely rewarding when I go up to people, and we just goof around. I was playing the other night, and there were two British guys doing something with a car at a LSC (Los Santos Customs). So I drove up to them, and started doing burnouts in my Jeep. Pretty soon one of them caught on that I was friendly, got in his car, and started doing burnouts with me. Then his friend finished with the LSC, and we started doing missions and other things together. At the end of the day, I got a friend request from the both of them. 

It's pretty nice when people arn't douchebags."

No one has popped me yet in the process, and almost everyone has gotten in the chopper without any prompting, like they just understand the peaceful intentions. Actually have made a few friends doing this, and its a lot of fun"

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"It's so sad that you can't trust anybody at all in some cases. Finished a nice successful cooperative mission with two other people. We got our payout and voted to drop into freemode (I guess I should have selected to quit instead). Spawned next to one of my recent mission-mates and started walking towards my car. Shot down instantly by the guy and he grabs his $100 off my corpse. Leaves the match as I catch up to him shooting him while he tries to drive away.

It is way too easy to grieve people in this game. Solo and friend only sessions are the only way to enjoy freemode unless you enjoy playing with unsporting dickheads."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,Stupid question but if you have the Xbocx 360 do you need an Xbox GOLD account to sign on or is it free through Rockstar?

Also at some point you realized you aren't homosexual. Unless you are, in which case ignore that last part."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"while reading this i somehow knew that either this mystery person was going to kill you, or you were going to kill him. But anyway, yeah. We're all monsters. We like to feel on top and all powerful. And to think normal life is filled with Trevors too...the only thing stopping them is criminal punishment. but honestly, if i could get away with shooting down helicopters with RPGs and poppin' caps in the back of civilians' heads during drive bys, would I? would you? maybe..i just might "
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Last night I was robbing a store and didn't pay attention to my star rating. A million cops come at me and I couldn't escape in time. So. Impounded car. I go to get my car, and some ass hole on passive mode steals my car from impound. I quickly jump in before he speeds off, figuring I could wait him out maybe. He finally stops, I get in the drivers seat, and before I can speed off he jumps in. I decided to go get my car repaired hoping it will kick him or at least he'll get bored. Nope. On top of that, I randomized my character and it came out girl, and I just left it. Anyways, this guy starts hitting on her. I sent him a message saying get out. He did not comply. 

Finally I decide the only way to get rid of him is to wreck my car. I start driving down the dock at full speed, intent on driving off the dock. He sees what I'm doing and bales. So I backed up and shot out of  there. 

Even then, I saw his blip trying to catch up with me again. That's the point I decided to log out for the night. "

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,This post and what I'm reading in general about GTA 5 online is proof that language and not anything else is what is responsible for everything we have in human society.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I'm having the same problem in standard races. When the race starts, everyone slams into eachother as soon as possible, and the race turns into a contest of who can cause other players to spin out or crash into stuff the most.

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I feel like it's less a comment on gamers, or society, or games in general, and more a comment on GTA Online itself. It's not that we're all Trevor, but it's just that GTA Online doesn't effectively support gameplay that isn't Trevor. Not everyone looking for a Michael experience becomes Trevor; sometimes they just stop playing, or look this up and don't even start playing at all. "
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,That's why I immediately turn on passive mode in free roam if I just want to get shit done. It costs a mere $100 and no one can shoot you.. completely worth it.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,some people read books.  i like to think i make my own stories when i play massively multi-player online games.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I'm helpful, but from a distance. If your in a car chase with the cops, i'll make a road block behind you. If your running from the cops, I'll shoot them from somewhere where you can't shoot at me. If you have another player after you, i'll try to take them out(unless I feel you deserve it). BUT I'll never come close to you. I haven't randomly killed a player yet, only revenge kills and self defense. "
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,Note to self: Never trust anyone who's played GTA5 online.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"First time I played I walked out of the intro mission to be blasted on sight by some asshole who was just camping it for all the new players. After it gave me the message about passive mode, I turned it on and went back. He tried killing me and I just stood there while he rampaged. Finally he lost interest and started walking down the ally. I turned off passive mode and shot him in the back of the head. He should've kept his car closer instead of letting me have the 10 second cooldown when he ran over to it. He didn't learn though as I did this twice more before he logged off."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I seem to be one of the few who are different. I try and avoid other players. When I have approached it is usually trying to just interact without violence but I usually get shot for my troubles.

I take offense to this, shoot the other guy, and take his car around for a bit before getting killed. I respawn and head back to the impound lot, only to find the other guy there waiting for me. He tries to invite me to a party on XBox Live, whatever that means. I ignore it and get back to trying to break into the lot. He's still standing around, and then I get a message asking me if I'm trying to get inside the impound lot. I don't know how to respond (I don't use Live much) so  I punch him in the face instead, at which point we are both killed by the security cop. Fun times.. Still haven't gotten that car out."

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"After a while the glamour of running around like a terminator on the fritz will wear off, and the game will be more interesting."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I don't think everyone's a Trevor, I think by now everyone knows that the other is going to kill them so what do you do?  Do you risk getting shot or do you just take the other guy out first?  Granted people will camp it up but you can generally tell when someone is coming after your or not.  Plus, why don't you turn on Passive Mode?"
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,I finally was just able to access GTA Online and I got kicked.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I think it's more accurate to say that everyone in GTA is Claude Speed (the GTA III protag). Silent, unpredictable, sociopathic, and willing to do whatever the mission-giver demands for petty cash. Most of the people I've met in freeroam have been pretty neighborly, though!"
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Trevor is a psychopath.   My character is not. 

I play a fun loving chick who happens to also be a crew boss.  She loves fast cars and bikes and is an avid street racer.  

She has no issues with other people or the business they go about.  She's happy to lend a hand and gun to someone undertaking a mission.

When she's approached, she doesnt shoot first.   But like you said, most people do shot first.  She seems to usually have the last shot.  

She's never been run over by Trevors, dispite numerous tries.  Usually it's resolved with one shot gun blast which also nets her a $100 and some PoS car.

She's always looking for people to team up with and make money though.  If you want to do that, then we'll have fun.  If you want to start a war, then she'll end it.

I find it way more fun to collaborate and be helpful, but like you said, most people are psychopaths.   That's fine.  I'm always ready to defend myself.

P.S. to the OP.  You are a Trevor.  Even worse as you act a friend and turn on them.  Maybe that's worse than trevor.  At least you know with him, what you see is what you get.

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I don't mind the killing every once in awhile but it's gotten so bad that I am constantly aware of where all the other players are because I know if I'm anywhere near them, they will kill me. I went to Ammunation the other day and I was of the understanding that you could go in those stores and not be shot....I was wrong. In the middle of buying a new gun and ammo, some dude comes in and lights me up and then drives away. Another game I was in, some douches in a helicopter just kept following me around and shooting me. I was fairly low level at the time and I only had a pistol. Every time I respawned, they'd fly in, hover above me and fire at me. I rage quit after my 4th death."

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I enjoy playing as Trevor, mostly because his character fits the way most people play GTA. I mean it doesn't seem that much like Niko, CJ, Michael, or Franklin to go out and steal a plane and go around blowing up cars and people for no reason, but Trevor is exactly the kind of guy who is insane enough to do shit like that. Trevor doesn't really care that much whether he lives or dies, and most of us play all the characters like that, but it seems normal with Trevor. For instance, Niko was a violent criminal, but he's not really the type to blow up a group of strangers with a rocket launcher for no apparent reason. Trevor would. "
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,Who is Trevor?

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,I was thinking that games like GTA V would be a great way to see how people view morality in virtual worlds compared to the real world.  Like you said theres so many non violent ways to interact with the game but most people still choose violence even though there is no real reward or incentive for it

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"That was brilliant. I started reading it in a Trevor voice, changed to Michael, and then switched back to Trevor when you shot the poor guy off the skyscraper."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,That was great. It's just too fun sometimes to kill people. Especially if they are people you don't know.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"To be completely honest I genuinely enjoy hunting players down occasionally.

However, usually, I try to play as ""a Michael.""

Last night I was playing and this douche with a pretty nice car was owning the shit out of me for no reason. You respawn way too close to get away without a car, which can happen very easily up north in the map.

...So I stole his car. He kicked me out when I got about 10 miles away. So I said Fuck You and burned his car to the fucking ground.
Apparently this makes me a bad sport.

Another time I decided that I wanted to hunt someone down and just screw with them with minimal violence. doing my user taunt and sneaking repeatedly behind them. They ended up killing me with a helicopter... So I took it out. and then them out. It was glorious and according to how they were acting on voice chat they loved it.

To find them I listened to three people robbing a store and tracked them down. Watched them drive around and come to a stop near a store... put a marker, snuck up and had my fun. Hunting people down is easily my second favorite part of the game."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Most of the free-roam online has just been kill or be killed but one moment I drove next to one guy and we drove around for a bit honking to each other as a means of communication. 

It was like Grand Theft Auto: Journey."

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"This right here. I just want to make money and get sick bikes/cars. If you fucking kill me, I will either come after you and kill your over and over or put a 10-15k bounty on your head so the entire lobby will be after you for the next 45minutes. Don't kill me and I won't kill you, simple as that."

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"The second time ever I got online, I spawned near a guy who was in the middle of what seemed like a 3 star cop chase with choppers and everything. And I actually rolled up to him and honked at him to tell him to get in... except I forgot I had my car access set to ""Friends + Crew"", and this dude was a total stranger, so after trying to get in two or three times and not being able to, dude ran away, but by then the chopper had shot him so many times, that he barely made it 10 feet out before he died. 

I felt bad... so I went about doing my thing, until I saw him on my map again, this time with my car access set to everyone, and this time he got in. For the next hour or so, we just went around switching between me and him being the driver, robbing stores, although this one time he shot the owner of the store which led to a three or four star cop chase and I had to go underneath into the railway tunnel to get rid of them(where I actually learned that unlike GTA: SA, the train actually stops if it's behind you and doesn't just roll along pushing you). 

And after about four successful store-robberies and getaways, I went into the menu to commend him... and the game froze. I couldn't find the dude on my Players Met list on the PS3 interface either to add him as a friend. 

My point is, not everyone is a Trevor. It sure is fun to be Trevor once in a while, but like you said, I like to think of myself as a Franklin. "

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,The other day after getting killed online 10 times for no reason and losing nearly ten thousand dollars I went back to the story mode I got spawned as Trevor. Those few minutes I spent with my scooter buddy were great.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Dammit, I've never had a scooter buddy switch and I really want one."

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I like doing this too, usually you can steal a cop car or van and chase people around in that in freeroam, that's pretty fun too, sirens blaring. Another great way to troll people is to fly the helicopter over the military base and get 4 or 5 stars and then start chasing the other players in your helicopter with the cops chasing you, they'll get swarmed by cops."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I was doing something similar this morning. I stole a helicopter and I would find police chases and then land/crash land, wait for them to get in, and then fly away feeling like a hero. But I did that to one one person and as soon as nobody was looking he tried to shoot me and I wasn't having any of that shit, so I shot him in his fucking ungrateful mouth."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I like to get the jet and kill the police when someone is wanted, personally I think it might help until the police are next to the criminal and he dies too."

I wouldn't ordinarily mind getting kicked by some dweeb who can't take what he tries to dish out, but getting kicked sends you back to single player!

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,Someone kicked be because they were chasing me and couldn't catch up.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,The only solution for a proper sociopath is to bomb their personal car before they have a chance to kick.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Similar experience, I was driving on some country roads, looking for random things that the game designer might have hidden around the country side.  I get out of my car to explore, then out of no where a guy and his hummer start trashing my car. He is doing jumps on to it, at first its funny, but then it is annoying. I pull out my pistol and start firing at him, then he tries to run me over. I dodge it and get in my half-destroyed car and take off as he persues me. I get some distance, stop my car, and wait for him. He ignores me and keeps on going, and steals an RV. So hes left his hummer, so i get out and start shooting the tires with my pistol until they go flat. Then suddenly, kicked.  I don't know about this online mode yet."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I finally got to actually play yesterday when my initial race mission un-fucked itself. Race was fun and my group and I continue on and do the first drug mission together and everything is going great. I'm happy and having fun. 

We go to drop off the dope and get the mission to head to the clothing shop and along the way I see this white car that's been beat to shit coming towards us, bumpers missing, windows shattered, scrapes and dents everywhere. My driver doesn't see it and me without a mic am unable to warn him as this guy whips a shitty behind us and comes barreling towards our little hoopty. 

My driver finally notices and picks up some speed and skillfully pulls into the clothing shop parking lot where he gets out and just kinda.. stands there, white-demolition-derby-wannabe slams into a telephone pole at the entrance to the parking lot while our other passenger gets out and makes a mad dash for the store. I get out and immediately hunker down behind the car when I hear the first shots and my teammate running for the door goes down in a shower of smg bullets. Psycho-Shitnozzle turns his gun on my driver and I barely have time to drill two pistol rounds into his stupid fucking face. My driver is freaked so he jumps in the car and pulls off leaving me there and I take off for the store, get some message about it being closed so I go running to look for some wheels and realize our would be murderers piece of shit is still wedged up against a telephone pole. I take it and drive off only to find him down the road in the process of jacking some poor innocents car. As I'm driving by he opens fire on me so I stop, whip the car around so I have cover, get out and shoot him in the face again. The *dick.*

A notification pops up that one of my teammates has left, then psycho-douche drops from the game and I shrug it off before hopping back into my hijacked POS and try to return to the clothing store. Along the way this obviously modded Mustang pulls a U and starts following me. Suspecting ~~fowl~~ foul (Thanks /u/Zenodice) play I drive as quickly as I can but realize I wont be getting away any time soon. So I head deeper into the city where I can get away from him using my cornering skills. Works at first but on the straightaways he catches back up. Along the way I manage to slip into an alley and lose him for a moment, seeing my chance to make it to the clothing store and safety I beeline for it, checking my rearview for any sign of the menacing orange 'Stang. 

Crossing the bridge and almost there I see him rocketing up behind me, desperate to believe I have enough time I jump the fucking curb and bail into the parking lot amidst the sound of crunching metal and shattering glass, struggling to my feet I start to make for the door and quickly check behind me only to see the orange 'Stang stopped in the middle of the bridge, parked at an odd angle. 

""Hah motherfu---!"" 

My exuberance was cut short when I realized why he had stopped. 

""You have been kicked from the session.""

""--cker! God*dammit*."""
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I think the game has some serious issues.. Kicking being one of them..

on a storyline that has more of an emphasis on action and excitement. The way I see it, each character each character is modelled for different players:

•Michael caters for those that want a great, compelling and somewhat relevant storyline whilst also experiencing some action.

•Franklin, I would say, appeals to those who got into the series because of San Andreas; both the location and situation Franklin is in feels similar but not totally similar to CJ.

•Trevor, however, as mentioned above appeals to the player that plays for the rampages, murder sprees and chaos that they can create."

I'm sure I used to be a madman in these games (and to be fair, 28 is hardly sane) but in GTA4 and 5 I actually go out of my way to avoid running over people or gunning down random people. Not sure why, other than I'm older and find it less funny to do. It seems that when I want to go nuts I'm more into finding a fast car and racing the country side and doing stunts in planes.

I also usually call the paramedics when I do run over someone. Not sure what it says about me. Probably that I'm Michael? A crook to the bone who has convinced himself he should be better than that.

I  circled a few times and then came low over street in front of them, I had a mic on but decided not to say anything just to see what they would do.

The passenger realizes I'm not a NPC and starts freaking out, telling driver to turn car so he can shoot me. The driver tells him to calm down and that I don't look like I'm going to do anything. I could have just throttled forward a little and chopped up their car the the rotor blades. The guy is still freaking out so finally I start talking tell them I'm just randomly flying around watching people, trying to get flying skill up some. 

As soon as I finish saying all this an explosion rings out and the car goes up in a ball of flame and smoke. I immediately back off and get some altitude, telling the driver that wasn't me and asking him if he saw where it came from, assuming it was an RPG that took him out. Come to find out it was the nervous passenger, he had dropped a grenade accidentally while trying to fire his gun, thinking he had his SMG equippped. So in the middle of this civilized conversation with the driver, the passenger was looking to murder me and liekly take my helicopter only to kill himself and him helpful driver friend in the process.

Ah humanity."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,There needs to be a mechanic that allows a you to see if a player has a weapon drawn from a distance. Maybe color code their username.

Saw someone on foot wandering on the side of a mountain, far way from the road. I hovered way above in my chopper and texted ""need a lift?"" 

He replied ""ya"" so I flew him into town to the helipad and off he went. I have done the same with people in police chases and robbing stores. I love being helocopter-bro."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,This is exactly what is going on.  The fear of a stiff death penalty is causing players to be on the offensive all the time.  Play GTA4 free roam for comparison.  I can't help but feel Rockstar's desire to sell GTA $ via micro transactions is ultimately to blame for the decision to impose a stiff $2k death penalty and the resulting player demeanor.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"The problem with a no-kill mode is that killing people and knowing that you can be killed by people can be fun, if it is happening sparingly.

Its like swearing. Adding the odd ""fuck"" or ""shit"" to a sentence gives it more impact or humor. Running around constantly shouting ""fuck fuck fuck shit cock gobbling fuck nipple shit wank fuckety fuck fuck nugget"" is just annoying."

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-11,"Exactly, people are so goddamn sensitive in free roam. The other day i slowed down while driving around aimlessly to check out a parked infernus to see if it had either just spawned or it belonged to some one. So then a guy pops out from around a corner of a building (i guess he had just respawned) and lights up my car. I tried to speed away but i was in a convertible and he got a good shot on me and killed me. So then i try to get back to my car when i respawn and he proceeds to throw satchel charges in front of my car, without me realizing it and i get blown to timbuktu. Then i respawn again and he is hunting me down (with his buddy now) and killing me over and over again. I finally lost him because i put a 5000$ bounty on his head and everyone and their mother were heading to him to claim it. All that from slowing down to check out his car. So that day I learned to not play free roam public games or at least play in passive mode online."

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Amen.

I like the Borderlands system, where I can play offline and then with friends and not have to completely restart everything each time. 

I don't want to endure a game where people either hoard all the resources, take all the best guys and never use some, take the health pack when they are at 92% and everyone else is at 54% or anything else like that.  

Every game with online multi-player should be required to allow at least 2 person ""couch"" co-op. "
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"It's a game dude.  Take a prozac and chill out.  If you don't want to get murked, then start a solo session, friends only or watch your ass on the mini-map.  

Granted, sometimes it can be excessive, but its not like its that hard to just respawn and drive away from the fight.  I seriously think your selling the community a bit short.  I've only been playing GTA online since the launch, I haven't touched another game.  I've met plenty of cool people, started a crew and had an insane amount of fun already, and some of that even includes random people attempting to kill me and either defending myself or being killed (and vice versa).  How lame would it be if everyone just ""played nice"" all the time?  It can be a bit frustrating, but you're taking this way too hard."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"My first priority is to kill whiny punks like you.

When I played WoW people complained all day about trying to do quests, but getting killed or camped by the opposing faction.. My question: Then why did you join a PvP server moron?

Fact of the matter:  It's part of the game.  If the devs really didn't want other players killing you, they wouldn't be be able to.  If you don't like the chaos, play candy crush or cake factory."

After that I wanted to switch from a scooter to a real car, so I walked up to where he laid in the road,  where cars had backed up, intending to steal something.

But when I got close to his body, mangled, bloody, lifeless, and half crushed under his scooter, I realized that I wasn't his scooter buddy, I wasn't anyones scooter buddy, I was a scooter monster."

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Thanks. I got the idea from playing the mission where you have to repo and return 2 cars. The guy I partnered with took the sports car and left me with the shitty sedan. I was pissed until I realized he drew all the heat. I lost the cops pretty quickly, returned the car, and he was still being pursued. So I nicked the Weasel News van and helped out. My partner pulled into a garage and I blocked the entrance behind him. As he exited the rear, the cops started slamming into my van.

Awesomely, I got no stars for hindering their progress, my partner escaped successfully, and a legend was born.

My favorite part is that neither of us had a mic, so it was entirely improvisation. Sadly, I did not catch the gentleman's gamer tag..."

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"The switch between single and online is the stupidest system i've ever seen, why couldn't they take you to a multiplayer menu or something?"
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,Interesting...I have yet be kicked and I have done my fair share of despicable things. I also usually meet a couple of players per session who are cool and aren't trying to murder me for a few measly dollars. I think its just about how you approach players. If they can see my blip rapidly approaching theirs then they will probably start shooting out of pure fear but if im walking with no weapons drawn or slowly pull up to someone they will usually hang out with me and rob liquor stores/do missions with me. Side note: you can race by yourself and get first place every time which makes it incredibly easy to unlock certain car upgrades.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"After you put a bounty on them, you can go to your house and watch them on TV, focus the channel on them and watch while all the other players go after them and try to kill him, while you watch on from the safety of your apartment.  I spent like 70K on bounties last night and just watching the people get murked from my TV.  It was pretty entertaining."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,How does it work exactly? There was a guy in a lobby that was being a general douche and a friend and I were getting tired of him so we both choose to boot him but nothing happened.

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,The best 5k ive ever spent in that game was on an ignition bomb. To see my car go up with that asshole inside was priceless.
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Some one killed me for no reason (as you do) and stole my car. He then proceeded to leave it somewhere, blocking traffic. I couldn't get to him, so I decided to just get my car and leave. Upon entry, my car exploded and the guy laughed his ass off, rabbled something in some foreign language and continued to spawn kill me. After about 5 minutes, I got fed up and spent my hard earned $20,000 on a bounty on his head. It was almost everything I had. It was worth it to see all 14 other players immediately come chase him down in all-out warfare just to be the one to kill him."
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,I held a cooked grenade in front of someone in their locked car.

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"Just had to let you know I enjoyed reading that story, it had a nice suspenseful element to it.

Oh, and to add to the conversation topic, last night I found out you could climb a ladder to the top of a Los Santos customs. I'm just exploring up there when I see a car full of people pull up. I try to hide since I'm a fairly peaceful player, but they know I'm up there because of my blip.

They start driving circles around the lsc to figure out how I got up when finally one sees the ladder and starts climbing. He gets up to the roof and immediately opens fire, to which I just start running because if I stop I'm dead for sure.

I run for the lower side of the roof hoping I can survive the jump and escape, unfortunately for me the driver had been busy during the time his friend was climbing the ladder. He had managed to park on the overpass near the lsc and let me know where he was by emptying an smg clip into me.

I'm still not sure if they were just being Trevors, or if they thought I was hanging around the lsc waiting to ambush people and were just making a preemptive strike."

I would like to think that the ensuing rampage which consumed over 5.5k rounds of gatling gun ammunition would have made my scooter buddy proud.

Edit: I should clarify that I'm getting this from [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/GrandTheftAutoV/comments/1nmiba/psa_kicking_doesnt_require_votes_anyone_can_kick/), [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/GrandTheftAutoV/comments/1nt4en/kick_by_other_players_constantly/), and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/GrandTheftAutoV/comments/1npdh9/great_so_this_kick_option_has_utterly_destroyed/) to name a few places. And there's a lot of comments about it in various other threads.  

Edit 2: I've been told that Rockstar might be using the kicked screen on connection drops. So, there's that...  

Edit 3...: So, a lot of people are saying there *is* a voting system. Either there used to be no voting system and it was patched, or a bunch of people have been lying about being kicked all the time, or a kicked screen pops up when you lose connection. The way GTA:Online has been for the last week leads me to believe any one of these could be true. Or all 3 could be true."

After a while I got a message along the lines of ""Warning: other players have started a vote kick against you.""
But nothing happened, I kept killing them too. They left themselves eventually. I guess I'm a Trevor."

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-09,"fucking love passive mode. I wish you couldn't get run over by other players, but oh well. I was by the Mod Shop below the bridge, and this other guy cruises down the road straight at me (I was standing in the open). I run to the side, and he collides with the pillar. He gets out, points his gun at me, and tries to shoot. I slowly walk up, as he shoots beside me in vain, and when I get as close as I can get to him, he hops in his car and drives off. 

A little while later, I was on a chopper-robbing spree, and had passive mode off. In the middle of the robbery he and a friend shoot me from behind. I respawn, run to my chopper, and am shot again. Fine. Respawn. As they are entering my chopper, they shoot me again.

They had stopped at the other side of the city for something, and weren't moving. So I floor it over there as fast as I can and find one standing on the ground, and the other entering the chopper. I promptly run over the first one, and shoot his friend as he tries to escape, causing the chopper to crash upon the newly respawned dick #1. Then I hopped in my car and enjoyed a frantic escape from those 2 and another 2 of their friends. And damn did it feel satisfying using driving skills to not only escape, but kill that guy on the motorbike a few times as well.

Oh, and all of these people were in my crew."

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I wonder if it is a mixture of both age and the realism. I've been playing gta since I got the demo for the first one on a PC Gamer CD, and I never remember having such a problem with killing people in the other games as I do now with V. I even headshot stun-gunned the merc who was holding Michael's daughter hostage. (It was funny to see how grossed out she was by that in the cutscene.)

Has anyone else noticed that there is also much less cop-killing in the missions? The big bad in this game are the highly paid mercs. In the last heist, one of the characters even says to take it easy on the cops because they're just cops. It feels like the action in Terminator 2 where nobody really dies.

I also wonder if some of it has to do with the general happy mood in the game. Everything just seems so pleasant. It's not about simple ride-or-die gang banging.

"
1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"I don't do it because inevitably it leads to death and I'm too fiscally conservative to watch 5000 go down the drain every time I respawn from the hospital.

1nzo1y,2013-10-08,2013-10-08,"This guy is way too chill. In reality it goes more like this:

You find some nice gear, a rifle, food and maybe a shitty bicycle and think ""hey I'm set!"" And start heading into the mountains, a few miles later you figure you should try out that new weapon you found, you find a rabbit and shoot it. Rabbits are weak though, right? So you find a cow and shoot it. At this point you kinda want to shoot something that can resist and fight back. A zombie? A player? Suddenly you hear an engine sound in the distance, your pupils narrow, you freeze and your heart-rate goes up. 

This is the moment, now or never. Just 1 shot. A test, just a test...

You turn around and start cycling like crazy, nearly hitting a tree and killing yourself. The engine sound becomes louder and you see a bright blue old Volga driving over a dirt road. You quickly think up an intercept course and head there, park your bicycle behind a tree and wait. 

...you wait.

Finally the car is in sight, you reload to make sure you have a full clip ready to fire, and aim down your sights. You wait until you can be *one hundred percent sure* that you will hit target. Missing might end up real bad.

Car approaches and you see a guy in a cap right inbetween your ironsights. At this point you're not even breathing. Your eyes probably haven't blinked in a full 10 minutes.

You hear a shot. A single shot. Without even thinking you pressed that button and someone is dead. Your heart is racing, you're breathing heavily. You slowly crawl towards the vehicle. In the distance you hear zombies screaming because of the gunfire, you have to hurry up.

You approach the dead player and take his loot. An automatic rifle, plenty of food, and some backup supplies and ammo inside the car. You hit the jackpot!  You come up with excuses such as ""if he'd seen me before I saw him he would have dropped me for sure!"".

You're not sure wether to feel bad or happy. You can retire and live in the mountains forever, right? No. You just killed someone. It felt good. You feel good.

You tasted blood and you need more. You have become the hunter. "

Standalone (Dayz actually started as a mod for Arma 2) game is coming out soon(tm).

I haven't been following it very closely for a while so I don't really know about release. I think it's going to cost 15 usd?

Check out some videos and stuff to see if you like it :)

By the way, don't get scared off by graphics or some bugs and boringness. There are times where I was lying in a forest for 2 and a half fucking real time hours, waiting with my buddies for the owner of that group of tents to come back and kill them. But it's all worth it when you start to breathe again 50 seconds after enemy contact and unloading 2 kalashnikov magazines.

Or chilling out with a guy you just met in a store and suddenly hear a cough (you can get sick ingame and cough an shit) behind the wall. All goes quiet and hearts start racing. You and your friend know exactly what to do. But your enemy also heard the sudden silence ;)

OR that time when I joined a big organized group (I think two of them were actually in the army so they knew their shit). We actually used some crazy tactics, like faking a firefight to lure players, or scaring bigger groups by using more different weapons than there were people with us at that moment so the enemy thought there was 8-9 of us, while in reality it was 4 versus 6 of them or so.

Once we had 2 snipers set up on a hill in Stary Sobor ( a small city with a military camp with loot) and whilst we were looting 3 guys were approaching town. One scout quickly warned them to divert but they laughed and continued, thinking it was some guy bluffing. When one of our snipers shot a zombie in the head right in front of them they hid behind a building and we told them to look up the hill. All 5 of us, fully loaded in military gear, were standing on a hill pointing our guns at them. One of them said ""ok bye"" and they left in shame..

I have so much stories! Even though I quit playing like 8 months ago. Unfortunately from what I hear, players are way more aggressive now and often shoot on sight without even asking if the other is friendly or something."

[At this moment, Franklin gets a glimpse of who Trevor really is, and why exactly Michael turned on him in the first place. Trevor looks like a loyal friend, but the truth is that he is just a psychopath with abandonment issues. He *needs* people, but he has no respect for them.](/spoiler)"

Why would he do that? Because he legitimately cares about F. You can see it takes everything in him, but he keeps himself in check.](/spoiler)

[Also, if you hang out with F and T, F asks him why he didn't kill M. T says he doesn't know, but he had a family, and he realized he loves the guy. Trevor is a broken person with a fucked up view of the world, but there's people he legitimately cares about. Nobody fucked Trevor harder than Michael. Out of anyone int he game who he could've killed and had a good argument for it, it would've been Michael. But he doesn't.](/spoiler)"

Trevor keeps his rage in check... for now. I believe it was because Franklin did not rise to the threat. If Franklin had reacted, Trevor would not have thought twice about murdering him.](/spoiler)

[We've seen Trevor befriend and use people in the past and later murder them when they irritate him. He attracts a following of desperate losers whom he constantly abuses and uses. He manipulates them into believing he is their only friend. But Trevor is not a good friend. Trevor is exactly what Michael warned Franklin he was: the devil in the flesh.](/spoiler)

x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-10,Bioshock infinite and last of us were tied for my games of the generation
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,That >!giraffe!< blew my mind.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"I’m gonna be “one of those people,” TLoU2 was incredible as well. Easily one of the best games I’ve played. The gameplay is improved from the first, the voice acting and character models are excellent. They did everything that makes a good sequel and compelling characters. In addition, you get multiple perspectives and the world design lets you tackle scenarios how you want (in most cases - this was also great about the first one). Anyway, they’re both tremendous games, and no one should be discouraged to play the 2nd because of the random spew of hatred that ensued from Joel’s situation and female protagonists."

x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,Incredible multiplayer back in the day. Me and the boys spent tons of time in it. Good times
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,It doesn’t take much to get karma on this subreddit does it
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,wait until you play Uncharted 2!
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Favorite game behind TLOU2 🤗😁
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Now go for tlou 2
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"it's funny how social media and its echoe chamber world views changed how these games are perceived. the first one has an interracial lesbian relationship, and a town run by a gay man and, thankfully, no complaints from gamers. then some years later, after a certain hateful man gave stupid people a voice, all the crazies came out of the wood work and the second game comes out and all the incel conspiracy theorists start screeching and think there is a secret agenda being forced into their heads through the tinfoil lol. they're both fantastic games."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,My roommate let me borrow his PS4 because he said I absolutely had to play it after he finished it. 10/10 one of the best games I have ever played.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Just started! It’s pretty damn good
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Man I need to actually need buy this remake and play it again someday
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,That intro though!!  Right in the dad feels.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"100% yes! I love this game, both amazing gameplay and one hell of a story. First game in a long while that I would play literally every free moment I had until I finished it."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,I knew it would make my list when Joel fell in the University and I really thought he was gone. I was panicking and actually thought the snow section was an epilogue. And that it'd end with Ellie making it to Spring by herself and I would've been very happy if that was the end.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"When Last of Us first came out on PS3, I rented it at Redbox and played through the whole thing in two days. After I returned the game, I was still so captivated by the experience and couldn't stop thinking about it. So the next day, I went back to Redbox, rented it again, and played the whole game again. It was that good!"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Now play the second part while you still have all the memories from the first one.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,That fuckin scene. It really cemented an incredible feeling for me of how rich the world is in that game & how human Joel & Ellie felt at that moment.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Did the giraffe moment get you? It certainly got me. Beautiful stuff altogether. 

Or as Ellie perfectly puts it, ""so fucking cool!"""
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"One of my top 10 game of all time too. I've never been so emotionally invested in a game, ever. 

The sequel wasn't bad either, loved it !"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Now its on too the sequel.  Its also fucking fantastic.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,2nd one is just as good imo. Better gameplay.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Agreed. And I really hate that they made part 2. Not that it was a bad game or anything but part 1 was just a beautifully wrapped package with so much raw emotion. It ended perfectly and I didn’t need any more story than that.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,My girlfriend got me TLOU and a used PS3 when it came out. Blew my mind how the game and graphics were.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,One of the best games ever made.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,The hotel basement level was the most intense experience in the game. Anxiety overload.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"10/10


Now quit there and be happy as there is only the last of us there's not a 2nd game"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,4/10*
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Don’t get tlou 2. It’s just 24 hours of naughty dog giving you the finger. Keep the ambiguous happiness from tlou going
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,On to Part II !
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,"this is just a personal opinion, i would have prefered to not play last of us 2. You can take from that what you will."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,[deleted]
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Now you just need to not play the second part so you don’t ruin it for yourself
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Can't deny the view.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Might pick it up for a 3rd time when the price is right.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,DUDE THE GIRAFF SCENE. So goddamn good
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Oh yeah the university scene. Best part of the game.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,It was too scary/intense for me when I sporadically played it. I was roped upside down hanging and had to shoot all these things crawling at me. Did not enjoy.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Easily my favorite single player game of all time, nothing compares to the authenticity and unbelievable storytelling of this game"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,The remake is amazing and I love that they didn’t change hardly anything like they do in lots of remakes.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,One of the great games of all time
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,This game is incredible and factions is the best multiplayer mode of all time
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Think you should put a spoiler tag on this post.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Is it available on PC by any chance or is it still a PS exclusivity ?
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"The new next gen version of the game has even more stunning graphics, not like the remastered version was still beautiful"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,I want to like it sooo bad but I’m horrible at any part I’m forced to sneak through. Didn’t make it too far but I can tell it is amazing if I was better.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Can't wait for pc release so I can finally join this club.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Should we tell him?
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,youre gonna hate Part II lmao
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,Overated af
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Absolutely one of the best games I have ever played.

The sequel was one of the worst."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,Apparently you haven't played Days Gone
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"The last of us was great, which version did you play? The original, The upgraded version, the first remastered version, or the second remastered version, or the.. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD CAN WE MAKE NEW GAMES ALREADY !!!!"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,This game was awesome. Sadly it goes down hill after that.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,it truly is a masterpiece. Then part 2 happened.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"I felt the same way for a long time, and TLOU was one of my favorite narratives ever. But Part II soured the franchise so much for me that I don’t know if I can ever properly enjoy Part I again"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Lol Elden Ring is so much better
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,Too bad you went through the remake. Remaster/Original is better
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,"If you like this game, you should try movies"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"I think it's a pretty great game, but also very over-rated.

The best parts of TLOU1 could have been done in a movie. Nothing about the ""video-game"" nature really stands-out. It just plays like a less-fun version of Uncharted 2.

And even though the graphics, animation, and acting are all great, I don't ""love"" the story in the first half. It's too much ""gotta get Ellie over here - nevermind now we gotta get her here - nevermind now we gotta get her here"".

HOWEVER, once it hits ""Winter"", the rest of the game's story is absolutely fantastic."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,"Super unpopular opinion: TLOU is a mediocre game, buoyed up by above average storytelling. 5/10, imo, and Naughty Dog hasn't made a game I've enjoyed since Jak and Daxter for the PS2."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,One of my favorites as well. I'm sad because I have no desire to play the sequel.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-10,"Played it shortly after twd s1, the story was worse than twd s1 and the game play wasn’t good enough to make up for the story."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Now saddle up for part 2…
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,Cool
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Naaah am good , played it 4 time already , i will feel dum if i pay 70 dollars  for another reskin ."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Could have saved some coin and got remastered instead
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Why did you ""beat"" the game? Was it a competition?"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,Remaster's characters look better... has less bugs and glitches... and its $65 cheaper.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Should play part 2, it's like the first obviously but wayyyyyyy better. Bonus is you don't have to deal with annoying ass >!Joel!<"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Such an underrated indie gem
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,Yooo this exact moment is where I took my only screen shot in TLOU Remaster. It's been my PSN banner for the last 5 years
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Playthrough Plus!
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,This game and Death Stranding make me want to buy a PS5
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,No angel moroni? 0/10
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Imagine how I felt when I beat it in 2015 for the first time. Wish they would’ve brought back the multiplayer.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Someone, somewhere in this earth, has beaten TLOU on three different games."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Bought this game used for the PS3 for ~$5 years ago. One of if not the best story driven games I've ever played. Honestly the gameplay was pretty janky but the characters are really unprecedented in any game I've played. 
If you've never played this... Maybe pay the $70 and experience it in the best visual way possible. (Without the multiplayer 🤦🤦) 
Or pick up the used PS4 Remaster for cheap and probably get the same experience 🤷 (MP included..)"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Yep. It’s such a great game, IMO. Something about playing TLOU — I always have a dumb grin on my face the whole time.  And I’m the last person to be giving opinions on games; I’m absolutely terrible and take forever to finish a game. But that game. Damn. It’s just so fun to play."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,One of the best stories ever told in the medium.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"I managed to avoid spoilers and discussions for both TLoU and TLoU2 up to last weekend.

Got the Part 1 remake and TLoU2 on PS5 and beat  
them on hard over labor day weekend and I gotta say Part 1 was definitely worth every penny for me. It was so damn good."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"I played the remastered version on the PS4, and enjoyed the game play. Very well designed game play, it is accessible. I liked it being linear of course too."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,BUT DID YOU PET THE GIRAFFE?
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,wow 10/10 perfect not a single glitch or anything huh. pretty crazy to hear.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,PC version when.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Can't wait to play this again when it releases for PC.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"The moment to moment gameplay is just not engaging enough for me to consider it a masterpiece.  Every encounter plays more or less the same, and most puzzles are the same boring ""move puzzles around""."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Did you play Days Gone??
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,For the first time? Damn.  I beat it ten years ago. Not paying $70 to do it again.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,I started playing it again after getting stuck in the Sewer and rage quitting like 2 years ago
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"It's just... Sigh. The story is good, the music is good, the acting is good. But as a game, it's just ok to me. Not bad! I enjoyed it. But I wouldn't say the game itself stripped of it's polish was anything special."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Yep. TLOU1 is one of the GOATs for sure.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Good game, overrated as hell tho"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Just wait til you play through two. Not a terrible game but they really dropped the ball on the over arching story. Coming from the high of one you'd expect some upsets with the follow up but damn. And now part three is said to be a prequel instead of a continuation to flush out the new characters. As if this is going to be a continuing series of spin offs like television.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"I've played the og and the remastered, 3 times through. This game literally changed my life, its so damn good and smooth and easily playable. Not to mention the story being amazing. I hated the sequel, it was god awful. Can't wait to get a ps5 this winter and play the new remastered part 1 !"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"I have a problem - i uploaded the save game from an old ps4, but when i downloaded the save game to a new console somehow the game always start at the beginning. I lost interest to play because of this. I was about half way as i recall."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Part 1 or the whole game?
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-10,"Not a chance 10/10, gameplay average, graphics great, story generic"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,Same. It was one of the best games I played during that time. The multiplayer was also fantastic and was one of my favorites.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"That final scene is perhaps the most profound moment in games.  It's so simple, so subtle, yet with a few words, it elicits a well of feelings and ethical questions that have no easy answers.  It's the sort of artistic moment you'd see in an indie movie."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,"...that moment in the first 15 minutes of gameplay that tears out your heart...

If I could replay this game again for the first time...I would do it..."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Haven't played it in ages, but there are so many great memories from this game. The story just pulls you in and doesn't let go."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,just don't play p2 and you'll continue to be happy.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Unpopular opinion here, I got to the part where you have to get past underneath a bunch of people with guns, and at that point felt like the whole game was going to be a series of “now get past these guys”, uninstalled it and never returned. I wasn’t pulled in by the story at all."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,"the gameplay isnt so bad that it makes the story not worth experiencing. it’s *fine* , but the story is worth the time IMO. not much replay value tho as a result"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,"It’s pretty good gameplay for a PS3 game, probably not as impressive 10 years later. Not sure if the remasters gameplay is still the same, the sequel certainly improved on it, so I’d hope it’s improved."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Play it in the hardest difficulty and it legit becomes one of the best survival horror games with tight resource and ammo management and tough enemies and very few checkpoints.. On easier difficulties it's a fun 3rd person game with good combat. But as a package with the story, characters, quality of animations and graphics, pacing, etc it's a Masterpiece."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,"It's a serviceable third person shooter with stealth mechanics, but the story definitely outshines the gameplay in my opinion.. (from what I remember, I played it on the PS3 ages ago)"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"im a huge fan of all the third person games, resident ebils, uncharted, tomb raider and i gotta say, for me, tlou had the best gameplay of them all. it feels real. gunshots have impact, punches have weight, its a perfect ballance between the action and stealth."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,"Game play is average, with part 2 being somewhat better than that. If your looking for a game with amazing game play, this isnt for you"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"I found the gameplay in both to be fairly fun. First game had some clunkiness, and the first playthough is a bit rough since you're almost certainly not going to get all the upgrade parts (I think they barely put enough in for you to do so in the original ame), but there's a general fluidity that makes it quite fun. Plus they don't make your allies break stealth so it's quite forgiving like that.

Part 2 is a bit smoother combat wise, and actually has a couple of really good gameplay-story integration moments that topped ones in the previous title. Downside is the parts problem is still there, the narrative jumps around a little more, and while a small thing I kinda hated them making each gun upgrade more detailed so you see exactly how they're implemented. It's one of those, ""Cool in theory, but tedious in execution,"" things that just really bugged me."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"I thought it was great. Everything about it felt fluid and logical. People are gonna say it’s somewhat slow, but that pacing rewards you with a very immersive story experience. 

The original multiplayer experience reminds me of a SUPER consolidated Fortnite mixed with metal gear, only more intense. It was stupid fun."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"It's fun, but it's a less-fun version of Uncharted 2's gunplay.

They kind of tried too hard with the ""Gritty and realistic combat"". The melee is a bit janky and the gun-play and stealth are pretty average.

TLOU2's gameplay knocks it out of the park. It's hard for me to go back to TLOU1's gameplay. It feels so...simple and boring."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"I’m not at all a fan of the gameplay, it’s like uncharted with really tedious stealth. But if you are a fan of stealth games in general, the story is well worth it.

There are mechanics that do make the stealth more interesting, but it’s definitely dated imo…"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"the combat, speech, action, stealth etc what ever features a video game has this game has the best of all those features."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,It's a video game not a book so the game play far is far more important than the  story in my opinion. The game play is damn good. Stay for the game play and let the story take you along if you want.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"It gave me one of my most memorable gameplay experiences I can remember. 

Basically I had spotted 2 guys coming right at me so I crafted a 2x4 and smashed one dude, then I grabbed the other guy as a human shield (to execute) when 2 others suddenly round the corner, I aim the revolver at the guys, 2 shots and they're down, and now I'm just left with my shield. Bam, executed, with my last bullet. 

It doesn't sound so crazy but that was all a natural4 emergent experience, like I wasn't sitting there planning and I had no ideas more were coming. If one more dude showed up I would have been probably fucked. After that execution I remember my heart pounding and thinking ""idk how I survived that""

And that's when I realized the gameplay was a lot better than people might let on, the nature of it leaves you exposed and under equipped all the time so you have to think on the fly to get by. Felt like I was only just surviving."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Generic gameplay. Similar to tomb raider reboot. Uncharted
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"No, not really. I picked it up about a year ago and I found it frustrating and unfun. Very much a “if you don’t do this at the exact right moment / in the right way you fail.” Felt like I was a character in a movie and I hadn’t been allowed to read the script. I stopped playing after about 3-4 hours."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Story is 10/10 for a video game.

Gameplay, the point of  a video game, is a 6.5/10.

Soundtrack 10/10

Voice acting, animations, graphics, all other production values 10/10

For all intents and purposes it's a movie but the problem is a lot of the important events do actually happen during the gameplay so you're going to miss the majority of what makes it good if you just watch cutscenes. I mean, you could just watch a playthrough though."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"I'll be the first to say I am NOT a fan of zombie/horror games, it's a genre I've never enjoyed. The game was a bit boring to me the first couple of hours but the story is what drove me to finish it. It was fun at times, and I always preferred human combat over undead combat. However, it felt very repetitive at times, and if it weren't for me falling in love with the characters I would have lost interest."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Its very very linear. Its not like “Heavy Rain”. 

Gameplay is fun though."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"It's smooth enough, but it is a decade old game. It's not complicated or depthful by any means, but I do enjoy the weight that weapons have. When you shoot a shotgun it feels good. You ""feel"" the shot and it's heavy and the results are visceral."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"It’s gameplay is pretty fun, and finding materials and crafting supplies, aswell as upgrading weapons feels satisfying. Though, it’s definetly not the main reason you’re getting the game"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"It's a third person shooter heavy on looting with light stealth, upgrade and puzzle mechanics. Nothing groundbreaking but at least for me personally, a lot of fun."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Gameplay was debatable. It will probably be much better in the remake.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"I really liked the gameplay, it was pretty simplistic but still full of strategy, management, and more."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"I would say the first game gameplay is serviceable, it isn’t bad by any means though. TLoU2 is when the gameplay become really good"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"It’s pretty good. There are moments where you are exploring an area and having conversations but they aren’t long winded.

In between each exposition section there are enemy sections where you can apply stealth, gunplay, or stuff like throwing / smashing bottles into peoples face."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,"The game knew exactly when to change its tone. From a calm before the storm like this scene,to a scene of desperation,shock and guilt."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,What a great fuckin moment
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,How is it a spoiler?
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Go Jazz
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,Oh you're in Salt Lake City? Is the view as good?
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Yeah I was playing this game in my SLC apt right by the capitol building when I got to the part in SLC. It blew my mind! I thought that they customized the game to wherever your location was, I couldn't believe it lol."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,I wish I could play TLOU again without the knowledge of Part II
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Yup. Mentally prepare yourself. You will know pain...
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,"Yea I just need to get 4 more pendants,all the Left Behind trophies and a few like ""don't high-five Ellie"" and ""Ride the platform with Sam and Henry"". Thankfully, there's nothing expecting me to play on Grounded or Perma-death."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,Can't believe I slept on PlayStation for all these years. A PS5 has been the best purchase I made in a long time.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Im not super interested in the Last of Us games because i dont like really linear story focused games. 

But last of us 2's combat system looks amazing. The movement options and the gore system is insanely good. I can't wait for Factions 2 so I can try out that combat in a more sandbox environment"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,I loved Part II. Loved the experience of playing both Ellie and Abby and flipping between the 2...seeing their journeys
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,[deleted]
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Part 2 was masterful storytelling. It didn't occur to me until after the fact that, when you think about it, all the pivotal characters were antagonists; there were no protagonists."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"The narrative, emotional, and gameplay drive of Part I is the relationship between Joel and Ellie. >!Part II was ill conceived from the start because it eliminates that core relationship right from the start.!< That is the reason that the only universally loved level from Part II is the museum level"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,">Part II

I think Part II was an interesting idea that was poorly timed. It came dead smack in the middle of a world-wide pandemic where everyone wanted something uplifting, but they had already planned and developed a really dark, macabre game. 

I also think there were better stories to tell in the universe and more moral greys to explore. Part II is a very black-and-white ""this is bad, don't you see"" story."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,The Remake.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Congratulations man. I bet you're a good parent.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Yea I'm definitely going to play it. Not too fussed about some comments telling me to ""protect"" myself from it."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,"Ik what you mean. The sequel is the only one that got spoiled for me and I watched enough to be aware of the general story. However, I'm a fan of TLOU2 just as much as the first one and I'm confident I'll enjoy playing it."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,It was oddly addictive. Wish they would bring it back
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,Never got to play that.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Will do. Just gotta get Platinum and beat the DLC.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Yea they are both great. If anything I think Naughty Dog executed diversity perfectly.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,This is the problem with TLOU discourse. Part II supporters automatically lump any criticism of the game with “crazies” and thereby refuse to engage with discussions over the game’s narrative flaws
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Nah, I'm a progressive fella and TLOUP2 was not a story I appreciated at all. Nothing to do with the loss of Joel, or any other character. It was a story that showed what happens when ND (Neil Druckman and Naughty Dog) are given no restrictions and a false belief in their capabilities as a game creators.  
Like Peter Jackson for the Hobbit trilogy or Lucas for the prequels."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Yea it was a great moment of calm and joy before the entire Hospital scene left me shocked.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,This. So much this.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"I have not played Part 2, but so far from all the reaction, I think unless they made a Part 3, which I would then need to play Part 2 to get the story continuation, otherwise I may not bother with Part 2."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Was that the Stalkers introduction? The Bloater caught me around a corner the first time.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,I'm going to play the second one anyway. I like it thx.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Murder is...bad? Woah real revolutionary stuff there Neil
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Such an odd take. TLOU2 isn't *quite* as good as 1, but its still an amazing story and an amazing game. Part 1 is much more focused in its story, but part 2 hits the same emotional highs."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,I still have to finish this on my ps4. Bought a PC and basically forgot my ps4 even exists. I really need to find the time to get back to it!
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,I like the second one personally. I definitely will buy it some time soon.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,Pretty much. It's about the fungi Cordyceps causing a (basically zombie) apocalypse. Story was phenomenal and a roller-coaster of emotions.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,Not zombies bruh
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,I'll happily play the sequel. I love it just as much as the first.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Just did. My bad.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Still an exclusive.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"I hoped that enough time has passed that we can actually dissect and criticize Part II with people immediately jumping down your throat. Nope, people are still so hostile over any opinion that doesn’t match their own"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Nah I Iike it.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,I disagree but I respect your opinion. Why do you think it’s overrated?
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"All, I played all of them"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Second remaster isn't a remaster.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Ditto
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Seems you're late on the elden ring hype.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,[deleted]
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,I'm not sure I agree really but still a great game.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"I dont love it as much as a lot of ppl (not in my top 10 or anything) but rly not sure how its 5/10, even its combat which was the worst part of it was still passable. Respect ur opinion tho"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Yea I'll grab it soon. Ik I'm going to be crying like a little bitch.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,I wanted the remake thanks.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Remastered characters.... look.... better? Do you wanna borrow my glasses?
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Of course.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,The only visual glitch was some small shards of scrap weren't reacting to the light in one scene. Doesn't impact my rating at all.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,The whole game is TLOU part one. The sequel is called part 2
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-10,Well it's just my opinion.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,[removed]
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"I just recently finished it.

I don't care how much has been spoiled because I spend to much time on the internet.

I can't wait to play more."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"I've played this game twice once when I was single and another as a parent and I gotta say the answer is fairly easy for a parent.   It may not be right, but it's easy."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"The ending honestly makes the game. It's not as emotional as other games, but indeed those last few words from Joel made me question everything I just did in his name..."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,And they completely retconned it in Part 2 by making Ellie gullible naive kid.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Yeah, I remember being emotionally spent during and right after that game. 

Once I realized the set up, and how incredibly important that first chapter was once he make that decision at the end.  

That final mission had the exact same energy, just cranked to 11."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"I first played this on PS3, that scene didn't really affect me.

I then played the remaster a few years later, after starting HRT, and that scene broke me. I couldn't continue past it.

Playing the remake, that scene was hard, but I managed to get through it and finish the game again."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Should I just watch a YouTube video telling the story?
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"It isn't. They made absolutely no changes whatsoever to the gameplay even though they explicitly said they upated it to be on par with TLOU2.

You can't dodge, prone, or crawl. The gameplay is 100% exactly the same, the animations are the same, and the AI is the same. For example the TLOU2 mechanic of breaking a clickers face armor and then being able to one-hit melee kill, nope."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,I thought playing on grounded would be awful but it turned out being one of my favorite playthroughs. Sure I was squishier but so we're the enemies. You could kill humans really quickly if done well
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"This. TLOU's combat even now is FAR better than any other game of this genre. Impact and weight are a good explanations. It's very very important to overall experience.

TLOU2 is even better gameplay wise. You can feel the brutality in combat."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Yeah I don't know what anyone is smoking. Gameplay is awesome even on the first one. Second is on the level of gods.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Idk why u got downvoted literally made by the same studio as uncharted
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Had the same experience this week, looking forward to the HBO show but I think I'm going to leave the games"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-10,"Nothing you just said isn't exactly how it is in basically any other game. 

>  “if you don’t do this at the exact right moment / in the right way you fail.”

Also, life."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,"I distinctly remember hitting this part of the game then saying to myself ""shit is gonna get ugly, real soon"""
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Nothing really happens but it's a brief moment of calm that is best when you don't see it coming.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,They changed the geography dramatically but yes the city skyline against the huge mountains in beautiful
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Oh yeah, SLC has insane views. Mountains around you with a view of the valley as well."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,The sex scene alone made it all worth it.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,"Yeah, the trophy that hurt me the most was to *not* high five Ellie

I've done every playthrough with the game where I high five her, so I've broken like, a 7 game streak

I will say though, beating the Remaster is a whole lot easier than beating the Remaster for the PS4, so I wish you luck!"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Sometimes it's great to leave one platform alone for a while and then catch up on its exclusives. I haven't played on my PS4 much for a few years but now have a PS5 to open and get to play Horizon Zero Dawn and Forbidden West, Spider-man, God of War, Uncharted Lost Legacy and Ghost of Tsushima."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,"Playstation exclusives are for the most the absolute best games i have ever played.
Just God of War, Spider-Man and Tlou are in my top 10 easilly.
(My opinion obviously and i of course love to death a lot of non exclusive game. Just felt like i needed to say this because people get triggered easilly.)"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,I hope God of War is next on the list if it hasn’t been crossed off already?
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,"Same. I bought a PS4 when Spider-Man was announced. Then played the remastered TLoU and I think it's still my favorite. I'm playing Horizon Forbidden West right now and as soon as I'm done, I'm headed into the Uncharted franchise."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,"I also have missed a lot of PlayStation games, didn’t get a ps5 but I have a pc so I’m playing the titles as they trickle in, never played Spider-Man before and that game is a TON of fun"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,I mostly gamed on my Xbox One until most of my friends were playing GTA Online  on PS4 so went there to game and it’s been great. Have had a blast with a few of their exclusives
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,"Welcome to Playstation! There are so many good games. One of my personal favorites last-gen is *Days Gone.* It gets mixed reviews for sure, and it's not perfect, but I LOVE it.

It's another zombie-but-not-really-zombie apocalypse game, but this one is biker dudes in the northwest woods. It sounds cheesy, and it is cheesy, but in the best kind of way. There is a charm to the story and characters that is better than it should be. If you don't mind camp, whether intentional or not, I can't recommend it enough.

The early pacing is a little off, but once you make it past the early sequence it really opens up. 

To be clear, it is NOT trying to be high art like TLOU, but it's a fun B movie in the best way with heart and charm and zombie hordes and motorcycles and grenades and firebombs."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Try Gravity Rush 2. It will probably be super cheap. It's worth playing gravity rush 1 first but it's not as good as number 2.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,[deleted]
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"I think it depends from what perspective you are looking at it. I didn't feel that anyone tried to replace someone and the death of Joel, while very sad, was understandable. I loved him very much as a character but he did so much gruesome stuff in his past that it would come back to bite his arse eventually. The fascinatingly intertwined story of abbey and Ellie was in my opinion very well written and both just had so much hatred for each other and yet it felt real. I loved the subtext to all of it and the lines that weren't written and the ones that weren't said out loud were the best. You could see at any time how a character felt and that made the game so great in my opinion. It handled its characters with respect but also tried to stay as real as possible. People don't have plot armour in real life so a completely unexpected death (like with Jesse) was really surprising to me, but I liked the decision."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"I played through both games twice and thought each time after finishing both that Part II was better. Part I is very good and sets up the story of Part II, but I was on the edge of my seat for the entirety of Part II. So I disagree completely that Part II was flawed, I’m not sure how you come to that conclusion. But it’s a needless debate to have considering the opinions some people have about that game."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"On the contrary, both Ellie and Abby are protagonists. Don't have to have morally good characters for protagonists. 

The fact each of their stories are represented equally is where it gets strange/unique"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"This isn’t how stories work, my friend. I think you mean that all characters aren’t good? Because a protagonist is simply the lead character. Antagonist is the character who opposes the lead character. Their morality is irrelevant."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,I don't think it was ill conceived as a result of that. I think it pushed story telling boundaries to a new area. Its presents the theme of suffering the consequences of your actions and I think thats a pretty powerful one in the world created/presented to us.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Sorry if that comes off as rude but the whole point of the story is that nothing is black or white and only grey. It showed us that perspective plays a role and that everyone has their own motivations and goes to certain lengths to achieve what they desire. I really don't know when the game was ever black and white.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,I hope I am - I try to be.

x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"oh, I definitely understand the narrative has some flaws, but the people I'm speaking about actually hate this game, as in loathe it to an unhealthy degree to the point it makes them absolutely furious, instead of being like ""oh the writing wasn't as good"" and moving on. anyway, if you have an issue with the writing, that's fine, I'm not disregarding that and this is not directed at you, I was talking about the actual crazies, the ones furious about gender and races."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"and that's absolutely fine man. I wasn't talking about people who disliked the actual narrative, I was only speaking about a loud group that hate this game because of gender etc. I completely get this stuff is subjective, and I had things I didn't like in the story. sorry, maybe I should have been clearer with my first comment"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Ha yeah it's the one fleeting moment of joy and happiness before you plunge head first into the end game, which itself stays with you.

Time for Part II now, you have the advantage of playing while the first one is still fresh in your memory and can just jump straight in, lucky you!"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,It's still a very good game.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Yeah ignore this dude. Part 2 is incredible.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"I guess you’re right, plus the new undead are cool. I just completely disconnected emotionally from the story after the “you know what” scene."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,"TLOU 2 is a masterpiece in storytelling, but that's also just my opinion."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,The fuck? You played the second one first?
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,"Technically it's not, but basically it is."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Kinda cringe ngl
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,It's coming to PC soon™
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Elden ring? Nah dark souls is coming out soon, that's gonna be the next big thing I reckon."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,They spoiled the models and faces of the characters and the atmosphere
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Some people just don't want others to enjoy the remake since they've already played several times, but don't let that get you down cus it just matters you enjoyed it :)"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"I can’t believe how divisive it is, but for me it’s the real 10/10 of the two! 

🙊"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"The Last of Us Part 1 contains the entire game?

I thought it was only half the game. lol. Marketing fail right there."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,For sure.  The series is really the best in gaming imo.  RDR2 is the only game that I think can roll with them.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,I enjoyed part 2 for different reasons
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Hate it (part 2)
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"I enjoyed part 2 equally as well. The game play and it being linear, are number one to me. The story was fine, except some parts and some aspects of characters I did not like at all, but its a video game not a book. If it was a book I would of stopped reading it."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"I guess there are 2 questions, both of which are easier as a parent: >!whether it was right to save your daughter by murdering a whole bunch of doctors that could save humanity, when you know she would prefer to give her life to save the world, and also whether it was right for him to lie to her face so that she could be at peace with living.!<"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,You’re assuming all parents would come to the same conclusion? I still think it is all *but* easy.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"My first experience...I had broken down/traded a bunch of old games for a PS4 and TLOU. That scene caught me so off guard... I had no idea what the rest of the game was planning to throw my way but powered through. 

TLOU isn't my favorite game...but it's definitely up there as one of the best I've ever played."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"no. a lot of the impact of the story is the character building, development, hubris, twists and turns. i don’t think a condensed youtube video would do it justice."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Maybe if someone you watch regularly already has done a play through? That’s how I experienced both games, Many a True Nerd played through part 1 right before part 2 came out and I’ve watched Jon for years, I really enjoyed watching him play. I was actually unable to play any games at the time due to medical issues with my hands, so for me it was the only way I could experience it at the time. For me personally it was a 10/10 experience, but YMMV"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,That’s disappointing
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Yeah it is a really intense experience. Stealth is key and I love stealth games so that's why I loved it so much. I once did an entire playthrough without Crafting a medkit. If I died I just redid the level.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Just like in early Resident Evils as a kid. You’re in a calm, unassuming hallway and there’s a door. You know something hideous is behind it so you just chill for a bit to collect your shit."

x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,Uncharted series are a heck of an adventure. It has some great puzzles aswell for a change of pace. One of my favourite gaming series.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,Yea I Platinumed it a few weeks back. The Screwball challenges were a pain but it was a fantastic game.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"I am glad it's not just me who loves Days Gone. I love anything with zombies but I slept on that game when it first came out because of the poor reviews, then bought it when it was on sale, gave it a try one night and got really into it. I thought it had a really great setting, a nice balance of gameplay mechanics and an interesting plot with good enough characters to make you keep playing to the end. Really gutted that it's not getting a sequel because I could do with another game just like it."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,The game is like 2 years old? I think we are past the BASIC premise of the game at this point

x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09, Can't believe you got downvoted for actually knowing the difference between protagonist/antagonist and hero/villain
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"To be fair, it's one of the few stories that introduced two protagonists. As a protagonist is someone who changes and develops over the course of the story. Its definitely a weird one for that."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Kinda have two lead characters in this game, pitted against eachother."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Storytelling structures exist for a reason. Storytelling 101 is an inciting event, rising action, climax, and falling action. The through line for TLOU2 looks like someone is having a cardiac arrest and it doesn’t work. Abby’s first 2 days lack motivation and the audience is burnt out. 

Breaking storytelling structures alone isn’t revolutionary, they need to be broken for a reason. TLOU2’s simple moral wasn’t enough to justify the narrative massacre"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"The story could be grey, but the game was created black and white. >!They have you kill dogs with one character while being friendly with them as another. One shows mercy to a pregnant woman, while the other kills one. The game is littered beginning to end with these sort of emotionally-manipulative mirrors, and they are not very well hidden.!<

>!They wanted you to feel like you were playing the villain by the end (up until the final decision to let go), and that violence and revenge destroys you. This isn't just explained by your actions as Ellie, it's clear in the way they frame, score and light the scenes. They made it very, very clear that's the message they wanted to send in the story. That is not grey, that is black and white. There's no uncertainty that Ellie destroyed what left she had of her life in her pursuit, and that Abby was not a character that deserved it when given her perspective.!<

>!The extent to which anyone actually did want to kill Abby by the end can only be fueled by disinterest in their character or their story. !<In terms of what the game was trying to say, it was very clear."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,That's all someone could ask for. A parent who tries is already going out of there way to do right by their child. I hope all is well.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-12,It’s the fastest selling PlayStation exclusive of all time...
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,"Yea thankfully Abby's story and her development hasn't been spoiled but I do know that her father was Jerry. Tbh,after finishing the first one,I don't get why so many were quick to defend Joel's actions. I was shocked to see his brutality to a bunch of innocents just wanting to return to normality. It was still a great ending and Joel is a fantastic flawed-protagonist."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Bigots exist, sure. But at the end of the day, that’s a small minority of critics and most people who hate Part II will shut down that line criticism when it’s brought up. 

What I hated the most about TLOU2 was for dividing the community. The community used to be appreciation and theory crafting, but after Part II it just became people yelling at each other. That’s on Neil. 

It was one of Neil’s stated goals to create a divisive experience and he succeeded in that. It’s not an outside influence, Neil destroyed the safe space that was the TLOU community. Which is why I thought your original comment is misdirected and actually contributes to hostility. 

I love the representation in the game, especially the conversation that Dina and Ellie have in synagogue. But I hate Abby and the nonsensical story structure. I want a community that can eventually discuss the merits and flaws of the game without the baggage that accompanies the current discourse on the game"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"It seems to be 50-50

Half the people tells me it is a good game, and it is natural to play the second game if you like the first.

Then the other half tells me if I enjoy the first game, stop now as the second game will ruin that fond memory of the franchise for me.

And it isn’t 1 or 2 people either, there seems to be a large portion of people that think that is the case."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"That was kinda the point. Well, not to make you emotionally disconnect, but to make you *angry.* Upset. To make you feel driven to revenge, just like Ellie. Its brilliant IMO. The game was bringing you into the game.

Naughty Dog literally tried to make you irrationally angry, and it worked. Some people just turned that anger against the game rather than applying it to their participation in the story. Think about how you felt when Abby and Ellie fought, and you were Abby. Then you did it as Ellie. You feel what Ellie feels. Then you feel what Abby feels. Then they collide it and make you feel confused. Just like they did at the very end of Part 1.

Thematically, TLOU2 was revolutionary IMO."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Masterpiece my ass. It’s horrible storytelling imo. Imagine if every hero ever head to deal with the loved ones of all the people they went through. That’s not a story. That’s just shit happening. It’s a situation. They should have moved on to a new IP.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"TLOU 2 is bad on every aspect of ""story"""
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,No. I just watched a decent bit of the story and a fuck ton of gameplay. This was before I ever even thought of getting a PS5 but I'm confident that I'll enjoy it despite what others may think.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Also some weapons feeling worse
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Really? Why?
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"I think a lot of players missed a lot of info in the last chapter, there is tons of ""extra"" lore in Video and Text u find in the last Area which makes the decision like sooooo much more human and relatable."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"I wish there were more ways to explore this, though; choosing between letting her die on the operating table and killing everyone to prevent her death seems like a false dichotomy.  

Like, why is it OK to operate on her while she's still unconscious from nearly drowning?  Why is the only choice to operate immediately?  Why is there no discussion with Ellie or Joel regarding this choice? 

Aside from the ethics of it (I imagine ethical considerations are somewhat different in a post-apocalyptic world) how much scentific knowledge are you losing by not observing this immune person while she's alive?  Why would you not try to get as much information as possible from a live person before resorting to kill her to get the rest of the information?

Joel may well have reacted differently if Ellie had a chance to tell him to his face that she wants this, and she's OK with it.  It's the immediacy of the decision to end her life, and the permanence of that act that results in Joel doing what he does.  There were better ways to go about this from both sides.  

But, that doesn't make for a good resolution in a video game context, I guess."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Find out in TLOU2 haha
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,A full letsplay series might though
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Good to know, I'd started the first one some time ago and it's hard to love. As a lover of TLoU, I have to power through though."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,"Just bought the game last week. 100% the main story the other day and DLC 1 yesterday. Screwball challenges are definitely a weak point, but at least they can be cheesed with certain suit powers and suit mods to get gold easily."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,"That’s the part I kinda stopped playing at lol, second dlc, the stealth missions, I hate them and it makes me not want to 100% it"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Absolutely. No exaggeration it’s in at least my top 5 games from last gen if not top 3. It just really clicked for me. 

I thought the early pacing was off in my first playthrough, but on NG+ going through it with familiarity I saw how actually really specifically and intentionally it was set up to introduce mechanics and locations really naturally. 

Love the setting, the story, and the characters, cheese and all."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Again I don't think you really get it. Nobody tried to convinced anyone that certain characters were evil. They showed us how everything can be justified if you have motivation and look at things from different perspectives. That was the main premise, nobody acted just or unjust, they simply acted in their own interest and based on their own desires.

The gameplay aspect is your opinion. The gameplay was very good and felt real, if that makes sense to you. A normal person can't sprint or change directions from 0 to 100 in a split second, things felt more slow because that is how humans move. The gun play was just awesome in my mind and the AI was also incredibly good and improved big time. I don't see where the gameplay exactly lacked or was worse than other games because I have never played a game that felt this good while actually playing. I don't really like this arcady kind of Playstyle where everyone and everything is fast everything feels like it has no weight to it. I like the slow more realistic approach because that made the gameplay more unique especially when compared to other games."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Why do I hear these kinds of arguments so often, same with God of war Ragnarok. Everyone is like ""oh no it is not the most innovative game for its time"". You do realize a good sequel for a story based game doesn't need to change much in terms of gameplay especially when it was awesome the first time around. Also I thought that they made so many great changes and additions to the gameplay that were mostly details and quality of life changes but yet they elevated the gameplay to another level, at least for me. The gameplay was great but I obviously play those games for the story. I also won't cry or be angry if there won't be any major changes but just healthy additions that make sense in GoW Ragnarok. On the contrary I will like it even more because why try and risk changing something beyond recognition when it was loved the first time. I feel like people forget that sequels should stay true to the games that came before (when they are in the same time frame and genre). Especially when it comes to heavily story driven games."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"I think logic finally prevailed because I don’t see downvotes. People think too hard about this sometimes, because they manipulate definitions to fit a narrative. In reality, these terms—protagonist and antagonist—are tools for the writer, guidelines for how to write compelling stories. 

It’s just that traditionally, the protagonist has been a good person. It’s not until the Modernism era where we see morally messy protagonists. But in the simplest terms a protagonist is the main character(s) that is trying to achieve something, and the antagonist stands in their way. 

In God of War 2018, Kratos is your protagonist. But Kratos is not a good person at all. He genocided an entire pantheon of Gods, was a brutal war general before his ascension, and in general was not a “hero”. And Baldur, the antagonist, is comparatively “good” insofar as we don’t see him like do half the insane murdery stuff we’ve seen Kratos do. I mean…he’s at odds with Kratos because he thinks he’s a giant and thus a threat to the Norse pantheon. Not saying Baldur is an angel or anything….but Kratos is definitely the worst person in this scenario. But that doesn’t matter, he is our protagonist, the person who we experience the story from. Our goals are his and that’s all that matters when it comes to if we consider him our protagonist."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Plenty fiction across multiple platforms—movies, TV, books, games, etc.—have two or more protagonists. And changing with the story isn’t necessarily a protagonist thing. As I mentioned elsewhere, these terms are mechanical and help give us a general idea. But they’re not rigid. The protagonist is the main character(s) who is trying to achieve something—The Fellowship, Kratos and Atreus, Joel and Ellie, Jak and Daxter, Crash Bandicoot, Spyro the Dragon, Samus, the Chosen Undead, etc. The antagonist stands in their way. There can be one antagonist, or there can be a dozen. They can be good, bad, or neutral. All that matters is that they stand in the way of our protagonists, who themselves can be good, bad, or neutral."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Yep. In the first 12 hours of the game Ellie is the protagonist. But where people kinda get it screwed around is that Abby isn’t the antagonist. She is the goal, the mark, the thing that the main character is trying to achieve. In this way, the antagonist isn’t a character, but rather the WLF/zombies, who actively—intentionally or not—stand in the way of Ellie achieving her goal. In the second half, Abby is the protagonist and the antagonist is Isaac and then later the Scars and then Ellie at the end. Unlike Ellie, whose goal is granitic, Abby’s goal changes throughout. She goes from just being a regular WLF member to helping the Scar kids to then wanting to leave the area entirely.  

In this way, TLOU2 is a complex, non-traditional narrative. It’s very much completely different from what gamers are used to. Gamers are used to fairly simple narrative throughlines with easily understandable characters and stakes; the classic bell curve. TLOU2 is very much like a book in this regard. We’re living in this really exciting era where games are trying new and more complex ways to tell stories. It’s amazing to see."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"I would disagree and say the game is splint into two separate, but equal, parts that simply converge at the end. Each plotlint follows the same structure that you just mentioned. 

It's not far off any show or movie (like Game of Thrones for example) that follows several plot lines. I mean shit, look at the end of season 1 (GoT) and tell me it's not similar to Joel's fate. Consequences of your own decisions."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Bro that argument doesn't even make sense. Yes, two different characters react differently about certain situations you are in, that is not black and white, that is just people being different. Also you don't have to kill dogs except the one scripted event where the dog literally tries to kill you.

Ellie also didn't know that she was pregnant so that argument is gone as well. You also see how repulsive Ellie acts when she sees what she has done, she didn't realize and in my opinion that doesn't make her evil, that makes her character even more tragic than before. 

These manipulative mirrors are not there if you just stop for 1 second and think about what just happened and why the characters do what they do. That is what makes the game so great, it is not just what we think we see on the surface but what we can see internally, what is going in inside the characters. 

I am sorry to phrase it like this but I don't think you quite grasped the full picture. And hey, that is fine but saying the story is black and white while it was never at any point black nor white is kind of silly.

They didn't want you to feel like the villain, if that is what you think the game wanted to achieve then I am sorry to tell that it is not that easy, you didn't look beyond the surface but again, if that is the layer you focus on and don't want to look deeper then that is fine I guess."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Thank you kind stranger! I played the PS4 remaster - have been on the fence with this one… I take it you would recommend?
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Word, many people forget how much Joel deserved consequences for his past actions. A person can change and become reconciled to their past, but that doesn't mean the people he wronged are going to give him the same pass he gives himself."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Some doesn't like the story, everyone loves the gameplay."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"And you are allowed to have that ""opinion"""
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"for me, the gameplay for 2 is awesome. It's the story that really just turned me off. The characters were not nearly as likeable as the ones were for me in the first game"
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Different guy but for me the plot doesn't feel as well written, and plot is really the main driving force behind the franchise.

Some of the directions the plot takes feel very forced, like it was trying too hard to go for specific beats of emotional responses that it lost itself along the way. The characters make decisions that don't feel like something I understand for them, forcing an arc that feels contrived and robbing you of the emotion it could have had.

And when you swap the amazing plot of the game out for one that's much more forced and contrived, there's not much left to stand on its own."

x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Well put.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"But Abby’s plot doesn’t. The rising action falls vertically and continues for 10 hours. The story abruptly ends right before the climax, and leads to Abby has no motivation. Abby’s story isn’t linear and includes various time jumps and flashbacks, creating pacing that are exacerbated by the abrupt jump to 3 days in the past. Abby’s first 2 days are directionless with no sense of urgency and she doesn’t have a goal until the story reconverted with Ellie’s. And all this pacing is further dragged down by the California levels. 

A tv show has a plots and b plots that mix together and lead to a climax. A video game is all a plot and two stories doesn’t work when told back to back, especially when the a plot doesn’t resolve. If a tv show spends an entire story with the a plot then an entire story with the b plot, and adds a poorly paced epilogue on top of that, it wouldn’t work either. 

Above all else, a video game at the very least needs to have you want to achieve the goal in front of you. >!Yet when Abby fights, most players either let Abby die or cheer for Ellie.!<

TLOU tells the conflict story better in 30 seconds. Abby’s dad is about to kill a little girl and brandishes a weapon at Joel, but has legitimate motivations to save humanity. Joel is also a complicated character that has to make the decision to save his surrogate daughter, and he even has the choice to spare the other doctors. That was a brilliant story told through subtext. TLOU2 eliminates the subtext, makes Abby a saint to rub it in (until she betrays her fellow soldiers that she’s lived with all her life for a kid that she’s known for a day with no remorse), and bashes you over the head with a moral of “other people have feelings so murder is bad.” If the game explored Joel and Ellie’s fallout instead cutting off the most intriguing plot of the series, then it would be much better received."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"The \*message\* of the game is that revenge and violence is a destructive pursuit that isn't worth it. They get you on board with this message by continuing to push the envelope more and more with a character you do like (Ellie), while showing you commendable behavior by the then-supposed antagonist (Abby).

There is no grey in the message. The ending is also the most obvious ""this should have been a player choice moment"" of all-time, but they didn't do it, because again the message isn't grey. The message isn't a choice. The epilogue of Ellie returning to find nothing, makes it more clear that her decision to pursue was bad. The irony is that had she not pursued, Abby would have died. Pursuing Abby actually saved Abby, but destroyed Ellie -- as if the message wasn't clear enough already.

And of course Ellie didn't know about the pregnancy. She discovered it immediately after. This is not by accident, this game is written and developed. Ellie's pursuit put her in that situation, this is the unintended collateral. That was the service to the story. By the end, she was -- with full awareness -- threatening an emaciated child with a knife to get an emaciated Abby to fight.

And with Owen, too, Abby let it go. She could have killed Ellie for what she did to Owen, but she stopped -- the same message Ellie was destined to learn by the end. This isn't the grey of TLOU where you have genuine conflict over whether or not Joel did the right thing, they painted a clear picture that Ellie's pursuit was to her own detriment, to the detriment of those she loved, that it compromised her morals and relationships, and that in doing so she lost everything.

Trust me, I completely ""get"" what they were trying to do. It's a high concept that I think is neat on paper. But they wrote it so explicit and one-note that there is no wiggle room to decide whether Ellie's pursuit was right or wrong. It was very clearly a bad thing and that's the message the game wanted to convey."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Most definitely. Ik people are saying it's just a re-skin but it's fantastic. The scenes and designs just depict so much more emotion and beauty. I'd definitely recommend if you have the money to spare.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Interesting how beloved the ending to Red Dead Redemption is in contrast to this.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Interesting since the story of the first is an overplayed troupe. An emotional cut of man finds his feeling again thanks to a segregate daughter. Name an action star who hasn’t made this movie.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-16,Yes contrived is exactly it.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"The pacing is off honestly, for the first part of the game you switch between characters then half the game you play as Ellie then boom suddenly your playing a completely different character for the rest of the game then back as Ellie again. It really takes away the momentum of story. 

We make it all the way here with Ellie just to cliff hang us at a pivotal moment to tell the story/path of another character. The sudden switch and time warp really almost stopped me playing but I get why they did it, I honestly liked Abby and emphasised with her even rooting for her but they did it in a way that takes away that immersion. 

Not sure how else they could of played it, maybe dlc with Abby or ease us into it and have Abby at some point tell Ellie her story idk."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-08,Worst part of the game! Otherwise it’s fantastic
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"My guy you throwing with the weirdest stuff around. All those games had minor changes to gameplay and stayed roughly the same, Yakuza doesn't even have great gameplay. You are literally listing titles that basically remained the same over years and complain about a game that focuses on story that it didn't reinvented the wheel and instead ""just"" improved very much upon the first title? Sorry but that seems very much like ""I just want to hate on something for the sake of it"""
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Exactly what it did. If you feel like the gameplay didn't improve then I can't help you buddy. The gameplay obviously improved very much and did many quality of life changes and added several features. Or do you want to tell me that there was no improvement.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,Agree to disagree. I think Abby's story had plenty of rising action and a very compelling story.
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Sure Mate, if you think so."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"I'm much less bothered by stuff having been done before, personally. Because at this point everything is a rehash, remix or direct repeat of the massive wealth of story telling humankind has accumulated by now. If you need a story to be truly new to enjoy it, you're gonna be shit outta luck.

The execution still managed to get to me, and for that I consider it a good story.

Other stories have fallen short of the same principle and then I do dislike them. E.g. I hated how Star Wars 7 felt like Disney going 'remember Star Wars 4? Wasn't it GREAT? yeaahhh....'.

But this? Nah, I was on board. And the fact that the game went with a bittersweet ending was even stronger for me. They didn't end on some heroic action or a sacrifice for love or whatever, where those action star movies always end.   
They ended on the seed of bitter resentment where any perception of Joel being a good guy for his protection is robbed from the audience, because Ellie would have wanted them to try and save the world instead."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"I agree, when I realized I'm about to play the last 3 days as a completely different character, instead of knowing the ending, I was a bit annoyed. But the Abby gameplay ended up being the better part of the game, with the level design and immersion. And even if you dont like the pacing, the game is still one of the best games ever made."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"I thought the pacing was mostly fine and really enjoyed the perspective shifts.  If they removed the last chapter entirely and left the ending ambiguous as to whether Ellie stayed or left, the game would have been perfect."

x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Indeed I enjoyed my play through too, Abby doesn’t deserve the hate she gets."
x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Hiding in high grass, being able to lie down, addition of dogs, improved AI, better gun play, more realistic movements, AI acting like actual human beings instead of being unimpressed when all their mates die, the scar who communicate with whistling and you having to learn what whistle command means what in order to know what they mean, the addition of a ""1 life"" Mode (can't remember the name), different weapons and upgrades, plus new craftables etc.

x9a4sx,2022-09-08,2022-09-09,"Bro, you literally are to idiotic to even follow our discussion. Your point was that it didn't improve upon the first title, I then list several things it improved and stuff that wasn't possible before and now you compare the additional stuff to other games? 
You literally just want to shit on the game but don't bring anything to the table. In terms of gameplay improvement these two things you cherry picked are new for the tlou games and therefore an addition and improvement. 

Man and here I thought you actually had some points for counterarguments but it seems like I misjudged you big time."

Kingdom come Deliverance has taken crap for not having any black people/gay people in their game.. a game set in 1400 Bohemia, Czech republic area. When a Czech gaming developer made the game, and brought on a crap ton of historians to make it accurate.

No matter what, people who think politics need to be in every aspect of life are going to have people on both political sides bitching about something. "

Besides, most people don't care at all. That means the majority of people, at least in gaming, don't care and that you really don't have to fight with the few remaining bigots. Let them die out. There's always going to be one asshole, try to enjoy your life anyways. "

The important bit is that in the West, it stops there. Nobody gets hurt. They just complain. The solution is to let them. People need to get to the point of acceptance organically.

It’s a process. Humanity isn’t naturally benevolent. Pretending we are and passing judgment on those that are “intolerant” is the rock you put in your own path.

8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,People will always have something to complain about I personally think the male white military ultra alpha main character profiles are incredibly boring.

8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Honestly the only people I've seen complaining about this are Facebook users, some Twitter posts, and Youtube

The 3 sites where people complain about pretty much *everything*. They could be referencing some company giving out $4 million to some charity and people on those sites would be furiously typing away on these sites complaining how the money is going to the ""wrong"" charity or how it ""wasn't enough"".


"
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The intended sentiment means nothing when you have a small portion of the audience who can't accept two women kissing.

In the age of the internet a relatively small focused group of whingers can sound much louder than they would if they had to put any actual effort into whinging via public outlets.

It's also safe to assume that those who don't really care are just getting on with their lives and aren't legitimising the naysayers by arguing what is essentially a petty prejudice.

Elie being a horny kid, who hasnt been with anyone b4 because all she ever does is kill people or has had people try to kill her, doesnt know how to act. 

This girl seems to be using her and Elie is just happy someone is finally looking at only her.(in Elies mind) Dont get me wrong, Elie probably does like her but is too inexperienced to pick this up.

However I get why people are pissed off with the ""strong wamyn"" theme that's been going on with so many other franchises. I also get why others are pissed off at Devs appropriating European history and culture and then warping it to suit their own agenda. 

The vast majority of consumers of this genre of video games are still males of European descent. Yet videogame Devs are creating content and characters that don't represent them. 

And before anyone says I'm crying about it, I'm not, I'm just responding to OP. I literally don't care, I just don't buy games that don't interest me.

8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,True dat. Don’t get me wrong. The majority I’ve seen speak positively. I just saw some comments made on Neil Druckmann’s Twitter and on YouTube 
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I felt like it was hinted at in The Last Of Us when she speaks about how she was infected and the reaction to it that her and her friend had, which suggested to me that there was some form of romantic connection between them.

8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Especially when they showed THAT fucking sick gameplay? Who tf focused on the kiss when the gameplay looked that awesome? Welcome to 2018 though. If a gay character is going to make people miss out on whats for sure going to be a gaming masterpiece thats on them.  
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Probably because those gamers only exist in your head

And for the record, the existence of people who constantly complain about the inclusion of LGBT people are exactly why gaming journalist will welcome this aspect of the game. Clearly, we still have a long way to go towards the acceptance of gay people in society, and  no, that's not a weird thing to desire.

8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"What games are you referring to that appropriate European history? Honestly curious, not being flippant.

8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Well, I guess we might see it as them being assholes, but from their point of view, the problem may be that devs are letting politics enter the gaming sphere and dictate how to set up their games and characters.

8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"It might make people uncomfortable who were invested in the character. It's a character decision that they don't agree with like if a tv show kills off someone they like.

When people tell me I have to support their world view, that is where I draw the line. You do you and I will do me. I don't ask for support in what I think or do, don't try and force me to agree with what you think.

Video and cinema are easily considered art but if 95% of the art at the louve was all Jackson pollack style paintings people would think art is stale. 

I like variety personally and in the art of gaming it seems like too many are willing to go with the status quo because they don't want backlash but that's not what art is about you know? "

8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I haven't watched all of the E3 content to be able to comment fully on this year's offerings. However off the top of my head we have DICE with Battlefield 1 and their vast vast over representation of minorities for European factions. The Ottoman Empire had the palest troops on offer which is ridiculous. The same scenario is developing with Battlefield V but in an even more farcical fashion.

The I recall the Witcher 3 developer being taken to task at the lack of minority representation in his game, to which he responded that the lore and inspiration for his game comes from a European standpoint. 

Then we have the Gear of War franchise which no one ever cares about being multi racial because it's set in a future universe. But they've added this pointless strong woman trope character out of nowhere.

Then we have the new Assassin's Creed franchise where we have African Spartans in the trailer. Historically something that would never ever existed because of how staunchly focused on blood purity the Spartans were. 

Its just a current theme in all entertainment platforms of late. I've seen the BBC produce TV shows that are appropriating my ethnic culture and having black characters within the  stories of my heritage. Around the time Dunkirk was released i remember the onslaught of articles calling Christopher Nolan a racist for having a predominantly white production because he was maintaining historical accuracy. 

To be honest I fucking hate talking about race, sexuality, religion etc but it's pushed so much nowadays in everything that I'm left with no choice. I just don't buy things that are actively against what I was born as but some people seem to have an issue with that. I don't care what other people buy but a lot of people seem to care about what I don't want to buy and why.

8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I've yet to see any evidence that ""diversity"" is a good thing. All jokes aside the ""diversity is our strength"" meme often stinks of desperation at the futility of a nations demographic situation. In fact all evidence points towards ""diversity"" being a negative in terms of social cohesion and integration.

Artists, authors and other creatives have been selling their products and creations in regions other than their own for centuries. You don't need a ""diverse team"" to sell that. There is no need to promote diversity within existing companies, if you want a real diversity of choice then publishers would concentrate on acquire new Devs in developing markets. That's how you get a true experience, not this artificial ""multicultural"" insult that seeks to pander to the perceptions of the white, middle class leftists that often get to set the agenda in these companies.

8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Best game shown for sure across all the shows. Blew my mind. 
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-17,"Was outstanding. But, people see what they want. If they wanna focus on a kiss from a developed and established character, instead of how outstanding that gameplay preview was, thats on them. "
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,you mean sites that turn 12 tweets into an article? or other posters that make up large reactions to things that never happened? or posts taken out of context like the strawman articles about BFV where they lied about what people were upset about?
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Violence is fine, lesbian kiss is not. "
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Hard to say, the whole ""art needs to be about backlash"" kinda scream marxist vibe, its not something I generally agree with as that view tends to ignore the heart of a work for the sake of it being controversial, which when the inclusion of LGBT seems to be the hot topic of the year wouldn't doing something against LGBT be the controversial statement?

When you look at Uncharted series on the surface its very cookie cutter even parts below the surface are but the heart put into the work makes it shine more than trying to make it buck the trend

I have nothing against variety and for a large portion we are lacking it, one if my favorite games is Journey, I just find variety for the sake of variety ends up being poorly written or ends up just a cookie cutter on being different a lot of the time

Sadly this years line up still comes out rather unoriginal with many of the companies doing sequels or following trends or appealing to money"

Here’s some more I found"
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Perhaps I’m blowing it out of proportion. I’ve seen a few more on Facebook and YouTube.
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I have heard that, its just difficult for me to get past the stealth aspects, it was also a generalized statement as to writing and insertion in general over just TLOU franchise"
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,The fuck do you mean ‘actively against what I was born as’?
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"As long as it's personal, that's all good. Let all him express what he believes in in his own game"
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Exactly. Hence this will always be a problem because there will always be that small few that will assert such accusations, and the many will just dismiss it as we've done now. "
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"How are you catering to them? and why do people have to be comfortable with gay people? 

I personally am but i don't feel people have to like or feel comfortable with them i just expect them to treat them with decency and respect as humans. Be grossed out with the sex all you want for all i care."
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,They can have their opinions just like you can have yours. They aren't hurting anybody by being uncomfortable with lesbians.
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Lmao you found the devils advocate!
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I find it rather odd that you're all in a tizzy over what people think of a video game. 

Are you one of those liberals in training? You know the type, they're the ones that hate anyone that has a differing view to the one that they hold and would actually go out from their college campuses etc to do harm to people that don't think like they do.

Seems that you're the one taking issue with what people think about what people think, what may not be an issue for you, is for other people.

If this was a real life scenario rather than a game that people play I could partially understand your soap boxing.


"
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,No....no I don't mean those things....but please feel free to make up what I mean in your own head. It makes for a solid argument.
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I totally see what your saying and my point wasn't that art needs to be risqué for the sake of being risqué I also feel that takes away from the artists intent. I just feel like we've gotten so used to the same thing over and over and it's boring. Not to say uncharted isn't good. It's great but that game series also has a very solid story and tells it well. Uncharted is a bit of an outlier but a great counter argument. How do you feel about this lesbian kiss is it shoving propaganda down people's throats? Does it not bother you at all? Or are you somewhere in the middle? 
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Last one is missing, oh well, still a handfull of accounts, this isnt something the scale of womensmarch, that would be a legitimate concern"
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I just dont see value in advertising hate, be it towards a videogame kiss or a dragon in a childrens movie getting a gf, it wont do anything other than cement their hatred"
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,An evil pale skinned heterosexual male of European descent with no confusion about what gender I am. 
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,That is such a blanket statement. Just because someone isn't physically hurting someone doesn't mean they aren't making them upset and invalidating their existence. 
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"It’s just an issue I feel very strongly about, and I wanted to share my opinion. I don’t hate other people with differing opinions. If I came off as hateful I apologize. "
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"There’s literally people in this thread doing the thing and they are like WHERE, bro, right HERE I guess their reading capabilities are selective along with their sight?"
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Honestly I never got that far in the original so I don't know her full story or character development, is this out of left field? I cant really say for sure, since I am a lesbian I know what opinion people tell me I am supposed to have whenever this topic comes up, but its all about writing for me really if it comes across hamfisted or tacked on for the sake of it I will have issues, take mass effect andromeda for example, the engineer just blurts out they are trans for no reason with no real context or forethought put into it.

With Ellie it doesn't appear that being a lesbian is the be all end all of the character or completely come out of nowhere like if they randomly made Joel gay despite there being no inclination, history or signs and him having had a wife in the past"
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Yeah, I guess I’m just blowing it out of proportion. I just wanted to share my opinion is all"
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Jesus Christ. Ok lol. Good luck with your horrifying oppression. Sending prayers.
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Don't apologise, your view is your view.

You just seemed a little too concerned about something that is essentially a video game and not real life.

The world would be a very boring place if everyone thought the same thing.

Have a good day."
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I got yah. I feel the same way as a gay white American male. If the story is good and characters well thought out and developed they can be any gender or race. Hell if they made a story compelling enough and relevant throw in someone who is a furry I don't care. It's the tacked on stuff with no compelling reason that grates me. 
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I honestly feel like the people like this who feel oppressed need to just consider if they're bthe arseholes. As also a straight white male, and knowing many others, I have literally never felt oppressed or excluded because of my race in a way that I didn't think was totally reasonable."
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Thanks bro. Remember that every like represents a prayer to God. 
8qgqlp,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,They are clearly just incredibly dumb to think they are oppressed because all of a sudden people who aren’t them are standing up for themselves
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Crackling audio guy just got fired that's for sure. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Good trailers and announcements, but hot damn the stream was a mess. Constant incorrect camera feeds, random voices talking over announcers, audio feedback, just a pure AV mess. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"What the FUCK is Death Stranding? The more I see the more confused I am, and the more I want."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I have a feeling Ghost of Tsushima might have more to it than it let on. There was the whole ninja stealth part of it with bombs and stuff. I dunno how larger group engagements will play out, but I'm cautiously optimistic."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,No FFVII? 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Not going to lie, I didn't really like the format they chose for this E3, it just felt kind-of out of touch. The ""intermissions"" really irked me."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"DYUM spiderman looked so smooth, can't wait to swing around the city bringing back the Ps2 spider2 feel love it.

More kojima news is good new to me also some more clips of KH3 with gameplay thank god my childhood cannot wait.

Last of us looked the gameplay looked almost like a scripted cut scene with the reactions to getting shot/slashed even the way the enemy dialog sooooo good.

good fucking job sony!!!"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Well. I'm whelmed.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Sony's games were really strong, but Microsoft still had the best conference. Sony showed 9 games, main titles not receiving release dates besides Spiderman. Still have no idea what Death Stranding is. Spiderman/TLOU/Ghost were definitely the highlights but that's all."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,[deleted]
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Besides the big gap between last of us and the rest of the conference, I liked that they went from game to game to game with no wasted stops to talk to game developers. Even after major game trailers. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Am I the only one who thought Sony's conference was no where near as good as Microsoft's?
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Pretty meh conference tbh. Nothing blew me out of left field. A lot of what I expected. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"After Microsoft's presentation I just can't see how people think Sony nailed this presentation. Largely trailers for games with already seen, little gameplay of the games we HAVEN'T seen, bad pacing (music solos? Really?) and not many titles shown, lots of technical problems...

This was on the same level as Square Enix and Ubisoft to me."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I am probably in the minority, but I thought that conference was pretty meh bordering on bad"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Spider man is gonna be awesome, thanks alot for this dude"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Ghosts looks like shadow of mordor in Japan, so that looks fun. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Less than 20 minutes of games once you put in all the music solos; unexplained music bits; how could anyone think this won? It had some quality in it but overall? Lukewarm
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Honestly, I think Sony losing to Xbox at this years E3 is a good thing for us gamers. It gives Xbox a better ""push"" forward in the race so Sony isn't dominating, and if a company dominates, they stop trying (...like here, i guess). Of course, Sony won this gen 100%, but competition is good for the industry. Sony might be in the position where they *have* to make a new LBP game or a Jak game, and who doesn't want that?

With that said though, wow. No MediEvil, only 3 new games, probably not all exclusive to Sony, and Sony's Twitch crashed. 

Bethesda (TES fan here) > Xbox > Sony > Ubisoft > Square > EA

Here's hoping Nintendo can redeem this E3. Personally hoping for a new F-Zero."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Want to give you a big thanks! Really love all of these you've done! One more conference to go!
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Great looking games, but terrible conference IMO. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Your bias definitely shows.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Man that was quick. Thanks!
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Ghost of Tsushima, Nioh 2, Spiderman all looked sick. Control is interesting looking as well. Solid overall."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Game reveal wise Microsoft killed it this year.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Look, admittedly the conference definitely picked up in pace after they moved rooms.

But seriously? *That* much time on TLOU? A fifteen minute intermission with Sony's own fake ""press roundtable""? Musical concerts are nice but only when you have momentum. No release dates except for RE2? Just four showcase titles that felt super scripted? No developers talking about their games? No other announcements?

This year was Sony's conference to lose--they had so much momentum and such strong drive behind them. And then they blew it.

Nintendo not factored in, my current ranking is definitely as follows:

1. Ubisoft - Killed it in every sense, except I wish more new game announcements happened.
2. Microsoft - Tons of focus on the games, the console's ability to make playing games easier, and acquisitions that will make the next generation WAY easier on them. I preferred Ubisoft, but Microsoft was damn close.
3. Bethesda - Pretty good. Some high moments, some low moments, some great reveals, and some points where we were left with two many worrying questions that shouldn't have been there.
4. Sony - Good games content, but a clusterfuck of a show.
5. Square Enix - Basically nothing new, just trailers, and almost all repeats. Why did they even have a conference?
6. EA - Lolwut?"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I was pretty underwhelmed.  The last of us and spider man looked good, none of the other games piqued my interest, really.  Hoping Nintendo has some surprises tomorrow."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Where the fuck was Red Dead
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Definitely a little bit biased with your overall review there. Games were good  of course but the random intermission and overly long instrumentals kind of killed the momentum.

A lot of the gameplay show also looks scripted with characters slowly walking into perfect set ups. Spiderman looked the best from a gameplay point of view I would say."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Spiderman: Arkham City﻿
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I'm sad
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Still no idea what the fuck is Death Stranding. No FFVII at all which is weird and a little concerning now. I suppose after KH3 they will talk about it more.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"To anybody complaining about no Red Dead Redemption 2:

There were no indications RDR2 would be shown. Rockstar doesn't do E3. They don't really like to share the spotlight with anybody else. I can understand you wanting to see something (because I do too), but it was never going to be there so you were setting yourself up for disappointment. I mean, maybe they'll show up in the next few days, but I wouldn't count on it."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Pretty boring considering how many of them we've known about and seen over and over. Last of Us still has no release date. What killed me the most was the lack of variety, other than KH3 and Trover, it felt like I was watching a bunch of really long movie trailers. They all are hyper realistic, story driven, third person and more zombies than I'd like to have in a single conference.

Don't get me wrong, they are astoundingly beautiful and will probably have great story and gameplay. It just felt a bit empty."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,That was bad
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I'm actually playing Spiderman at Sony this week, it's ridiculously fun. Reminds me a lot of Prototype 2. Unlock new Spiderman skins as you level up. Really fun, coming from an Xbox gamer too."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,That wasn't good.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Didnt expect Nioh 2. 1 was incredible, the combat was better than Souls/borne games, but the enemy variety could use some work. Hopefully they'll fix that up."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"As a fan of Eastern aesthetics and culture, I love how many games this year are going the feudal Japan route."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The games shown are looking great, and I'm sure they could have pulled together another dozen games that are 4-5 years away from completion and shocked the audience.

But honestly the structure and presentation of this show was awful. When they are sinking millions into putting this show on for the world why does it come off feeling like a rushed high school presentation? "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,RIP FF7 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I was disappointed by this one . It was the worst one for them in years . no real future games except control . I want to see future games too . Days Gone was a no show and RDR2 was a no show !!! 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"To be honest, I love showcase of gameplays than multiple trailers or teasers. At least I know what I'm getting with my money. Too many people are hyped up with a 3 mins scripted trailer but ended up getting a game that is no way comparable to the hype it garnered.  "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Thanks again u/Loffeno! 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I get what they were trying to do with the start but that intermission dragged and took away from the rest of the content even though the integration of the church setting into TLOU was sublime.

IMO, they should've started with Spider-Man and ended with TLOU. Spider-man is 3 months away and is prime for the start of your showcase and then you end with the long term AAA release. Nonetheless, the footage for both looked great

As for the rest, that Samurai Game looked amazing as did Control. Still not sure what Death Stranding is but it should be cool and atmospheric. KH3 adding pirates is terrific as well. 

The only game I didn't really care for was the Roiland game and I'm too young to have much hype for RE2.


I was hoping we would get information on 1 other superhero project; either Rocksteady's alleged Superman Game or Square's Avengers Project but that proved to be too high a hope. 

ALL in all, great footage but poor organisation and structure of a presentation. Bring on Nintendo!"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,After The Last of Us Part II showing it didn't matter what came next. I was happy.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Am I the only one who just doesn't get how TLOU is people's favorite game of all time? I think it was just so hyped and by the time I played it, it felt like a bit if a let down. I'll still play the sequel just can't get as hyped about it as others."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"If you missed it,  do yourself a favor and check out the gameplay demo from after the presentation. Can't find it on YouTube yet but it is beautiful. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,You the real MVP for this break down. I totally forgot Sony's breifing was tonight
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Something to add is they said there will be New Game + in God of War during that intermission 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Here I am, just wishing Rocksteady would announce what they’re doing, ever, at all..."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The good... the games.  A couple of game I already knew I wanted, a couple that I might be interested in.  A couple meh games that looked pretty.

The bad... the over 2 hours it took them to show 10 games.  Could have done a lot better with the pacing getting to the meat of the presentation."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Based on this conference, is the next PlayStation going to be at the next E3?"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Looking forward to Sony's new exclusive game: ""The Adventures of Flute-Man & Banjo-Boi"""
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Meh. Not a great conference, some good games but no surprises really. At the minute Xbox have still had the best conference, but of course Nintendo will probably steal the show yet again, can't wait til tonight!"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Why the fuck did they do that long intermission, I thought Sony knew how to layout things by now "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"After reading this chat, I genuinely don't understand the fighting over console exclusives and their value. I suppose I come from a weird place in the fight since I own both consoles anyway, but I still find the fighting over which console has better exclusives and wanting a ""winner"" between Xbox One and PS4 to be stupid. Do you need validation for your purchase decision?"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Why is no one talking about re2?? They're remaking a classic from the ps1 era and it's freaking amazing! 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Ghost of Tsushima reminded me a lot of Assassin's Creed. I don't know if that's a good or a bad thing.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Dying at all these people complaining about not being blown away by some big announcement when they literally said they weren't doing that. 

Edit: And what the fuck is with this whole obsession with you all and ""winning"" E3? Who the hell cares? Is it just something meaningless you can all beat your dicks about? "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,More spidey fuck yeah!
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Death Stranding stole the show. Looks amazing. My frustration on Silent Hills being cancelled has subsided.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,You honest to goodness think Sony is winning E3?? I honestly wouldn't rate their show much above EA's to be totally honest. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Hearing that the inFamous guys are behind Ghost of Tsushima is very hype inducing. inFamous 1 and 2 were amazing games and i can't wait to see where they take this new IP.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I'm pretty suprised they didn't show more. Maybe they're being stretched thin for content inbetween E3, they're own show and Gamescom?"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,What’s “New Game+” when talking about a game? I’ve seen this a couple times this E3 and I’m not sure what that even means. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Only excited for Spider-Man 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,During the fake roundtable thing they straight up said not to expect any big announcements or surprises. They didn't lie about that at least.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Spiderman: Release September 07, 2019; one of the villains you are missing is Mister Negative
"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Ghost of Tsushima and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice in the same E3?

We now Samurai boys and girls!"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Can't wait any longer for Spiderman. Finally a good one after Spiderman 2. 
Also I was hoping for REmake 2 and yep there it is"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,What the heck happened to Days Gone ? They showed the Game for the last 2 years and now they just throw some random frames of it into the VR Part ?

My favourite game of all time being completely remade, I can't fucking wait baby!!!!!!

"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"As someone without a leg in the race between Xbox and Sony neither really blew me away, Sony's conference however had too much cringe compared to Microsoft... the intermissions were beyond annoying the first time I just wanted to click away so I did and I came back after like 10 minutes and they were STILL on the fucking intermission! Over all so far my favorite conferences were Bethesda and Ubisoft just eaking out over Xbox sony wasn't nearly as bad as EA or Square enix tho."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Sure, if we ignore several 10 minute intermissions, and three concerts, it was ""non\-stop games""....

It took like 30\+ minutes to get to the first reveal. The format was ass. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I’m surprised no one is talking about the Resident Evil 2 remake! I’ve wanted this for so long. That game was one of the first games I played as a kid, and was by far my favorite Resident Evil game. 

Looks like the release date is fairly close too. Sooo excited. "

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,That last of us 2 gameplay was so Clean. I'm having a hard time believing that's actually gameplay.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I was very let down by Sony. Everything we see we already knew was coming. What is there to get excited about it?
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"This felt a lot like last years conference to me. A lot of games that look absolutely incredible but seem highly scripted and will most certainly receive a graphical downgrade prior to launch. Especially considering there weren’t even release dates. I want games that are coming this year, not a reason to look forward to next E3.

And where was Days Gone?"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,More like the E3 Press Let Down
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Pretty lame

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,">Sony killed it as usual

I'm not a ""fanboy"" of any one platform as I'm happy to play on them all... but this was the worst presentation of this E3.

The games they showed were fine, but the presentation itself was just so bland.  A friend of mine pretty much nailed it \- ""this is like watching CNN's Election coverage"".

>Definitely winning E3 for me right now

I've got to strongly disagree.  There were no new big game reveals, no surprises, very little momentum, and minimal excitement.

Sony absolutely has some amazing games coming out in the next year, but I felt that they totally dropped the ball on firing up their fans with this presentation."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Every single game in that conference looked great. That was fantastic.

The pacing was awful though, that huge gap between TLOU and the rest of it was unacceptable.

The big highlights are:
E3's best KH3 trailer

Spider Man

Ghost of Tsushima was a very pleasant surprise, will definitely be following it

REmake 2"

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"""the rest of the show, it was non-stop games, literally no one talking on stage. ""

It was literally half the show at least it seemed of intermissions with them talking with people from the studios.  I personally didn't feel like they showed that much. Most of it was stuff we already knew about. It felt as if they didn't have a lot to show, so they used tons of filler content like the interviews, music, instruments, etc."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I didn't much care for it. That intermission really killed the pacing, and made me not even care about Ghost. Control looked alright. Resident Evil 2 made me most excited. The Rick & Morty-esque game didn't look good. Nioh 2 was such a cocktease. Death Stranding looked really good. And Spider-Man as the closer pissed me off."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,For a person who doesn't own a ps4 it was fairly poo :/
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"It was terrible; the intermission was ridiculous, it dragged on way longer than any conference showing so little has any right to, and we didn't even learn much. The Last of Us II will be great, but the trailer looked pretty scripted and didn't tell us *that* much. Ghosts of Tsushima is probably gonna be good, but nothing in that showcase made it look fresh or unique at all compared to all the other open world games everyone is making nowadays. Death Stranding still feels like we know just as little about it as in 2016, so it feels a bit odd we spent so damn long on it. Lastly, Spiderman was the best they did actually showing something off, but most it didn't seem that new compared to what we knew from last year. Everything else was glossed over extremely quickly."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Terrible conference. I am a sony fanboy all day long and i was SO HYPED for this one. Felt like a big let down. They just threw some trailers on a screen. Didn't even talk about thr new titles at all and kept subjecting us to that horrible fucking intermission panel. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I think if Square combined with Sony, it would turn out much better. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Holy hell this was a bad conference. Glad they at least had Ghost of Tsushima because all the rest is anywhere from mediocre to downright abysmal.

(Besides Bethesda, but 76 doesn't look like my thing and ES6 and Starfield are too far out to get hyped about). Really don't care about AssAss Creed, The Divison, Halo, or Gears of war. Just my preference, but TLOU 2, Spiderman, and Ghosts of Tshusima were the games that had actual gameplay footage that I am most excited for. Death Stranding may be sweet too, but really, it's all just confusing intrigue at this point."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Stayed up for the Xbox conference and was disappointed. Didn't stay up for the other ones and don't regret it. Maybe I'm getting old but these conferences just aren't exciting anymore. I don't even think it's because of the leaks. I miss the hiccups and fuckups. Now you just have one guy on stage and a load of pre-recorded videos. Hardly any live gameplay stuff. May as well just be a Nintendo Direct if they pull this shit.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Nothing about Destiny 2, I’m surprised"

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Ghost of Tsushima just made me cry a little. It is just beautiful beyond words. Death Stranding is just fascinating. It's just peak Kojima. Déraciné looks like the kind of game I could absolutely love and it's made by the great gaming melancholic Miyazaki himself! I'll watch that very closely. Didn't really care for the rest.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,TLOU also has pistol silencers.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"So, no ff7 remake ?

also this all package games in ps4, is this part of the limited edition kingdom hearts 3 or something separate entirely ?"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,">Some gameplay sections of characters walking, but they showed different characters (so there may be multiple playable characters)

For me it looked like, its still Reedus but with short hair. if you notice the scene where he pulls out his toe nail you can see its Reedus, but got shorter hair. A few scenes later, shortly before he pulls out his ""gun"" from the ""suitcase"" you can see he got a little pony tail. so i assume you have a growing hair mechanic like in witcher 3."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"holy shit, don't read the comments on the YT video for the trailer for Control (remedy). Sony fanboys claiming it's an exclusive and xbox fanboys claiming sony is out of ideas so they are ripping off quantum break.

even though it's not an exclusive..."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I was including some of the smaller ones like Tunic and Ori as well. I only do that because No Man’s Sky was considered an exclusive even though it eventually came to Xbox. A lot of the smaller games they showed that were launch exclusives. If you go by major releases, then yes, I agree with you. Otherwise if you go by timed exclusives along with major releases, I’d say the point still stands. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Now that we’re getting KH3, I have a feeling Death Stranding won’t come out for another 5 years..."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Hmm that open world japanese game sounds good but thats really all that peaks my interest. Too many artsy-movie style games. At least there will be non exclusives to play.

It should be noted that I have never watched E3 before and haven't followed the gaming scene for about 6 years so I have no idea if these games look amazing or if they are just the norm now."

The games as usual were awesome and love that Sony first party deals primarily with single player games. I would say the show was awesome and this year both Sony and Microsoft had a good show at E3"

I dont really care for the artsy titles or spiderman, and the last of us... i need to see someone with a controller playing a  actual level that isn't scripted beyond  belief. Didnt show anything about days gone really. RE2 was the only reveal announcement i think. Death stranding is looking... weird, but not singing I'm sure I'd pay to play. I think my only excitement was for Nioh 2. Cause i loved the first one. Abd Shadow of... whatever looked cool, like a real samurai rpg almost. 

But yeah over all it was... meh. Was hoping for some spyro or Medi-Evil news. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"“Trailers for games that have already been seen”

Not entirely true. The Destiny 2: Forsaken Story Reveal was new. It depicted Cayde-6, a fan-favorite character, kneeling, battered, worn, and alone. He is slowly surrounded by the Scorn, who are seemingly being led by Prince Uldren. One of the Scorn snipes Cayde’s ghost, and then Uldren proceeds to kill Cayde using Cayde’s own weapon, the Ace of Spades."

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Was really disappointed by Sony this year. Not very many surprises or new games we didn't already know about were announced or shown.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"You know what I dont like about Sony conferences? They dont talk about the games between trailers, its just trailers one after another. I guess the majority of people dont like the talking and just want to see games, but I really miss it when its not there."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I have to be honest, this was underwhelming. I'd say it was only slightly better than EA's, and on par with ubisoft. It makes me feel like they are planning on dumping the PS4 next year and they didn't want to push out a ton of new games. 

The stage switch was totally unnecessary too. Just show us some fucking games."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The last of us 2 looks amazing obviously. And ghosts of tsushima is something I’ve wanted ever since way of the samurai, I was erect for the whole trailer. But sadly, as big of a kingdom hearts fan as I am, KH3 just doesn’t do anything for me. Maybe it was what they showed but something just seemed off. I’m not a fan of frozen and tangled so maybe that’s what’s putting me off. I’ve waited half of my life for KH3, I just want it to be good and right now I’m a little nervous "

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Sony did great but I am obligated to say the conference was shit bc no FFvii announcement. I seriously hyped myself way too much and that pretty much ruined the whole conference for me.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I think Sony are being very clever here, it's obvious they have a ton of new games in the pipeline but they're holding anouncements back until the games are closer to completion.

The situation with few exclusives at Microsoft makes this doable in my opinion.

I've a feeling that they may be holding a few back for next gen also. I can see a ps5 announcement next year."

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I know KH series waz a Sony exclusive but I am pretty salty that they aren't bringing the previous games to Xbox. I mean why the hell not? If they're gonna bring KH3 to Xbox why not let Xbox players have the previous games? So tHt fans who maybe dont have a PS4 relive the series as well.

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"As a TLoU specialist, Ellie cannot craft Bombs (but she can Smoke Bombs), and they've changed the ingredients for crafting: Sugar is gone, Binding is gone (so no more melee upgrades or they only take Blade), Scrap is added. It looks like Rag is also gone replaced by Gasoline.

Overall, this should make the crafting a bit better in the story, although I wonder what Med Kits will take to make, given the legit choice in the first game to make Molotovs or Med Kits on the harder difficulties."

Can't do much but swap em out and go find the dude that rekt it and slap him haha"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,is there a video for spiderman?
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Happy cake day!!!
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I'm primarily a Sony fan but, good lord.. the stream is just an absolute shit show.  People going through one room to another? What's up with that? The presentors are doing some cringy impromptu talk. A guy picking up the signal and talking while one of the presentors is playing the Spider-Man demo. A weird cut between the trailers and the musical thing. 

Solid games though, especially with Ghost of Tsushima. The whole Sony E3 presentation is an accurate depiction of “Good idea, terrible execution.”"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Its funny because I was watching the stream with little to no audio at work and i thought the conference was amazing. Came to the stream just for the Last of Us, but watched the whole thing cause I was basically hooked with just seeing the trailers lol."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"In the trailer they said that the monsters ""fastforward"" you. I think they carry cloned fetus of themselves so when the monsters attack, he ages rapidly and gets eaten while the fetus also ages to become an adult him and carries over the memories somehow"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Pretty sure Kojima and Norman just did a bunch of acid and fucked around in a CGI studio 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"new world is fucked. Beings cause time to slip forward. Infrastructure all shit cause gets fast forwarded and crumbles. Humanity relies on special couriers to transport stuff. Couriers have ""extinction"" markers, either DNA or some innate shit that allows them to sense these beings that fast forward time. Couriers carry their baby clones with them hooked to their consciousness via a cord. If they get caught by the beings and go forward in time their body will whither and die, the baby will fast forward and become an adult while the consciousness is uploaded from old body to new (quote in trailer about Norman Reedus surviving if caught but the area around him will become a withered crater.)

Famous people each different courier companies. Maybe combat, lot's of hiking"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It's a multiplayer Battle Royale game.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It's a survival game where you deliver boxes.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,The madness of Kojima and Del Toro. I can't wait
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I have no idea what I watched or any idea what the game was about or what you do.

Yeah confused as ever.
"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Classic Kojima. 

Game feels like one whole movie trailer. 

Hope to see more details soon. Saw one guy packing a gun in the trailer. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Srsly, it looks awesome but when are we going to get a solid gameplay video?"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,[removed]
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,For me I want to have NO idea what I’m getting into when I pick up the game (whenever that will be). It’s so mysterious I’m excited. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Human mule simulator 2020
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Every time I see more of it, a few things make more sense and basically everything else makes less sense, every time I think I've pieced together a plausible theory the next trailer fucks it all up.

What kind of a fucked up drug you need to take to think of those kinds of things"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I love how Kojima mooned everyone, and no one remembers and everyone confused as fuck."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"A clusterfuck, the proper term is a clusterfuck.

"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,You walk around with babies n sh*t
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,A studio let Kojima do whatever he wanted.  Kojima's a crazy talented but I think he's nuts.  I'm fearful that the game is going to be a big mess because noone is there to tell him 'No'.  That being said I think there are going to be some elements that are going to be sensational because of that.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Given how close KH3 is, it's no surprise that they want to keep the focus on it. I imagine we'll see a lot more of FFVII next year"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It will be coming to PS5 now
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It's probably put aside for PS5 now. There's just no way it's ever coming to this system.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"They pretty much fired everyone working on it and started from scratch, so we won’t see much for a while and when we do it will probably look completely different from what we have seen. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It killed the conference for me. I really don't know why they did it. They had the formula for these things figured out.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"There was no surprise, no real excitement. You could hear it in the audience. Red Dead would've saved it, because Death Stranding and KH3 were just utterly confusing.  At the end I kept exclaiming to myself that people actually paid for the privilege to see it in person. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Irked is the word. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I'm going to predict that's like the first fight, you have all the dope ass powers, slaying dudes left and right, get to the big fight, knocked out, hurt, someone miraculously saves you, you've lost a lot of your strength and training, then it's on to grinding to get to that dope ass Spidey again. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Spiderman looks sick with the fluid web slinging mechanic. I pity Vulture because he got webbed/kicked/dropped in every scene he appeared in with Spidey. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It's insane that we're getting so many villains in one game. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"\+100 upvote points for mentioning the PS2 spiderman 2. Was the best Spiderman game out there. And a completely different game than it's PC release, somehow.  


Last Of Us was always like that, smoothly and seamlessly connecting the gameplay with cinematics, to the point where you're sure you're making all the decisions and yet it's all scripted to give you the best story possible. Seems even better here, with some amazing AI behavior, hope it won't change too much on that front."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I'm let down tbh
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I honestly was waiting for the main show, and just now noticed the stream said post-game show. Thought it was looking hella hype if this is what they started with. Still want most of them, but certainly super whelmed as well."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,how? they had amazing games. i guess only a few though
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Microsoft came in strong and set the bar high. I have been disappointed by everything after. Nintendo should be a treat though 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Yeah I have still have some grudges against Microsoft but they hands down had the best conference.  Just game after game with a couple minute talks for their major releases.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I totally agree with you even when I don't have a Xbox and will probably get all the games Sony showed, I think Microsoft's was  indeed better, presentation and content wise."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,They also showed mostly multi platform games that are also coming to the ps4 though. So half their conference may as well have been part of Sony’s anyway. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Microsoft had the better conference but you can still play all of their games on pc and most of the ones they showed also on PlayStation so Sony will continue to dominate them. Mostly every game PlayStation showed is only on PlayStation (maybe nioh goes to Xbox also?) . Also Sony literally said they were changing it up this year and instead of announcing tons of games they were going to deep dive on 4 big games which they did, long gameplay sequences of tlou2 and Ghost of tsushima and Spider-Man and pretty long trailer/gameplay(?) of death stranding. I would prefer a mix of both maybe like deep dive on games soon to come out like Spider-Man while also revealing more new games but I absolutely loved the big gameplay sections from tlou2 and ghost so I can’t really complain. I think they will see how this did and change it up again for next year."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Quantity doesn't beat quality, at least for me. I was only interested in a few of the 50 games they showed, as I assume most is the case for most people. Not to mention only 18 of those games are exclusive and a majority of those are platformers or other small indies. I still think Sony's exclusives are stronger, but I'll be picking up Halo and a few others."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"This surprises me. I really didn't care much for Microsoft's presentation. It felt like a shotgun blast where they just hoped they showed enough things that something would stick while Sony had a much more curated presentation.

All personal preference of course, but when Sony gets me excited about the same number of games as Microsoft did while showing off a fifth as many, that's impressive to me."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,There were game trailers?
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Also despite being a short list, everything looked extremely polished and unique and almost entirely gameplay trailers."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,why stop to talk to developers about games we've known about for over a year?
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Yeah all four of them
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,You're definitely not the only one.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I think that's the general consensus, but fanboys seem to be arguing with anyone who has that opinion "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Conference wasn't as good as MS - agreed. Microsoft caught some steam coming out first. Even with a lot of multiplatform titles, it still won due to a good pacing, structure and just the fact that it showed those games first. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Yeah what happened to the massive release trailer rapid fire? They're 3/4 filler time like all the other shitter companies now.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Yes and i own a playstee. Sonys focusing too much on weird eccentric movie style games. Every game is some attempt at an edgy philisophical drama and after working all day, thats the last thing i want to focus on."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I agree with you. Structurally, it was horrible. Revealing only one new game in the first 30 minutes of a show is a bad call, no matter what the game is. Then to have an intermission afterwards because they had to shuffle everyone from one hall to another? Terrible idea. It's like they tried to come up with a cute gimmick but they could've had a bunch of reveals in that time instead and had a better show."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"If microsoft just showed **their** games, would you be saying the same thing?"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"i feel like something went wrong with their original plan.  The extra long break after showing TLoU2 was weird and felt improv.    And then they revealed a new game by From Software after the conference appeared to be done, that a bunch of people missed.  ~~Apparently they didnt even show the trailer on the playstation stream, it was only shown on the Twitch stream lol~~  *edit: guess not.  my friend said it wasn't on the PS stream, but he must've just missed it*.  And God of War is getting a new game+ mode, but it wasn't mentioned in the conference.     
  
the game trailers were awesome, but the conference format was really awkward. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"With only 1 of the 4 tent-pole games having a release date in 2018. We’ll be lucky if TLOU2 is 2019, but death stranding and ghost are most likely 2020. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Because Microsoft was showing third party games that are most of a greatest hits of E3 2018, and less showing you reasons to buy their system.

Openingly admiring they're just now buying studios to make games for them, not even actually telling you any names, screams that they don't give a shit about Xb1 at this point."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,You're probably in the majority then
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"After the first 35 minutes or so, I was ready to say it flat-out sucked.

It picked it up later, but damn that was a lot of painful waiting."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Same, other than TLOU everything was meh. Death stranding just looks meh, think Kojima isn't half as good at making games as people say he is. Spider man looks pretty generic for a super hero game. The samurai game looked okay but didn't look like anything that hasn't been done before. Conference and its games were lackluster. Nothing really that pushes or makes me hyped."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Honestly that’s the game I’m most excited for from PlayStation. I don’t get the hype for last of us. It looks the same. I’m sure I’m gonna play it anyways 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,if this game has a nemesis esq system i’ll venmo you 100$
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"That Last Of Us gameplay felt 20 minutes long by itself, so awesome"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,[deleted]
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Dude Nintendo won this E3 before it even started. Everyone knows that.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Less than 20 mins? Besides the gap feom Last of Us to the rest and the 2 music solos, it went from trailer to trailer with no cuts. Other conferences waste as much time with developer interviews or more. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"They didn't show 20 games that were multiplatform, not sure how that even matters.

You can tack on a vast majority of what Microsoft showed, being ps4/xb1 releases, to what Sony had tonight."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The Banjo music was essetially the theme for TLOU. The random fruit was from the game Dreams that was explained. The music before Ghosts of Tshusima may have been unexplained but fit with the theme. Didn't really watch the other conferences so not  making a statement there either way, but I enjoyed the music and didn't find it unexplained."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Each to their own but I thought the Bethesda conference was bad. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Give this man more upvotes, he knows what's up. More competition is good for the industry. Let them fight each other - we'll be the ones to profit. I also hope Nintendo steps up with more games from their ignored franchises. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"How did they lose?

Because Microsoft will release a Forza game in 2018?

They showcased a bunch of third party games that you can keep buying on your PS4.  They didn't show anything that would make someone buy an Xbox 1 at this point in time, if they haven't already."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,If you are a tes fan I don’t see how you can put Bethesda first after seeing that blades bullshit. I have never seen something more cash grabby and terrible in my entire life. I thought it was another joke like the Alexa thing for the entire time Todd was talking about it. I honestly still can’t believe it’s real. And a 34 second clip saying tes6(which Todd already said last year they were making) in no way makes them the best conference. For me Bethesda was 3rd last (ea and squenix were worse) and I am a fucking massive tes fan.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Shoudn't it be Microsoft and not Xbox? I own both PC and PS4 and I have no desire to buy an Xbox because I know I can play all the games on my PC. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"This does not change the race at all. I have both consoles. Play my PS4 a lot more, but not solely. Sony has sold twice as many units and will continue to do so. XBOX is not gonna reframe the race this late.

Sony has not stopped trying. That’s ridiculous. They tried something different and it failed. Their messaging has been consistent. Deeper around our core exclusive titles this year. They have worked to cultivate the best and deepest talent filled studios, and it worked. They focused on those stories. 
"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Is that samurai game a PlayStation exclusive?  
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Hell yeah that 6 second clip of Nioh 2 was sick it got me *s^o^o^o^o^o^o* hyped.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I thought Control was going to be a psi-ops sequel watching the trailer. I’m really interested in where they go with that game
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The Microsoft one felt a lot like, ""Look we are getting all these previous PS4 exclusives too"". While Sony's was like ""Here you go a lot of gameplay and story on our new exclusives"". Felt like Microsoft was playing catch up (obviously not for all the games).

Ubisoft did a good job indeed, and I'm not hype on Bethesda's games so for me Sony did a great job, perhaps second best to Ubisoft (first place for me at least as I am more interested in the titles Sony showed).
"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Rockstar never attends E3
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The point of last of us is how scripted the game flows. It's a movie, it needs it's script. Spiderman looks really fun, but the last of us will be fantastic. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,The arkham games are just Spider-Man: Splinter Cell
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,People are just surprised because sony has marketing rights
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"That's great to here. That and Horizon 4 are my hype games this winter


Maybe RDR2 but I still have the first one in its plastic "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Holy crap, Prototype is one of my favourite open world games, and I don't usually enjoy openworld gameplay. But that game did traversal and fighting very satisfying. Got more hype from this comment alone.

"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I agree 100%
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Agreed, enemy, environment and weapon variety (different stats and colours for a weapon class is not variety) was seriously lacking. Also maybe have some static loot this time so that there is a reason to actually explore the levels?"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I can't believe they didn't show days gone. That game is releasing near kh3, Crackdown 3, Anthem, and the division. It needs all the promotion it can get"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,you can have gameplay in a trailer
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I laughed when I saw the Division trailer started playing . They try to hype it so hard with these beautiful trailers but the graphics aren't going to look half that good . Just like when they showed it the first time . 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Fans apparently only want an hour and half of teaser after teaser of games that won't come out for 3 plus years on consoles they don't own yet. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,No same here. Most overrated game ever for me.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Hype does nothing but ruin experiences for people. You want hype to garner interest, but when expectations are built to such insanely high levels, it gets to a point where there is no way the game can actually live up to them."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Am I the only one who just doesn't get how BOTW is people's favorite game of all time? I think it was just so hyped and by the time I played it, it felt like a bit of a letdown. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I kinda in the same boat as you but I can see why people love it, from a storytelling perspective is a video game masterpiece, if it wasn't just because I don't think the gameplay holds as equally I'd be praising it too.  "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"TBH I think the majority of sony exclusives are let downs they all get 10's then you play them and you sit there wondering why it got a 10 when most of their exclusives have become CRYTEK games (Look pretty but have terrible gameplay). But then again when you compare it to xbox that just seem to release terrible games, i think the whole standard of what is a good game now has lowered massively. The Witcher 3 is the only game worthy of 10/10 this gen."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"You may not like it, which is fine. But you can't deny that there is no game like it. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Same. Just feels like the same adventure type game that Sony keeps pumping out over and over. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Most of the people arguing over a console winner are children who don’t have bigger problems in their life to worry about. Those of us who are a bit older tend to let people enjoy the platform they prefer and don’t feel the need to cheerlead a mega corporation.  
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Mongol Witcher for me
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It's going to be open world - so for me personally that doesn't sound too exciting. But a samurai open world game does sound intriguing.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Doesn't change the fact that it was a clusterfuck of a conference.

Just because they set the bar low doesn't mean hitting that bar is any better.

And you can focus on only a few games, but damn, keep the momentum going all the way through. A 15 minute intermission? 2 musical sections? No release dates for anything except a remake? Very little active gameplay in 3 of the 4 main games?

It's not about being blown away by some big announcement. It's big underwhelmed by the fact that even with the bar they set, they executed terribly."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It's ok that their conference sucked because they said it was gonna be weak beforehand. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Honestly the fact that all that was shown was loosely scripted gameplay with ZERO release dates is an absolute fuck up, I mean these are games that have been announced for over two years (mostly), they should at least have a year or something."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"The gameplay looked like long boring walks from cutscene to cutscene, did we see the same thing?  "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"IDK, Death Stranding didn't have nearly as much actual gameplay or interaction to steal the show in any way.

It lost in pretty much every regard to TLOU2."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"You start the game over, but keep all the gear and levels from your first playthrough. The game is also made more difficult."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"He meant new villains announced, Mr Negative and Kingpin (Wilson Fisk) have already been confirmed before."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Nioh 2
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"They showed it a few days ago. Figure they didn't want to show Days Gone and TLOU2 too close together, get people confused. They announced the release date and showed a good trailer. Freaker animals all over that shit. ""The VR part"" was actually a recap of the games they had shown in the days leading up to the conference."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Last news on FF7 was ""it will release by 2023"". Not surprised it was a no show "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,They talked about it last week? It's out in february...
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Exactly, E3 needs to have a new game announced. I mean for me Microsoft is winning this year (even though I am a huge Bethesda fan) because they had a lot of new announcements and the stream was not a mess."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"If you were hyped you have only yourself to blame, since Sony had already made it very clear there wasn't going to be much (new) to be hyped about.

As a ""fanboy"" you should have known this."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"It was a bunch of Black Ops 1-2 maps, some 'classics', that I vaguely remember playing way back then, but they were good... I think? Ha."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,*Yes*
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,The author missed it; there’s a video up on the destinygame youtube channel of what was briefly shown.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"FF7 and TES6 are tied for the ""Duke Nukem Forever"" award, to be awarded sometime in the PS5 generation in 2022"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,The little we've seen of shenmue thus far makes it look unpolished as hell. That game is a long without and likely not ready to be shown.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"...

Considering it's a ps1 game, gonna say that you can just 'enhance' it."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I agree, I really like the longer gameplay segments however, especially that it helps see more of the game. I prefer a lot of what other conferences do with talking but I dislike half cutscene half gameplay mashup compilations, much prefer the gameplay reveal their games have."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Microsoft had no reasons to buy an Xbox 1 though, with Gears/Halo/Forza already having iterations on the Xbox 1. 

If that didn't sell you by now, chances are these new versions won't either.

Everything else was multiplatform."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"If you played the first one, that was a part of Ellie’s character that was fleshed out in the DLC and at least in this trailer, it juxtaposed how different her life inside her enclave is a complete opposite of the vicious and visceral nature of hers that was on display during gameplay. It wasn’t shoehorned, it fit already established character lore so I don’t get the idea this is propaganda at this point. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Like gay people and women exist? 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,What aren't you getting?  You play a guy making deliveries across a world that's undergone some kind of cataclysm.  You avoid the monsters and shoot guys. They strongly hinted at some kind of time warp mechanic where the monsters send you back in time.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Both Sony and MS have a shit-ton of ""Splinter Cell Re-Skin"" games where you watch a characters ass for 30 hours while taking cover and button mashing during cutscenes.  I applaud Splinter Cell and Resident Evil 4 for changing every single single player game into a clone of them.   And now I can add Breath of the Wild to the list.  For instance, Death Stranding is BotW but carrying large backpacks, TLOU2 is Splinter Cell/RE4 but with Lara Croft as the main character, Halo Infinite is BOTW but its first person.  Every single game is just ""Cover+Zombies"" or ""cover+lara croft again"""
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Did you just not watch the Microsoft conference or something? There was more pissing about in Sony's and a fraction of new games shown with gameplay in comparison.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,What?
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,/r/AsATlouSpecialist
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,What about the droid attack on the Wookies?
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Lol that was so weird 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Wait, when did it happen?"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,That was so weird!
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Apart from the services made under Gaikai (Vue, TV, etc) Sony cannot be called good at online services \*cough\* PSN \*cough\*."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,The original room they were in was built to be like the beginning of TLOU2 trailer. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Yeah. Where did that ghost game come from? Just visually stunning. Heard and saw nothing about it and suddenly they're showing off gameplay of it out of nowhere. Whole thing looked really sleek. But yeah, by the second musical number I was like...okay let's move it along already..."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Wtf did I just read? I need to watch the teaser.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"And they don""t just eat the new grown up version of you? "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Did i hear incorrectly?  I thought they said the rain fast forwards you, the monsters eat you."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,That is a good theory. If that is the case i am liking the sound of it. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Literally?

Edit: literally(.)"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Isn't Mads Mikkelsen on that project too?
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Aka what will be the best game until, possible, TES 6."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Last time that happened he named the game after the experience and Ac!d is by far one of my favorite handheld games of all time.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"ooh that's why plants grow around them, it's starting to actually make sense"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12," This feels like an entirely different thing from the Del Toro trailer though.  This is ghosts that eat you and cthulhu monsters, as opposed to zombie Nazi's.  Jar baby being the only really connection.  Are the zombies immune to the rain?  in league with Cthulhu? etc."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Just wait for metal gear: royale to be released from the heartless konami studio in a few months.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,[deleted]
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Seriously the whole game looks like ""Breath of the Large Backpacks"" - ""Can YOU walk 500 miles through empty wastland without tipping over?  What if we ADD ANOTHER BOX TO YOUR BACKPACK!  MWAHAHAA"""
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Fetus delivery.

Fetuber Delivery Co."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Those boxes were actually disguises. He was transporting people who turned into boxes. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Del Toro is not really involved. Just a cameo. Del Toro swore he wouldn’t work on a video game ever again after what happened with Silent Hills
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Maybe that's all you do. You just walk through the country side carry a big backpack for 50 hours.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,[deleted]
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"After MGS2's pre-release trailers, we should just assume none of the stuff we are seeing is even trying to explain what is going on or will even be in the final game. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Next year??? For fucks sake. I literally only bought my PS4 for FF7. I have a feeling I wont even get to play the fucking game until PS5 is out at this point.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,[deleted]
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,This reminds me of FFXIII Versus and waiting for years. God please no. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,My thoughts as well.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Ahh, that looks a lot better"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I hate that kind of thing, I don't want to be powerful then have it all taken away, like metroid or castlevania or darksiders or god of war. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I wonder if they’re taking a page from the Arkham games and having a Spider-Man rogues gallery where lots of villains are involved somehow.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"No WiLD, Dreams or Medievil? what the heck Sony?"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Microsoft definitely set the bar high, but I thought Ubisoft passed it. They had a great conference and had a really great balance of all the things I like to see in an E3 showcase. But then again, so did Microsoft.

Sony though was a mess.

EDIT: Not sure why the downvotes. Right now, Ubisoft and Microsoft are very widely seen as having the two best conferences thus far. Despite preferring Ubisoft's conference, they're both still pretty neck-and-neck for me."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-13,"I wanted to disagree until I saw what was in their conference. Holy shit.

Sekiro, Fallout, Kingdom Hearts, Tales of Vesperia might be interesting (haven't played that one yet), **Devil May Cry 5**, Cyberpunk...

Though seeing how none of those games are Xbox exclusives, I can see why some people didn't remember them as being in the Microsoft part of E3."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,[deleted]
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,That’s fine. Microsoft is trying to build Xbox into a brand and not a console. Exclusives are anti-consumer and eventually people will think back on game consoles like we do on DVDs. Microsoft is building towards the future after the the Xbox one launch flop while Sony rides the popularity wave for as long as it can. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,MS has the best console for multi-plats though so it's not too surprising to see them show those off
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Microsoft is pushin the play anywhere feature. Of course you can play them on pc too. That’s the point. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Quality over quantity.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"What do we actually know about TLOU? Death Stranding? Ghosts? RE2? Nioh 2? Control?

They could of talked about any of those games if they wanted to. I'd listen, but I also appreciate leaving that to the rest of the e3 days."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Every developer that talked at E3 was probably for a game we have known about for over a year. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"*10 

And how many of those can you play on Xbox? "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"And dropping Halo, Forza *and* Gears in the same conference? I don’t think that’s ever happened before!"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Sony fired most of there shots with the really good 2018 releases and is now left with a handful of games  not coming in the near future. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I believe so yes. If both companies only showed their games, Microsoft still would have shown more as they have 2 platforms essentially. No matter if you buy it on PC or Xbox, that’s a sale for MS and they just showed more by volume and possibly in quality depending upon your perspective. 

I love Sony and have owned my PS4 for twice as long as my Xbox, but as a matter of fact, Xbox just had more and stuff I liked and more in general. I liked the PS4 stuff, but if I’m buying or stuck with one right now, I’d go with Xbox due to the studio acquisitions and the sheer volume of games that are coming and will look good on it. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It looked like they went to a different building/tent or whatever it was just so a guy could play a banjo and watch TLoS 2 and then a 20 min break so he could change to play a flute in an entirely different building
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I was watching the Playstation stream on YouTube on PS4. No issues with my feed, saw the extra trailer."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I saw the trailer on the PlayStation stream. I really wanted it to be bloodborne 2 when they said From Software. I was bitterly disappointed.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,">Because Microsoft was showing third party games that are most of a greatest hits of E3 2018, and less showing you reasons to buy their system.

They showed ~~18~~ 15 exclusives, which is more than what Sony even showed in their entire conference. All to be released in the next 12 months.

>Openingly admiring they're just now buying studios to make games for them, not even actually telling you any names, screams that they don't give a shit about Xb1 at this point.

You are hugely mistaken, and it's a shame you'll be missing out on the benefits of their ecosystem because of it."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I don't think that's a good thing...usually a good thing is, ""That was so amazing it felt like it went by so fast!"""
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Seriously, what’s with the collared shirt over t-shirt look? It’s as bad as sneaning and needs its own name. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I thought Sony had it in the bag and that it was their conference to lose, and that Nintendo could steal it.

Now Microsoft is on top, Sony dropped the ball, and Nintendo is still a major unknown except for what is basically guaranteed Game of the Show (Smash Bros)."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I thought Xbox showed a lot of content after content without interrupting to much imo.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,You need you watch the Xbox conference before saying that.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"It clearly wasn't less than 20 minuites. LOU2 was 11+ minutes of footage alone.

It was prob 35-40 mins of stuff, not sure why OP said that number"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,So basically everyone wants what nintendo is doing and do a 20-25 minute reveal/trailer after reveal/trailer 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Not a lot of content aside from Fallout 76, but they did announce some pretty exciting new stuff. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Bethesda was really bad, they spent 20 minutes on a garbage mobile skyrim game (PORTRAIT MODE OMG!!!) Instead they show us one pictures of skyrim and starfield."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I believe he speaks only in terms of E3 conference. He doesn't disagree that this gen was won by Sony. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Why are you on every damn comment shit talking MS? It's okay that you're too poor to afford both consoles. But give it a damn rest.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Xbox is a Windows 10 Platform. That's what makes Microsoft's side of things so unique.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Yes. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Ghost of Tsushima is yes, Nioh 2 (Also Samurai) will be on PC (well the first one is anyways.)"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,It is indeed a PS4 exclusive.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Half expected it to be Onimusha at first.

But, this is just as sexy."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I was gonna say lmao. Did my stream cut or something? 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Ironic that you say that. I could not disagree more and think it's the exact opposite.

Not only did Microsoft show off way more exclusives (**fifteen**) with a ton of gameplay for almost every one, but Sony's gameplay couldn't have looked more scripted and tightly choreographed than it was.

Not only did Microsoft premiere a ridiculously high number of games, but Sony premiered **two** games, both with no gameplay, both multiplat.

I *still* don't know how much of Spiderman is QTEs and scripted sections because all the gameplay demos we get is so heavy in them. And Death Stranding still has nothing except walking around.

There were literally only two games where your description applied--Nier Automata and Kingdom Hearts III.

Sony showed one game for **fifteen minutes**, then had a **fifteen minute intermission**. Then it started to pick up. But all the while, all the bullet points I mentioned. And in the whole conference **one game got a release date**."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I mean, MS *are* playing catch-up. And judging by their conference, they're making the right moves. We'll have to see what comes from these 5 new studios, but Ninja Theory was a great call, along with finally bringing Playground games into the fold. All the rumours have been that the latter are working on a new Fable game, but I have a feeling that might be coming from the newly created Santa Monica instead. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,My problem is that Sony showed only 4 games and I would bet a hefty amount of cash that those same games will be shown at e3 again next year. (Excluding Spider-Man)
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,They show trailers occasionally at one of the major conferences
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,A 30 sec rushed gameplay in a 3 mins trailer doesn't tell me much of the game. I prefer they give us a dedicated 5-10mins of gameplay like Spiderman or God of War. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Same with Watch Dogs. I was immensely disappointed. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Ubisoft are a bunch of liars in my eyes at this point. I don't care what they announce or release any more, I know I won't be buying their games. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Make that 10 seconds...
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Am I the only one who just doesn't get how Katamari Damacy is people's favorite game of all time?  I think it was just so hyped and by the time I played it, it felt like a bit of a letdown."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Thrms fightin words
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Very little gameplay in 3 of the 4?

I'm trying to figure out which you thought had action then..."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,But they didn't show zero release dates. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Yeah, how dare they take their time to actually make good games. I like it better when they rush it to make quick bucks."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I hope to god it's not some sort of a walking simulator. But I do believe we'll have to deliver scavenged things, make money, and upgrade ourselves to be able to face tougher areas. I hope there'll be some sort of combat - but it's all guesswork at this point."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Oh that’s pretty cool, thanks for the explanation and breakdowns! "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I feel like Pirates of the Caribbean was a way for Square to test Unreal on making more realistic graphics in real time...
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I dont have a ton of time, i have trouble keeping up with all the news.   I was excited because Sony has not let me down yet!   And no, I dont have to blame myself at all.  An an international entertainment  company telling you are are going to deliver a poor product doesn't mean it isn't a poor product. Nor does it excuse them from it.  I'm not dealing in absolutes. Sony is still the shit and I love what they do! But a poor conference is a poor conference. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I looked it up and it said it was slums, jungle, firing range and summit."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Thank
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Definitely. While Xbox’s presentation of games was great, the actual content was lacking. I was looking for exciting new IP and I didn’t get that. Multi-platforms is nice, but with Microsoft’s drought of “not on PlayStation” content majority multi platform is not going to cut it. People are acting like Fallout 76 is an Xbox game because Xbox presented it. No. 

I can’t get excited for Halo because I played Halo 4 and 5. Why would I be excited for Halo after that? I’m cautiously optimistic. This really is the make or break moment with me when it comes to Halo. If the campaign is more garbage I don’t have to go back ever again. 

Not excited for Forza because driving games are just not me thing. I’ve played a bunch and I just don’t get the appeal. 

I never played gears. The concept and design just didn’t appeal to me. 

Crackdown is cool, but it should have come out 2 years ago. Based on what they did show nothing says it was worth 2 years of extra development time

I’ll get Ori 2 because it’s Ori and I’m a sucker for that crap. 

When it comes to Xbox, I was looking for a hook and I didn’t get one. It was a cool 2018/2019 showcase, but not a worthwhile Xbox showcase. 

Sony seems to have the opposite problem. They showed a few games, majority exclusive, but took a few too many steps into, “get on with it.” Funny, I said that Sony could be a few steps ahead of Xbox if Sony showed some gameplay. They did, but it was still lacking. They needed less gameplay and discussion and more games. They wanted to avoid the “oh, we’ll play this in 3 years” joke that has plagued them in past E3s. Double-edged sword I guess. 

Neither of them really hit what I needed them too. Both were close, and both were kinda meh. 

I don’t know. 6/10 for both. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I get where you're coming from, MS clearly need new IP's, and I doubt you'll find anybody  but the most fervent fan boys who'd disagree with that. But ""Gears/Halo/Forza already having iterations on the Xbox 1"" is such a weak argument. They're huge franchises that have massive followings. By that logic, why should anyone be getting hyped about TLOU2, we've already got one on PS4 (albeit a remaster)? Would people not be losing their collective shit if Sony had announced Uncharted 5?"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"<0.01% of actual combatants yet somehow they somehow manage to show up in every single cobat game now.

Very equality such progressive wow. Stronk and independant."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I agree. Enough suspense and setting for me to buy. Don’t need the whole game spelled out for me before I play it.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"It literally looks like a walking sim with added traversal design very similar to BotW. I was looking forward to it the first 2 years, but the ambiguity of it is just boring at this point. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Bet you’re fun at parties..
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,What about the Spanish Inquisition?

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I believe they announced it last year at E3. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"You read an accurate summary of the ""monsters"" mechanic. Something that was already hinted at in previous trailer, with people rapidly aging before our eyes, choosing to kill themselves over getting eaten and carrying the yellow tanks with them."

The black sludge advances on del toro so he immediately hooks in his baby. The planes and tanks have some weird black effect trailing from them indicating that they are not from current time and maybe brought back or forwards through timefall.

It's all very unexplained. Mad's has old skeleton soldiers that he drenched up from the dead. Idk if Mads has a strong extinction factor allowing him to not only see these time effects but also change them.

Ubi let down a lot of people with no Splinter Cell despite all the hype, Assassin's Creed was already leaked and people aren't as excited as usual because Origins is still new so they're starting to saturate like they did in the Rogue/Unity/Syndicate years, Siege took up a very long segment with no announcements except eSports BS.

I know it's all subjective, so in your opinion, why is Ubisoft up there with Xbox? I thought Xbox and Bethesda both killed it and Sony and Ubi are the next best as both had mediocre conferences with one or two great trailers (and both suffered from multiple A/V fuckups)."

However, exclusivity still makes PS seem vastly more special, even just timed ones.  just TLOU2 is solely making the PS a strong brand in my oppinion, whereas the xbox feels forgotten, and i just know microsoft launched a lot of things that i might consider for pc.   so it might build microsoft as a brand, but it imo it makes the Sony and PS stronger brandwise, as a console choice.   Games i wish i had on PC it makes me feel like, so that is doing it well imo (even if i surely wish it was avaible here). 
  Microsoft had a solid good presentation surely! "

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Actually at least half of them.

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Not being a fanboy but can you expand on this when saying - if both companies would only showed their games Microsoft would still win?   

If talking about major releases (or triple A as everyone addresses them nowadays):  

Microsoft has: Halo, Gears, Forza, Crackdown which are good franchises in their own right but it's nothing new.   

Sony has: Death Stranding, The Last of Us: Part II, Ghost of Tsushima, and Spider-Man with only TLOU2 being a sequel.  

So I would say they are kinda equal. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I think that is why it wasn't part of the ""main"" stream and was shown afterwards. It definitely didn't look like something that people would expect out of a From Software title. Not saying it will be bad, but I can see why people would be disappointed."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"\>They showed 18 exclusives

They really [didn't](https://ca.ign.com/wikis/e3/Games_at_E3_2018). The exclusives they did have were mostly small indie games/dlc. Both studios really only showed 2 or 3 big exclusives worth talking about. Spiderman, TLOU, Ghost of Tsushima, Death Stranding vs Forza, crackdown, gears, halo.

Big corps buying small studios shouldn't be a positive, it usually means tighter restraints on the studio which makes worse games, which results in the studio being shutdown and then you get C&C on mobile.

All in all no one really won E3, anything worth talking about won't be here for years."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Out of all the ""exclusives"" they showed only small Indies and Crackdown (which looks quite meh to be honest), Forza and gears are Xbox exclusives for real. The rest are coming to other platforms too.
Microsoft just basically stole all the big e3 announcements and made it seem as if they we're their own.

What has Xbox got so far? Sea of thieves, state of decay, Forza and halo?
Compare that to Horizon, Persona, Uncharted, GoW, TLoU, Nioh... Should I even keep going.

Microsoft is trying to sell a console at a higher price that the competition's with objectively worse games, and that's that."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"You do realize that Sony has far more exclusives than Microsoft, right?

Really, this dick-waving about exclusives honestly shows that you understand the One is fragile.

I loved my 360, and was rooting for the One, but they made some very severe mistakes and sank their own battleship.  Sony has outsold them and had vastly more exclusives over the life of this generation that are 1) high sellers, and 2) highly regarded by critics and gamers alike.

There's nothing to Microsoft's Xbox 'ecosystem' that isn't already available on the PS4.  Fucking Origin offers a lot of the services that Xbox One does.  ORIGIN.

Stop being juvenile.  It's okay to like the Xbox One, but give it a rest.  Microsoft's dick was massive last gen compared to Sony, and they went all flaccid this generation while Sony's knocking shit off tables just by turning around.  Here's to hoping Microsoft will do better next gen."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"A lot of people haven't mentioned this but they essentially have four conventions where they announce games; E3, Paris Games Week, Tokyo Game Show, and PlayStation Experience (More emphasis of E3 and PSX). This makes their E3 presentation a lot more lackluster because they actually save new games for PSX now. "

What reason do you have to buy an xbox again? Cause those two games already have xbox 1 interations, and the system sure as hell ain't doing that hot regardless."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Microsoft did not show 15 exclusive games. Literally every game shown there can be played on pc as well and all but 3 (gears, halo, forza) are probably also on ps4. Every game Sony showed except nioh and kh3 i believe (and I guess maybe re7 remake) are only on PlayStation. Also I vastly prefer these deep dives on games with actual gameplay instead of a random 1 minute cgi trailer. Like the Ubisoft beyond good and evil thing, yeah it’s pretty cool but we have no clue if it will look anything like that in game how it plays or anything. So maybe for people who only watch e3 Microsoft “won” but as a gamer Sony was vastly superior, and while Microsoft still insists on putting all of their games on pc as well as Xbox they will never outsell a Sony console, it’s just a fact of life."

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Oh please, I'm obviously not saying rush it but perhaps they shouldn't announce a game four years before it's probably gonna come out. Or they shouldn't wait until a couple of months before the game is released to actually announce a release date.

It's not about the development of the games, It's about the way they market the majority of their games, which in my opinion is really sub par."

- Extended, unscripted gameplay for their previously announced games.
- Tons of release dates, many in the near future (late 2018, early 2019)
- A live concert at the height of their momentum for Donkey Kong, followed by a release date
- The Star Fox crossover reveal
- Further post launch support for games that have *really* picked up since launch (For Honor, Rainbow Six Siege)

This purchase from Microsoft shows that it's a different Microsoft in control here. A post I saw the other day explains this perfectly;

https://www.reddit.com/r/microsoft/comments/8q82g2/microsoft_adds_five_big_gaming_studios_to_its/e0h8ts5

> The more I think about it, the more it seems like a choice that only a new Microsoft would make.
>

> The old Microsoft would have made massive, high-profile acquisitions with tons of money put into them. Instead, it's a new studio in SoCal headed by a reputable veteran and aimed at grabbing possible talent leaks from Hangar 13 and Infinity Ward, two studios that they have funded since their inceptions, and two studios that match the company's vision. The vision here goes along with Xbox Game Pass which aims to populate lots of small and mid-sized games and have a steady stream of them. The acquisition of Ninja Theory, in particular, is very highly applauded in this regard. It's not to turn the studio into AAA machine, but to support the ""Independent AAA"" methodology the company established with the last year's Hellblade.
>

> All of this feels very natural, with seemingly no clash of culture. It's no secret that Bungie and Rare did not get around very well with Microsoft Studios executives, but they have been trying to make better choices in the last few years. This acquisition news perfectly encapsulates that. Good choice."

I mean, other games such as Crackdown 3 were also shown off. Also, while 1 of each of those series got iterations thus far, neither was that good.

And if MS goes with the approach it looks like they are where they are gonna start pumping thier Xbox division with cash, PS could die in the next 2 generations from the sole fact that they dont have the money to keep up. MS can release consoles that dwarf Sonys in power and sell them cheaper to destroy Sonys console division because well, they can. They have the money for that loss to not put a real dent in them. Sont doesnt."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Just because there's a reason behind it doesn't mean it wasn't dumb in the first place.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"No they definitely should show them, but 75% of the conference shouldn’t be tune in next year for a release date."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,With no actual name.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,They have Spiderman coming out in 3 months at least

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I agree that they shouldn't announce games so early. Bethesda announcing TES VI now is nonsense, they obviously have absolutely nothing to show about it. 
With that being said, I feel like every game showcased during Sony's conference were already to the point of being announced. Surely it would have been better if they hadn't already been announced 1 or 2 years ago.

E3 became the dick-length contest we now know, pushing each dev to announce their games as soon as possible. I like that Sony is now willing to talk only about upcoming games and major hits they cannot afford not to (à la TLOU 2). They could have shown more, they are currently working on many games. Heck, they have FF7. They could have gone the easy way though they chose not to showcase it. I like that they stick to fewer games, already well developped. They'll release them as soon as they can don't worry about that."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,">  I'm obviously not saying rush it but perhaps they shouldn't announce a game four years before it's probably gonna come out

Yea, no one else at E3 has done that this year."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Indeed 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Because ever since then the market has been *over-saturated* with games trying to copy it. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-13,It looked like kh battle system with an FFVII skin. The actual release could be entirely different. 
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-13,"Ha! That’s mainly why I liked it. I personally don’t like FPS at all, though that seems to be the most popular. Different strokes for different folks"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Twitch chat absolutely blew up with hate when they started the music and dancing people to announce Just Dance (4?), but to be honest, even though it's really not for me it was fucking catchy and 10/10 advertisement."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Oh, I agree about that, I was just specifically talking about the amount of games. I was a little disappointed there wasn't more content concerning Siege."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"How is Forza Horizon 4 irrelevant? If racing games aren't your bag, fine, but you can't deny that that it's a stunning game and does have a huge following. It's been the best racing franchise in the market for some time now, I'd hardly call that irrelevant. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I mean Sony only showed 5 exclusives (TLoU, Spiderman, Ghost, Death Stranding, Trover). Not really a Forza fan, but it's hard to say it's not the best racing game out there."

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,">You can’t play 7 of them on Xbox

The only 5 were Trover, Death Stranding, TLOU2, Ghost of Tsushima, and Spider-man. All the others were multiplat.

>15 exclusives of which 90% were indies

Not only is that statement heavily reductionist and in complete denial that both Ori and Cuphead were two of the best games of their respective years, but it's also plain wrong.

I just went through the list of the exclusives with trailers and at least half are not indie."

Saying games like Crackdown 3 and Ori are hardly mentionable is absurd."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"It is a matter of tastes, but saying ""by far"" is a big exageration"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I'm not denying that. However, when Sony also focuses on PSX as it's other primary reveal conference it takes away from their E3 showing. The Last of Us Part II was announced last PSX and if it had been announced here everyone would have thought it was a better conference. Microsoft only focuses on E3 and it looks like they're actually trying to publish console selling games now. PSX is to blame for this year and last years conference not living up to expectations. 
EDIT: Think better of the Sony conference, not necessarily better than Microsoft's conference. "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"1h38 I think, so near enough. Flow of MS's conference was much better imo, even though it was longer. "

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I'm sure having made far, far more sales than Microsoft means that your lack of buying a PS4 will really hurt Sony.  Fight the good fight."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Totally agree, I just feel like I keep seeing trailers and clips for games and yet I don't actually know much about these games. The games look amazing but as far as I know they never come out and actually talk about what you do in the game, or the story in the game, and so I'm just left with so many questions.

Edit: I know that trailers can show you parts of the gameplay and story, but sometimes a small 5 minute video is representative of the game on a whole."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,Does that mean that everyone should do it?
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-13,Why would they release a gameplay trailer then make it completely different for release?
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Phew, I thought I was the only one that actually kind of likes the Just Dance segments.


Then again, its Twitch chat. Twitch chat hates and complains about absolutely EVERYTHING.


"
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"Microsoft's best selling point was their commitment to adding their biggest offerings to Game Pass. Their exclusives this year were not that exciting. Halo and Gears are good but not coming any time soon, and the rest are niche or small."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,You are right that Sony conference was poor. TLOU looks amazing but other than that it was average.

Along with content updates for

That is the most shameless shift of goalposts I've seen in a LONG time.

- Halo: Infinite - not indie
- Ori - indie
- Crackdown 3 - not indie
- Sea of Thieves expansion - not indie
- Forza Horizon 4 - not indie
- PUBG - not indie (or if it is, it's high profile enough that it shouldn't be sorted the same way)
- Session - indie
- Cuphead DLC - indie
- Gears of War 5 - not indie
- Tunic - indie

Those are the ones I counted so far, though it's incomplete. Of those 10 already, 6 are not indie. Two of the indies were top tier games of their respective years.

**By the way, I don't even own an Xbox One or a PS4.** I'm a Switch and PC gamer at the moment, and still more considering PS4 just for Bloodborne and TLOU. But I know a better press conference when I see it, when it's leagues of a difference."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,I really liked ghost of tsushima. Not a big fan of the first TLOU but this one's graphics look amazing. Not worth staying up at 3am for extremely disappointed.
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-20,"Yea but they totally remade it into a different game, this is an already established game and they've already established how it will play."
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I am most certainly not defending Sony's release schedule. I've been waiting for a majority of the games they showed for 3 years. 

But to counter your point, Sea of Thieves needs more content to even be enjoyable and PUBG is a broken mess on Xbox. God of War getting a New Game Plus mode is more exciting than either of those announcements to me. I didn't even remember the other games on your list after Xbox slammed 40 more cross\-platform trailers at me and I probably won't be buying them."

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,"I didn’t say Sony’s Conference was better. But are you really counting DLC as a game presentation? Let’s erase the DLCs so 3 out of 8 are indies. Isn’t PUBG already released? So 3 out of 7.  Tunic is only timed exclusive but let’s count that. 

Xboxs Conference was the one I most liked but not because of Xbox but because of the games I can play on my PS4 or PC. Xbox is not trying to get buyers to buy a Xbox. Sony is delivering awesome exclusive titles so gamers will buy the PS4 while Microsoft is delaying or cancelling game after game. 

This is just a speculation but if the new PS and Xbox are coming in 2020 then Gears and Halo most likely won’t be on Xbox one "
8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-21,One gameplay sequence that plays exactly like kingdom hearts isn't enough to convince me they had built anything for FFVII at the time.

8qfb9c,2018-06-12,2018-06-12,">Microsoft is delaying or cancelling game after game

Only recent delay that comes to mind is Crackdown, and only cancellation is Scalebound (RIP). That's hardly ""game after game.""

And Sony might be in the same boat, but we'll never know because they don't seem to be too keen on announcing release dates. Things seem to have gone very quiet on Shunmue 3 and the FFVII remaster, for example. "

Like the story was excellent, it looked beautiful, and the characters were great but all the gameplay elements were as cookie cutter as they get. Neither the combat, nor the stealth, nor the open world, nor the upgrades and powers felt all the particularly interesting or innovative. The highlight for me were the main story quests and the legend quests but everything else felt really basic. Maybe I’ve just played too many open world games at this point. TLOU2 felt way more immersive and interesting to me; stealthing around and getting upgrades was a much more compelling experience."

After that get cyberpunk choom"

The Last of Us 1 & 2 on the other hand are literal masterpieces.  
  
If you do go with cyberpunk wait until 1.7 comes out. That update is adding actual police response and car chases."
z27tya,2022-11-22,2022-11-22,"Get both, because you can get the PS4 TLOU for cheap and it's basically the same thing."
z27tya,2022-11-22,2022-11-22,"Last of us is a more linear, story driven single play experience. It is a truly amazing game. 

I haven’t played cyber punk, but it is an open world RPG that i have heard amazing things about. 

Can’t go wrong with either of em"
z27tya,2022-11-22,2022-11-23,Definitely go with Last of Us. I’m playing through God of War Ragnarok and you can feel TLOUs influence all over this game
z27tya,2022-11-22,2022-11-22,Last of Us! Top 5er
z27tya,2022-11-22,2022-11-22,"Both are good, really depends what style game you're looking for. Personally I'd vote LOU, but it's close"
z27tya,2022-11-22,2022-11-23,"If you want a video game, cyberpunk 

If you want a movie game, the last of us 

You could watch a full playthrough of the last of us (like most Sony games) and get a good chunk of the experience; you wouldn’t with cyberpunk"
z27tya,2022-11-22,2022-11-23,Cyberpunk. No question
z27tya,2022-11-22,2022-11-23,Get cyber punk now and tlou in a few months
z27tya,2022-11-22,2022-11-23,Please do
z27tya,2022-11-22,2022-11-23,"If you enjoy doing something, it's never time wasted."
z27tya,2022-11-22,2022-11-23,Is Cyberpunk worth getting if you are still on PS4?
z27tya,2022-11-22,2022-11-22,Lot of replay ability with CP? Is there any good mmorpg games for ps5?
z27tya,2022-11-22,2022-11-22,The soundtrack is fire.... as the kids would say
z27tya,2022-11-22,2022-11-23,"How is it broken?

Care to mention these issues, glitches and missing features?"
z27tya,2022-11-22,2022-11-23,Cant wait to get that one too
z27tya,2022-11-22,2022-11-23,Lmao who is downvoting this? It's a a personal opinion
z27tya,2022-11-22,2022-11-23,Right on
z27tya,2022-11-22,2022-11-23,"I haven't played it on PS4 since it first came out. It was so broken I just couldn't play it beyond the opening act. I'm sure it's miles better now, but I don't know what it's quality is like since the updates started coming through."
z27tya,2022-11-22,2022-11-22,There's a bit of replaybility with the choices and different builds but not so much that it should matter. This does change with mods however in that case it has alot of replay value.
z27tya,2022-11-22,2022-11-22,"Once you get to the final chapter of CP, that's pretty much it. Although, there's a lot of side missions and such in between. I haven't felt the urge to do a replay yet, but that was after spending over 100 hours playing."
z27tya,2022-11-22,2022-11-22,"Agreed.  I wish there was a bit more satire in the radio stations like gta, but the songs are great.  Love pacific dreams"
z27tya,2022-11-22,2022-11-23,"I already mentioned two, not gonna play the argument game with you."
z27tya,2022-11-22,2022-11-23,It’s amazing
z27tya,2022-11-22,2022-11-23,"Don’t get me wrong TLOU is exceptional, but ultimately it’s a 10-20 hour game vs a 100 hour game

Plus one is much newer, if cyberpunk is discounted you can bet it won’t be as often as TLoU will be"
z27tya,2022-11-22,2022-11-23,"Thanks, maybe worth a try then"
z27tya,2022-11-22,2022-11-22,Damn its that long of a game
z27tya,2022-11-22,2022-11-22,"Here's a good idea of how long it can last depending on how you play it

z27tya,2022-11-22,2022-11-23,Here I am haven't finished my 2nd playthrough over 150Hrs...
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-13,Never once used my flamethrower because I was saving it for the non-existent 'final boss'
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-13,I kinda thought the tunnel right before the end with 3 of those big ass clickers (forgot what they are called) made up for a boss fight. I couldn't sneak around them and ended up using my flamethrower to take them all down. 
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-13,"the hardest part for me, even on normal, was the part where you're in the flooded basement and start the generator.  That bloater killed me so many times."
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-13,"I enjoyed that there was no actual ""boss"" too. It would make it feel too unrealistic, if after fighting so many damaged mortals you suddenly come across a Lazaravic-style warrior god."
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-13,Oh man so my boyfriend just started the game on normal and rage quits every time he runs into clickers. That on part in the subway when you have to sneak around them he tried so hard to Rambo all of them and got so mad every time he died. I kept telling him Sneaky Joel is the best Joel but he still thinks he can Rambo it. He hasn't gotten past that part. And he will get so mad if he hears I said this.
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-13,nonsense
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-13,He went to home
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-13,"The fuck, that last level (trying to avoid spoilers here) was hard as hell, compared with the rest of the game that is, with all those lethal beings there and a pretty unapparent way forward. "
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,"Although there was no boss, the last chapter was pretty difficult due to how decked out the people were with machine guns. I also didn't have much ammo at that point."
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,Looking at you bioshock infinite. It took like an hour for me to complete that last mission although it was on hard.
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-13,The game in general was hard. Especially those puzzle parts. Damn you Naughty Dog and your puzzles!
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,"That part with the 2 bloaters, 1 clicker, and about 10 regular infected in the subway really pissed me off though."
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,"I had so much ammo. Oh so much ammo like nearly all guns at full ammo. Thinking i was going to face an all out warfare between the infected and the fireflies, but instead i killed everything with a stupid brick
Never again'"
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-13,"I loved the lack of a boss, uncharted games, especialy 2, ended on a low note because of them."
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-13,"American devs really aren't good at doing bosses. This game in particular had some terrible ones. 

The last battle was really disappointing though. I expected a bit more from it. The whole game was just too easy, even on Hard."
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,"Man, that thing was almost gamebreaking it was so deadly."
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-13,"It's not all that hard to sneak around. When you first start, climb the truck that's sandwiched between a roaming bloater and a runner. Use an arrow to hit his back (his BACK. That way the arrow doesn't break when he falls forward). Move along edging towards the right after that, arrow the next runner you see. Enter the doorway to your right, have a small loud fight with the next three runners in that hallway, this won't trigger a big ol' fight as nobody else can hear it for some reason. Exit through the other side, careful around the clickers, (you can find a manual on top of a truck near here and it gives you a perfect vantage shot at the last runner, which again I advise to use a bow) Jump down the truck, or just continue making your way forward, hug the wall to your left using one final arrow to kill the clicker in your way OR throw a bottle to distract it. The bloaters shouldn't bother you at all if you hug the left and only use arrows. Lastly, you'll have more than enough bottles if you much more prefer to distract them as there are more than enough piles of 3-4 bottles/bricks scattered throughout this part. Now just hug the wall to your left and proceed to boost Ellie up.

(source: really good memory of TLoU level layouts, I can describe a way to get through just about any level from memory)"
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-13,"The thing with Normal mode though is that encounter is only really hard if you're forcing yourself to do it stealthily. On normal, you reach a point in the game where you're pretty adequately stocked weapon wise and can handle your own in any combat situation. 
Personally I didn't realy mind. I initially started the game by trying to be as stealthy as possible (restarting encounters when I was caught), but at some point (think around the high school) I just got frustrated playing the game that way. I still tried to play stealthy, but didn't mind busting out the shotty when things went sour, and wound up enjoying the experience a lot more."
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-13,The bloaters?
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-13,Read that as big ass-clickers. The mental image was disturbing.
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,"This is gonna make you so mad. But once you start the generator, you can just run upstairs, open the door, and bypass that whole fight altogether."
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-13,"Aw yeah! Me too. I ended up running away upstairs, and then throwing molotovs all over, and as luck had it the bloater was hit and died eventually."
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,"That was the only part of the game where I just ran away. Dropped and threw every molotov, nail bomb, and smoke bomb I had along the way and went for the door. "
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,I simply sprinted to the door as fast as possible... It was terrifying hearing the damn beasts as I ran.
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,"I didn't see the generator first, I went up to the 2nd floor, and saw the door, after retrieving the keycard it still didn't want to open as it needed power. 4 stalkers then spawned up, killed them, turned on the generator then started running while shooting with my shotty, then I see a huge bloater coming down the hall and I just sprint the door without getting killed. I found it tense, but there were definitely (for me) harder parts in the game."
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-13,Or some kind of giant fungus mutant.
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-13,"spoiler.

that's exactly what made the cannibal rapist frustrating. 3 backstabs that killed everyone else and he still lives. plot armor is the lowest copout of a lazy dev.

edit: ah, here comes the downvotes. i knew it was only a matter of time before people would disagree without giving a reason."
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,CoD bro meets Last of Us? 
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,"Because they made you like him first.  

Hey, this guy's kind of alright.  Wait... what's...oh... oh god.  NO GOD.  "
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,I loved that boss fight.  Goddamn I loved that fight.
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,"That was the only part of the game that was spoiled for me, so I never got to warm up to him. Plus Nolan North (voice of David) has given hints about his character's personality. "
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,That shit was nerve wrecking.
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-13,I just took off running down the hallways and eventually I made it to Ellie... I had no gameplan.
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-13,you guys actually use guns? i just sneak up and shiv everyone.
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,That was the only time in the whole game I used smoke bombs. Thankfully by then you also had a full arsenal of weapons but it was still tough 
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,"Jesus, the assholes with the assault rifles would blindside me every time and instantaneously kill me. I had no health packs and no ammo other than a few shots in the bull. Needless to say, I dies plenty of times."
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,"It looks like ammo and supplies are the make it or break it factor in the end part. I had quite a lot left, and maybe some luck, so I got past the end guys fairly easily. The clickers and bloaters in the tunnel on the other hand took some tries."
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,You could've stealth-ed or sprinted to the finish line
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-13,"I've only tried it on normal, but I found it challenging at times. I do agree that the ending was surprisingly easy though - but better that than impossible."
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,"I played on hard my first time and playing on Survivor now. It wasn't hard to sneak past them at all, I just threw a brick and then climbed the truck as /u/krakken86 said. I then threw some molotovs for fun."
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,Run the fuck away was my first instinct when the generator started making noise
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,Good luck doing that on Survivor where's there's hardly no supplies.
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,I somehow got super lucky on this part and made it out on the first try but vividly remember it because of general fear.
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-13,"Yeah, I was relieved that that never happened."
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-13,"In defence of that part, she never really one-hit kills anyone, she stabs them several times. In that smokey room, when she's terrified and weak, I can see how CannibalRapist gets the best of her."
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,*cannibal suspected rapist 
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,Haha sort of He just hates to die. Its like that with any game. It hilarious watching him play BF3 or CoD
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,You described my feels exactly with this guy.
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-13,I did this in Doom 3 once because I was so sick of the cheap scares. Just ran all the way to the end of the level... and then I was trapped in a room with 20 monsters with a framerate of about 4 fps.
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,Glass bottle + Moltov or nail bomb. after I figured that out the clicker levels never really gave me any trouble.
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,"Sure if you have a shiv.

Actually two shivs. Gotta hold onto one in case you come across a shiv door."
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,It took me forever to stealth since the final hallway was literally FILLED with enemies. And sprinting isn't the best considering I was trying to get all the valuables. I was also playing on hard so they noticed me pretty easily.
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-13,"I've always believed that if a game is going to be bad, it should at least be easy. A bad game that's hard is just aggravating, while an easy one is merely boring.

The DLC better be a major increase in difficulty, but I don't see it happening since a lot of the ease comes from the basic mechanics and AI. I highly doubt they're going to completely revamp everything, but hopefully they can come up with some better encounters."
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,"Your first Survivor run is gonna be a blast. I absolutely love not being able to use listening mode, it's a crutch. Doing my first Survivor Plus run as we speak. Just got out of the walls of the Boston QZ. Taking a break now."
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,"My first instinct upon seeing the bloater was to run the other way, straight off the ledge, into the pack of clickers, and die. :<"
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-13,"knives don't get duller from the user being terrified, and who is to say he scared her the most up until that point? the attempted rape didn't happen until after the fight was over. then, when she was truly terrified, she actually managed to kill him, so you may be right that fear weakens some people, but in fact her fear actually made her stronger after the fight, not weaker during it."
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,"very valid point, but come on, it was obvious what he was trying to do, especially when he was trying to woo her while still in that cage. i'm more baffled that naughty dog has no problems depicting a decayed society where all morals went to hell and people would kill for the littlest advantage with no problems blatantly displaying them in the all the gruesome ways within the game, but beats around the bush when it comes to sexual deviants, and thinks it's realistic. honestly though i understand why they did it this way, parents of players would be more alarmed about one than the other."
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,"Yea, he didn't actually tried to do any raping yet except getting on top of her, but if every guy who does that gets called a rapist, then I see a bunch of UFC fighters and actual people pinning people down as a way to fight some major pervs. still though, he was really creepy and would maybe rape her or something."
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,Please show him Dark Souls. Make sure you have backup controllers.
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-13,"Have you played on survivor? Or tried disabling hearing mode? It's not a whole lot harder, but once you disable it it's like playing an entirely different game."
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-13,Alright new excuse: guy was heavily drugged up on those pills that allow Joel to take shotgun blasts to his face with only a stumble.  How's that?
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,"Or if you live here in Australia we leave that kind non-logical game classifying to a government panel. That panel however is 90% middle aged women, a gamer's worst enemy."
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,"Yeah, but it's strongly implied, just like how it's strongly implied that Bill is gay. ND is basically saying ""Yes he is, but we just cant say it strait"""
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,Haha record him and put him on YouTube.
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-13,"It didn't help a lot.

I've played Stalker. TLOU feels like a shallow imitation."
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-13,i like it. at least it's as big a copout as the rest of the game mechanics.
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,What in the hell are you talking about?
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-13,"I've only just barely dabbled with one stalker. I can't remember which one, so I guess I can't argue. "
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,"For Bill, did you NOT watch the scene where they were driving to Pittsburgh? Also, from the ND AMA:



q:""On /r/thelastofus I've seen some debate on whether or not Bill is gay and if David intended to rape Ellie. So, just to put the questions to rest, are those true?""

a:""Open to interpretation. I will say Bill was written to be a gay character, but W. Earl Brown has said his performance is open to interpretation.""

For David, ND said ""Open to interpretation"" as to weather or not he was going to rape her. Obviously they cant say it aloud, cause of this shit storm they would get. Look what happened to Tomb Raider and all the flak it got because an employee said something which was accidental which made people believe there was a possibility of rape for Lara Croft, and she's a full grown woman, imagine how the internets would go crazy if they said that David had the intention to rape Ellie. Even Nolan North said it himself."
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,"I wasn't talking about Bill at all. Please read who you are responding to. Bill was obviously gay, I didn't need /r/thelastofus to confirm it for me. Ellie and David was all speculation from the fans as I have said. in my previous post. Also if Tomb Raider really did have a raping scene when you die then it would cause unwanted controversy. You'd have to be an idiot to think that that's what the bad guy would actually do. It literally just fades to black with him chocking her."
1ka70n,2013-08-13,2013-08-14,"ah, the new generation, needing everything spoonfed, thinking everything told to them is fake, and completely fail to read between the lines.

if it was not intended to be suggestive, ND would have flat out said ""no"" instead of ""open to interpretation."" they were being classy with their answer to be tactful and not offensive. class seems to be lacking in kids these days."

1gliar,2013-06-18,2013-06-18,By the time i got to UEC (college) and i only collected 3 sets of tools and not enough parts i thought to myself and said the rest of the game is going to be extremely hard.
1gliar,2013-06-18,2013-06-18,"Not necessarily. Some are after big battles too. They mix it up. Others do prep you ahead of time, yes, but at the same time if you're smart you can avoid the coming fight and keep most of the supply goldmine. I learned this the hard way by dying a lot at one part only to learn I could entirely avoid the battle by getting more strategic."
1gliar,2013-06-18,2013-06-18,Just worked that level. My thoughts exactly! 
1gliar,2013-06-18,2013-06-18,More like bottles and bricks scattered everywhere = massive fight here on the way back

1gliar,2013-06-18,2013-06-18,Exactly. 
1gliar,2013-06-18,2013-06-19,"My brothers and I had a saying for Final Fantasy games; ""Well, you know what that save spot is there..."""
1gliar,2013-06-18,2013-06-19,"Except in Dead Space, there are PLENTY of save spots. which makes it kind of unpredictable. Like, ""Oh, save spot, should be safe---- AWW HELLL NO!!!!"" or those times when there are no save spots, and you think, something is about to go down and you hold your plasma cutter up the whole way through and nothing happens."
1gliar,2013-06-18,2013-06-18,Its kind of annoying the art in game design right now is focusing on who can best integrate chest high walls naturally into their environment.  Even this game has yet to do it at all convincingly.
1gliar,2013-06-18,2013-06-19,there is really only one obvious chest high cover area.
1gliar,2013-06-18,2013-06-19,That's part of what makes it awesome!
1gliar,2013-06-18,2013-06-19,"Haha, the first time you go up against some guys in that one open area I was thinking ""Gosh, that's an awful lot of chest high stuff, I wonder if maybe this conversation doesn't go over too well..."""
1gliar,2013-06-18,2013-06-19,"Yeah, that early-game tutorial bit was telegraphed pretty heavily.  That said, it never happens again."
120oeja,2023-03-24,2023-03-24,"It’s way better combat wise, which is the big thing for me. I like it better then part 1"
120oeja,2023-03-24,2023-03-24,I think a person has the right to enjoy whatever they want to enjoy as long as it is not at a detriment to others.
120oeja,2023-03-24,2023-03-24,"Going to get downvoted for this, but I didn't like either of them. With all respect to those who did."
120oeja,2023-03-24,2023-03-24,Who cares? You are allowed to have your own opinion.
120oeja,2023-03-24,2023-03-24,One of the best selling playstation exclusives of all time. So nah
120oeja,2023-03-24,2023-03-24,"Yes, it is controversial, but it's also correct. Part 2 is a masterpiece, and excels past the first game in every respect. People just got mad about Joel's death before it came out, refusing to engage with the actual point of the story. It was supposed to be shocking and sudden, it was supposed to make you want to brutally murder Abby. But then you *play as her.* It directly leads into all the themes and plot of the story, which also follow directly from Part 1. It plays with the player's emotions in a way I don't think is possible without it being a game, which is why I think the HBO show will restructure it."
120oeja,2023-03-24,2023-03-24,"My issue with TLOU Part 2 is the way it forces its “actions have consequences” story. They’re too in your face about it imo. Take Marvel’s Spider-Man for example. That game shows how actions have consequences, but they don’t shove that down your throat the entire time the way TLOUP2 does. I didn’t mind Joel’s death, if anything I actually really liked it because it was very bold of them to do and truly sent huge chills through my whole body. Loved it. The gameplay itself was awesome as well. It’s simply that everything you’re doing for the story is just gonna come with a big red “OPE, YOUR ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES” sticker right in your face rather than a more… I guess natural approach to it if that makes sense? Idk, I’ve tried explaining this before and get hate for it, but idk how else to really explain what I’m trying to get at 🤷🏻‍♀️"
120oeja,2023-03-24,2023-03-24,lol my dude you are on the internet but specifically reddit. you can say you like literally anything and someone somewhere will be triggered because their identity is based around not liking thing or liking opposite thing.
120oeja,2023-03-24,2023-03-24,Its better game yes
120oeja,2023-03-24,2023-03-24,I liked last of us 2 more than 1 ever since I finished 2.
120oeja,2023-03-24,2023-03-24,"I would say no because I think TLoU2 was better as well, I think the story of the first one was a little better due to the relationship between Ellie and Joel but I thought TLoU part 2 story was an excellent story about grief, loss and the self destructive ways people cope with it (I know a lot of people would say it’s just “revenge bad” but I felt like there was more to it than that). Not to mention the fact that they kill off Joel almost immediately and taking a more critical look on Ellie actions took a lot of balls to do which I think that risk is always more interesting than going the try and true route.

I also like it when games end on a downer note. Like it’s easier to end a story on a happy or cathartic note but I think when used effectively a downer ending can stay with you long after the game is over. 

This isn’t even going into how the gameplay, AI, and the mechanical ways that the game is better than the first one."
120oeja,2023-03-24,2023-03-24,"i much preferred the first one, ive even played them back to back (first part 2 and then part1) and enjoyed the first one immensely more. 

i found the story in the second one a bit ridiculous and the gameplay just not that enjoyable. I realized i dont really love the gameplay of this series that much but i did love the story of the first one and i guess that pushed me to finish it.

 I did not like the end of part 2,seemed very forced and even taking it at face value i dont buy the saving of one life (which was the whole reason for the game) after you murdered in cold blood DOZENS of people and now that you can kill the one that started all you dont? weak."
120oeja,2023-03-24,2023-03-24,I love both games dearly but I do believe Last Of Us Part 2 is a superior game and will be looked back as such in the years to come. The only real controversy was from an incredibly loud minority that have very questionable reasons to hate on it. There are others who legitimately had gripes with the story but a disturbing amount of the backlash was coming from a place of hate and misogyny.
120oeja,2023-03-24,2023-03-24,"Less and less as time goes on.  The last of us 2 pissed alot of people off.  But over time: opinions change. People are warming up to it alot.  I sincerely hope naughty dog is smart enough to move on from the last of us because of the fans have their way, they will invalidate the entire point of the story so that they can have a happy ending."
120oeja,2023-03-24,2023-03-24,"The only thing that matters is what YOU think and how YOU felt. Don't worry about what others think.

Unfortunately elements of the gaming scene are extremely toxic and fail to understand that everyone of us is an individual with different tastes.

You should have seen the downvotes I got into oblivion when I said RDR2 bored me. The RDR2 ""fans"" came out frothing at the mouth. I had ""no taste""  and was told to ""return to Tetris or COD"" 

Somehow in the gaming scene a vast number of gamers seem to think ""Well X billion of us love the game and therefore you must love it to""

Doesn't work that way. You like what you like OP :)"
120oeja,2023-03-24,2023-03-25,combat was definitely better in 2... not a fan of the story.
120oeja,2023-03-24,2023-03-24,Part II was horrible. The turned Ellie into a serial killer and Abby was one of the worst video game characters in history.
120oeja,2023-03-24,2023-03-24,I didn't play either but I don't think it should matter I prefer 3d sonic to 2d
120oeja,2023-03-24,2023-03-24,"I feel like the story would have been better told in reverse, the beginning should have been played as Abby traveling with her friends. The surprise being that you did all that to kill Joel. This would have given the player time to get to know those characters and like them. Making Ellies' murder rampage of the group matter more. 

As it is now I kill a bunch of people I dislike which Ellie and the game reinforces in us, and then play as a character I was made to hate. It just doesn't feel like good writing as first impressions matter.

But that's my complaint, and if you liked it that's fine too. Thankfully there are tons of stories out there."
120oeja,2023-03-24,2023-03-24,"It's actually not bad to like part 2 more than part 1, the thing is, Joel's death was pretty dumb and pathetically cooked, it's as if Rick Grimes would've died the same way Carl did, more or less.

So the way the plot started, was disgustingly bland (seriously, there's no way to possibly defend that dogshit scene, except for Ellie's reaction and Johnsons' voice acting), but that doesn't mean the story is wrong, is just that the pacing of the plot in general became so meaningless, that forced divided the gameplay in two sides: Ellie's revenge, and Abby escaping that very circle that she executed after 4 years and Ellie proceeds to develop further.

Part 1 is a whole different story that digs in deep about both Joel and Ellie, and part 2 does well in showing at least some bits of what that relationship has become.

Part 2 improves the game further in many ways (considering original and not the Remake), but it has that dirt stain due to the pacing, and completely ignoring what Joel means to the story. It shows what happens when you take the golden egg out of the picture."
120oeja,2023-03-24,2023-03-24,Everyone has the right to their own opinion. Don't worry about what others think. You enjoy what you enjoy.
120oeja,2023-03-24,2023-03-25,"A lot of people seem to forget that Joel was not a good person at all. In fact he was terrible. He murdered tons of innocent people. Just because he came to love a young girl as his daughter doesn’t suddenly atone for everything he had done. 

Using an extreme example:
If hitler had children that he absolutely adored and would kill anyone who hurt them, does that make him good? Does it absolve him from all of the bad things? No.

Was Joel hitler? No. He was a guy trying to survive. But does that mean it was ok for him to kill a lot of innocent people? He admitted to being part of ambushes. You know all of the enemies he kills during the game? Well he was one of those. If there were other last of games from their perspective you might see things differently."
120oeja,2023-03-24,2023-03-25,"The only I provement of the last of use 2 is general combat is more fun and violent. But you spent about 3-4 hours total of combat and 20 hours watching cutscenes, pressing triangle (or not with accessibility settings so your just walking now) and inputting codes into safes. 

That and the writing being... Uh... Interesting to say the very least, it's not a worthy sequal but the first game stands on its own so much it's super easy to ignore part 2 (except the remake being called part 1)"
120oeja,2023-03-24,2023-03-26,Gameplay wise it’s better hands down. Story is subjective but I also like Part 2’s story more.
120oeja,2023-03-24,2023-03-24,"Fair, even if you didn't like the story you can at least say the combat is great"
120oeja,2023-03-24,2023-03-24,"Well god damn it, I really enjoy detrimenting others enjoyment. Guess I’ll have to to back to reading books or knitting or something."
120oeja,2023-03-24,2023-03-24,"That's fine, I respect it"
120oeja,2023-03-24,2023-03-25,Those who did engage with the point of the story found out it doesn't work either. This story does not work at all with this type of game. And the story itself has plenty of writing issues outside of it's relation to gameplay.
120oeja,2023-03-24,2023-03-24,This game has a really interesting story though. That alone beats a huge amount of other games. Things that you mention I think are irrelevant.
120oeja,2023-03-24,2023-03-24,Fair enough
y1b0tf,2022-10-11,2022-10-11,Yes it looks just as good today as it did tomorrow..

y1b0tf,2022-10-11,2022-10-12,"Not sure why i'd pay to play the same game with better graphics. My gaming backlog is huge as it is, don't need to revisit old games. Except Zelda games, there is no maximum # of playthrough."

I've seen this exact screenshot about 50 times now with the same text on"

y1b0tf,2022-10-11,2022-10-11,We have 2022 also why do people like this scalper version or is. This just a post to get attention
y1b0tf,2022-10-11,2022-10-11,This any good on steam deck?
y1b0tf,2022-10-11,2022-10-11,I think it could be a little better maybe port it to three more consoles and see if you can get it right
y1b0tf,2022-10-11,2022-10-11,Bethany Clare Field
y1b0tf,2022-10-11,2022-10-12,Cuz I made 'em good.
y1b0tf,2022-10-11,2022-10-11,"I mean I get what this is about but I also find it funny what other games get praised for graphics that ""were beyond there time"" but actually were not.

The only game remake that still makes me go ""wow... it's that old but still looks so great"" is the remake of Resident Evil 1 for the GC.

And here is the kicker: there are only 6 years between the Original and the Remake!"
y1b0tf,2022-10-11,2022-10-11,Maybe #7 is when it will actually be funny.
y1b0tf,2022-10-11,2022-10-11,"And not even for an old game.

 ""Look at this game which was released barely more than a month ago. Doesn't it still hold up?!"" At least refer to the earlier versions. Geesh."
y1b0tf,2022-10-11,2022-10-11,I think they pushed the release back a bit — it’s going to be the 2022 Christmas Special.  All those extra months are going to be worth it though.  Think how many more textures they’ll be able to upscale!
y1b0tf,2022-10-11,2022-10-12,Ellie’s a kid in this one
y1b0tf,2022-10-11,2022-10-11,Don't tell me but they just released the supercalifragilisticexpaliadocious version

Not surprised it's not on the list, but the series is a hidden gem and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who likes strategy games and fantasy.

Not impressive graphically, but it's the only game I know where you can summon an army of praying mantises and bestow human-like intelligence to one of them so you can empower it with death magic and have it cast a spell to rapidly age the entire population of the world."

18s097f,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,Nothing I am personally interested in.  Probably for the best.  Last few months have been stacked.  Might give me a chance to try and put a dent in the backlog of games I have started recently.

Part II is getting a remaster but still isn't available via ps+, that's ridiculous"
18s097f,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"The remaster is practically a port to PS5, but we are also getting a new roguelike game mode and lost levels for the campaign.
This whole thing was also done by new employees apparently in order to learn how to use the engine."
18s097f,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"I'm excited for it, wanted to have updated duel sense support like TLOU1"
18s097f,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,"People keep blowing this out of proportion and making it seem way more outrageous than it is.

* It’s more of a port than an actual remaster. Just imagine the game came out now with a PS4 and a PS5 version.

* It was used as a way to introduce new ND hires into their tech. It’s not like they’re taking time away from ND vets to work on this when they could’ve been working on a new game.

* It’s only $10 for existing users. It’s not like they’re forcing people to buy it again if they want to see how it looks on the PS5.

* They added new stuff into the game, including a roguelike mode which looks pretty cool and helps making the price easier to accept.  $10 is already pretty much standard for getting the PS5 version (at least with Sony games), extra stuff makes it sweeter.

Ghost of Tsushima also had a $10 upgrade to the PS5 version, this is pretty much the same thing. Other Sony games also cost $10 more for their PS5 versions, same thing here.

The price is reasonable. It didn’t really significantly take resources away from new projects and it helped ease new hires into the studio. It brings new content for fans of the series to make the wait for another game a bit easier. Why are people acting like this is outrageous, ridiculous or perplexing in any way?"
18s097f,2023-12-27,2023-12-28,They can make more money with it
18s097f,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,Just wait for them to remaster the remaster

No, it’s a PS4 game.

18s097f,2023-12-27,2023-12-27,"I really enjoyed the game, the twist, and ""first"" ending.  The entire thesis of the story was about how destructive and pointless the endless cycle of violence is, ultimately with Ellie deciding to break it.  It then threw all of that in the garbage in the epilogue just to seemingly set up a third game.  Don't get me wrong it's still a top game for me and I want to see what they do with a sequel, but the game would have been a master-class, beautiful piece of art if they had just left off the epilogue."

oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-04,"I didn't care for the other people's opinions on it when I played.
I liked it, but mainly because I liked the first one so much.

Only thing I hated was what they did with Joel. That was difficult to sit through with headphones on."
oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-05,Expectations. People essentially wanted a copy of the first one.
oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-05,"I liked it. I see why some people don't, but it was a wild ride with lots of emotions. I was in awe. Also the gameplay just slapped."
oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-04,"Oh boy, this thread ought to be interesting"
oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-04,"Im replaying it now and the 2nd time through it might be hitting me harder too.

Excellent game that shows what a top notch combo superb storytelling/acting AND gameplay can be.

Quite a moving experience, Im in 100% agreement with you!"
oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-04,My buddy and I have talked about it recently. He says he doesn't like it and when i asked him if he's even played it he said no... 🙄
oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-04,"I think it mostly stems from the death of Joel and how he died. I really wish the devs hadn't killed him off, especially so soon. It didn't make sense to me how Joel was murdered by Abby AFTER he saves her life. You'd think that would make things even in Abby's mind; he killed her dad but then he saves her life. And how did they even find Joel or know it was him? That could've been any guy named Joel IRL, Abby's team weren't expert trackers or something, just a bunch of nobody's like everyone else in the apocalypse. 

The story was alright but it definitely dragged on for me. In my opinion, if they wanted to make it like a film, they should've just made a movie. I honestly don't know if it was so drawn out because the devs said it was gonna be their biggest game to date or if they  were trying to give fans more gameplay, but the sneaking around killing the same enemies got old by the end. Where was the enemy variety? Why make a game long just for the sake of it? There were multiple times I felt they could've ended the story at a certain point or there were sections that could've been left out entirely.

By the end I just wanted to get it over with to see the ending because I'd invested so much time into playing the game. I enjoyed the first games ending, but goddamn was Part II's ending a letdown. All that way and neither of them had it in them to kill the other? I was rooting for Ellie but I would've liked to see a more climactic ending with one of them dying. I understand the two of them were sort of past their conflict, how they just wanted to live their respective lives and forget the past but it just doesn't seem realistic to me how after all that they would just part ways peacefully. To me it was garbage writing and this game would've been torn apart by critics if it were an actual film. A technical powerhouse of a videogame, sure, but it didn't deserve game of the year which is also why it got some hate.

All in all, IMO a decent game with average writing that left a bad taste in my mouth by the time it was over. I'm glad some people enjoyed it the whole way through, but once I heard director Neil Druckmann cried at the ending of HIS OWN GAME I was disgusted. That's my take, anyways."
oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-05,"From the people I know who didn’t like it, they just hated what they did to Joel and Ellie. Some people just don’t want to see their beloved characters tortured or killed. 

I don’t mind it, as long as you can tell me a compelling story alongside it. I understood what happened to Joel, especially after Abby’s chapter. It didn’t feel like a glorified scene to cause pain to the players, it had a reason and a purpose. The actions Joel took at the end of the first game would absolutely have major consequences, and I feel that the writers of TLoU2 provided a fantastic example of that consequence. The resulting “an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind” quest that Ellie takes was gut wrenching. I loved it."
oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-04,"Divided down the middle. I didn’t like it because I never really felt bad for Abby, she did you know what and felt no remorse. So forcing >!me to play as her for half of the game!< did not get a good reaction from me. Bad story. I’d give it a 6/10 based off of the graphics and gameplay alone."
oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-04,"For me, I didn't enjoy it because I felt the writing was sloppy. Too many coincidences and plot armour. Also, how they killed off Joel felt like a slap in the face to fans of the first game. I will give credit where credit is due. The graphics are incredible, the acting rivals Hollywood films, the gameplay is smooth and responsive and the soundtrack is just God Tier! For me, TLOU 2 was a flawed game. Not amazing, but not terrible. I think most people don't like the game because of Joel's death, Abby and the game snatching Game of the Year (it was competing against Ghost of Tsushima and DOOM Eternal, which to most gamers loved)"

oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-04,I thought the gameplay was amazing I liked getting to play as Abby but I felt the story could’ve ended earlier and I would’ve been fine with it
oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-04,"They couldn't get over the loss of their beloved character from the first game (one of my favs of all time btw) and accept their flaws, while hated having to play as 'the bad guy' which helps you understand them and why they did what they did. Abby was in fact, not the bad guy. Neither was Ellie. Neither was Joel. They are all flawed and stuck in a cycle of revenge and misunderstanding. Coming to terms with that and understanding them from narrative perspective that none of them ever got the chance to is what makes the story of revenge/forgiveness so tragic and, in my opinion, very well done."
oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-04,How is Ellie seeking revenge for 90% of the game sacrificing everything and killing everyone just to stop at the very last minute good writing.

oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-04,"I really loved the last of us 2, but the ending just didn’t feel right to me. I don’t mind the whole idea of “vengeance is not worth it” type of theme, but I felt like it was handled poorly with all the deaths before the ending. I have played games with similar themes that handled it better. Also I completely disliked the Owen and Abby scene. It felt very forced, but, thankfully, it’s possible to skip it."
oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-04,I think what happened with Joel made people very emotional and soured everyone’s tastes to it. Don’t think they realized that was the point.
oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-04,Some leaker told them the game was gonna be bad and they believed it. I bought it launch day and loved it
oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-04,Never played the game myself but I think it was something about transgenderism if memory serves.
oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-04,How it masacreed the legacy of the first Last of Us
oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-04,You cluld have put literally any other story over the gameplay and itnwould have been playable. But they chose *that* one
oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-04,"Originally Abby was Andy.  Then ND hired an infamous woke specialist.  So Andy, being a straight, white male was unacceptable.  So Andy became Abby.  They didnt redo the arms as the work into animations were too advanced,  so Abby has Andy's arms for about half the game.

You basically had a series of issues snowball into ""fuck that game"".  The writing, particularly the ending, was a big step down from the first game.  Joel is killed stupidly and very early, too poor choices multiplying off each other.  Especially since Joel's death could have been held off with simple rearrangements of the order of things.  And of course, injecting a trans-cuz-we-said-so character, as the villain of sorts, in a blatant attempt to pander.  Finally, Neil Druckman's moronic replies to people questioning and criticizing ND's decisions.

End of the day our opinions mean little.  The game should have easily been the best selling game of the year by miles.  The combat alone earned that.  But ND leaned hard into woke without actually being woke, and found the broke that follows.  It's not a bad game.  It's also not nearly as good as the first one despite being technically superior on every level.  Massive disappointment to a vocal majority of the fans, if sales numbers are to be trusted.  Naturally, sociopolitical sides grabbed the one aspect that suited their narratives and ran with it, creating bad press to fans on the left and fans on the right."
oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-04,"Differs. Some hate it for the sake of it. Something about bands and wagons, or something. 

Personally, I think it was very good and did pretty much everything well. Just not the story and especially the characters (mostly the new ones and the handling of the old ones) which was one of strengths of the first game, if not *the* strength. It was bold, no doubt, but the execution didn’t quite match it. 

It was very much like the finale of Game of Thrones. Everything was top-notch…but that narrative…"
oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-04,"You’d be surprised at how average the response is to the game. 

I’ve encountered more of a “meh” when discussing TLOU2 with others. It usually goes something like this: gameplay, graphics and combat are impeccable, but the characters, narrative and the WLF/Seraphites were incredibly underwhelming and underdeveloped. This creates a weird middle ground of gameplay vs story. To be fair though, I don’t think many gamers hop online to yell about how “alright” they find a game to be. 

Yeah, it’s a good game, plays fantastic, but it just suffers from not being as great as the first one. It’s a sequel and it will always be held up to the likes of the first, which is inevitable. It also suffers from being just another overdone revenge story at heart relying entirely on the bonds formed from the prequel that are shattered right at the beginning. Not much to work with anymore after that, no matter how fantastic the graphics and gun play may be. 

The vocal hate for the game is unwarranted in my opinion, but everyone has their preferences and I can respect that. Though I’ll usually roll my eyes when the main beef is “joel dead + buff abby = worst game ever.” 

To me, it’s okay. I’ll probably revisit it on the PS5 here soon."
oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-04,I personally didn’t like anything related to Abby. All her story and the whole effort from the developer to engage to bring me to like her made me hate her even more. The game is technically great but I would have loved to play just with Ellie since Joel is gone
oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-05,"I really appreciated lou2 for what they tried to do, but I felt like I was being talked down to while playing it. They were using emotional manipulation to try and make you feel a certain way. Like everytime you kill someone, you hear someone call out their name, but at the same time didn't give options to progress without killing people. So they want me to play the game and feel bad while doing it. The context of the game already made killing something that was uncomfortable and I knew was bad, they don't need to also say it out loud ""hey, what you just did is bad and you should feel bad"" no subtlety or nuance to the writing like I feel the first game had. 

The structure was also poor imo. I feel like the game as a whole needs restructuring. Playing through Abby's story first would have been more impactful I feel. 

It was also just waaaay too long. The gameplay barely was enough to get me through till the end. The writing wasn't good enough to warrant that length."
oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-04,100% yes about Joel. I understand why they did what they did but that scene still haunts me and im not weak when it comes to gore.
oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-04,Someone I know said he hasn’t played it Cus SJW shit.
oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-04,You gotta realize Joel killed her father and stopped the cure to this virus. Not saying killing Joel was justified but I understand why she did it.
oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-04,At first I didn't care for Abby because if that as well but after going through her story I did start to feel bad for her but at the same time I wanted her to die so bad. I am glad the way it ended but at the same time that last fight was something very intense to go through.
oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-04,"While I haven't played GoT yet I have beaten Doom Eternal and sorry but not sorry Doom was Doom. Yes it was a blast but towards the end it got pretty boring gameplay wise and who plays Doom for the story? Lol.

oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-05,This right here. The fact that ND gave us the point of view from both sides of the aisle really made me love this game. I hated Abby after what she did and I started to hate having to play as her but once I got into her story I started to actually care about her and all of her group.
oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-04,lol
oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-04,Because the entire story was about Ellie. I knew going in this was a revenge story as the dev team said that back in development. It was good writing because it made you feel what the characters were feeling. Imo that comes from great writing and directing.

oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-04,Showing Abby’s side of the story give MORE context into Ellie’s story. That context plays on your emotions during the final act. During ending climax i was a crazy mix of emotions and was actually glad that Ellie chose not to kill Abby. I think that’s good writing for a video game. Like I’ve never cried and felt conflicting emotions like I did with this game
oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-05,Did you play the game?
oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-05,"Abby’s story directly ties into Ellie’s story. It brings greater context to the pain and anger Ellie feels and makes you question her (and your own) actions. I felt different about Ellie’s mission after spending time with Abby, and the game wouldn’t have been the same without it."
oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-04,"Yeah, I liked DOOM 2016 for story. Eternal is definitely better from a gameplay standpoint"
oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-05,"I disagree with the mindless shooting mentality. Doom Eternal is very skill based and requires a lot of strategy such as prioritising which enemy to kill first, which weapon is most effective for each enemy, circle strafing and inventory management. I felt like it should have won Game of the Year because it was well designed and actually respected the fans. TLOU 2 divided the fan base. I don't think a game that pissed off the majority of gamers deserved Game of the Year in my opinion"
oy1ncx,2021-08-04,2021-08-05,"No he didn't, he probably watched a stupid stream playthrough where everyone on chat is meming to the ground and clapping Everytime Abby died. You know, this kind of playthrough that gave birth to a loud minority of haters ."

Him giving individuality to Geth by his upgraded code and reapers seeing organics can actually make peace with synthetics. At the end go into an all out war. The ending will depend on if the Quarians and the Geth made peace or not, if Legion could persuade half of the reapers or not etc. You will win the fight, lose it or win by sacrificing too much based on your galactic readiness and the choices you made."

I'm fine with the fact that Cole Phelps dies at the end, but the way that he died (by being drowned in a literal torrent of shit) and not really getting to have any level of closure or at least reflection on his attempt at redemption was super lame for how much we see the character change and develop. Even having the corruption of the LAPD continue on without a prime whistleblower is great storytelling and a good ending to a noir game, I just wish he'd died in literally any other way - getting burnt by his ex-colleague with the flamethrower at the end of the game and living just long enough to take him out before succumbing to his wounds and coming full-circle in redeeming himself for his war crimes would have been much more poetic than choking to death on poop.

I'd cut the entire Starchild out, replace it by having someone techy go with Shepard to initialize the Crucible and explain options (also option to take TIM prisoner). Multiple endings, accessible with roughly ascending levels of cooperation score from the previous 3 games:


- Failure. You die before activating it because you didn't get enough support from other races. You lose. Everyone dies. Yes, those choices mattered. You get a cutscene of the Liara's message to the next cycle helping them break it as a comiseration prize.


- Kamikazee boom. If your assets aren't enough for the better options, you can cycle the Crucible faster. Downside: it blows the Earth relay, wiping out the entire solar system. So Earth? Gone. Quarian fleet? Gone. Should have actually built alliances. Have someone throw in Shepards face that they committed genocide once to stop the Reapers.


The following actions would require enough fleet ships, mostly boiling down to making peace between the Quarians and the Geth


- Control. Attempt to rewire it to control the reapers. Ending cutscenes show that this was an absolutely terrible idea and it fails utterly, and the player was a moron for not picking that up from the last 3 games.


- Destroy. The crucible works. The Repears are rendered inert, alongside all Reaper tech. The mass relays are disabled, along with the Citadel. The next epilogue has Shepard briefly helping navigate a new galactic order, depending on friends or enemies made along the way. Hints of a problem on the horizon from Tali about dark energy reinforced by recovering data from a disabled reaper about how mass effect is destroying the universe.


- Communicate. Communicates with the Reapers. Learn about the effect of the Mass Effect, why it's bad, but they won't back down. Have to then choose another ending.


- Cooperate. If Shepard has actually built genuine cooperation across the Galaxy, actually gets through to the reapers. They agree to stop purging, in exchange the galaxy stops using mass effect beyond very tight limits. If exceeded, conflict will return. (Shepard can then either destroy/control/trust them). Ending again has navigating a new galactic order.


- MAD - like Cooperate, but Shepherd threatens to activate the crucible if they ever come back. Doesn't seem very effective, in practice the same as cooperate with a more renegade slant.


- Humanity first. This option is advocated for by TIM if you have him with you and enough time. an option to have the weapon target both reaper and other race technologies. Alien tech expert refuses to do it - renegade option to shoot them in the face. TIM (or high tech shepherd) can then activate the crucible to destroy the reapers and pick through other races to destroy their tech.


- Dark ages. Similar to humanity first but destroys all mass effect tech in the galaxy, and doesn't required TIM or killing your tech person. Unless you want to - if it's Tali she spares the Quarian fleet and lies rather obviously about it, so to include them you do have to kill her."

Timeline God Liu Kang at the end of the story is guided by human raiden for the rest of his life and this becomes a big moment that helps Liu Kang build his character in his new role, shutting off all other timelines maybe except for the one where Shang Tsung wins

MK1 starts kinda the same but I would've loved to have Shang Tsung or even Shujinko take the role of new era Shang Tsung via Damashis deception, but this time it can actually be Onaga or still be Shang Tsung but the power makes it so that he can shapeshift (since Shang and Shujinko feel like the same kind of character just on different sides of good and evil)

Have Shujinko/ShangTsung do their journey throughout the realms

Have us question ""why are the""bad realms"" still there"" because I want better focus on the other realms and have human raiden stress to God liu kang in a flashback or something the important of having all the realms in relative untouchedness, Earth, Nether, Outworld, Order, Chaos, Edenia, and the Kamidogu are important again etc

So I'd probably keep the options for the existing 4 endings, but add in a 5th. To elaborate...

Edit: TL;DR:  
5th option to convince the Reapers to stand down by going over major decisions made across all 3 games.

----
Destroy and Control are the options that prove the Reapers. The Reapers are Synthetic life beyond their control, and the only way to co-exist is to destroy or dominate them. You either wipe the board of all synthetic life as Anderson would have, or dominate/control them as TIM would have.

However, Synthesis should have been described more as what Saren wanted. No longer simply organic or synthetic, but something more. Also, just because everyone/everything is a mix between synthetic/organic, doesn't mean it's all happy kumbaya between everyone. In ME2, Legion explains that the Geth was split between joining Saren and Sovereign in ME1. They're all Geth, they're all Synthetic, and even though they can all communicate with each other, it doesn't mean they agree and understand each other.

Hell, just look at organics in the Citadel. They all speak common and talk to each other, but cultural differences mean we all have trouble understanding each other. The Batarians consider slavery their right and it is part of their culture, enslaving people is just part of their lifestyle. Considering how much friction the other species have with the Batarians and their culture, even though they all can sit down and talk, do you really think just because Shepard forcefully converts everyone into organic-synthetic hybrid species, the Reapers will lay down arms and be all happy happy happy with everyone else?

If anything, I think Synthesis would have made the whole thing a bit more chaotic. At least right now, the Reapers are all under a hierarchy or mission goal. Destroy and Control basically remove or rewrite that goal, but Synthesis is freeing everyone to be ""equal"" moving forward. A Reaper is the combined knowledge of all the intelligent species of that cycle. Knowing Javik and how he portrays the Prothean, do you think the Prothean Reaper *wouldn't* immediately try to indoctrinate planets and establish dominance? And the Protheans are the only species we know from previous cycles.

So yeah... all I'm saying, Synthesis is uplifting all organics and synthetics to be techno-organic hybrids, while also freeing the Reapers from their original directive of harvesting the galaxy.

The 4th option of refusing the Star Child is pretty straight forward. You basically prove the Reapers right by shooting. A lot of Reapers die, the galaxy is harvested, the cycle continues.  
I also think the 4th ending is the worst, because you've essentially handed the Reapers a completed Crucible, and they now know about the security issue with the Keepers. The next cycle will either have fixed Keepers in the Citadel, or have Keepers 2.0 with some new species caring for the Citadel. As for the Crucible, it was basically a flu shot for them now. Next cycle, even if the next species manage to create the Crucible from the beginning and plug it in, the Reapers know about it and know to block it. Heck, if the next cycle start to immediately try to build the Crucible and it gets discovered by the Citadel, the Reapers might immediately come back to do another reset.

----
So here, I would put down a 5th option: you plead your case. The culmination of all your choices across the 3 games put forward to get the Reapers to stand down. As stated, no organic ever made it this far and it's clear the cycle is flawed and a new path needs to be determined.

The Star Child is basically the Reaper AI in the Citadel, and the Citadel has records of all the things Shepard has done, all the things the species from this cycle has done, and they can both bring forth topics to talk about. Shepard can talk about how their cycle is different, is better, and the Reaper can bring up counter points.  
Topics directly related like The Geth, how the Council treats the Quarians, the fallout with the whole conflict.  
Topics like how the Rachni was handled, uplifting the Krogans, the Genophage. How the Queen was treated, the choice you made in ME1. How the different species reacted to a possible Krogran threat with what they did on Tuchanka in ME3.  
The Reaper might even bring up what Shepard did to the Batarians at the end of ME2. Putting you on full blast for doing something unthinkable, unethical, despicable, etc. Is this the kind of species you want to survive the cycle?

Basically, this would be a final gambit between you, your choices throughout the trilogy, and the Reapers. The actions you've taken can prove, deny, or go beyond the Reapers expectations from organic species. The willing sacrifice of your own to save the Council? Trusting the Rachni Queen with freedom? How you dealt with the Heretic Geth? Wrex, the Krogans, and the Genophage? So on and so forth.

If you've done more to prove the species of this cycle are different, that organics can co-exist with not just each other, but with the synthetics they create, the Reapers can choose to pull back. Their directive has failed and their job is over, but now they can attempt to work on moving forward to what's next. If it's exile back into deep space, or leave the Milky Way for another star system, so be it. Or maybe they can stick around to help. Let the scientists figure out how to prevent indoctrination, and then slowly work towards being able to co-exist. At the end of the day, the Reapers are a product of the Leviathans, and even though they are the literal boogeymen of the galaxy, the Leviathans are to blame for this whole debacle.

If your actions just prove you cannot co-exist with organics, then it'll leave you to your fate. You can't shoot/kill the Star Child, it's a hologram. You can't run to the original 3 choices, you're weakened and it probably took away the bridge to get there and/or closed the window to protect you from shooting the thing. The culmination of all your choices show you are no different from the previous cycles, only that the cycle needs some work to prevent them from getting this far again.

====

Does this mean you need to do a full Paragon run? No, there should be some choices where the Renegade choice is the ""right"" choice to make. Sometimes the right choice is the one where you need to be the bad guy. Although, this is probably more of an issue with categorizing choices as Paragon or Renegade, and how certain choices/options get locked behind the system.

At best, the Reapers stands down and becomes a new species in the Galaxy. At worst, you prove the Reapers right and war continues. Even with a Krogan army, a united Geth and Quarian fleet, and whatever other species army you can muster, all you can do is watch the Reapers decimate their forces. But at the very least, the choices you made helped decide this outcome, and not just make a choice based on what other people wanted.

You don't Destroy the Reapers because the Citadel species demanded they be destroyed.  
You don't Control the Reapers because you wanted the power of the Reapers like TIM.  
You don't force the galaxy to be uplifted into some Synthesis where everyone is now a organic-synthetic creature, like Saren wanting everyone to be better so the Reapers would let them live.  
You, Shepard, made choices over the course of 3 games that convinced the Reapers to change their directive, to choose whether to stand down and let this cycle move forward and explore something new.

Without the main Reaper directive, maybe some Reapers will stand down. Maybe some will try to force their collective cycle consciousness to establish their own new reign of power. Maybe some will fight against each other. The Reapers unshackled are AI, each powered by the collective knowledge of that cycle, and who knows how they might act without the original directive to keep them focused.

So yeah, I'd add a 5th option to where you try to convince the Reapers with your past actions. If it leads to peace, slavery, or destruction, it's because you made the choices that led to that conclusion. Not because you picked a color."

1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"And also make the music that plays over the ending triumphant... after playing through the Gears franchise, I strongly feel like something along the lines of 'Finally A Tomorrow' (specifically the part that starts from the shot of Hoffman up to Carmine surviving) should have been playing during the sequence of the Reapers being destroyed, given how it not only accomplishes the goal Shepard had through the entire Trilogy but also frees not just the current species of the Galaxy but all future ones from the fate of being harvested by the Reapers (and from Javik's perspective, avenges the Protheans and all other species previously wiped out by the Reapers) so it's the biggest victory in the history of the Galaxy in that series."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"I personally disagree with this. The trilogy was never meant to be about winning but more so about how you go out.

I feel it far more fits in with the themes that are played out in alot of love crafts stories which the trilogy took so much inspiration from.

It's not about win or lose but rather it's asking if you're proud of what you left behind in your lifetime?

 Did the galaxy go out still bickering amongst eachother or did they manage to put their differences aside in the end and go out as one? Did your friends meet their end bitterly or did you help them resolve their traumas and go out with a sense of peace?

What about you? Are you proud of your actions? Did you ruthlessly pull no punches and go out with a fight the reapers won't soon forget? Or maybe you took every opportunity to bring people together? Did you manage to take the reapers down with you and assure the next cycle gets to live on? 

Basically to me the entire trilogy, 3rd game especially, is thematically similar to how a man on his death bed might feel as he looks around at all the people in his life and what he's leaving behind"
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"I'd have it so Destroy is the only option. How well that goes depends on your war assets. High enough war assets, and the Geth and EDI live. I'd still have Shepard die though tbh."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"Just TEB, AHEM and CEM on PC and boom, you got a great ending ;)  
( Take Earth Back, Audemus Happy Ending Mod, Citadel Epilogue Mod)

And there is so much more mods you can add for the Legendary Edition."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"oof seems like you fucked up... shepard can survive in one of the endings, if you have high enough war assets, there's even a cutscene showing him breathing or gasping for air among some rubble"
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"If you get the best ending for all 3 games, and you carry over your saves, you get a special ending."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,But we got like 5 minutes of additional ending to episode 2 in alyx.
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,If rumors are true there's a new Half Life game in the works.
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-17,There actually kinda is an ending if you played the old republic mmo. The mmo and its dlc has a continuation as to what happened to Revan and the main character from kotor 2 after the kotor storylines.
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"Seriously, Master Chief and Cortana should have been finished after Halo 3. Nothing they've done with the characters since has been worth the damage done to the brand. There's dozens of other Spartans we could have followed, as well as countless ODSTs and even Sangheili that would have been prime material for new stories but nope, always gotta follow the empty suit of armor. Master Chief isn't even that interesting of a character, especially after he just goes full force simp for Cortana, who is literally a computer program."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"Came here to say pretty much exactly this.

ODST and Reach are the only games released after Halo 3. The rest are bad fanfic.

I wish MCC didn't have that blight stain that is 4 taking up unwelcome space."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"I barely paid attantion to Halo 4 when it came out. Thought it was pretty forgettable at the time. Loved the Bungie games, but 4 just kinda slipped by.

Revisited it a few years ago and I was actually shocked at how frustratingly bad it actually is. The story, the lore, the level design, the weapon balance and sandbox; it's all just SO far below passable, it's ridiculous.

Even the art style, which can look pretty at times, is more often extremely harsh and muddy when in combat."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"I'm playing Space Marine 2 these days and it just feels like a sliver in time during the Forerunner-Flood war. 343 had a universe of endless stories to tell that they could have drawn inspiration from. We could have had 3 games focused on the Flood expansion up to the first firing of the rings alone. We could have had new flood infection on some new made planet sparkling a new race for the rings. Iunno man I'm just spitballing here. I think we could put 5 nerds in a room and write a better halo trilogy in an afternoon than 343 did in, checks notes, 12 YEARS. "
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,I agree. Halo 3 should have been the end of Master Chief and Cortona's story. Halo 4 should have rolled with Crimson and Majestic team especially when they featured a full set of support characters. 
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,You never know... SOMEHOW Master Chief has returned!
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,IMO 4 was freaking amazing and I'd end it there. 5 is where things tanked.
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"Yeah I mean honestly it's hard to have a more compelling narrative than humanity literally fighting desperately and heroically for survival against a zealous alien collective for decades. That premise is just so compelling that nothing can really compare to it. The sequels really should not have happened when the OT already had a satisfying ending.

  
If anything they should've just gone the Reach and ODST route and set anthology type stories in the universe that fleshed it out more. Those were some great games"

1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"I honestly felt the ending to 2 would've been better received if you actually got to choose to follow through with Ellie's revenge.  She had no problem leaving a bloodbath behind her like a John Wick movie until it came to the ending scenes.

That and maybe have Joel go down swinging instead of a cartel execution, he's earned that right."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"The Last of Us 1 didn't have a feel good ending either. 

The point of the end was Joel forsaking the world to save a girl that reminded him of his daughter.

TLoU2 is a game showing the results of Joel's rampage. 

The point of the end is that Joel gave Ellie a good life at the expense of Abby's and Abby ruined Ellie's life the same way Joel ruined her, leading to everyone involved getting destroyed by it.

It's a good story, people just dislike Joel died and are upset Ellie was completely broken by the end of it that she didn't even want to kill Abby anymore realizing everything she gave up for it."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"Yeah I've been back and forth on it ever since I played it. Amazing gameplay. Incredible graphics. Good characters who all had great acting performances.

But like you said, there are no real ""feel good"" beats >!beyond Ellie and Dina getting some time together on the farm. Beyond that, apart from filling in the blanks of what happened between Joel and Ellie, the story of the game is just Ellie going on a revenge mission. *Twice.* Both ending mostly the same way. While that's all happening the lives of every character just get unimaginably shittier as things continue.!< By the time the credits roll you just feel depressed instead of wondering what happens next.

I can guess what's going to happen next: awful things will continue to happen to everyone. Yay."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"The “feels good” moments in TLOU2 were the flashbacks with Ellie and Joel. That sequence at the space center was incredible, and it was the moment that most reminded of the best moments of TLOU1. "
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"I dig Necron. Having this judgmental embodiment of death and what that means fit the themes of the game perfectly.

1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"Most of the factions are diametrically ideologically opposed to each other. Even if you managed to somehow negotiate a temporary cease-fire between them, I wouldn't really buy it as an ""ending"" because I don't think the peace would last. The Brotherhood believes that the way the Institute uses technology is inherently evil and the sort of thing that could destroy the world again. The Institute's ideology and life research won't allow them to stop doing everything the Brotherhood wants. The Railroad is radically at odds with the other 2 factions and they will never agree about the personhood of synths. The Minuteman can mostly agree with everyone, but them making peace with at least one other faction is already a possible ending. 

Now, one thing I would like to see changed is the ability to have a little bit of control over the faction's future if you choose the Institute. You don't have the option to try and make the Institute better or make it start treating the people of the Commonwealth better. It is assumed that is you go Institute, they will keep kidnapping and replacing people."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"You can have an ending where only the Institute is destroyed. I feel like this is the best case scenario. It wouldn't make any sense for all the factions to have peace in the end, something needed to give."

Isn't that what happens throughout the ENTIRE GAME?"
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,I disagree. That would ruin the narrative/game. The entire premise of Night City is that there are no winners. You either die a nobody or burn out in blaze of glory. Those are exactly the endings that V has presented to them.
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"I thought that was actually a good ending to Mafia 2.

My biggest complaint is Tommy suddenly changing his whole views. From the beginning, he told ellie it would only end in heartbreak, only for him to show up at the end and fuel her revenge."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,It'd be interesting if you could choose to keep going down the original path or you could choose to give up her path of vengeance and end the game early knowing what Abby and Lem's fate is.
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"My head canon is that Ellie goes back to Jackson and works to regain Dina's trust. It takes time but she gets there.

The part I can't get past is that Abby took Ellie's fingers meaning she can't play the guitar anymore. This bit hurts because the guitar was how Ellie felt closer to Joel so without her fingers she loses that connection to him. I hope she found a way to play despite missing two fingers."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"She does have a chance at peace, though.

In the same way that the ending of TLOU1 is superficially happy but undercut with a note of bleak foreboding, the ending of TLOU2 is superficially grim, but undercut with a note of optimism.

Ellie has hit her rock bottom; and in hitting that rock bottom, finding out just how appallingly far one can go in the name of a loved one/to assuage one's own trauma, she's finally come to a place of true understanding for Joel, and why he did what he did.

And coming to that understanding is what finally enables her to move forward. Finally forgiving Joel for what he did. And in forgiving Joel, having to accept the final gift he wanted for her: the ability to simply go out and exist in the world, to live and have a life, and to determine the course of that life for herself. And in accepting *that,* at last, she is able to start to let go of the thing that has driven her all game: her own guilt, for not forgiving Joel, for not saving Joel, for not saving humanity, for still being alive. In achieving closure for Joel's death, she's able to start to forgive herself.

The ending of TLOU1 is a, ""They lived happily ever after... *for now,""* with an implied sword of Damocles hanging over Joel and Ellie's relationship that you know will eventually fall. The ending of TLOU2 sees Ellie go through the darkest (literal and metaphorical) storm of her life, but come out of the storm on the other side finally able to start processing her grief and trauma healthily, and start to heal."

1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"I’d argue the ‘real’ problem was that the three colors all had the same result; the reapers are neutralized but the galaxy as we knew it is still effectively obliterated. 

It’s made abundantly clear throughout the entire series that the galactic community cannot exist without the Mass Relays, and only the Reapers possess the technology to build and repair them. And in each version of the ending, the entire network is destroyed, effectively ending galactic society. Every planet that isn’t fully self sufficient at that moment is cut-off and doomed, and any planet that would have been capable of being self sufficient pre-Reapers would have been a priority target and is almost certainly in ruins (ex;Earth). In the decades to centuries it would take to even rebuild the network, assuming you even can, a gigantic chunk of the galaxy would have ended up starving to death.

There’s nothing necessarily wrong with bittersweet “…but at what cost?” kind of endings, but ME didn’t end that way. If it was anymore triumphant and saccharine a unicorn would have fallen out of Garrus’ ass."

1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,I think this it is. If she killed Abby then the game would be better. Stories about revenge where you decide in the end spare the person sucks. Ellie killed over thousand random guys but somehow Abby deserve mercy?
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"I think TLoU2 was on the right track with giving Joel a cartel execution. That's kind of what it's all about, there are no heroes and there is no glory, the world is just fucked and nobody is special.  

Then they chickened out at the end by having literally every character waffle on their ideals. Tommy suddenly becomes obsessed with vengeance and doesn't care who gets hurt, Abby suddenly decides violence is bad and wants to be a good role model for Lev, Ellie goes back and forth like 3 times on whether she's batman or a family gal.  

Could probably get away with ONE of those and make it interesting, but all of it together was just sloppy and felt inconsistent. It's probably realistic, that's how people are, but it's a shoddy narrative.  

IMO they should have gone harder on the idea that Abby follows in the footsteps of Joel, her former mortal enemy, and Ellie is forced to see in Lev a better version of herself, what she could've been and what Joel wanted her to be. They were ALMOST there but fumbled it by trying to do too much at once."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,">The point of the end was Joel forsaking the world to save a girl that reminded him of his daughter.


That is if you think the Fireflies are actually capable of manufacturing a cure. I don't think they could and they were mighty fast in deciding to kill Ellie."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"100% the only reason people hate TLOU 2 is because Joel dies, which is unfortunate because it really sets up the plot of the game well and reinforces the core thesis of the game that revenge is a self destructive concept in its very nature."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,That's what I said. The ending of the series would be the end of the first game.
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,That was such a bad cop out. Sending in a radiation proof ally should've been a secret ending kind of option
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"Yeah, which makes it even more infuriating that it has no effect at all on the ending."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,Joe was my guy😂
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,Nothing distracts like shooting them to death. Or a stick of dynamite.
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"I don't see it that way. I think Tommy always wanted revenge but didn't want Ellie to have that life. Tommy was by Joel's side during the early years when everyone was out for themselves and they were doing bad things just trying to survive so Tommy knew there would be no happy ending in pursuing Abby and didn't want that for Ellie, he knew Joel wouldn't want it either. Knowing that wasn't enough to deter him from going after Abby though, which is why he went out there on his own.

I think his change at the end was driven more by desperation and hatred of Abby causing him to override his fear of allowing Ellie to indulge her rage than an actual view change. After all, Ellie had already gone out there and already done horrible things so why not try to finish the job?"
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"Tommy has a TBI from being shot alongside the brain. TBIs notoriously cause massive personality shifts. In addition to this, you see in both the first and second game that being involved in the Jackson community, being a helper, devoting himself to being one of the community's protectors is something that gives his life a lot of purpose and meaning.

By the time of the farmhouse chapter, he's had time to not only stew in the loss of his brother and his inability to avenge him, he is also physically disabled. He walks with a heavy limp, he suffers from chronic pain; he can't even park himself atop a tower and help guard Jackson's perimeter, because he's blind in one eye, and can no longer use his signature weapon: the sniper rifle. The nature of his injuries and of the setting mean that Tommy can no longer be active in the way he was; can no longer contribute to his community in the way that gave him purpose. And so in addition to the psychological damage wrought by both trauma and his brain injury, for the duration of the timeskip, he's had nothing to do *but* sit around and stew in his own bitterness."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,Tommy berating Ellie at the end was so out of character. I hated that bit so much.
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,This! Well said: the comparison between the endings (optimistic with note of bleakness / bleak with a note of optimism) is spot on.
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"It's not really an argument, it's a proven point that the creator was poorly staffed, under pressure from the studio, and didn't get to do what he wanted. It's just like the original ending to Evangelion vs literally any other ending. You might say ""well we got the original ending"". well, yea. Look at the actual endings they went on to make when they had the freedom to do it, though."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"Nah, not the full picture. Square said just end it at disc one. He has openly said he didn't get to do what he wanted. It would have turned out differently and quite likely better. Hence the original post."

1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"Honestly see them retconning that. Continuning Mass Effect post reaper war in the milky way basically makes control and synthesis impossible endings to explain.


Whatever new threat comes up would need to be way deadlier than the reapers and synthesis is an asspull perfect world where conflict theoretically will no longer happen so a threat would need to be from beyond the galaxy.


And it's a retcon I wouldn't mind at all, seeing how shitty ME3's ending was."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"It's sad, but logical in a way. If the Geth survive Rannoch, they absorb the Reaper code to become completely sentient, intelligent beings. Same way for EDI because she has the Reaper Code after taking the Reaper IFF in ME2.  The destroy beam just doesn't discriminate and will eliminate anything with the Reaper code."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,The hardest choices require the strongest will
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"Yeah, that's some thick ass cope.."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"Yeah my issue was the ending was badly written, rushed and answered unneeded questions. It was so bad that I've boycotted EA since and I didn't even bother touching Andromeda. 

If you cut out the Star child and had Destroy as the ending then it's ok enough. Even one that ends with Shep dying isn't an issue as long as it was executed better. My suggestion for a cheesy RotJ ending would have just pleased the majority."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,The leaks so far seem to indicate that there's a non VR title and a VR title in development. With Deadlock too it seems like Valve is finally starting to make games again.
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"Yes ODST could have been it's own trilogy. They could have just made an ODST game for every chief game. 


Since they're just human, they could have done a Dead Space rip off even of just one ODST surviving a flood infected ship. "
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"But Paarthurnax is the OG and having him suggest you kill the Blades would imply that they were right. Fuck em, though, seriously."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"It would have been, if they didn't foreshadow it with your character basically now being a psychopath and mentally deranged from killing people. Far from a Hollywood action movie good guy wins ending."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"Snake is still dead from the aging, isn't he? He just gets a few months for closure."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"Abby deserved to die, she sucks."

1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,I really like the part of the epilogue where Ellie tried to play the guitar again but couldn't because she lost her fingers which was more symbolism of giving everything up for revenge. She has nothing now. Not even the only thing left of Joel.
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"I genuinely can't comprehend how people can hold these intellectually dishonest and reductive narratives when it comes to criticism of something they like. That behavior is fucking all over Reddit and the internet.

It's insane to claim TLOU2 is only criticized because Joel died. There's so many good videos and reviews going over the story and its flaws."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"Joel dying and Abby living amd Ellie never getting to avenge him, having to live on knowing his murderer and the one who crippled her is running around free and clear."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"you need to re-read that interview. he was not talking about the story being incomplete. he was talking about \*how\* they finished the game was a regret. They didnt end after solaris, and they moved into the studio and worked on it day and night just to be able to tell the whole story. there are no questioned left unanswered for xenogears."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-17,"One of the main reasons that type of ending was never that likely is cause BG3 takes place in the Forgotten Realms. This is one of the more high fantasy type settings of D&D where pretty much anything is possible.

Even when people were killed of for plot reasons and story or even progress of time; like the Companions of Drizzt, these guys reincarnated like a few decades after their death. Gods walk around and die almost all the time here."

1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"For what it’s worth, Andromeda isn’t half bad. The facial animations and most of the bugs got cleaned up, and the combat is pretty fun. Story isn’t great but it isn’t offensively bad or anything. Worth picking up on sale for like $10.

You can pretty plainly tell why it wasn’t exactly a runaway success at release, but there’s meat on the bone. 

The greatest tragedy is the lack of Mass Effect games and media. S tier sci-fi universe mostly left to rot."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,They just acquired a bunch of devs from Hopoo Games (of Risk of Rain 2) too so that's a good sign.
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,"At least how I understood it, he managed to snap back and regain his humanity by saving his friends and returning home, while the other ending symbolizes him embracing the new psychopath side."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"Right. My headcanon is in the 8 months following GOTP, snake became something of a global celebrity; he traveled with otacon and sunny, told his story, essentially cleared his name as rhe truth of the patriots came out, but the more he told, the more people questioned, irritating him to no end as his health declined, robbing him of his ability to even walk in time. In time, the authorities that once were out for his head became replaced by endless paparrazzo.

One morning, he felt a presence awake him. It was that of his old friend, gray fox. He knew what that meant. All he wanted was to watch the sunrise one more time before they left. As a fleet of  news vans pulled up on the nomad, snake laid down, and passed away with a smile on his face, like in the projectbitoh novel. They had no choice but to lift the search, the alert, ro leave him oracon and sunny alone. Snake left the world doing what he did best - giving his pursuers the slip. He got away."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"No, I think context matters a lot in a situation like that.

Full stop, they weren't gonna manufacturer a cure in that grimy hospital room. The only thing they'd have achieved is Ellie being dead and the possibility of a cure along with her."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"It's not daring to try, it's deciding to murder a girl."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"I literally cried at that point. I can't believe I had to dig this deep into the comments to find someone defending the end of TLOU2, it was basically a perfect story, and any other ending would've been a disservice to the rest of the story."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"Funny how most of the criticism about the game came out immediately after the plot got leaked ahead of the game launching and a lot of the complaints never changed. What else is to complain about? The existence of gay relationships? The fact that Abby has muscles even though it makes perfect sense in context? The only valid complaint about the game is that it's probably too long, the rest are a bunch of hogwash propagated by people who didn't even play the damn game."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"Ellie letting go of revenge because it cost her everything she loved is the entire point of the game, the game is a warning against seeking revenge. Also I wouldn't really say Abbie is running free considering she lost basically everyone she loved and was nearly tortured to death alongside her only remaining friend. It makes me sad that these points missed you because of how clearly they are portrayed in the game."

""...the story in Xenogears wasn't finished. And not just limited to the monologue. It wouldn't have been so simple to make it like the game of disc 1. Probably, it's as finished as it ever will be. Maybe if the players are aggravated enough, it could be redone in the future.""

Then again, I'm no Mass Effect lore expert."
1g4e29l,2024-10-15,2024-10-16,"Kinda defeats the purpose, since Reapers are all over the galaxy"

If you think the game is a storytelling masterpiece with the only flaw being that it's probably too long, then by all means enjoy and express that. But you're filling in the reasons why people dislike the story and invalidate them in the process, that's just bad faith."

And if they were about to murder Ellie, then murdering them to stop them can be justified."

As a company whose purpose is to generate profit (and rightfully so) I completely understand they don’t objectively owe me unhurt feelings and that they can delegate their creative manpower however they like.

If we’re gonna refer to it as art, I’d prefer them to create the fucking art you say they love creating and then they’d get more revenue and fan loyalty, instead of rehashing old art for quick revenue, pissing off the people who were fans of their art to begin with.

I'm just curious as to why BotW was higher than NieR in the score category. I'm not being toxic towards BotW (I own both), but I can only think of the reason being that BotW just had a lot more exposure and people who've played the game. I personally found the BotW score to be a bit disappointing because it was so limited but I understand it is because of the nature of the game.

Also, Aloy’s voice actress was nothing special. She was very monotone and wooden. The voice actress for Senua in Hellblade was way better. She actually showed a range of emotion.

Melina as Senua was one of the best performances in gaming period. And Brian Bloom is the best in the business and kills BJ every single time. I'll chalk it up to game popularity though.

Also best music/score not going to Nier or Persona 5 is a joke and again probably just due to popularity. "

You have to remember that Zelda receives the same treatment from most gaming sites... ie. A total lack of objectivity due to just being Zelda/Nintendo. Whereas other rpg games(like say Horizon Zero Dawn) get criticised for being ""unoriginal"" and ""not innovate enough"" while being compared to every other rpg out there while the latest Zelda, which is the most generic Zelda yet and borrows ideas from every rpg game out there gets an ""Greatest game ever, masterpiece, GOTY"" talk just for being Zelda. Gotta love those double standards. Essentially every Zelda game that is released is the greatest of all time/GOTY, till the next one comes out.

PS. Also at the same time i remember all the same gaming critics and journos and a fair few gamers gushed over likes of Skyward Sword or the likes of Dragon Age:Inquisition in a similiar fashion with glowing reviews and ott hyperbolic praise as well... So yeeeaah im a gonna take these overly positive statements/reviews of Zelda BOTW with a large grain of salt. From what ive read and seen its not doing anything that other games havent done better before it, but because its Zelda im meant to think its the best thing since sliced bred. No thank you. I give it six months to a year later when everyone will be saying it wasn't that awesome after all, and there will be redactions and a dialing down of the ott hyperbolic praise and a more honest appraisal can be had.

BotW though, felt like something new. I don't think I've ever played a game that felt so unlike a ""video game"" before. I kept trying stupid shit that would never work in another video game, just to see what would happen, and it all worked.

/r/gaming is way too hiveminded. Cuphead for best score? Lol. Surprised it didn't win best narrative too here."
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-06,Agreed. I played both games and Nier definitely has the most phenomenal score of any game released this year. BOTW doesn't even come close.
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-06,"Speaking as someone who played BotW and NieR for several dozens of hours each, I can say that I hands down pick BotW. I loved NieR, and it’s definitely my favorite PC game of all time. But it still can’t even come close to BotW IMO.

I think that the narrative of BotW was very subtle, but very strong. After finishing the game and the second DLC (still haven’t gotten around to the first, I don’t even know what it is yet), I can say that the narrative totally engulfed me and I caught myself uncontrollably smiling at the key points.

While NieR does have an amazing score, I think the great thing about BotW was that it didn’t. I mean, the music was amazing, but most of your adventure was silent. It really built onto the huge world and the sensation it brought. That alone, for challenging the conventions of how a game’s music should be formatted, is what makes me think BotW managed to outperform NeiR.

But if I’m going to be totally honest, NeiR should have won both times. I personally feel that, even though BotW was my favorite, if they were equally popular games, NeiR would have won. You are totally right in saying that there wasn’t an equal playing field, but that’s life. I’m sure there’s a much smaller game out there with a better narrative and music than both BotW and NeiR. Maybe even Petscop."
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-11,maybe a game that has you slogging through tens of hours of of bland gameplay through a bland world only to have to do it all over again with even more blandness for little payoff is a bad game
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-06,I didn't care for Nier Automata's narrative. The ideas were novel but the execution was poor. The plot was choppy due to the split chapters and aside from 2B and 9S none of the characters were fleshed out or had any real development.

That's a big joke. Same for a lot of other categories.

Tells you a lot about the average consumer, even when they pretend to cry about EA doing shit, in the end they will buy every shit, I mean they can't even do a survey right / sincerely."
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-05,"It would be for ongoing game. I took the list from the Game Awards show and added WoW based on someone’s feedback. Otherwise it doesn’t technically fit in the realm of 2017.

I did like the way they did the whole datapoints thing where you slowly pick up tiny pieces of the puzzle to put together why the world is how it is. It's one of the only games where I actually stopped to read and listen to every single note I came across. Like you said, the other elements were first-class.

7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-07,"It's because HZD was the more popular game. This entire thing was just a popularity contest. That's why Cuphead and BotW basically won every category they were in.

You could nominate BotW for best performance and it would still win over Hellblade just because it's so much more popular."

I wish more people had the joy of experiencing NieR: Automata. Hell, I wish more people would play HZD too. These games both highlight why games can be a great medium."

It’s an excellent game in so many ways, and it took me playing it to realize.   It deserves most awards its getting imo. And tbh it definitely does things differently from other games.

Breath of the Wild was fantastic and I've soaked more hours into it than Odyssey, but Odyssey felt like it had the most clever design per square metre. Now that I think about it, I probably had more fun with Zelda, but I feel like if I had to rank the games being as unbiased and objective I could, Odyssey just seemed so well-polished overall."
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-06,"A lot of what you say shadows my opinion about botw. Whenever people ask me what it is like I tell them anything you think should happen does.

7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-07,"I like Breath of the Wild so far because it seems every of-age female wants some of that link booty.

I've barely started playing either, that is my judgment so far."
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-12,"Me too. Personally I'm biased towards Zelda. It's not that I don't like Mario, but I never grew up with him, except for at friends' houses and such playing MarioKart. And I like some of the platforming games, but surprisingly this is the first time I beat a Mario game. Huh.

It was a new experience honestly and I liked the fact that it was more free and open than the hyper-linear designs they've previously had. It was clever, sounded amazing, and although I'm not a big fan of the art style, it did look nice. My personal favorites were the Metropolis and Wooded Kingdoms which looked stunning.

But BOTW was something different altogether. I had a connection the series. I was familiar with the world, but I wasn't familiar with BOTW's. It was different in all the best ways. Not only did the game look absolutely fucking beautiful, but the word was so alive. It wasn't just a few select areas with people. There were towns all over. People travelled the roads. Enemies were fairly intelligent, using weapons on the ground and other enemies as weapons. Literally my only complaints about the game were weapon durability (not the system itself but how extreme it was) and rain when you need to climb. 

BOTW and Odyssey are both something special. Odyssey perfects a series classic in Mario 64 (haven't played it but I've heard it's amazing) but BOTW reignites the fire in a series. It showed us that it was worth it to wait all those years for a new Zelda. And I'm so fucking excited for the next game."

7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-06,"I think what you're saying makes sense for audio design, but not soundtrack/score."
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-09,"Man, I just can't see how someone would say the narrative in BotW is good. It's pretty much the exact same story Zelda has told time and time again. And while it's neat that they added little bits of story in the memories, they didn't even live up to past games in terms of their storytelling. Also I thought the side quests were severely lacking."
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-08,"Having played both I completely disagree with you.

>most of your adventure was silent

Yeah, that means it wasn't a great soundtrack/score."

7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-05,"I completely agree, first couple of hours were so slow.  I was just more surprised it didn't get mentioned.  

I know it may not be game of the year when compared with Horizon (only got Xbox but that game looks fantastic), Zelda or Mario, but I figured it'd get some form of recognition from gamers considering how the franchise use to put out the games on a yearly basis.

Its like with Origins they gave us what we want.  Egypt is the perfect setting, Bayek may not be Ezio but his motivations are understandable and it probably has one of the best looking and playing open worlds.  

If the full results get posted I'd like to see what people liked about it."
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-10,"I disagree. Personally I would vote for Persona but they  both are well deserving.

As for Persona's being done before probably not to it's extent. Persona 5 art direction praise doesn't lie in it being ""cartoon anime style"" but in how stylish the game does everything, especially the UI.

https://i.pinimg.com/originals/93/6c/c7/936cc7d7c3b3c23678cbcde6f6720b11.gif

Either way all I said is that Persona should be on the top 3 and the most stylish game this year, not that it should've won."
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-07,"That’s like saying super man isn’t a Mary Sue because he’s a kryptonian. In the story Aloy never seems out of breath or challenged by any obstacle.

7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-10,"The combat is great, and so is the music.
The story seems good on your first play through, but once you know all of the twists the game has the worst story I've ever seen. It retcons itself (something is set up and retconed within the span of one cutscene once) the characters actions make no sense, it tries to make you sympathise with madmen, and what little character development there is is boring or cliche."

7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-10,Definitely isn't. Games worthy enough to be considered an eSport are actually fun to watch. Overwatch is the most boring fucking game I've ever witnessed. Many others say the same. Overwatch has no right to be considered the best eSport game. There are games way better that have pulled way more viewership in tournaments. I'm baffled at all the 12 year olds on this sub that voted for Overwatch knowing that there are far superior games and most people agree the game is not very entertaining to spectate.

7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-06,"Odyssey is fantastically designed, but BotW was a constant new and exciting experience. I just didn't feel that from Odyssey. It's the difference between the best version of something I've done before, versus trying something new in a hobby that I thought I'd never try something that felt new again. Everything in Odyssey impressed, but nothing surprised, not everything in BotW impressed (there are definitely issues), but there were just so many surprises in a ""games don't do that"", sense. 

I don't know how else to describe it. But I've put like 150 hours into Zelda, and maybe 40 into Odyssey, and I'm still playing Zelda 8 months after release and finding new stuff."
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-06,"I have so many problems with Odyssey that it makes me mad that people call it well-polished. It's not. The story is short, the ending is disappointing, moons had the same problem korok seeds did, and the fact that some of Mario's moves are motion control only is a huge turn-off for me. I know I don't ""need"" the motion controls, but I hated playing in handheld because of this, and handheld was a big draw for me. SMO is great, don't get me wrong, it's one of my favorite games of the year despite how I talked about it. I just don't think it's better than Zelda in any way, including ""polish""."
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-06,"Yeah, I remember being stuck in the rain and being like ""I need to rest so this rain passes, and thinking, I wonder if I can take that metal door and wedge it here to get out of the rain so I can start a fire. Everything in my video game limitations lexicon screamed ""This is dumb, there is no way that will work"", and it did. Time and time again I either discovered moments like this, or saw other people discovering things like this, and it was just a constant stream of ""oh, they actually thought this out to that extent?"" moments. From a game design perspective, I don't think anything I've ever played has had as well thought out and cohesive mechanics."

7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-09,"I respect your opinion, however in regards to ""Best ESport"" I think it's ridiculous that CS didn't win. Its ESports fan base is just so much larger than that of Overwatch and Rocket League, and its really a unique ESport in that the concept is extremely simple and you don't really need to understand any game mechanics to spectate it - everything is very intuitive in that way.

Even if CS didn't win, how was it not on the top 3? I mean arguably I could see LoL and maybe DOTA being up there but RL and OW???"
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-07,"OW is good, but that's it. It's just good.

How anyone prefers watching pro OW matches compared to the SPL or SC II leagues, I have no idea."

7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-17,"Its a good, fun game. Not for everyone obviously but its easily my favorite game from 2016 and well into 2017 until I got a switch. Plus it does lootboxes right"

Watch a new match, it is infinitely better, easy to follow. They know it sucked before and changed it."
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-17,"When was the last you watched it? Recently they're really pushing for esports which is a lot easier to digest and understand. The cameras move a lot more smoothly, they have replays, a top down view occasionally, and teams have their own color and white for ""away"" teams. Does seem like they kind of tried to make it too much like US football though."
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-06,And it clearly is not the best esports game.
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-12,"THat’s maybe true for dota (dota players tend to play only dota, they have way less games in their steam library) but that’s not the case at all for csgo in my experience"

BOTW probably still has my favorite because almost no other game uses music in the same way it does and I'm a sucker for minimalist piano and its audio design is ridiculous, but Xenoblade 2 is a close second for me right now. And I'll admit it has more earworms.

Also, that ending theme."
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-07,"Some general criticisms

*The world is bland looking and sort boring

*The side quests are basically ""Go here, kill this robot and collect an item""

*The supporting characters are underdeveloped and the Villains are severely lacking

*Too much of the story relies on expositional data logs

*The item/upgrade system requires too much grinding

*The game didnt need to be broken up into multiple playthroughs. 9S's story was almost identical to 2B's with 1 or 2 extra tidbits of information and the playthrough just had you repeat everything you've already done but added the hacking minigame.

*The game has a message that's all too familiar and redundant. We get it, AI can have feelings too, War is pointless, whats the meaning to life, yada yada yada...it's all been done before and Nier Automata just beats you over the head with it from start to finish.

With all that being said it's still a well made game and the presentation was great. It just didnt ""Wow"" me like most people."

7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-05,I think the audience that frequents the sub is probably not that into esports. I mean I think it's still really up in the air whether Overwatch goes anywhere as an esport and this coming year is going to be a big test to see if they can actually start bringing in the viewers.
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-10,"I used it as a starting point and added in many areas. We have another plan for next year. For the most part, what we have got the job done rather well. I’m rather positive it wouldn’t have changed the top 3 in any category."
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-05,That might explain why only 2/3 of people on Xbox even bothered to complete the first area. They may have felt it was too slow.
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-07,Pretty sure there was controversy around greed before it's release.
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-11,It's an action rpg. Don't know what that guy's talking about.
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-17,"No, but a single player game can't really work like that. I've had family members want to see me play it or something, but its more family friendly and available to most people rather than possible for everyone to play at once.  
  
I'd still consider mario kart better for a family though"

7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-05,It’s because Rocket League/Psyonix has terrible marketing and not really good production value compared to top tier e-sports. The game is pretty much soccer which is already the most viewed real life sport. Idk how they haven’t captured a larger audience by now. I feel like Latin America would eat the game up
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-07,"I agree on your point about the characters, I felt the same there. I also agree about the story not being as special as some make it out to be.

My other problem was the combat. I felt that the game never forces you to play different and you fight every enemy the same. Also, you are basically the same as the beginning in the end except for a few minor changes. Though I heard when you max things out gameplay changes but in my playthrough to E I was never able to max everything or anything besides the Engine Blade.

I think the bland world, although from a game standpoint is very lacking, worked for the game itself. I think people hype the multiple playthroughs a little, but I do think A and B were slightly cool in that it gives you extra tidbits second time around. It's basically continuing the story with credits in-between. I feel like most side quest in games are the same so I never dock games for them.

That being said I do think it's great at being a game, but doesn't amount to be untouchable as many claim it to be. It's an okay game overall."
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-07,"

* It's an dying world, what are you hoping for.

* The side quests is simple, yes, but I don't think it's insignificant for it can add a lot to the game' world. 
* If this is about A2, yes, but only ingame.
* This is personal so i don't judge you.
* Again, this is also personal. You don't HAVE to do so.
* I don't think of route B as ""another playthrough"" because it isn't. A normal playthough is consist of three main route, A, B, C. And I suppose you don't know the purpose of playing as 9S in route B as well?
* Perhaps. But it's not about the theme or the message, it's the way the story is told.


If it didn't ""wow"" you then simply it isn't for you. You don't have to love everything. But you need to fully undertand the game story or at least a main part of it to bash the game for something like ""overhyped"". "

When I played Horizon, it didn't feel like an RPG to me because leveling and progression felt very bare bones, but again, I'll admit that's just a perspective thing."

It's still something of a testament to the Switch's launch year that we're even having this discussion.

7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-11,"I play OW a lot more than I do SC II, and I know infinitely more about what's going on.

What you watch isn't tied to what you know. I know football in and out and it's boring as fuck compared to something like marksmen games or hockey, both of which I know little about.

What matters is that you can clearly see what is good, what is bad, and who is who, while being able to recognize a next-level skill held by pros. In OW it's just... the exact same thing repeated over and over. The minute-to-minute gameplay hardly ever changes or evolves. It's the same thing that drags NASCAR down. Oh, a left turn! Oh, a left turn! Oh, a left turn! Oh, he shot her! Oh, he shot her! Oh, he shot her!

All that leaves are investments into the personalities. Sure, that's good, but it's bad to have that as your only supporting pillar besides the level of marketing.

I just see 0 longevity in OWL if Blizz ever lets up on the funding. It can't support itself in the long-term."

7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-07,"As someone who understands the story, I still think it's overhyped.

7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-05,"I do - been hoping for a patch on PC so I can go ahead and purchase.

Narrative is a very aesthetic concept - so you get a mix of people not understanding and just a general disagreement on what resonated more.

Some of the most tired and overused tropes can be presented in a way that they connect with the viewer/reader/player.

We arent talking about a game with no narrative vs one with a strong narrative - they are both single player games with an emphasis (generally) on story.

From what I've seen of both games - they seem to be really strong in different aspects of the spectrum. I really dont think fanboy-ism has anything to do with the majority of voters (as Horizon is a brand new IP).

I hope I get to play both soon - holding off on buying a ps4 until I know wether or not TLOU 2 is coming this gen or next."

I've actually spent more time on Splatoon 2 than Odyssey and Breath of the Wild combined, and I've spent a *lot* of time on Breath of the Wild and Odyssey, so that really speaks to the fact that I've been pretty hooked on this console. As much impatience as I have for Nintendo's general bullshittery, so many great hits (and so much to look forward to) in a single year is pretty spectacular. When I speak to people about the merits of the Switch they think I'm a paid Nintendo shill or something, which is pretty spectacular."

7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-07,"You said you fully understand it but if so why the questions?




So I think the problem here is that existentialism isn't for you. About the ""belittling"" thing. Yeah, that's what happens in every fandom. They just want you to experience the same feelings but the way they force you into is a bit too harsh. 



Look, i LOVE NieR/Drakengard series and i know that there are people who don't like it and i know why. But i HATE the word ""overhyped"". It's ... subjective. People don't just praise some random game' story for no reason, right?"

7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-15,"I disagree. To me an RPG is a game with a heavy focus on character choice.  Choosing what clothes to wear isn’t really very impactful though. For example in Pillars of Eternity you visual customization is pretty limited, but instead you customize your characters personality and origin in great depth. This shapes all the interactions you have, and the way characterd will treat you. Those are to me more typical RPG elements, this stuff has been streamlined/watered down and slapped on every action game and now they call it an RPG. At the end of the day its not super important, but its just some food for thought."
7ocawp,2018-01-05,2018-01-06,"I don’t see how Nier is revolutionary in terms of storytelling. I’ve played through all 5 major endings, the only times it ever uses interaction as a storytelling device is the very beginning of the game and the very end. Beyond that, it’s world/fiction is very well developed and some of its mechanics and its UI is grounded in that fiction pretty well, but that’s not storytelling nor is it revolutionary. "

* DMC 5 (I expect Microsoft to have Cyberpunk)
* Whatever From Software are doing
* Bluepoint's next project
* Red Dead Redemption 2 exclusive stuff 
* Maybe a hint at Horizon 2
* Resident Evil 2 Remake

Also I'm not sure where Rocksteady show up (I'm leaning toward Microsoft but you never know)
 
Edit: Seeing what we have, I'm saying Rocksteady and Square's Avengers tease at Sony. That's a lot of superhero stuff but I'm not sure what other big teases there are (that we know exist) and something brief of FFVII remake. I would have said Assassin's Creed too as it usually shows up more than once but Ubi to Sony is pretty close depending on how much Ubi show. Kingdom Hearts seems pretty big too, wouldn't be surprised if Sony have some game play exclusive video.

Out of nowhere, Tony Hawk comes onto the stage on his skateboard and reveals skate 4 and a new Tony Hawk's Pro Skater game that isn't complete ass.

Then, sprinting onto the stage like a madman, we see Miyamoto. He's panting and trying to catch his breath

He's holding a piece of paper in his hand

He holds it up for all to see

Here's hoping Sony was just *confirming* those four major titles would be shown, not saying they would be the *only* ones to be shown. According to a lot of sources, they heard the outcry against last year's conference being only about games we knew about, so hopefully we'll have a fair few announcements fired at our waiting eyeholes.

Like Playstation All\-Stars 2 like c'mon Sony that quote leak unquote from late last year was too good "

Death Stranding: ?

Death stranding was super confusing, but you could tell it will look great and will have some sort of platforming/traversing ? section. Some stealth/hiding and combat...Ghost looked amazing visualy and the gameplay (depending on how free/scripted ) it will looked amazing also.

Spiderman looked fucking amazing, we will fight the sinister 6 AND its in the same universe as the avenger game ?!?

And they sneaked in a new ip i think with the ""Control""game that looked great.

Out walks Gabe, and the half-life 3 symbol flashes on to screen, burning bright against the darkness.

The symbol gets jumped by a funko pop headcrab, and the words, ""exclusively on PSN and mobile!"" appear underneath.

Gameplay footage shows all the main characters as funko pops, deployed onto the field, attempting to destroy an enemy base, with all the mechanics and microtransactions of a Clash of Clans rip-off.

The trailer skips ahead to show multiplayer mode, an obvious battle royale mode, featuring large scale battle on a single map of large terrain. Canned, pre-recorded audio can be heard, as your squad congratulates you on that totally awesome kill.

The crowd looks on in horror as the words ""Pre-order today to get 6 steam trading cards and 1 free month of additional challenges, used to unlock a war chest containing a new random skin!"" flash up on screen."

8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,Damn you Sony...they own the rights to Spidey and out of every game to make exclusive it has to be this
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,Vulture’s clearly the tutorial boss. He’s been pretty pathetic all demo.
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,"Wait there's more after this ""short"" break right? RIGHT!?"

8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,Sony exclusives always remind me how annoying exclusives are. I’m legit interested in that Spider-Man game.
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,So the presentation done?
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,Suuuuper psyched at that resident evil trailer!!

8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,That intermission took up way too much time
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,[removed]
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,that's it? I think they could've cut some of the longer demos short and had a few more games people were expecting 
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,I didn’t know rocksteady’s follow up to the Batman games was a Spider-Man game from insomniac 
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,"One hour later...

And I still don't know what the fuck the random things playing instruments were there for..."
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,That was... bad? Am I allowed to say that about anything Sony?
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,"The flow of this conference is not good, have people in a room showing videos and talking heads in a different location?   
"
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,Thank you Sony for just delivering footage and gameplay and cutting out all the awkward speeches.
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,Best gameplay shown at E3 so far 
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,Holy shit this is boring
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,Anyone feel like Sony just didn’t come to play this year? Felt ridiculously under par compared to Bethesda and Microsoft.
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-11,"May be a small crowd but how about some Crash Team Racing & Crash Bash with Multiplayer support!

Also as a VR owner. I don't understand why they don't have more third person platformers, or Mortal Kombat VR! Would love some more VR content. 

Can't wait for Battle Royales to die. "
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,"Well, if you like games with movie-style CGI and dark environments that presentation was definitely for you. "
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,Looks like a slow start folks. Maybe they’ll pull a Bethesda and pull a good conference out of their asses.
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,Well fucking played Sony

8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,What's up with the so and so won comments? I think we all won because we get to enjoy these games.
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,No new Knack? smh
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,"Well it started weird but it got better I guess

I'm sold on KH 3, LSOU2 and Spiderman. I think that anything else caught my attention a little bit aside for Rick n Morty, Destiny and COD. But I would need to see more of those games to see if Im sold on the idea like the other 3.

It was good, but I think MS was better.

8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,So they’ve designed different rooms for each game? God I love sony 
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,Probably going to a “proper” stage now?

8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,Sony is getting a little arrogant now.
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,I would be pretty pissed as an attendee. Having to walk all over the LACC every 10 minutes to find a new seat among a crowd of 1000 people just so they can change stages. L

8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,Roach looks different
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,"Gameplay for both of the games Sony has shown so far. You can shit on them for the intermission and what they're doing on stage, but at least they are showing you the games unlike other companies. "
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,Well as it turns out all it takes for me to buy a game is a flute and a bit of sword combat. Well played Sony. 
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,Ghost of Tsushima gameplay looking better than I thought it would. Fully on board the hype train for this.

Spiderman games have had a habit of being very ""dynasty warriors"" if that makes sense, in taht they'd just throw mobs of enemies to mow down at you to complete stages.

This was more or less a conference for people who wanted to see gameplay. "
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,Kojima really threw in a toenail in the trailer to distract us from the fact that we still have received zero information about this game. I wonder if people will eventually get bored of the mystery of the game if they release yet another movie like trailer or will the hype maintain?
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,"Dude, this format of conference was so bad"
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,"What the hell did I just watch?! 

Church banjo man, then gameplay. 15 minute break with awful commentary. New conference center, white Asian guy playing flute. Probably the most interesting game shown. More bad commentary. Some more games. PlayStation logo comes up on screen, confusion in the crowd. Conference ends abruptly with more bad commentary to follow."

8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,There is no evidence of gameplay yet. For all we know Sony and Kojima could be trolling us and Death Stranding is a CGI movie like the Resident Evil ones.

Fish bowl is actually a Proton Pack.    
Proton Pack is powered by unborn infant?     
Paramount's adaptation of Steven King's ""The Mist"" monsters are everywhere.    
But there is no fog/mist, so this is not a game adaptation of ""The Mist.""     
Norman Reedus is very strong, and can carry a lot of stuff.     
Norman Reedus is a pack mule.     
Norman Reedus is in radio contact with someone.    
Life, death, flesh, and other things.

Dude, she knew at the end of the first game. The reason she even said this:

*""Swear to me. Swear to me that everything you said about the Fireflies was true.""*

was because she knew he was lying. She just wanted to know if he was willing to commit to it. We saw earlier in the game that she has a good bullshit detector. She went along with the lie, saying ""Okay"", because she understood why he was lying. He cared too much about her and didn't want to lose her. She felt the same way about him. "

8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,"I feel like he's probably taken on more of a leading role, instead of going out and actually killing people. I don't think Joel's *that* much older than Ellie, and Ellie looks like 20-30. I'd think Joel is still able to do stuff physically, we might even get a Joel sequence later on, like we did with Ellie in TLoU part 1."

Really loved how the TLOU2 AI was calling each other out by name and seemed to care about each other. God I hope that wasn't just scripted for the demo."
8pxyhv,2018-06-10,2018-06-12,"IIRC, TLoU part 2 takes place 5 years after the first, so Ellie would be 19. In the first game, they said Joel had Sarah young, you can fairly estimate an age of 18-22. When the outbreak started, Sarah was 12, making Joel 30-34. The rest of the game takes place 20 years later. Making him 50-54. Then tack on the five years in between parts one and two, and Joel is 55-59.

My personal bet is that Joel does take a leader role, but gets killed by the people who Ellie said that “[she’d] find and kill every last one of them” in the trailer that was released last year. I think she wasn’t actually talking to Joel, but just imagining his ghost. "

One show i went to he kicked someone out for heckling his opener and even the opening act told MC Chris it wasnt a big deal and not to kick the guy out
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"If I had a dollar for every ""MC Chris is actually kind of a dick"" story I've heard, I would have no paltry sum of dollars.

I went to a show of his in Austin, and during the song Wiid, he actually stopped mid-song (at which point it became apparent he was just lip syncing along with an audio track) and yelled at some people to back up who were smoking.  He then went on a short rant about this is his job and he's a professional and...the whole thing was just pretty disgusting.  Dude is not a fan of his fans, clearly."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,I'm taking a stand by deleting the two songs of his that I pirated. 
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"HOORAY!  I get to tell MY MC Chris is a dick story!  
Back in 2009, MC Chris was playing a show in my hometown on my birthday!  So naturally, I told all my friends THAT was what we were going to be doing!  
Near the beginning of the show, one of my buddies came up to the group and said, ""Check out what I just found on the floor!"" and held up a backstage pass.  ""Dude!"" I said, ""It's my birthday!""  My buddy smiled and handed it over to me.  
There were 2 opening acts and through their sets, I spent my time heading back and forth to the backstage area, chilling with the bands.  I wasn't causing any trouble, I was very polite and I tried not to overstay my welcome because I was acutely aware I was not supposed to be there.  
Late in the second act's set, I finally spied MC off to the side of the stage watching the band.  I mustered up the courage, approached him and said the following, ""Hey, it's my birthday and my buddy got me a backstage pass, and I just wanted to say you rule.""  
To which he responded, ""That's a little creepy dude, wanna back off?""  
I replied, ""Yes."" and left the backstage area, never to go back.  At first I thought it was funny.  I was not supposed to be there, and I gave myself away, so I got chastised.  But after a while, I realized he was just being an absolute dick.  I was a fan.  I was being polite.  I was paying him a compliment.  And he told me to back off.  I was GOING to buy a shirt, but I didn't.  
I found out later that at the next show, in the next town over, someone in the audience had a birthday too.  MC went on a tear on stage, ""What is it with people and their birthdays?  Everyone has one!  Big fucking deal!""  
I want to find a way to relay this story to him on his birthday."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"Wow....

I thought i was the only one who he bullied. 

back in 2004-2005, i went to a show in lawrence kansas. He came on stage in between bands and talked with us. I was so excited to see this guy, being a life long nerd and loving hip hop but not having hiphop and nerd shit mix. I was thrilled to meet the guy. He then started to say ""GO BUY SOME MERCH YOU LITTLE FUCKERS"" everyone laughed. well this is about the second band in, and i didn't see the merch table anywhere....(most bands have it set up as soon as you come in the venue) his wasn't no where to be found...I then yelled ""WHERES IT AT CHRIS!?!"".... and everyone yelled yeah.. he then started off and said ""at the merch table douchebag""...everyone laughed and the whole night called me a douchebag....is this not a form of bullying i thought. 

I didnt let it phase me tho...I finished the show and afterwards went with some friends to the merch booth where chris was signing autographs. Our turn came and his roadie asked us what we wanted. I bought a sticker (i was 18 at the time, scrub..not much money) and my friends bought a shirt and cd's...We paid and we went to Chris to sign our stuff. Ive met loads of musicians and had mostly great experiences but this next thing killed me...

Chris thanked my friends for buying the shirt and signed their cds, my turn came.... ""Hey look its the douchebag that doesnt know what a merch table is...All you bought from me was a sticker...wow..."" he then signed it....douchebag...I was stunned. I hadn't been bullied like this since grade school. had so much rage i wanted to pummel the fucking midget. I took the sticker and threw it in his face. Since that moment i have hated the fuck. 

Crazy story OP, i am glad i seen this today and all the responses. I am glad more and more people have seen how this dude is a fucking bully and is a fake.

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"""did two interviews. broke down crying in the middle of mall. mission accomplished internet. this is the worst I ever felt.""

He's pulling the pity card now, and his fans are falling for it."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"A friend of mine was once kicked out of a show by MC Chris because 'he was too excited'. MC Chris was opening for some big name group(can't remember who, my group of friends went specifically for MC Chris). Basically my friend was the only one dancing and having a good time while everyone else stood around like zombies waiting for the main act and snickering at MC Chris. Needless to say we all left. Later my gf called MC Chris 'fat' outside the venue and he wrote some blog complaining about my hometown and the fact that the green room was out of sweet and low. 

**TL;DR- MC Chris is dead to me**"
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"At the show I went to, he not only relentlessly made fun of some guy with no teeth he then kicked him out for being too drunk (no worse then a bunch of others). He also FORGOT his fucking laptop... you know the one thing he needs to play a show!! 

Instead, we got some weird karaoke done by him, with his songs he downloaded off iTunes, played on his iPhone. 

Plus when SOPA was going down, he tweeted ""am i the only one who hates bandwagons?""

He's an asshole. "

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"MC Chris is a douche nozzle. I went to one of his shows some years ago and got a good spot in the front row. I was wearing a polo shirt and a baseball cap, I didn't really think anything of my attire. Evidently MC Chris did mind my attire, between songs he started going on about rallying the fans to kick the jocks asses,""with their polo shirts and bent brim caps."" I realized this was a shot at me and immedietly felt uncomfortable and left. 

TL;DR
MC Chris was picked on when he was younger, took it out on me."

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"Plus, homie's a nightmare to work with. I, as well as a bunch of my friends over the years have worked with that little diva. And it's so fucking weird, he'll go between moments of what seems like sincerity, where he acts like he's really into being a good dude to people and then outright viciousness. He basically ruined this one dude's life, because the kid wanted to roadie for one of his openers on a tour. Chris thought this kid was trying to infiltrate his life and told the band that if they didn't fire him, he wouldn't let the band tour with him. That kid quit his job to do that roadie gig because it was sure thing. Fucked him over really bad. He's CRAZY paranoid, by the way. Which has fueled a ton of other really surreptitious shit, he's gotten away with. He says he's ""sticking up for people"" who can't help themselves or are too afraid to do anything about it. He's just a bully. He sees an opportunity to rage out on someone in a lower position of power than himself and he takes it. That's what a bully does. He just hates himself so much it spills into everything else. Can't blame him, though. There's not much to like."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"I saw him at Van's Warped Tour about 5 years ago with my then girlfriend.   The girl I was dating was significantly more attractive than me.  She and I went to his booth after the show to shake his hand and maybe buy merch.   We get up to him and my girlfriend says ""My boyfriend and I love your music"" gesturing to me.  He says ""Do you know how fine you are?  Why are you dating this fat fuck? Did your Dad rape you a bunch or something?"" and then moved on to the next person in line.  I stopped listening to his music that very day."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"Either way, I bet MC Chris is pretty pleased with this thread. It's the first time since 2005 many of us have even thought about this guy."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"Sup Kicked out of an MC Chris concert buddy. He kicked me out of a show for the same thing in 2005 or 06 (only I was actually vocal).  I just walked right back into the venue because I'm not going to let some pipsqueak come to my city and ruin my night. Security didn't give a shit that he was upset. In fact I walked up to the doorman and said ""Hey, that guy on stage wants you to kick me out, so I'm going to have a cigarette"" Despite all that, I still waited in line afterwards to meet him and apologize, but not before he kicked my friend to the back of the line because he thought she was skipping, when in fact we were in line together and she just went to grab us some drinks because it was taking so long. Despite ALL of that, we were still friendly (and drunk and huge nerds) so we greeted, chatted and left. When my friend posted something about having been kicked out on MySpace later that night MC Chris posted something telling all his fans to harrass her. Seriously, fuck that egomaniacal dwarf. "
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"I also have a tale of mc chris being a complete dickhead to me. Some time back between 2006-2008, he was repeatedly asking for help (through myspace) with his networking configuration as he couldn't get on XBOX Live. I offered my help and we exchanged some messages. My assistance didn't resolve anything but the point is that I selflessly tried helping the man.

Now over the course of the following months/years he was repeatedly reaching out to his audience for various things ""hook me up with trees"" or ""get me into an amusement park for free"" or ""hey I need a roadie""

I responded to one of his requests for leisure, offering him a way into Universal Studios with the added bonus of some greenery. I wasn't expecting any response, nor did I receive one. Again, offering a guy I admired some help, nothing to gain for myself besides maybe some fun memories.

So he eventually asks his audience about a roadie, and seeing as though I had tour managed in the past and worked for an independent record label prior to that, I thought I'd be a worthy nominee. And boy did I miss touring! I believe he requested this a few times for different tours and I forwarded my resume along for two of those requests.

What I received back the 2nd time was absolute bile/venom. Mr. ""we are nerds, let's rally together and fight back against the bullies that picked on us our whole lives!"" is actually a bully himself. He basically told me that I wasn't his friend, I never would be, etc. etc. and to stop reaching out to him.

It was quite lengthy and the entire thing was just him shitting all over me and my ambitions. I wish I still had the correspondence as I was completely distraught after reading his response. I used to recommend mc chris to anybody that was looking for new music, bought all his releases and some merchandise, etc., but I haven't listened to a single song since and take any opportunity I can to speak out against the bullshit character he pretends to be on stage.

He has an outrageous ego despite his moderate success. This also isn't the first tale of him kicking people out of his shows over nonsense that real touring professionals can brush off and laugh about later behind the scenes.

TLDR: mc chris is an enormous asshole and has no problem stepping on or over people as long as he gets the things he wants in life."

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"MC Chris has always been a terrible canard for the culture he insists he represents.  I gave up on his [good] music a few years ago after a similarly juvenile, although not nearly so individually humiliating, incident at a concert when he threw a hissy fit on stage because not enough people knew the lyrics to a song.  This experience sounds shitty, but I wish I could say that it were particularly surprising."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"This will probably get lost in the comments, but I have a similar story.

 I went to see him in ABQ about 3 years ago with I Fight Dragons and Whole Wheat Bread. When it was Chris's turn, he started doing his thing and all was well. I was in the front with some friends, and next to us were these two girls. Attention whore kind of girls, all they would do was grind on each other and give other people the look as if to say ""Yeah, im totes a lesbo, dont you love watching this?"" Anyway after Chris's first couple of songs, these girls were singing along, as most people do at a concert. Halfway through a song, he stops, and tells the girls to move to the back of the crowd, because they were throwing off his groove due to them singing along. He flat out refused to continue the show until the women were gone. The girls apologized profusely (Most of the rest of us were singing right there with them) and he wasn't having any of it. The crowd started chanting to them to ""Move the fuck back"" So MC Chris could finish his shit, and finally, they did. He made an example of these women so we wouldn't sing along to his raps. 

I should note, this was a small venue, a couple hundred people maybe. We were literally a couple feet away from him, so I guess its understandable, but there's probably a better way to go about it. I forgot his exact words, and I don't want to misquote him, but he said some nasty things about them and how annoying they were.

I think MC Chris's head is a little too big."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,I think its hilarious MC Chris even saw this tweet. He didnt tag his real twitter on the tweet which means he literally searched for his name on twitter. Thats pretty lame if you ask me. 
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"He posted on facebook in response:

""last night I kicked someone out for being a dick to my opener richie branson on twitter. now this guy's got his pals calling me hitler on twitter or twitler as I now call it. they say I don't allow opinions. wrong. I just don't like it when u insult my friends and i don't really want you in the building. I have nothing against opinions. i have something against you insulting my friends. pretty simple. #haternerds""

EDIT: He's been deleting all the negative comments on this post.

EDIT2: ""the worst part about to day is that I'm a redditor that goes to the site every morning. this feels exactly like it did when I was attacked by 4chan. I thought reddit was a nice place""  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.

"
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"This past year when MC Chris was in Denver, he yelled at a girl in the first row for placing her beer on the stage between an opener and his performance and made her lose her place along the front row over it.  He yelled at her through the mic, humiliated her, and would not continue with his show until she and her friend got the fuck out of there.  Sure, she was a knuckle head for placing her beer there but he was totally being a dick.  

She apparently stuck around and got super drunk because near the end of the show she got close to the stage and hurled her beer glass, hitting him in the dick.  He freaked out (understandably) and ended the show early, but then bitched incessantly on facebook about it for at least a month to the point that I dropped him from my newsfeed.  He even lectured on his facebook that fans shouldn't come to his show and drink...pretty hypocritical considering his shows often happen in bars and he constantly raps about how high/fucked up he and his friends are/were.  

Yeah, she was out of control, but get over it at some point and don't blame all of Denver for that.  He could have avoided the whole incident by not making such a big deal about her putting a drink on the edge of the stage.  He could have told security prior to going on stage and had her removed more quietly.  I like his rap but his facebook self comes off as really immature, petty, and bratty.

*edited: removed description ""stupid bitch""  That's not really fair upon reflection.

>So apparently you did this to female fan back in the day

>Something similar happened when we went to see him last October in LA. He had come back out to do his encore and there was this girl dancing right in the front of the stage. Let's just say she was well endowed and having a blast dancing and shouting the lyrics throughout the whole show. Just as he's launching into ""Popcorn Frog"" he stops, looks at this girl and says something along the lines of, ""I'm sorry, but your tits are in my face, you're ugly and it's just too distracting, you need to leave.""
What made it worse, although I commend the girl in doing this, is that she refused to leave and argued with him for a good minute before he got the crowd to push her out of the way so he could continue with his encore.
It must have been terrible for her, because she clearly was digging the show, and to be publicly humiliated like that... I don't think I could deal.

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"I'm a big MC Chris fan. Seen him many times. The last time I saw him he was opening for Piebald. They played at this really little place in Phoenix. He was the opener, but drew easily 4x the crowd Piebald did. When he finished, most people left.

I'm a big Piebald fan so I stuck around. As Piebald was setting up I saw him sitting in the back. I asked how it ended up that he was opening on this tour? If the crowd distribution was common at the other stops they made? And if so how it ended up he was opening but drawing a lot more people.

He basically looked at me blankly and more or less told me to fuck off. I don't remember what he said to me exactly, but it left me with a pretty shitty opinion of the dude. Was just trying to make conversation at a now really empty show."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"I don't know who McChris is, but he sounds like a douche."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"I had James Hetfield call me an asshole right in the middle of a giant concert and everyone looked back at me.  I just laughed.  It was because when they said it was the end of the show, everyone else groaned and pandered to them begging for an encore, but I instead cheered and whooped."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"It's so bad seeing him live, I live in San Luis Obispo and he played at the local brewery a year ago. Worst show ever, the openers were meh, but when he got on I was expecting it to get better. Dude kept doing songs over and over again because nobody was singing along. Some guy yelled something and next thing you know he gets super butthurt and has security reluctantly escort him out. He did this twice, to two different people. Dude's a piece of shit to his fans that he's letting down IMO. "
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"I have no idea who this guy is, looked him up and was shocked to find out he's 36. Now, I'm not going to say you should grow out of gaming culture (far to the contrary). Rather, I would say I'd expect a 36 year old to act with a little more maturity than to throw out a paying customer from a show of his because of a meaningless twit.

Didn't know who MC Chris was before reading this point. Still don't really care to learn anything else about him."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"He kicked Optimus Rhyme off a gig in Seattle because they we're releasing a new album and that's the first time it would be available.  Even though it was just an opener he was jelly because it would be ""cd release"" show, and not his.  He claimed they the opener were stealing his fans. 

There is a kick ass song called ""MC Chipmunk"" by Optimus Rhyme over the incident, one of their best songs they ever made. 

EDIT: can't find the song online but here are the lyrics
EDIT: People posted links to the song on grooveshark, I don't know how I forgot about groveshark. 

We know how you feel about these opening bands, and
assert that they are leeching and stealing your fans, man
that's a loser move, we all need support
MC Chipmunk's coming up short

We met a little rapper that is so damn cute
Has this chubby little cheeks standing three foot two
We call him Chipmunk because his voice is squeaky too
And when he said he smoked weed, dude he lied to you
And he doesn't guzzle Robotussin, he doesn't do much
The stuff he raps about, yaps about
Telling kids to track him down
After the show in the parking lot
Because that's where he says he likes to spark his pot
His fans find out that he just talks a lot
He's like a little puppy dog, likes to bark a lot
And never bite, except for the songs that he writes
In every piece of culture he regards in taking sides
It's amazing, watch him walk out and press play
The Gummi-Bear soundtrack blows the crowd away
But I gotta say, this kid is smarter than he looks
We bought his CD and started singing all his hooks
We played a couple of shows, I guess he got the upper hand
He tricked us into thinking the he was indeed man
He was all smiles, laughing, joking, slapping hands
He said he was a fan as he hopped inside the van

But that's typical for MC Chip
He's a hypocritical little twit
Whose face drips, I don't trust him a bit
He's not fit for this music
First he's not nerdcore but now he tries to use it

Whatever, we had a show set up to play together
but Chipmunk steps up and says he'd never
share the stage with Optimus and promptly kicked us out
He claimed that we left a bad taste in his mouth
What's that all about?
See Chip use us to be heel
Afraid to say this face to face he chooses just to squeal
I'm no you're sensitive Chip, but sorry, listen up
We live in Seattle of course we think the bears suck

We know how you feel about these opening bands
And you think that they're leeching and stealing your fans
Man, that's a loser move dude, we all need support
MC Chipmunk's coming up short

You think about you, anything is awesome
You used the burning man so quickly and often
You could be the king of your level minded court
But MC Chipmunk's coming up short

Hey Chip, I'm sorry that I think you're a dick
Maybe I'm the one who's a prick
Maybe I'm the one who played PAX and then never came back
With my fez too pumped up and big
You this might be a fact, that we're the novelty act
Then I'm the throwaway wrapper with disposable check
I mean, maybe we're the ones who like to overreact
Maybe I'm the comedian pretending to rap
Or maybe not
Let's say we stop before it gets confusing
I'm not the rapper in the big time movie
I'm not the dude in the Post and the Times
I'm just Wheelie Cyberman, you know from Optimus Rhyme
The point is this:
We're nowhere near as big as MC Chip
And MC Chip is nowhere near as big as what he thinks he is
I hope he gets a million hits and figures that he wins
but then it's single player Chip because you don't have any friends

We know how you feel about these opening bands, and
assert that they are leeching and stealing your fans, man
that's a loser move, we all need support
MC Chipmunk's coming up short

Megalomaniac, that's you dude
We never sitting around thinking about you
Don't get me wrong, yes this song is true
I won't let it go, other systems too
Yeah, think about it, gonna rap gonna lose it
Who's this kid with derivative music
Ha Chip, wish you the best
Come to the top with full success
Stab your friends in the back and chest
Get what you need you snot nosed pest

Megalomaniac, that's you dude
We never sitting around thinking about you
Don't get me wrong, yes this song is true
I won't let it go, other systems too

I lost all respect for him, and I won't be listening to any of his work ever again. "

Chris insults this dude's clothes, hair and even the beer he was drinking. After 10 minutes of this, tells dude to GTFO. When the guy refuses, Chris offers anyone in the crowd compensation to ""remove this piece of shit"". When no one accepts, he gets the crowd to berate the man, ending with the guy throwing up the finger and walking out. As he leaves, Chris gets in as many insults as possible, then apologizes for that guy ruining the show. With a question. MC lip synced that entire show, anyways. I was a long time fan til that night. I won't even start about meeting him after the show. Glad to see someone bring some attention to his bullshit."

I've seen him a several time, once in Houston (fat cats I think) and twice in fort worth (thirsty armadillo). May just be me but it seems he's become progressively less friendly and fun at shows. That first show in Houston he was super excited to be there. Later shows he just seemed tired of it.

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"I went to over 15 mc chris shows, to the point where I decided to stop counting. I considered the first time I ever saw him (must have been 16, before I ever even got stoned the first time) to be the best concert I've ever been to. I wrote about him in my high school news paper, and had him sign a copy. I brought easily over 20 people to his shows, and introduced dozens of people to his music. 

The last time I saw him, I was in the front row filming the whole show. At one point, he dumped a bottle of water on my head for ruining his punchline. ""You're going to film my show and ruin my jokes?!"" I believe was the direct quote. I think he was talking about a new X-Men movie and I yelled ""Where's Gambit?"" I was a good sport about it, laughed it off, whatever. The camera was fine so who cares. After the show, he was a complete dick to me and told me to not ever yell anything at his show. I told him how much I used to be a fan, and that he could go fuck himself.

I don't have a single track on my computer anymore, and I learned that he's basically a phony and doesn't write ANY of his material to begin with. So, It's good to see that everyone is on the same boat, that the guy is a total cunt face."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"The thing that still hasn't been considered is /why/ MC chris was on twitter in the first place. I mean, sure he preforms with a laptop so it's completely possible for him to check twitter, but what would possess him to do that at his own show? As someone already mentioned in this thread, he's paranoid. He wasn't defending his opener, he was pre-emptively kicking OP out to avoid having negative feedback tweeted about himself. Anyone still defending him at this point should realize that he was just being a selfish douche as per the norm."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"Lessons Learned: 
#1. Don't fuck with Redditors. 
##2. Don't fuck with your fans or be an asshole.
###3. Don't do the above two at the same time. "
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"Last year I was at a show of his when he was trying to start his set off and not 10 seconds in literally grabbed this kids phone out of his hand (he was in the front row) and threw it over his shoulder and then stopped his show to say ""don't come to my fucking show and text in the front row"" or some shit like that along with more bitching and harassment and then proceeded to make everyone push the kid to the back of the group, and for some fucked up mob mentality reason, they all started booing the kid and shit like he actually did something bad. 

He then tried to restart his set and fucked up a good 2 more times before he could get out his first song without stumbling. Needless to say I felt real bad for the kid and lost a lot of respect for MC Chris that night. I was very disappointed to see him be such a huge tool over something so juvenile. It reminded me of one of my little brothers when they don't get to have ice cream for dinner.

But on the unrelated upside I saw MC Lars for the first time that night and gained so much respect for the guy. If I was rich I would throw money at him and his career. He is extremely talented and overall an incredible person, his song about his friend committing suicide literally made me tear up. If I was a lady I would do him in a heartbeat."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,What kind of egomaniac is monitoring twitter before their show to make sure nothing bad is said about their opener?
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,I expected better from MC Pee Pants
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,MC Chris is like 40 years old. Maybe Richie Branson is his son.
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"MC Chris has always seemed bipolar beyond belief. Every radio interviewer I've ever read followup articles from says he's dull, abrupt, abrasive, and often rude. 

His music was decent at one point, but the man is too far up his own as anymore. 

I didn't want to dislike him, but all I can think now is ""Fuck Him"". He can have opinions and be snarky about things others love, but no one else can snark about his friends? Fuck him. "
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"So that thing with him sounding like his balls haven't dropped isn't an act? He really _is_ a whiny 12-year-old?

You just don't treat people like that, you don't kick a PAYING fan out just because you feel like it. Even worse than that, you DON'T EVER flame that person in public, over Social Media networks. Reading the comments on his Facebook status, I'm disgusted.

I hope this guy sorts himself out and stops acting like such a pathetic child."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"I used to like mc Chris a lot. I listened to  his CDs all the time and I had a chance to see him mc lars mega ran and Adam warrock at slo brewery back in October. I ended up going with a few of my friends and we were having a blast with all the openers, i got to have a pretty awesome conversation with mc lars and warrock. Then mc Chris came on and started being a huge douche right from the get go. He started out playing I want candy 4 times because he didn't think enough people knew the lyrics. then he kicked someone out for not paying attention to him while he talked and continued being a douche the whole time. When he was done a friend of mine along with some other randoms tried to talk to him and he completely blew them off. 

Needless to say I don't support him after seeing him in person

He's a giant douche"

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,I've seen him in Denver a couple times.  My brother is a bouncer at the club he preforms at and he usually kicks someone out every show.  The last one i was at before the show started he spent 20 minutes kicking a girl out for putting her drinks on the stage.  She was drunk and obnoxious but he made such a big deal about it and incited the entire crowd to surge forward and crush us.  It took everything I had to keep my GF and a guy in a wheelchair next to us from getting hurt.   I finally got fed up and fought my way out.

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"I live in Louisiana, and the first show he ever did he smoked weed with a couple of us after the show and talked it was awesome. Then the next show he said the weed smoking was hurting his voice and stopped. Now every time he comes down he doesn't give a fuck and he doesn't wanna chill or talk. He just finishes his set and rolls the fuck out. I will say this. Over the years I have noticed that his give a fuck meter is going out and his shows aren't that fun anymore. I think that the era of MC is coming to a close."

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"The first concert of his I went to he tried to get me to step away from his booth while a girl was buying some merch and getting it signed because he was obviously trying to get into her pants. The girl wanted me to stay by her and told him so. Mostly because it was my girlfriend. He kept trying even after that. The guy is a total dick.

Fuck you in hell, mc chris. You're 15 minutes of fame are up and you're talent has waned so much it's thinner than the premise of an ATHF plot. And your dick."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"I had a little experience with Mc Chris myself at the 2009 Nerdapalooza. The MC was sitting off to the side and my friend was really excited and wanted to get a picture with him. I obliged and helped to take the picture. Being super tired from staying up the night before and partial to MC Frontalot and MC Lars, I wasn't as excited as my friend. I wasn't rude, just not as hyped as he was. So I take the picture and then we begin to walk towards another panel when from behind us Mc Chris yells, ""I love you too!"" to me as I walk away sounding mildly annoyed. I didn't mean any harm from my demeanor but because of his attitude I can't say that I'll be interested in buying his albums anytime soon."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"I've had mixed experiences with the guy.  When he first toured, he booked a gig at a dive bar in my town that holds like 300 people.  I had a good friend of mine actually step in as promoter the second time he came through like 8 months later.  

We booked him into a MUCH larger venue, got the place up to capacity (500-700?), got him video/promo support, did posters, and even aired some 3 different local commercials on basic cable on Adult Swim about 3 weeks out from the show to help promote it... 

I was allowed to do distribution of the DVD I produced of the event, but he didn't want to deal with me or my promoter friend ever again.  Next time he came to town he dealt with someone else who booked him back into that same dive bar.

[I got contacted by his record label booking person about 6 months later to help put a demo reel together](http://youtu.be/3k41vTXFezk), I wasn't given any artistic direction, no media to work with other than 20 or so JPG's from his press section of his website which only show the crowds or him mugging the camera, not him at all performing...  I interspersed it with footage of his performance... Never heard from the record guy again after I submitted the work, never got paid for the 30+ hours I put into producing it.  The intro to it took 14 hours to produce alone (this was back in 2004 when doing After Effects stuff in SD took awhile...)

Later still, like 2007, saw Chris again in concert, I've met him personally like 7 times by this point, enough where DJ John and the merch guy both recognize me on sight... he doesn't recognize me at all when I try to strike up a conversation.

I've never had an experience like OP or several others have had, but he's acting prototypical of a celebrity, just that he's not terribly famous outside of the nerdcore circles..."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,Apologizing after you are getting bad press is not classy. It's saving yo' assy.

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"Another mc chris was a dickhead to me story. After a show in Richmond we got to talking to him and he was signing some of our stuff. I had given my money to my friend so he could buy me a shirt while I waited in the line to meet mc chris himself. Instead of having him sign my shirt I asked him to sign a Boba Fett toy I had had on my computer desk. He looked over and his merchandise table and said something to the effect of ""you want me to sign something when you're not buying anything from me.""

I let it go and we actually got to talking after the show. He kept asking if we had any green. One of my friends did and we all sat down in a circle out behind the club. He sat there and smoked my friend's entire bowl to himself and then laughed at him and said ""thanks for letting me smoke all your weed."" At that point I was ready to go and cut my losses. Very disappointed with how little regard the guy has for his own fans.

I will say DJ John was really cool. I liked talking to him and he seemed genuinely appreciative of us coming out to the show and apologetic that chris smoked all of my friend's stuff."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"mc chris sounds like a fucking douchebag.

I've never heard of him until today, but based on OP's story and all the stories in this thread,I can pretty much conclude he's a huge jackass bully who will never make it into the big leagues. He'll always be known,but he'll never,EVER be a household name if he keeps this bullshit up. It's unprofessional,and disgusting. 

Also I hope mc chris see's this reddit thread. "
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-19,"I posted this in another thread, but it got buried. This dude is a nightmare scumbag. 

Several years ago he posted some memorabilia/toys online for an auction, the proceeds of which he was going to give to charity. A friend of mine was a huge fan and won one of the auctions. They emailed each other for awhile back and forth and hit it off. As they both lived in NYC at the time, they dated briefly until they broke up for a variety of reasons, mostly because he was a dirtbag. The worst story she has of him is how he would constantly bash his fans, and how he would brag to her about all of the money he made off of the auctions he had. He would steal the majority of the money collected from the auctions and give very little to any charities, all the while laughing at how stupid the people were who bid on the items. It didn't last much longer after that."

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-19,"Wow... I bought tickets to one of his shows around '07 and enjoyed it quite a lot; however, we were indeed treated to the ""MC Chris attacks a fan"" sequence as well:

About halfway through his show, he pauses for a bit to get a drink, etc... and 2 or 3 fans who were together shout that they have a gift for him... it's a poster tube sort of thing they're holding, tied with ribbon.  He says that he sees them and asks them to come up to the stage.  They proceed to unroll a painting or litho or some such of custom MC Chris artwork that they made for him.  They hand it to him, he rolls it back up, and throws it over his shoulder like trash.  Not many in the audience laughed.  The fans left the stage and went back to their prior spot... they were frowning, but not much else.  He proceeds to threaten to throw them out if they continued to look at him like that.

I've met him to buy CDs and get them signed at DragonCon, and he was kinda nice, but in a ""I'm not here to actually conversate with fans"" sort of way.  We were the only two people there, no line, and he spoke like he was doing a stand-up routine the whole while.  I've met a few other nerdcore rappers, and they were all *much* nicer, more sincere people."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"I'm a little surprised that anyone whose followed MC Chris' career for any length of time is surprised by this. He's a self-obsessed douchebag. He kicked Optimus Rhyme (the lead vocalist of which now fronts SuperCommuter) out of a gig that was supposed to be in support of their album release like four years ago. They released a wonderful track called Mc Chipmunk: http://lyrics.wikia.com/Optimus_Rhyme:MC_Chipmunk

ORIGINAL STORY: So I got kicked out of the Powerglove & mc chris show at Union Transfer in Philly last night by mc chris himself over a tweet. I wasn't digging his opener, Richie Branson. I felt his lyrics were lame and pandering to us gamers and other assorted nerd fans. I also didn't think his delivery was good and his beats were mostly sampled from others songs and music (from games, anime and whatnot. I didn't like any of it, so I went on Twitter and Tweeted ""Dear nerd rapper opening for Powerglove/mc chris. You're not good enough to pander to me. Better luck next time.""

I walked out to the lobby, grabbed a soda and was sitting there when I heard the crowd went nuts and mc chris started talking, and I heard him ask for my real name. My friend and I looked at eachother confused and heard him ask for it again. I got up, walked back onto the floor and raised my hand. He then pointed at me and yelled, ""Security is going to take you the fuck out now! That's what you get for talking shit on Twitter!""

As you could imagine, my combination of humiliation, shock and disappointment wasn't great. I've been a diehard mc chris fan since about 2004, with plenty of fond memories of listening to Life's a Bitch and I'm Her Pimp and Eating's Not Cheating on repeat while commuting back and forth to college. This situation kinda sullies those memories. I realize my tweet is snarky, but I'm a smartass and I can understand a guy being mad and protective of his opener. However, publicly kicking out a long-time paying fan because they tweeted a negative response about the opener of your show? Are you serious? I realize what I said was petty, but how immature is it to publicly humiliate someone for something tweeted to just my hundred (which are mostly bots) or so followers? Am I not allowed to have a negative opinion? Didn't mc chris just post a video on Youtube not long ago criticizing the Avengers movie for screwing up Hawkeye? Should the producers of the movie publicly embarrassed him and Marvel cut off his comic book description? No, they're bigger than that, and he should be too.

I will say the venue gave me a refund, the tour manager was very apologetic and even Richie Branson himself thanked me thanked me (half-handedly) on Twitter for helping make his show better (I told him I still wasn't a fan, but I wished him luck and told him he does have good taste in video games). But mc chris definitely came off as a dick, throwing away my years of fandom and support over 140 meaningless characters. I don't need pity, but I feel gamers and other fans have a right to know that if they go to an mc chris show, make sure to keep your opinions to yourself. You might find yourself kicked out for not praising him or his crew.

EDIT: If you want to see my tweet itself, here it is: https://twitter.com/AdmiralMikey/status/225389177829728256

EDIT: mc chris has posted a response on his Facebook page: ""last night I kicked someone out for being a dick to my opener richie branson on twitter. now this guy's got his pals calling me hitler on twitter or twitler as I now call it. they say I don't allow opinions. wrong. I just don't like it when u insult my friends and i don't really want you in the building. I have nothing against opinions. i have something against you insulting my friends. pretty simple. #haternerds""

Also, I didn't tell any of my pals to call him anything, they did that on their own. That is real friendship and loyalty. Thank you everyone for you overwhelming response."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"In 2010, MC Chris played a show in Iowa City.  My girlfriend got kicked out because someone passed her a joint and security grabbed her before she could hit it or throw it away.  

After the show, I emailed MC Chris to see if he would send her a signed T-Shirt or some merch, and I would pay for it over the internet.  He asked for her address and I thanked him over and over.

He never sent anything to her.  It was a pretty shitty thing to do, considering he agreed to send her something.  I've always had fun at his shows, but I've never been the person he rips on during his set.  He's always kind of an elitist dick to someone at his show to get cheers and laughs from his mob of fans.

My advice - just keep your head down at an MC Chris show and don't do anything that would upset the guy.  He doesn't come across as super nice, the way he does in the Geek Skits on his albums. 

Sorry OP; sucks that you went through this."

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-19,Right...you can kick out a paying customer because you don't like their opinions. 
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-19,"What a bitch.  I also love(d) mc chris, he was a huge part of my life through my late teens and early twenties.  I was a HUGE fan.  

But he recently had me blocked from liking or commenting anything on his facebook.  I noticed he had some big paragraph post talking shit about people being ""haters"" and ""if you find yourself blocked it's because you suck."" (paraphrasing here...) When I tried to comment on it, I noticed it didn't give me an option...on all of his posts.  I was blocked from commenting.  I've been nothing but a huge fan, being snarky and crude to only the forefront of mc chris haters, and still, I was too much for him.  It's not quite being personally addressed and physically thrown from a venue, but still, it hit me right in the fandom.

He can pretty much fuck himself.

Little bitch..."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,What an asshole. 
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"This will be buried obviously, but I removed MYSELF from an MC Chris show back in 2005 due to his douchery.  My high school band opened for him at a local venue.  The dude is a total asshole who thinks he is fuckin mick jagger or somethin.  Did not say a word the entire time he was there.  Looked annoyed as hell while the opening bands were sound checking.  I wanna say 3 bands opened that night, and he didn't say a word to any of us.  Just sat in the corner the entire time.  Once all the local bands were done playing most people left, because us losers were the ones promoting his show, and we were the only reason more than 10 people showed up in the first place, so other than a few ""big fans"" that drove a long way to see his sorry ass most people left because they had no idea who he was. 

I was pumped to see him honestly, and really excited to say my band opened for him, but after seeing what kinda person he was first hand I got the fuck outta there as soon as he started up.  It was very gratifying watching a pretty packed house empty out when he went on.  "

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"So, let me get this straight, he got mad over something someone said on the internet?


HAHAHA."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,He did the same in atl to a guy who made a pretty funny joke. Then I envied the guy who got kicked out cause MC did a real shitty show. He's a fucking baby.
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,He came to my city once and I posted something on his myspace wall (yes back then) and he messaged me back asking where to get pot. Seems like a dumb thing to be asking around to young kids you don't know that you just met online. I would have been stupid to get it for him too! He obviously isn't too smart.
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"I've jerked off to too many fake nudes of Diana Troy, Seven of Nine, and Xena to stand for people throwing the 'nerd' label on themselves so willy nilly."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"LOL so he checks twitter while doing his show? And gets so offended that he literally calls you out in the middle of the show? Man, that is some petty fucking shit."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"I see the OP deleted the text.  For those who missed it:

>So I got kicked out of the Powerglove & mc chris show at Union Transfer in Philly last night by mc chris himself over a tweet. I wasn't digging his opener, Richie Branson. I felt his lyrics were lame and pandering to us gamers and other assorted nerd fans. I also didn't think his delivery was good and his beats were mostly sampled from others songs and music (from games, anime and whatnot. I didn't like any of it, so I went on Twitter and Tweeted ""Dear nerd rapper opening for Powerglove/mc chris. You're not good enough to pander to me. Better luck next time.""
I walked out to the lobby, grabbed a soda and was sitting there when I heard the crowd went nuts and mc chris started talking, and I heard him ask for my real name. My friend and I looked at eachother confused and heard him ask for it again. I got up, walked back onto the floor and raised my hand. He then pointed at me and yelled, ""Security is going to take you the fuck out now! That's what you get for talking shit on Twitter!""
As you could imagine, my combination of humiliation, shock and disappointment wasn't great. I've been a diehard mc chris fan since about 2004, with plenty of fond memories of listening to Life's a Bitch and I'm Her Pimp and Eating's Not Cheating on repeat while commuting back and forth to college. This situation kinda sullies those memories. I realize my tweet is snarky, but I'm a smartass and I can understand a guy being mad and protective of his opener. However, publicly kicking out a long-time paying fan because they tweeted a negative response about the opener of your show? Are you serious? I realize what I said was petty, but how immature is it to publicly humiliate someone for something tweeted to just my hundred (which are mostly bots) or so followers? Am I not allowed to have a negative opinion? Didn't mc chris just post a video on Youtube not long ago criticizing the Avengers movie for screwing up Hawkeye? Should the producers of the movie publicly embarrassed him and Marvel cut off his comic book description? No, they're bigger than that, and he should be too.
I will say the venue gave me a refund, the tour manager was very apologetic and even Richie Branson himself thanked me thanked me (half-handedly) on Twitter for helping make his show better (I told him I still wasn't a fan, but I wished him luck and told him he does have good taste in video games). But mc chris definitely came off as a dick, throwing away my years of fandom and support over 140 meaningless characters. I don't need pity, but I feel gamers and other fans have a right to know that if they go to an mc chris show, make sure to keep your opinions to yourself. You might find yourself kicked out for not praising him or his crew.

This was at a Denver show. The worst part is, he initially had a legitimate reason for being mad at her. But it's the escalation that's scary. He goes on for ten more minutes bullying this woman, refusing to continue his show until she was kicked out. At one point he gets the crowd to yell at her. My bro and I got tired of recording him and went back to the merch table to hang out with Mega Ran.

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"Hey guys, I AM RICHIE BRANSON :) 

Quick bio: I worked for awhile as an billboard-charting music producer, worked with ppl. like Rick Ross, DMX, Def Jam, Sony, etc. Started rapping a couple of years ago and made a crazy transition into the nerdcore scene with a song that helped bring back toonami to Adult Swim. Now I produce music for nerdcore artists like Mega Ran and make music for Adult Swim. 

This is my first ever tour, but fortunately the crowds have been overwhelmingly supportive. As for last night's incident. I have absolutely no hard feelings against anyone, I had a great show in Philly tonight. My man Mike definitely made it an even greater experience. While he didn't care for my music, at least we agreed that Chrono Trigger is one of the greatest games ever. 

The only thing about your tweet that I took issue with was the ""pandering"" remark. Just because I'm on stage rapping doesn't mean I'm any less of a nerd than you my dude. I'm not trying to ""pander"" to anyone, I make music about what I like...so if anything I'm pandering to MY interests. 

At the end of the day guys, I'm just a guy who likes rapping about my nerdy interests. I'm on tour with two other acts that share the same interests as I do, and I support ANY artist (no matter if I think they're good or not) who gets on that stage and raps about who they truly are instead of the mainstream money cars and clothes bullshit that's tearing hip-hop apart. I'll take sucky cowboy bebop rap any day over the same uninspired commercial hip-hop playing on the radio.

Once again, no hard feelings on my end guys. Thank you Mike, hopefully we get some good Squaresoft games in the near future. I genuinely wish you well man. Maybe try to be a little more positive towards people trying to bring something positive and different in the music world. After all, I could have stayed producing degrading senseless mainstream hip-hop, lol

At the end of the day it's unfortunate that everything went down the way it did. I'm just trying to add some positive insight. 


As for MC Chris, he's been an absolute blast to tour with. Powerglove is great too! 

Thanks guys.

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,I saw him open for Reggie And The Full Effect couple of years ago. Shouted Mc-Pee pants until he said he was on ATHF. Talked like he was ashamed of it. Fuck that bitch but I'll be damned if fettes vette isn't a jam.

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"I also... Have a Tale of MC Chris. I reluctantly went o see him on Tour. in 2009 when he came to the Social in Orlando.  He said something about Andrew W.K. He was saying how cool Andrew WK was and that he was in the works of some pilot that was going to come out on Adult Swim. (Needless to say i haven't heard any of this or seen anything in the past two years) But Someone the crowd shouted ""Andrew W.K sucks!"" and he called security on them as well. It was the lamest thing i ever saw. that show did make me think negatively about him. Finding out he does this often makes me dislike him a lot more. Im sorry he turned out to be a Douche. "

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,http://imgur.com/kABgN He publicly apologized
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"I used to listen to this douche every now and then and thought his stuff was pretty decent. Specific songs stood out. Never loved an entire CD and never really though that he was like.. crazy talented or amazing. My friends all loved the shit out of him and swore up and down he was the best thing ever but i'm sure it was just because they were immature stoners that loved AS and were just standing behind their product. 

After a while i got a minute and while derpin at work decided to go check out his website. Got into the forum... started talking to a few members that seemed cool and settling in to the mcchris homepage being my main hub of internet activity for my daily time wasting. 

Fast forward maybe 6/8 months... possibly more... and i've got 3 or 4 amazing new friends. People i'm genuinely close with and talk to daily and we all went and saw batman at the same time then got on vent and were making our best joker impersonations (mine was the best) and generally just enjoying the shit out of that community ... EXCEPT for Chris. That guy is such a blowhard, self absorbed complete ass hat. I sware to god he considers himself a grammy worthy artists ready to knock any number of talented noteworthy hiphop artists around and it's just fuckin ridiculous. I ended getting banned from the forum for making a joke along the lines of ""Oh man.. i can't wait to rape you so good when we meet up"" to a FRIEND of mine on the forums. This escalated and became the icing on the cake of like 3 months of his harrassing the shit OUT OF HIS FANS for... god... fuck all knows what reason. 

Just a truly stupid midget douche canoe that I happily haven't had to listen to in years since I moved the fuck away from my even douchier ex-roomate. 

P.S. Been to like 2 or 3 of his shows back in the day ...and that behavior is not at all uncommon imo. He would talk shit to people that werent ""getting into it"" enough... jacked a bowl from my homie instead of smoking it with him and was generally just a little diva bitch. 

If you can't tell I do not like him very much. At the very least I scored like 3 hilarious/badarse lifelong friends off his forum. I go back every now and then to test the perma-ban. 

Still goin strong. "

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"About 3 years ago, I saw MC Chris at the Blender Theater in NYC. This girl up front was yelling ""Pizza Butt!"" every now and then. Finally he turned to her and pretty much cursed her out and made her get to the back of the crowd."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"I've been a big supporter of mc chris for years. Met and talked to him at Dragon*Con. Saw him live twice in Birmingham -- a 4-hour round-trip drive from where I used to live -- and was planning on seeing him when he came through Portland. Even defended him when the ICP threatened to send their army after him when he said that Batman Arkham Asylum was fun to play because fighting the Joker's henchmen felt like beating up Juggalos.

And all that time, I have seen the dark side -- the guy that kicks folks out of shows for the lightest of infringements, the rumors of non-payment to his staff, waving the banner for nerdcore with one hand while flipping off other nerdcore artists with the other. Even so, I remained a fan. Those first 4 albums were great. ""mc chris is dead"" and everything after was kinda weak, but there were hidden gems to be found.

But with this fiasco, I... I don't think I'm on board anymore. What happened to the fun-loving mc chris that put out ""Life's a Bitch and I'm Her Pimp""?"

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-19,"I know this will get buried, but here's my MC Chris story.  

I saw him in November 2009 and he kicked out at least 8 people in total before the show was over. One of his excuses is that people were ""waving their arms too much"" and ""jumping up and down too much"". His response to the crowd was exactly as follows, ""look, we're all nerds here. These people haven't left their house in months and they'd probably rather be playing modern warfare 2 right now (the game just came out, que laughter from the crowd). You can't be rough with these delicate people. Please just calm down"". He went on to say ""Who's next? Who's next? I *looooooove* kicking people out of shows so just raise your hand"". Yes, that's right. MC Chris kicked out multiple people for having too much fun at his show. His opening band ""I Fight Dragons"" also kicked out 4 people for telling them that they sucked (honestly, they did. Horribly.) but the next band ""Whole Wheat Bread"" got a better response from the crowd simply because they came there to play and were nice to the crowd. MC Chris was a dick the entire time and at one point said something like ""I don't wanna hear people complaining that I sing over my songs on iTunes"". Yeah, that's what he did. He played his songs complete with vocal tracks from his macbook and just sang over them. I don't really care about that though."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"People get kicked out of shows all the time for stupid shit, front men tend to develop egos. I was at an Islands show and this dude just shouted out the name of one of there songs he wanted to hear, the front man got all pissed off and had security kick him out. It sucks when that shit happens because it doesn't just ruin it for the guy getting kicked out it ruins it for everyone. I'm sorry you had to deal with this first hand. What a bummer. "

Both of the Tim and Eric shows and the ATHF live show ive seen there everything was great. i think MC Chris just needs to get a grip and roll with the punches.

Being the hardcore star wars nerd that I am, I bring along my kickass ForceFX Luke blue lightsaber. We we having a lot of fun with it and got right up on the stage. At one point, he asks me on stage, which was cool, until he took my lightsaber and knighted me with it. Which again, would be cool, except that he said ""you need to get"" taps other shoulder ""a life"". 

Felt kinda douchey and I remember thinking ""Dude, you make a living off a song about star wars. I need to get a life because I brought a lightsaber to your concert?""

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-19,"Never actually saw MC Chris himself... I was at a small national tour he did in 2009, the Adult Swim Tour or something like that. He was on with Whole Wheat Bread, and I Fight Dragons was opening. I was, and definitely still am, heavily into IFD. As soon as they finished their set I rushed over to their merch table to get autographs and bracelets and their cd, when I heard Chris (who had managed to wander over to his merch table) say something about how nobody should ""listen to those hacks"" who ""obviously have never played video games."" Plus he managed to hit on Laura (formerly of I Fight Dragons) NON STOP. All the while, I was having good conversations with the whole of IFD about things like Twitter, and a cover I had done on YouTube. They thanked me for doing things like a cover, and coming out to the show, whereas Chris blasted me personally for ""pandering to a no good band who doesn't know how to make music."" Needless to say, I left before he even got on stage.

TL;DR Chris can't even get along with bands on his tour, and insults fans of said band while said band holds real conversations with fans. Also, Chris is a douchebag."

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-19,"I remember accidentally catching MC Chris at Warped Tour one year. I feel like I was about 15 at the time (I'm 22 now) and was walking by with a group of friends. I stopped for a minute and thought he sounded a hell of a lot like a variety of characters in Aqua Teen Hunger Force so I asked if they'd wait another 5 - 10 minutes until his set was over so I could ask. We wait, he hops off stage, and everyone disperses. No one was chatting with him or asking for pictures and he didn't appear to be in a rush so I assumed it would be a good time to ask. He starts walking away slowly and we attempt to wave him over. He glances and keeps walking. We're standing a few feet away and ask our question a few times. He just keeps ignoring us then gives a very pissed off looking glare and walks off. Sort of as if he was offended we weren't aware of who he was. I Googled it later that night.

It was just strange; You're at a festival with over 100 other bands and offended that a group of 15-year-old girls don't know exactly who you are. I'd assume he'd appreciate those who were unaware of him prior were taking the time to catch his set. I didn't think much of it; It's not a big deal, but it didn't make me assume he was generally a pleasant person."

I was a big fan of Life's a Bitch and Eatings not Cheating. I saw him the first time he toured, and he seemed really cool. I was excited to see pictures of myself on his website. 

About two years ago, when I went to see him a second time, he kicked me out for, i guess, barely touching his shoe. He made me get on stage and go out through the backdoor to the parking lot. Luckily, security thought it was bullshit and let me come back inside as long as I agreed to stay away from the stage. 

After I went back inside I got pretty drunk and waited for it to be over since my friends wanted to stay, as we'd traveled a few hours and all. Very upsetting night.

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-20,"Hi! I'm the girl in the MC Chris video on YouTube - Nrrrd Grrrl and I'm glad to finally know what is going on. I woke up with tons of angry messages on my account and I was confused. Just so you guys know, MC Chris didn't make that video and had nothing to do with it (other than it being his song..). My friends and I made the video for fun and we entered a video contest he was promoting. I don't think he's going to read those messages. I mean, maybe he does - but I doubt it. Just letting you all know because some rage is being directed in the wrong place. "
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"As much as I've enjoyed his shows, there have been times where he comes off as a whiny princess.  I keep hearing stories about his behavior and even witnessed some mild forms of it at the shows I've been to.  "
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,What a prick. How does he think he'll get/keep fans while acting like this?
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"'While Ward is one of the artists most closely associated with the genre of nerdcore hip hop, he has been hesitant to accept the nerdcore label for most of his career, preferring to describe his style as ""mc chris music""'

... he just seems like a pretentious prick."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,Who the fuck is MC Chris?
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"Lost my last little shred of respect for MC Chris after this, what a bum!
"
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"This is the down side of ""fame."" People who perform and earn any level of fame from it really do train their minds to think that if a building has 10,000 people in it, every one of them is supposed to be in love with the performer. It's weird that he was monitoring twitter during a concert (he should be focusing on his performance), and weirder still that he felt empowered to act on it. Megalomania much? "
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,I find it ironic that more people have liked this post than have probably ever been to one of the venues he plays at.
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"My writer for my website was there and wrote about you getting kicked out this morning. Here are his accounts

did two interviews. broke down crying in the middle of mall. mission accomplished internet. this is the worst I ever felt.

more like mc chrocodile tears.  how about reaching out to the fan directly, apologizing and refunding his ticket?"
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-19,"great holy wtf. he fucking cried about it. WTF. i can deal with him being a douche. i can deal with him being a fake, pandering to our crowd because we throw money at him. but crying over internet drama? this is much much worse than him powertripping and/or kicking somebody out of a concert.

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,I'm sorry... what does this have to do with gaming?
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"He's obviously very butthurt over a fucking tweet. Seriously? Hate comes along with popularity, he has to deal with it instead of being butthurt over everything"
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"Never listened to him, now I never will. Alienating fans is a great way to become irrelevant. "
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"I guess I don't understand Twitter.  How did they see this twit?  It doesn't have a @ thing or a # thing.  Was he back stage searching Twitter?  That's odd.

Edit:  Also, I saw MC Chris in Tallahassee about four or five years ago.  There were numerous technical difficulties during the show and he seemed upset the whole evening.  Couldn't blame him for that one, though.  The venue was pretty awful."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"I saw him two years ago in West Chester, PA and he did the same thing at that show. Some of his music's okay, but he's a giant asshole. "
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"Upvoting. This needs to get to the front page.

As someone who enjoys all kinds of concerts, this sounds like a really shitty experience. I am sorry this happened to you."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"That's pretty ridiculous, fucking twitter and fucking world we live in today."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,The guy has always been an ass. I'm sorry that you had to be exposed directly to it to find that out.
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"OPs incident alone is not that bad. After reading all of these comments though, damn. Dude is a serious diva. "
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,MC Chris kind of sucks. 
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"He also threw a bunch of people out during a Knitting Factory, NY show in 2010. From what we could gather all the way from the back, they were just not enthusiastic enough. Once he called tem out they were assholes themselves, though. Insulting him and stuff. What was really bad about it was just that it took very long until they left an he refused to perform with them there.

Plus, he kept talking about saving ""pussy juice"" in a jar for later use and stuff like that. The girls I had dragged along were extremely weirded out. They'd been loving the show so far, STD, MC Lars, YTCracker and then came Chris and repulsed them with his agressive attitude. Really unfortunate."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,I hope that I can still respect MC Lars for many years to come...

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"Listened to one of his songs, i'm actually surprised people like that garbage. The voice just annoyed me."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"He's a dick. I went to a show in Orlando once where a guy said something about Andrew WK sucking. mc Chris wouldn't start the show again until the guy was kicked out.

I remember saying ""Oh wow, I've kind of always wanted to do that. How was it."" I'll never forget his underwhelmed expression. He was almost confused as he said to me, ""It was OK. He was kind of a dick."" I've always wondered what exactly happened. I guess it was something along the lines of this..."

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"I remember when he played at PAX in...2005 I wanna say?  He went way over his time and barely performed for most of it, he spent most of his time talking.  His delaying meant that the last performers didn't get to play very much.  The guy was a gigantic cock."

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,I would pay good money to see him get destroyed by a legit MC
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,Chris is a huge baby that cries about everything because he looks like a hobbit and suffers from girls loving his music but then being repulsed by him visually.  Long story short he's the kind of person that abuses any shred of power he may have because of self esteem issues. Worst dude I've ever met.
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"MC Chris is a dick, hope this helps.  I guess you could have used this information yesterday though."

@AdmiralMikey dude I fucked up. there's no other way to say it. I'm sorry and I felt this way last night. I hate kicking people out and I hope you take my apology sincerely. I deserve what I'm getting today and I will adjust my hyper critical attitude I'm sorry

and

tough day to be my fan or richie branson. sorry I don't shut up more often. I thought I was doing the right thing and standing up for my friends but I was wrong to handle it like I did. again sorry for all the negativity that happened today because of what I did.


the power of reddit..."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"Reading over these comments, he apparently makes it a point to kick people out of his shows.  Probably because it riles up the crowd, gets them on his side, etc.  

I've seen a comedian do it (it was a shill he kicked out), but never for a show where the people paid to specifically see the act in question.

This does explain why he would be scrutinizing the twitter feed about him and his opening act so closely, though.  Looking for someone to step out of line."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,Lol he posted on his Facebook that he was crying about it.. Mc Chris is a real tough guy huh? 
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,No one should listen to his music or support him ever again. Let his douchiness ruin his career!
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,fuck this guy. he sucks first of all. and what a douche! you can't kick people out of shows for a fucking tweet! 
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"In all honesty, MC Chris is quite possibly the ugliest man on the planet.  Most people compensate by developing a superior personality.  I wonder what went wrong in his case."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"I love his music- I do. But I hear so many horror stories about how much of a complete douche he is. He's constantly kicking people out of shows. He sees people drunk and rages on them because like someone in his family was an alcoholic. I think he was a nerd for a long time, and was bullied... but when he gets ""the power"" he doesn't learn from it and just does the bullying himself. "
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,So a self-admitted smart-ass gets his feelings hurt as a result of being a smart-ass? You're the most boring kind of person.
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"That's what you get for being an MC Chris fan.  I find his voice grating, his lyrics trite and shallow and his attitude toward his fans absolutely abhorrent.  I have no idea how he got to be so popular.  I divide independent musicians among two distinct groups: The cool ones and the Douchebags.  I'll give you an example:

I live in Orlando and am a fan of Nerdcore music.  Therefore, I (used to) go to the annual nerdcore event in Orlando, Nerdapalooza, (Last year was my last year attending, and Nerdapalooza won't get another dime of my money, but that's a separate rant.)  

Most of the artists come for the whole event, hang around in the common areas, chat up the people there and generally act like human beings who just so happen to have an act on stage at some point and thousands of fans.  Really cool people.

Some artists are ""way too cool/important/popular/douchebag"" to do this, only showing up for their set and leave soon, if not immediately, after.  One year, MC Chris was a headlining artist, and did exactly this.  Showed up immediately before (or a little late) for his set, did his thing, and left immediately.  He was an asshat to the organizers and volunteers, and a dick to the audience.

So no thanks, I'll save my money for people who have common decency."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"""MC CHRIS IS A TOTAL DICK"" stories is now a meme."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-19,"You say your friends calling him up and blasting him on twitter is ""real friendship and loyalty"". Are you saying what mc chris did wasn't?"
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-19,freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom of consequences as a result of that speech 
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-19,So I guess he's personality matches his music...pure shit.

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-19,"I hate artists like this, but on a good note:

Went to a Kid Liberty show when I was in college and I was looking at their t-shirts after their set as I was leaving. I was walking out the door when the singer said ""no shirt tonight dude??"". All I had was 3 dollars and they were 15. I said ""man I wish, I only have 3$"", and he said ""well you're in luck, all our shirts are 3$ tonight"". Not my favorite band, but lots of respect after that."

It was pretty awesome, but then after his set me and my buddy go by some t-shirts and get in line to see him. I ask him to sign my shirt and he says no. Not sure if is joking or not, so I ask him again, and he says something about not wanting to ruin a perfectly good shirt. So I wander off in amazement.

My friend is next in line, bought the same shirt, asks him to sign it, and MC Chris signs it no problem. 

Later I was able to get MSI to sign a $20 bill. I ended up spending it."

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"My experience with douchebad mc chris: I am LONG TIME fan of mc chris. I've been listening to his stuff since I was 14 (I'm now 23.) Last October I went to an mc chris show in Baton Rouge and entered in his costume contest dressed as Harley Quinn and I won. After the show, I talked with him and he took a picture of me. Later that morning (we didn't end up leaving the venue until like 1 am) he posted the picture and, as expected, it recived some negative comments because I am not a size 2. Well, instead of defending me or cosplayers in general he just deleted the picutre. Afterwards, I asked him a few times via facebook if he could just put the picture back up because I didn't care what other people thought and I felt my victory in the contest was being ruined by stupid idiots. Instead of talking or listening to me he completely blocked me from his page. I cried for three days. It wasn't the negative comments from idiotic people that hurt me, it was the fact that mc chris himself, who I have loved for YEARS, would just completely block me because of what other people though of my size. I had seen videos in the past of him kicking out hecklers (one show he threw a guy out for saying that Schaffer the Darklord has no soul) and kind of has a history of tossing people from shows. Sorry this happened to you dude but when I saw it on fb I wasn't surprised in the least. The really sad part is that I'm going back to see him on the 30th. Even though I think he does some seriously douche bag shit, I still love his music. He's only human and no one's perfect. I still had a great time at the show and I don't want his assholery to ruin a good time. I think mc is really regretting what he did, but probably won't admit it. All in all it's a pretty situation. mc was totally in the wrong and I'm sorry you got banhammered. "

That said, it's apparent that /r/gaming has no idea how to go to shows, though, since you shouldn't spend your time on your fucking phone at a show (let alone on a social network), complaining about the show you went to see. The [opening act](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHkNH9SXG1s) almost always has it bad, and you most likely didn't go there to see them, so respect them regardless.

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"This has completely changed my view on the guy. I will have to find a way to keep NOT listening to his crappy music. 

Dudes got some funny songs, but, musically he sucks ass. His beats and music are just terrible. "
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-19,"This does show how lame Nerdcore is.  Think about it:

Axl Rose kicks guys ass for recording concert.
Dave Grohl kicks guy out for fighting with people.
MC Chris kicks out someone because they said something negative about a friend on Twitter."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"I'm a pretty big fan of Richie B, because his flow is pretty good and he managed do make an entire Gundam EP without getting stale. What Chris did to you was pretty messed up, but I do understand where he's coming from. He wasn't feeling well at Pearl Street a few days ago, so maybe that was part of it. I'm not saying what he did was right, but maybe there was more going on. Richie just started his first tour, so maybe Chris was trying to make a statement about haters, while ensuring that Richie could stay through the whole thing. Obviously, I don't know any of them very well, so Chris could have just felt like being a dick.

Just my two cents."

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"Don't expect ""rappers"" that make music like children, to not react like a child when prodded. This isn't the first time hes done something like this, every comedian flips out about hecklers but its a concert not a comedy show. He should really just understand that not everyone is gonna like some random shitty wanting to a be nerdcore rapper who is also an opener.

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"I used to like a music, but he's never been a good person at all.  There is a reason so many nerdcore rappers hate him.  He hated the nerd scene until he found out he could make money from it, and now he's all about it.  He does everything in his power to pander to the nerd crowd at this point.  If I go to a show that he's playing at, i'll generally just leave before he gets on stage, it's a shame paying for his concerts is the only way to see many of my favorite bands live."

MC Chris seemed really on edge during the performance...like he was having a hard time keeping his shit together.

Performers are people too. They have their breaking points. They struggle. But, a performer should also be able to withstand a high level of bullshit. If they can't roll with the punches, it might be time for a break."

Night wasn't a total loss, got drunk and hung out with one of his openers ""I fight Dragons"" they were pretty cool..they all signed their most recent album and gave it to me for free. "

When he was on stage he started making fun of some guy that wanted something signed before the show.  He also made fun of some guy in the front row for cheering too much.  Overall he just seemed pissed off, maybe because it was a smaller venue and not a big showing of fans, but he took it out on the crowd.

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"I like how he defends his tweet about being a dick. It's this simple, you have an opinion rather than being at the show you decided to be a music critic and tweet about it. Not only that you sound like a complete condescending douche in that tweet so MC Chris took issue with it. GOD FORBID HE DISAGREES WITH YOU! 

Remember these aren't beings from another dimension, they are humans like you who have feelings and emotions just like you. Just because you have a shitty opinion doesn't mean it should go unchallenged and without possible repercussions. He isn't there to HAVE to see your tweets about how you think his friend isn't good enough for you. it's shitty he tossed you out but he's sticking up for his buddy.. I find it surprisingly how you think that's odd.

He shouldn't have kicked you out, nor should he have had the power to. I feel like at clubs, security's job is to protect the performer and keep the peace. In this case, then, mc Chris was taking the words a bit too seriously. I don't know what my point is, but I feel like social media, on one hand, has a tendency to be taken too literally, and on the other, should be taken more seriously, as it is a public statement of feelings ( much like a press conference or public statement, with the twitter followers being the media )"

As a musician (I know, not another one) myself, I'm sure Richie took those comments to heart and used it to evolve as a musician and better diversify himself from the nerdcore gerne. Criticism is extremely important, especially the negative kind. Why do you think rappers use haters in subject of their lyrics so often? Chris will obviously see this is an issue in a little bit."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"Hahaha. There's some kind of flame war all over this guy's fb page. It seems his fans are such die-hards that they really don't care what the douche bag does/ doesn't do. 

I wonder what he'll say in response to all this? He'll probably take it like he's being unjustly persecuted for his art or some bullshit. He'll nail himself to his personal cross and hope that this riled publicity actually get's him somewhere in the public eye. 

In any case, this nerdcore thing is starting to sound like that insane clown posse culture, cult/weirdness. I guess being a nerd does have the affiliation with being obsessive."

Between his songs he suddenly says ""Look at those cool people on that hill drinking beer! Everybody turn around and give them the finger! Yeah, FUCK you guys!"" 

We all smiled and laughed about it, and told people ""hey MC Chris talked about us! We're famous!"" but after seeing all of these comments I'm kind of wondering if he wasn't joking, and he ACTUALLY hated us for sitting on this random hill drinking a beer."

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,I've heard a lot of negative things about Mc Chris's attitude online. I heard he was going to stop all that and handle things differently....I guess not. I hope all this internet stir will cause him to change for the better.

you like an artist that makes songs called ""life's a bitch and i'm her pimp"" & ""eatings not cheating"" and you think are right.

He's touring with these people, if the opener is getting shit from snarky mc chris fans it will start to wear on the opener. He'll start to resent mc chris fans for it and eventually mc chris himself. Have you ever been forced to spend months with someone you don't like? It's horrible, and that kind of vibe just poisons everything. It's hard to keep things together in a traveling act and the relationship between acts has to be respectful and friendly. While being a douche and kick someone out isn't the way to deal with the issue, I can understand the merit behind what he did.
To those who are mad that he checked his twitter during the show, he sees the same show every night, he's not going to be sitting there totally engrossed by the same act he saw the night before. He probably just sits down finds something to do and does breathing exercises. "

* Guy get kicked out of a concert because of a tweet

* My friend get myself and another friend in trouble by posting twitter status'

* The rest of the high school thinking someone had died on our senior trip because of the poster being vague about the situation

--------------------------------------------------------------
Well I just heard of this dude from reddit. This ""MC Chris"" character.

What I hear is that he's originally an asshole, who prides himself in supporting ""nerds"",""geeks"",and ""gamers"".
Personally, I have no problem with this motive. But you Chris, you are a a real fucking ass hole.

Now- there are a ton of horror stories about you. A ton, a lot including you not paying your staff and just the bull shit things you do at concerts. But what gets me the most is just YOU in particular. You post this status on FaceBook
""did two interviews. broke down crying in the middle of mall. mission accomplished internet. this is the worst I ever felt.""

Trying to play the pity card. What the fuck? Are you some kind of three year old? Who the hell pities someone who honestly is the devil himself? You're fucking thirty six, who cries about hate? Are you sure you want to be considered an ""MC""? I'll be totally rude, you're a pathetic excuse for a living being.

Do you feel like you're a real ""nerd"" or anything? You're the bully in every situation, you're the reason why I pride myself in a loner. You were probably that annoying kid who complained whenever you didn't get what you wanted. You like to say you play games, and all that stereotypical nerd stuff but that isn't what a REAL nerd is. Hell, a real nerd is someone who has intellect and understands coding,C++,and just basic computer hardware. You just act like a gamer, when you know nothing about games, and so on.

You try and pull this persona that seems like ""Yea I was bullied, I'm here to support people"" when in all reality that's bull shit. You're greedy for money, and your songs are trash. I won't say you're not talented, but honestly, you aren't shit with that annoying ass high pitched voice I just heard on YouTube. Sure it could be catchy, but if that's all you got then you're pathetic.

I hope you know you're a joke, and your fans are a joke too. They have no real opinions, they're probably just hipsters who bandwagon on everything you say because it seems ""original"". Hell they ride your dick, and I hope you know it. We can be assholes, but you know we can. This is the internet. You're pretty fond of it, so you know we aren't harsh. Not yet.

This originated from a comment about Richie Branson, who I honestly don't have a problem with- and seems that the person insulting Richie Branson is at much of fault here. But you MC Chris, you are the real issue here.

This whole thing on reddit? It's about you. We might be harsh, but even you know that you've played this role too.

You can't except negative opinions about yourself, just good ones because you're still a kid. You could call me a ""hater"", but no.
I am that loner kid that sees and understands what's going on. I know who's at fault here, and why this has occured.

A sorry won't make up for all the bull shit things you do to people just because you feel like you've made it now as an ""MC"".

You will never be legendary in my book, you will never even be considered a good person in my book. You are just a fraud.

You should realize that from now on, you will always have these people who don't like you. I will be one of them.

Your actions don't make a right. You infact make a lot of bad decisions and then blame it on others. You can't except anything yourself.

From that dude who originally wanted to kill himself over people like you, Simon.

The internet is a scary place people, and you know nothing about it.

I had never heard of him then and never really cared for the sound of his voice but whatever, to each their own. Just don't be a shithead to fans, that's awful."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,This is not music.
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"How ironic that I've never heard of this guy, now the same story about him is all over my Front Page cross posted to all these subreddits?  What the fuck is Reddit becoming, free advertising space?  "

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,WTF is a McChris? I don't go to McDonalds too often so I don't know what the menu looks like nowadays. 
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"Oh god I'm so glad I unfollowed him a while ago for his constant whining. What a fucking tool. 

E: just realized this makes me sound like ""I hated mc Chris before it was cool"" but that wasn't really my intent. Just... I fuck that guy. "
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,He's just apologizing to try and prevent any more negative publicity. His Facebook response shows his true opinion on the matter.
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"I dunno how I feel about Reddit becoming this guy personal army.  
Isn't that a LITTLE fucked up ? "
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"This will probably get buried, but...

I've never heard of this MC Chris guy, and just checked him out.

The *FUCK* is wrong with this dudes voice? It's like a 12 year old boy trapped in a 30-something man's body"
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"something kinda similar happened to me once. went to a tiger army show in Portland, OR a few years ago. me and some friend came up from Eugene to check out the show.

during one of their breaks, Nick 13 asked if anyone was from eugene. a couple people started cheering. then he went on about how disgusting eugene is and how much he hated it. after wich i yelled ""FUCK YOU"" flipped him off (likely had no idea i did either of these things), then left the venue. what kind of person completely shits on their fans right in front of them?..."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"I'm confused..  Why has nobody simply beat the shit out of MC pee pants and then explained to him that they did it because he's a dick that makes the entire genre of hip hop look bad?  
"
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"Maybe it is just me, I just feel that if you are prepared to share your thoughts about something in a negative way, then you should be prepared to hear the feedback in an equally negative way. It seems that a lot of people get very bold with their communication since it is ""anonymous"". I guess it boils down to: would you have said that face to face with the other person? If so how would you expect them to react? "
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"his apology over twitter looks so fake, quite clear he was seeing all the negative stuff written about him/what he did here and realised this could affect his career. which it should, clearly a twat."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"the least professional artist ever- im appalled by the lack of sincerity in his apology. see, now hes riled up reddit and hes going to see waning interest in his already dying fan base.
using my statistical imagination, i wouldve let him slide for this one incident if it was isolated. turns out hes actually done this a number of times over the years."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"If he was really sorry he would have apologized before the shitstorm.  Now that he saw it might actually hurt him in the pocket he's in damage control.
My question, if this hadn't gone viral would he still be sorry?"

There was ""nerd girl"" as he called her sitting on someones shoulders and he politely asked her to get down... Should I even mention this? it's not overly negative. I had a a lot of fun at his concert. "

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"Obviously a little late to the party. But all though he handled this terribly, mc Chris has been great the 3 times I've seen him. He has only been ""rude"" to a very drunk lady and made her go to the back of the venue. Was quite entertaining to be honest. Had my gf on stage at his last tour for the whole dress up thing. Handled that very well. I've met him 2 of the 3 times I've seen him. Always straight to his merch table after his show. Always expects the crowd to be respectful to others. Some people would get rowdy during WWB, and if moshing etc. carried into his set he wasn't having it. His show is very relaxed and a great time. I've had a blast every time I've seen him, and while he did handle this very badly, I will be seeing him soon. "
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"I'm always up for new music and always trying to check out new artists that I hear about. I've never heard of MC Chris; if this was a thread that talked about how nice he was to his fans, or a great example of him being humble, I would have gladly checked him out. However, after the opening story and the number of comments confirming his faggotry - fuck you MC Chris. You don't even deserve to waste my internet time."

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"Not a bash story, but an observation. I saw one of his shows in Albany, NY. It was a good show and I got a picture with him and my friend but what struck me odd was when he started to smell weed. He stopped singing and told ""whoever it is"" to put it out or get out. I mean, yeah, I get that, it's illegal, but for an ent I thought he'd just let it slide and let the bar staff handle that shit."

And so when he came to Frankie's up in Toledo, OH, a bunch of friends of mine were all excited.  A couple of them worked at the bar, and were thrilled to get to meet him.  Apparently he was a super huge douche to every employee, treating them like indentured servants who should be kissing his feet just for being lucky enough to make eye contact with him.  He wouldn't talk to anyone except to bark orders.  

The biggest dick move they still talk about to this day was that he pulled a Tony Clifton; he threw a huge fit about the venue being STRICTLY nonsmoking (Toledo, OH has one of the highest percentages of smokers I've ever seen, and you can smoke in bars/clubs).  This pissed a ton of people off, but they did it anyway.  And what did he do?   He snuck out back for a cigarette between every set.  "

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,#I wonder if he meant it or just said it to get the heat off his ass.
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"I love reading all of these stories because the one consistent thing other than him kicking someone out of every show and generally being a raging sociopath is that he has apparently obsessively searched the internet after his shows for any criticism on just about every major social media site for the past decade. Myspace, Facebook, Twitter... Now we just need a representative for Xanga and Tumblr to step forward.

This guy is the worst and I didn't even know who he was until reading this thread. I've never seen a thread with so much corroborating evidence of unfettered douchebaggery."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,Had to look this MC Chris up. Listened to a couple songs. Thought he was a chick.
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"Wow, just wow.  Celebs, or anyone in the public spotlight should be well aware that not everyone is going to like them or the acts they choose to be with them.  In that case they should ignore it, responding just makes the issue explode."

saw him open for piebald. 10 second intros for songs, then gave up. worst show ever. walked out. fuck you, mc chris.

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"Regardless of the performer's personality, I think the ban's justified, considering it was apparently not an emergency and (as others here mention) he played a show that very date elsewhere. That kind of switch-out is unprofessional, and the organizers would be risking another round of disappointment and inconvenience if they signed him again. "

In what universe is it up to the performer to throw people out? There's security for that to decide. In all the concerts I've been at, people have only been thrown out for either being too drunk or aggressive.

mc chris sounds like a bully. Probably making up for a shitty childhood."

I love his music.  I honestly wish I had never started following the guy because his personality completely ruined it for me.

It was a very small venue and I said, ""yeah why not"".  They danced for 2 minutes tops. Dude stops the show. Calls them out and makes them feel like complete shit.  He says something along the lines of ""Fuck you fake bitches, I like em fat"".  Then brings up some larger girl from the crowd and makes her dance. The better looking girls (there to have a good time) were mortified to say the least.  "

EDIT: Since so many asked; MC Chris collaborated with Lars for a song on The Graduate album. It's a good song, and I dunno the details, but Chris sued, or threatened to sue, Lars over the song, basically to shake him down for money. He mentioned it in another song, Where Ya Been Lars from This Gigantic Robot Kills, but I can't seem to find an article anywhere with the details. From what I understand, it was just a friendly collaboration, no rights or monies agreed on, and when Lars got big, Chris wanted $3k from him."

I've been to a show where something similar happened to one of my all-time favorite artists, [Devin Davis](http://www.myspace.com/devindavis). Drove three hours to the show, and when we got there, the venue was locked up and nobody was around.  We're sitting on a bench outside, wondering if it's been canceled or something, when a van pulls up, a dude gets out, and holy crap, it's Mr. Davis! We ended up chatting for half an hour until the other bands arrived and the venue opened up. I tell him that my girlfriend drove us three hours just to see him since it's my birthday and I'm a huge fan

Long story short, when he opened, there were three other people in ""crowd"", for a grand total of five. After a couple of songs, he thanks me for coming out and says they're gonna play their full set anyway, and as best as they can, since I came so far to see them on my birthday. Eventually more people turn up, and he wraps up to crowd of sixty or so people. After the show I confess that I pirated his music, but want to remedy the situation by buying his album in person. He wouldn't take my money and insisted I have his album and some other merch for free.

Most performance artists are great people. This MC Chris fellow seems to be the exception that proves the rule."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"I was at a different Piebald show in Philly where MC Chris opened.  It happened to coincide closely with the release of the ATHF movie.  After his set, this asshole tells all the fans to go to this local movie theater to watch the movie together.

Almost the whole crowd left and Piebald had to play for like 20 people.  Now Piebald is just an awesome band, and they decided to throw out their set list and basically let the remaining people pick what we wanted to hear in a private show.  We talked to them and had a blast and it ended up being one of the best concerts I've gone to.  Regardless, MC Chris was still a huge dick to his fellow musicians (and his set was pretty lackluster)."

MC Chris was an ass for how he handled that situation. Not only that, I feel it was disrespectful of YOU because he stepped in in the middle of your set to cause a scene and kick this guy out. I feel how to handle this should have been your call, not his. And if you blasted this guy back on Twitter or called him out in public, that would have actually been fine, because this was directed at you, not MC Chris. He stepped in when he wasn't warranted and acted like a childish asshole. Totally uncool.

But yeah, I've no issue with your stuff-- but MC Chris is no longer even on my list of people to consider listening to or seeing live. I've heard too many incidents of him being a jerk to fans, and I'm just not interested in it.

From ""Where Ya Been Lars."" <3 MC Lars"
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"Once, in a bustling town, resided a lively and inquisitive boy, known for his zest, his curiosity, and his unique gift of knitting the townsfolk into a single tapestry of shared stories and laughter. A lively being, resembling a squirrel, was gifted to the boy by an enigmatic stranger. This creature, named Whiskers, was brimming with life, an embodiment of the spirit of the townsfolk, their tales, their wisdom, and their shared laughter.

However, an unexpected encounter with a flamboyantly blue hound named Azure, a plaything of a cunning, opulent merchant, set them on an unanticipated path. The hound, a spectacle to behold, was the product of a mysterious alchemical process, a design for the merchant's profit and amusement.

On returning from their encounter, the boy noticed a transformation in Whiskers. His fur, like Azure's, was now a startling indigo, and his vivacious energy seemed misdirected, drawn into putting up a show, detached from his intrinsic playful spirit. Unknowingly, the boy found himself playing the role of a puppeteer, his strings tugged by unseen hands. Whiskers had become a spectacle for the townsfolk, and in doing so, the essence of the town, their shared stories, and collective wisdom began to wither.

Recognizing this grim change, the townsfolk watched as their unity and shared knowledge got overshadowed by the spectacle of the transformed Whiskers. The boy, once their symbol of unity, was unknowingly becoming a merchant himself, trading Whiskers' spirit for a hollow spectacle.

The transformation took a toll on Whiskers, leading him to a point of deep disillusionment. His once playful spirit was dulled, his energy drained, and his essence, a reflection of the town, was tarnished. In an act of desolation and silent protest, Whiskers chose to leave. His departure echoed through the town like a mournful wind, an indictment of what they had allowed themselves to become.

The boy, left alone, began to play with the merchants, seduced by their cunning words and shiny trinkets. He was drawn into their world, their games, slowly losing his vibrancy, his sense of self. Over time, the boy who once symbolized unity and shared knowledge was reduced to a mere puppet, a plaything in the hands of the merchants.

Eventually, the merchants, having extracted all they could from him, discarded the boy, leaving him a hollow husk, a ghost of his former self. The boy was left a mere shadow, a reminder of what once was - a symbol of unity, camaraderie, shared wisdom, and laughter, now withered and lost."

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"I went to a Everclear show at Irving Plaza a few years ago, this was after Art broke up the band and started a new one.  My girlfriend, now wife, got me tickets.  It was a great show, huge mosh pit, some guy tore another guys shirt off and started beating each other, Art just kept playing like it was just another night.  After the show she bought me a shirt, we were just poor grad students at the time so it was a pretty big purchase.  Art signed it and then got the rest of the band to sign it too.  Then he insisted we take a picture together to commemorate the event, even though there were still like 40 people behind me waiting to get stuff signed.  Artists who love their fans go out of their way for them, not shit on them on stage.

Oh a funny story I saw They Might be Giants at Irving a few weeks later and another mosh pit formed.  John Linnell looked appalled after a 6'5"" guy pushed down another guy so his girlfriend could get to the front of the stage and then a huge fight broke out.  After security pulled them away he said, ""This doesn't happen in Brooklyn.""  It was pretty hilarious.  "

If he hates kicking people out so much, why does he seem to do it so often? [iamactuallyalion reports](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/wrm3v/so_i_was_kicked_out_of_mc_chriss_concert_last/c5fvlpy) that the dude has done it at nearly every mc chris concert he's been to.

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,Same. There's three acts he's toured with that I ended up being friends with after the tours were over. Each one of them weren't very positive about the dude. They mostly didn't like how he'd obviously ignore them in their attempts to be friendly. He would just retreat back to his shitty little van and smoke. I got showed pictures all the time of his openers all having one big picture together to celebrate the tour and he'd be absent from all of them. He's invented this philosophy that you have to be intangible for people to want you. He talks about it all the time. Maintaining a distance from everyone makes you mysterious apparently and that translates to attraction. It's a whole spiel of his.
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,I only knew of one person this happened to. Him being conveniently absent when it was time to pay them.

Who has any right to question why someone dates another person? I'm just so astounded by that kind of thinking, that certain people are *supposed* to date other certain people. Seriously, I'm having trouble wrapping my head around that. You can date anyone you want, and it's none of anyone else's business who, and why you date that person.

And randomly insulting the guy, for no reason? And asking one of his fans if her dad raped her because of the person she was dating? Are you fucking kidding me? Get a grip on life you cretin."

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"True. There were these three kids who had followed his tour from Ohio, through PA, through MD, through VA, and into NC. One of the kids had requested the same song at each show and it never got played. That night in NC he ended up drinking (I know, bad sign) and he started shouting the song prematurely while chris was doing his little standup bits between songs. So chris kicked him out. "

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-19,"As reddit loves Liam Neeson, I can personally say he is not only a down-to-earth guy, but willing to go out of his way for even non-fans. I met him before I even knew who he was on the set of K19 - The Widowmaker. I was disappointed with Harrison Ford, and Liam Neeson fucking blew me away with his kindness. And it wasn't ""Oh, hows it going kiddo"". It was ""Hey, your hero just blew you off. Let's take a tour of the sub while I ignore your parents and make you feel better"".

They're far from tales of douchebaggery and such, don't worry.

Also, they pulled a little kid onstage before during a show I went to. It was one of those moments where you realized how awesome people can be. Edit: [Here's a vid if you want](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PredixK510)"

It's wack. Someone you thought was like you. Someone who was different and was doing cool shit, that you wanted to be a part of. He ""reached out"" to his fans and it made him seem approachable and cool. Guess not. Just another b list celebrity diva with a complex.

Fucking aye man. "
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,I could be wrong here (and still agree the guy was being a total shitbag) but does this sound like classic signs of a possible bi-polar disorder?
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"It's the voice, right? I can't be the only one that hates that fucking voice."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,This shit sounds like it was made by a sixth grader using Garage Band. How is this person a professional musician. 
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,Well I have to say I find him very mysterious. As in I had never heard of him before right now and after listening to a song or 2 its a fucking mystery he can have enough fans to have an ego like this.
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"I played in a few bands for several years and as a musician I gotta say, what a shitty attitude for him to have. 

I always appreciated the bands I played shows with more that were friendly and personable. Even if their music sucked, it made a huge impact if someone took to time to hang back, drink a beer, talk gear, even at the least just give a nod and not be a dick. It made me want to support them more. Not that everyone is required to act like this all the time, everyone has times when you don't want to talk, and just want to be left alone which I completely understand. But ive read nothing but bad experiences from people who have worked with this guy. Slowly but surely, shit like this will probably close off openings for him to perform.  

Eventually he will be stuck where all he can get for a gig is a 15 minute spot at a boat show or a Monday afternoon at a strip mall parking lot for the new game stop grand opening and he will fucking deserve it. "
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,Apparently he never learned the difference between mysterious and douchebag.

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"Because it's a very simple way for him to stroke his ego, while at the same time giving himself an artificial sense of power.  People like him are the same the world over; they like to put on a nice facade for the masses, and act like an asshole every chance they can get.  He got picked on when he was a kid, so now he takes it out on anyone he even remotely thinks are a ""threat"" to him.

**TL;DR:** He sounds like he has delusions of grandeur, an unhealed inferiority complex, and paranoia."

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"Good.  He started it by taking shit way too far, and is feeling the backlash.  I hope he felt good on his stage powertrip when he kicked OP out of his show, because it's coming back to him now."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,What a bitch.
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"He's been this way for years; it's foolish to think that he's just gonna up and change his entire personality in one day.

Thought about going to the Atlanta show this Monday...glad I didn't order those tickets."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"No true scotsman/redditor only goes to the website in the *morning*. You gotta be refreshing this shit all day, mang."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,Poor baby. Does he want sympathy for being a dick? 
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,...now all I can think of is chipmunked Rammstein

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"That last line is exactly how I feel.  ""Nerd"" cause he owns an xbox. ""Nerd"" because he owns a video games.  No you aren't."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"Tagged as ""can't computer""."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,damn hipsters
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,That's something a casual would say.
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"[Prepare to be amazed](http://venturebeat.com/2011/12/27/ocean-marketing-how-to-self-destruct-your-company-with-just-a-few-measly-emails/). It'll take awhile to read that, so make sure you have time; it's totally worth it. Great piece of internet drama possibly even rivaling the feud between Penny Arcade and Jack Thompson IMO. (Incidentally, Penny Arcade was the hero in this, too.)

When you're done with that, here's an [AMA by Paul Christoforo](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/nxpqo/i_am_paul_christoforo_ama/), and here's [one by the guy who replaced him.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/nw1vm/ama_the_guy_who_replaced_paul_christoforo_and_is/)"
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,Google Ocean Marketing and the post on Penny Arcade should explain all.

wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"I have never heard of this man until this day, but reddit sure is good at making me hate strangers."
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,10/10 would read again
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,Fucking casuals man
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-19,it's the gypsies all over again
wrm3v,2012-07-18,2012-07-18,"Eh, needed more Desu."
