Action,Death Stranding,2023-07-22,some of you may not like this game and totally understand that. with that being said im sorry to say you do not appreciate games the way some of us do. so many games are alike nowadays. we rarely get unique and risk taking games like this. i absolutely adore this game because i genuinely think its fun and addictive. even if you dont enjoy it you must appreciate it for the originally and give it points for doing something no other game has attempted much less accomplished. please support original games. support of games that break free of the mold will inspire other game developers to take bigger risks and actually offer us new and original games.

Action,Death Stranding,2023-11-21,watching this 4 years later after playing like 10 hours. the introduction to the game in the first 1.53 hours are insane! it's so visually pleasing and you can really feel the weight of the world you live in.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-06,"after recently finishing the game, the metaphors and narrative swell... the idea of learning to better connect with people, to appreciate the little contributions they make everyday to have someone's life be just a bit easier was beautiful. the game made me rethink a lot about how i communicate and reach people in my life. it is rare a video game, let alone a piece of art, can do that."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-11,that feeling when you watch ''before you buy'' right after you bought it p
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-11,gameranx' before you buy is one of the best review outlets in the market today. god bless jake baldino and the team! 3
Action,Death Stranding,2023-06-02,"one of the most unique games ive ever played. i was so strangely obsessed with it and finished playin it a few months ago with over 70 hours on it. really looking forward to replaying it again in the future one day. its not a game for everyone, if you expecting something that will make you feel like some superhero and expect some crazy action like a lot of games, this is not it. for someone who plays call of duty everyday, i really enjoyed this game. it was like therapy from all the usual shi i see in video games. i loved the music, the great characters, and the crazy story. it was also beautiful and was just overall very unique. as i see someone described in the comments that the game is calming, exciting, and interesting all at once. cant wait for ds2, and other games from kojima."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-11,i miss the time when i had time to play a lifeconsuming game like that.

Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-11,my legs feel tired just by watching this.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-04-01,i clearly agree this game isn't for everyone but for me it was a great experience! i've unlocked the platinum trophy and still keep on playing because i like the idea about everyone needs to go the same ways to reach their goal and everyone is suffering because mostly this journey is not easy but once you stop to play this game just for yourself but also to help others to reduce their suffering like others did it for you... idk it's just a unique feeling for me!  good day to everyone reading this

Action,Death Stranding,2022-06-23,"i got the game when it first came out and played for about a few days. i felt it was daunting at first. i put it down and just now picked it back up and im absolutely addicted. its a magnificent experience with breathtaking vistas and yes some convoluted exposition but thats ok, its just so good and different"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-04,"the game was an experience. its an adventure, just you and your thoughts as you traverse through the world. people saying its a walking simulator or that all you do is walk. i dont understand that commentstatement. its like saying all you do in the gta series is drive when you know theres more to it than that. i loved every minute of it. its something fresh and new. in a gaming world where its being dominated by battle royal games, imo, this is something the video game community needs"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-11,kojima has been wanting to make movies for practically his whole life. i think he should. i would be fine if this was his last title because it whould have marked the start of a new company. gg kojima.

Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-10,i can only imagine how different the general reaction to this game would have been if it had been developed by ea or ubisoft
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-15,i just started playing this game yesterday on the day of the pc release and it was the most oddly engaging experience ive ever had with a game. i realized i was playing what essentially amounted to a walking simulator but for some reason it wasnt boring at all. very surreal
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-10,....i already work a full time job though

Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-11,"to me, the ultimate overlying issue with this game is that if we are honest with ourselves, if this game didnt have that kojima name attached to it, it would absolutely bust."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-22,as soon as he pulls out the ladder me what a thrill...
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-21,506 you know what else is massive
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-11,divisive i've heard this word in relation to this game a lot. it's quite ironic for a game that's about bringing people together.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-11,this game is basically playing as jake delivering all of our pizzas
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-10,boondocks saints actor caught me off guard
Action,Death Stranding,2022-03-10,i just beat this game again and put over 200 hours into it. i decided to play without the online this game is a masterpiece imo.

Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,only kojima can make a 10min trailer that leaves us more confused but also even more hyped. and unlike many devs he actually delivers on the hype.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-09,"nobody does game trailers like kojima. 10 minute  runtime, epic cinematic music, gameplay, alist cast, loads of weird shit that needs to be explained  i'm in."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-15,most realistic baby and most realistic kiss i've ever seen in any video game. and that look at 107 is also a good example of great actor's emotions captured by mocap. and i'm sure this trailer is fully captured in game and not prerendered. just like the first ds trailers. i definitely would've preordered if i had spare money.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"you thought this was going to be death stranding 2? well, actually, yes, it is death stranding 2. but not just. it's also metal gear solid 6!"

Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-17,my favorite trailer of all time used to be death strandings launch trailer. now its this. only kojima can surpass kojima.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"i played death stranding, during the covid19 pandemic lockdown, and it was a philosophical moment. the game's themes of connection, isolation, and perseverance made me think about life and the power of nature. ds is a masterpiece that goes beyond of just being a game. i just hope ds2 will be also."

Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"i only realized this was 10 minutes of a trailer 6 minutes in. this games ending is gonna 7 more hours of lore cutscenes than the last, isnt it? kojimas ambition is just insane. even more insane that it works."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-12,"bruh. what does kojima smoke? he's got access to strands that willie nelson and snoop can't get. even shigeru miyamoto is looking at him like, what are you on?"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-09,and kojima brings yet another new degree to graphical fidelity

Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-09,one of the best trailer i've ever seen !!!!
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-09,the moon scene was mindblowing
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-11,"yup that's kojima, you're here trying to piece together based from the first game and still can't figure out what happened in this trailer. how faith is not old from the neck down anymore and why she's taking care of lou? then there's a talking mini puppet, a titan fight and fricking solid snake!!?? anyway can't wait for the game release, looks like we will be getting a bunch of new areas to explore. there's a sandstorm area, jungle area, fiery area and so much more. the best part is for me at least the tons of new ways to traverse the map by vehicles or by building a structure like a zipline. i'll bet there will be more fun ways to deliver your packages."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,1008 now that's a beautiful cover artwork! 3
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-09,"funcking 10minutes trailer, kojima, i love you,"

Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-09,kojima fuck it all bro. this needs solid snake
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-30,this feels like a english translation of a korean movie subtitled in japanese and read back to us in russian then made into a film.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-24,the fedex game where a baby gives you powers to defeat ghosts
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-24,"could we start from the beginning, i lost myself when you said this is death stranding"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-16,"what an amazing and thorough explanation of death stranding. props to all. don't understand shit but still, good job."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-30,it's basically a family drama set in an apocalypse when you think about it
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-25,kojima watching this video be like oh so thats what the story is about.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-06,bridget and amelie are not mother and daughter like we first though. they are in fact the same person. me throws notes in the trash
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-01,"no matter how insane the story may be, it's different and will always stand out as something worth experiencing only because it was willing to do things other games these days just won't."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-01,you explained it very well. great job. but i still didnt understand it.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-21,before watching this video  confused after watching this video  confused
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-14,bioshock nobody understands my lore! deathstranded hold my packages.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-12,"i avoided this game for years just thinking it was a walking sim. just beat it, and it was actually incredible. loved it. such a unique game with a lot of care and effort put into it by everyone involved."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-02,man this game is more complicated than my life lol
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-29,teacher  the test is easy the test
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-06,they literally couldve created one game per each of these ideas. afterlife beach you can go back and forth to. babies that see dead people. rain that makes things age. dead bodies basically zombifying or blowing up.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-01-25,"fun fact sam, bridget and amelie have the last name strand, which might be a reference to the strand that the bts have to their beach. but in dutch, the word strand literally means beach"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-22,"the last time i ran with my sister across a beach , i pushed her into the sea truth has been spoken"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-07-15,"so the ending is your mom isn't your mom, your sister doesn't exist, you're the baby you thought you were protecting, and the baby that's helped you is just another baby."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-07,gamers how many plottwist can u put in a game makers of death stranding yes
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-16,i was legit crying the entire way to the incinerator at the end. i even rested at the top of the hill and played the harmonica.  but they tricked me with the twist after that!
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-04,let's not forget the fact that lou came back to life holding amelie's necklace which same did not have anymore. this literally shows that lou died and was sent back by amelie for sam. also sam's name is sam because uncle sam.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-04-19,"this all started when kojima said, pass me the acid tabs, friend. it's time to make a game!"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-10-08,people playing the game for 40 hours this makes no sense people watching this video this makes no sense
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-18,i came here just now after finishing the game. i had some questions that i was a bit confused on and you cleared them up. this game was incredible to me and i really enjoyed every step i took to one side of the country all the way and back. there were so many moments where i did cry because it was very emotional when you could understand what was going on. having put together that sam was clifford's son in the final confrontation had me choking. when i learned that sam's mother's name was lisa bridges i immediately knew that clifford was his father. this game doesn't get enough praise. if you can just listen to what's going on and be patient everything for the most part will make sense and you won't feel like you're wasting time.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-05,five nights at freddy's i have the most confusing lore in video game history!! death stranding hold my baby
Action,Death Stranding,2020-12-12,"id like to thank you for taking the time to explain all of that. it was comprehensive, eyeopening, and educational.and yet i still have no fin what the hell was going on in that game."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-04,i think this is the closest to a drug trip ill ever be. im really confused but i like it
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-14,"nice video  not sure if anyone else mentioned this but fragile delivered the first bomb unknowingly blowing up middle knot city. then stopped the other porter who was carrying the bomb for south knot city. small detail detail but it explains a bit more. she even tells sam that she regrets saving the second city, explaining why she never even tried to clear her name."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-11,this game shouldve been called norman reedus and the funky fetus
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-03,the last time i ran with my sister on the beach i pushed her into the sea. same! that's true love between siblings
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-10,emily  i am the beach. meyes...yes you are
Action,Death Stranding,2023-05-13,"i don't understand why people find the plot of this game confusing. it's perfectly simple your mothersister girlfriend is a supernatural creature that starts the apocalypse when she brings you back to life on purgatory beach and creates your daughterself who will help you survive against the deadliving things that live in the time rain. i mean, do you need to be spoon fed everything people?"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-06,"the game was just explained to me in detail, and im still confused..."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-03,bridget brings the baby back. the baby was holding her necklace.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-15,the last part where sam change lou's name into louis made me cry
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-14,original stories are so rare nowadays. this is a true treat
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-21,i wonder how intense was the pitch meeting for this game!
Action,Death Stranding,2021-07-14,i love how the baby gives you a thumbs up when you revive yourself sometimes.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-05,this games story is still less complicated than kingdom hearts.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-06,"so im currently up on the 1st year anniversary of my wife leaving me, in that year i withdrew from the world... pushing everything away... but playing this game, a game about connection, and reconnecting it has helped me. we are beings of connections and making those connections make us humans. this game has helped me in a way i can't still fully fathom... thank you kojimasan you have helped me to find the want, the desire for connections again."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-10,"me before watching video oh nice, i can finally learn what the teaser and trailers all mean! me after watching this video lol me brain hurts."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-10-04,"fun fact i think the moment both louise and sam exit the incinerator it's without timefall, but simple rain, as it shows a normal rainbow with the blue on it. that's why sam enters the rain without fear of aging. it seems like the world starts to heal itself"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-21,the ghost woman that picked up the baby is mama in the afterlife
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-08,"this game is an absolute masterpiece. i put game in quotations because it's so much more than just a video game, it truly is an experience like no other. aside from the game looking absolutely gorgeous, it has one of the most unique story's ever created."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-11-06,before the video confused after the video extremely confused and somewhat disturbed
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-14,i dont think cliff never lost a man in battle. in my battles with him he was using his allies as a shield.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-06,id rather watch death stranding then play it seems better as a movie
Action,Death Stranding,2022-09-14,"good summary. i just finished the game on ps5 and needed to hear it all back to feel i have in fact made sense of it, well, as much sense as anyone can of a kojima game.... it's crazy how insane, weird, mundane, scary, touching and profound this game can be  usually all at the same time."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-06,clifford unger give me back my bb. what he really meant give me back my baby sam. me realizing this
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-28,this game will always be confusing even after a decade later
Action,Death Stranding,2021-03-27,"this is one of the most intriguing yet scuffed storylines i have ever heard, what a game"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-04,"this game was so criticized due to its gameplay hand over this package from point a to point b, but it has a complex story so worth to hear it. and the gameplay itself its awsome, the game maneges to give you a lot of different elements through it, so that you dont get bored. i've played directors cut and deffinitly its one of my favorite games of all time."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-27,after 35 hours we want closure lol i was at 101 hours by the end of the game.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-07,new title for the game norman reedus with the funky feetus whos not going deletus
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-04,mamas story is so beautiful yet tragic
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-05,"i love this game, it's lore, the gameplay, all of it imagine the human implications of discovering the afterlife and documenting the hard facts of it's properties heartman, repeatedly going into limbo to search for his family. that's understandable experiments of the ka, deadman, seeing what gives a person a soul and a beach to go to when they die, that makes sense plus the science melding with spirituality is something i have never seen before. i just love all of it"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-22,"sooo... i keep hearing people say the story is confusing. what's confusing? timefall was a strange but naturally occuring event that caused sentient living organisms to age upon contact. around the time of the first voidout, the president had manifested the power to travel to beaches, and upon discovering the connection between bbs and the beaches thought of using them to recconect the isolated sections of the states. upon shooting clifford, she accidentally killed one of the first bbs, sam protagonist, and repatriated him on the beach out of guilt. this breach of natual law allowed all the dead to return to the land of the living as bts, because presumably a kind of metaphysical gate was thrown open. it can be assumed that ameile was brought into existence because briget president was in and out of a near death state, which created a kind of out of body experience that led to the manifestation of her soul as an entirely seperate entity. sam's blood acts as a key to killing bts because he is the original source of the abnormality that freed them, as in the one whose rebirth broke the cycle in the first place. higgs learned of how the extinction cycle worked, and figured that he could ensure the final extinction occured if he completed ameile's plan to link the beaches, creating a much bigger gateway for the bts to enter the world through. lou, sam's bb, triggered a neural response in sam each time they reconnected due to his own past as a bb."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-24,"thanks for 1,000,000 subs!  q wheres the face reveal? a its coming this week. its something special and worth the wait. hope you understand."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-28,if you haven't pissed in a bt you're not living.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-11,"i love this game so damn much! cant wait for ds2. kojima always sets the bar high. i feel like the game was perfect as a stand alone, however i am excited to explore this world more."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-01,cryptobiotes look like tardigrades but theyre timefall bears instead of water bears
Action,Death Stranding,2020-02-29,"a couple of things i feel should be mentioned 1. sam named lou after he and his wife's unborn baby, who had died a decade before, which was the reason he left bridges 2. mama neglects to inform sam that lockne is her sister, so their first interaction is sam going mama? is that you? and lockne replying who are you and why are you calling me mom?, which was honestly rather rude of mama"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-12-19,"the actor that played diehardman gave such an amazing performance like i have never seen!! not to take away from the others in any way, but just watching this video reminded me of my experience, giving me chills. fantastic job!!"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-09,"so if norman is actually madds baby, then while madds is trying to hunt down norman to steal the bb unit lou, madds is actually mistaken and going for the wrong bb?"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-01-01,godzilla had a stroke trying to understand this.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-04-14,2019 this game makes no sense?! 2020 pandemic ...ok...this game makes sense now...
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-09,1310 sam just said yeah boiii i can't
Action,Death Stranding,2023-10-07,when bb's theme kicked in during the last delivery i bawled
Action,Death Stranding,2020-02-11,i couldnt stop laughing when the baby showed its butt
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-09,damn.. it's like i'm on acid while in inception movie falling through the twilight zone.. i am lost !!!
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-14,mom education is important for everything me i just wanna play games i dont need education for playing games playstationgrenade death stranding story explained me i should have listened to mom
Action,Death Stranding,2023-03-31,2126 homer brilliant!!! i have no idea whats going on.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-10-21,"sometimes i wonder if kojima's insane, or if he just enjoys messing with our minds."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-04-14,the way he says personally i wanted to let the world burn. is just amazing
Action,Death Stranding,2020-05-31,"i love this game, the characters, the story, the environment, the amazing map, the graphics, the soundtrack, the whole concept, etc. thank you kojima, what an experience!"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-16,kojimas writingstory telling style seems to be dude what if insert batshit here happened?!
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-25,adam goes in depth and completely explains game me huh
Action,Death Stranding,2021-01-04,"the tag line for this game should be we know its bullshit, but just go with it."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-25,for the love of christ almighty. how you managed to turn all that into something i can understand roughly 10 of is amazing. this is actually so brilliant that its out of my league. how ones mind can come up with a story like that wo an insane amount of lsd and adderrall is beyond me. ive got to give you mad props grenade for putting that together. that's doing work son.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-10-05,one of the greatest and most unique game of all time. really loved this game. thank you very much for making such a game and for this video for a great explanation
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-04,everyone out here thinking kojima is a genius. my uncle has been on meth for 20 years and thinks he's king edward the third and he makes more sense than this story.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-09,midpoint of the game i was like if they kill off lou i swear ill hurt somebody
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-06,954 waaiit a minute. isn't that the giraffe thing from horizon zero dawn??
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-26,"you are the ultimate commentator, great work. never ever would have worked this game out. saved me 50 hours!"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-10-23,"breaking news species literally to lazy to die, delays apocalypse eh well all die later says spokeswoman."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-11-25,"couple things on this, repatriate is different than doom's. sam is the only repatriate in the game. doom's does not allow you to travel to the beach specifically, it is one of the powers later down the line. also, heartman is special in that he can travel to other beaches. each person usually has their own. however mass trauma can make a shared beach aka massive shared war beaches"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-10,"although these videos explain the story they forget to answer key questions. they don't explain why timefall occurs or why bt's only appear when it happens. why bt's create a mass explosion when they consume a human being, why there is no blue color in an inverted rainbow or even the reason for bt's to reach out to humans. everything is explained in heartman's and deadman's interviews in the game. a shame that people overlook this."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-16,its off the wall when you watch it like this. but oddly makes more sense when you play it lol
Action,Death Stranding,2020-12-13,after watching this video i somehow understand what is death stranding even less now
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-03,"mammas baby just wanted to go back to herhis momma. literally, just wanted to fully die with momma as both had originally died in labor. kind of sad."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-31,i just finished the game thanks to quarantine. that ending had me crying. the game is not for everyone but damn i loved it!!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-04,interesting to see higgs wearing amelies necklace in the ds2 trailer. lou is clearly holding it at the end of ds.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-04-14,a wise man once said jesus christ rick don't eat the baby!
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-19,"after playing this game on pc, i have a new level of respect for delivery men"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-01-26,that plot is the wildest thing ever. wow.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-03-23,i got teary eyed when sam was helplessly trying to bring lou back.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-11-23,"does anyone realize how cute it is that he ended up naming bb louis which is very similar to lucy which was his wife's name, that's adorable"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-05,"this story is too convoluted. it's a lot of interesting ideas kind of thrown together in a soup. it's unique for sure, but i don't think uniqueness and complexity alone makes a story good."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-10-20,"the story is simply beautiful. up until halfway through the game you are confused as hell and you think that there is no way that all these crazy things, ideas and threads inside the story will make any sense at all. and yet surprisingly, by the end of the game every piece falls in place and actually makes perfect sense always considering the world and the lorerules of the game. not only that but most impressive is the fact that compared to other kojima games, this, even though it seems by far the most crazy of all, it is actually explained pretty thoroughly and easily. there is no considerable effort required in order to understand. it doesnt even matter if you miss a few details. the plot will make sense if you pay a bit of attention when you have to. and when i say sense, i mean everything. from the scars on his belly, to the baby, to the hands to everything. it is a beautiful story that will really move you and it is worth experiencing this game. it is completely unique and there is nothing out there like it."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-09,what an amazing world building. im all for a shoot em up game but sometimes they are so dumbed down its insulting. games like this allows original ideas to flourish while being a game. very cool.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-30,"kojima so whats this game about? interviewer ...wait, what?"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,true knowledge exists in knowing that you know nothing socrates while watching this trailer

Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-16,after finishing the game i realised that this trailer reveals almost the whole game
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-31,i felt like a 7yearold reading a calculus book
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-30,me 2 minutes in i think i finally know what this game is about me 3 minutes later aaaaand it's gone
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-13,because of coronavirus this game has become a documentary
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-31,all other companies launch trailers are usually 1 or 2 minutes kojima nahh let's make it 8 minutes
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-30,ok what i got out of this is that the main character has to deliver a package while at the same time fixing the wifi around america with his trusty side kick baby

Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,it's an indie game with a triple a budget and one of the most unique experiences i've ever had in gaming. ignore the haters who are still salty kojima didn't put david hayter in mgsv. lol
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,it went from one of the most divisive games to one of the most praised games of the 2020s
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"this wasn't a game, this was an experience."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,definitely not for everyone and i get it. i played this a few months ago when sick for a week. extremely interesting worldstory. game becomes extremely addicting but one of the slowest starts to a game i have ever played. try it
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-11,"kojima predicts the future how did a game about reconnecting people that he was developing years before, drop when we literally couldnt leave our homes and were physically disconnected from each other.."

Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"this game is polarizing. a lot of people loved it, and a lot of people hated it. i myself absolutely loved it but i understand why people hated it."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-16,"i needed some trys, had a year long break and never thought i'd even finish it. now it is my absolute comfort game. i just started a new playthrough, just roaming around the world, doing deliveries and vibing."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,so what you're saying is i should wait for the director's cut of death stranding 2
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-16,"definately one of my most favourite games of all time. a very unique experience. one of the few occassions where a game got under my skin in a good way, id think about playing it when i wasnt playing it and i think thats a good thing for a game to be able to achieve from a player. its also a game where i understand peoples criticisms. the game definately isnt for everyone and it is a massive slow burn. but its so hugely rewarding if youre able to push past the opening several hours to really get into the games flow. when it clicks. it clicks. who'd have ever thought that a walking simulator inventory management game would be so fulfilling and rewarding to play."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,one of the best games i have ever played.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,ive only played directors cut. im suprised how much stuff was added post launch...didnt expect that
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"for anyone playing this game for the first time, do know, the game has an incredibly slow start. i promise the intro section does not represent the whole game. it is as slow as it is for a reason."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"exactly the kind of video i was looking for, i haven't played it since the first few months of its release, excited to go back"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-16,love death stranding! its one of those games that really impacted me on a personal level. keep on keepin on
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"i thinking to wait for ds2 directors cut. i started with ds1 directors cut, i didnt realize how many of the features werent in the original, including better graphics."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-11,"if you have a bit of ocd, this game tickles that itch. my wife was annoyed at me for obsessing over making sure every single road is built..."

Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-17,didn't even mention the new support skeleton that came with the director's cut. it's a huge improvement for the early game
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"never tried this game,i wonder  if i should give it go"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-13,"i have been playing the directors cut for the past couple of months and logged well over 100 hours now. i have not experienced a single bug or glitch. there is some jank with the reverse trike, but you learn how to handle it. with all the buggy messes that are left unfinished these days, it has been very refreshing for a game to function properly 100 of the time. death stranding director's cut is a masterpiece and i'll be waiting for the complete version of the sequel too."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,just started another playthrough after the announcement before we get into the weeds again with the next wave of new releases. feels good to be back.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-12,"i tried it playing two times. absolutely loved the atmosphere. sadly, my dumbass tries to deliver every package possible, progressing very slowly and ultimately getting bored and i stop playing. hard game to come back to after some time. maybe one day i will try again. one of the coolest game concepts for sure."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,the rewards on pc weren't just cosmetic either immediately lists a cosmetic skin for the standard truck vehicle as an example.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-15,"i'm still pouring time into it to try and platinum it 115 hours later in the postgame. it feels so good to help others players out in this time of uncertainty. it reminds me of breath of the wildtears of the kingdom. while i can't quite wrap my head around rhe story, the gameplay is good i love drop kicking mooks. plus the sticky gun is quite handy! i can't wait for ds2! also, rip ryan karazija from low roar."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-15,"this is one of those games where you gotta get past the first like five hours to start unlocking things and then it all makes sense, i loved it."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-21,"the added story missions, while simple, definitely add quite a bit. they expand the backstory for higgs and fragile and the bb program, which based on the trailer for ds2 will be an even bigger focus. feels perfect to play them before jumping into part 2"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-16,one of the most unique and rewarding gaming experiences you can find. and its funny that those who've played thru the game will tell you its a masterpiece while everyone who didnt play it will tell you it sucks. a lesson to always learn to think for yourself
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-13,this helped me through rona it was a beautiful experience
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,i only played 18 hours. i've got a lot to do still. i guess i'll give it another shot.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"this is the most ambitious game that sony was crazy enough to fund. because if this wasnt made by hideo kojima, no one would ever understand or support it. so be famous, and make crazy games lmao"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-16,i just started playing death stranding for the first time two days ago.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"i guess its time to play the director cut then! played with this game during lockdown,was very relaxing and fun! very unique game!!"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"as someone who played gta games since the very first yes i'm old lol.. death stranding was my second all time as for ds2, i'm easily as excited i am for that as gta6. kojima is a fing legend"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-20,"separation, isolation, ppl avoiding intimate relationships all this is, has and will continue dudes a genius. somewhat excited to play this on ps5 appreciate kojima son and what he has done with mgs series very artistically interesting mind."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-15,death stranding is a masterpiece.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-15,"man, the sequel is gonna be fucking crazy."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,such a great and unique game. i've played through the game first on ps4pro then on pc and now working on ps5pro to get platinum before sequel.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-14,this game blew me away when it first came out i never got why ppl didnt like it durning launch
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-15,finally able to play this and i'm glad i'm getting the best version before the sequel
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-14,thanks for making me consider upgrading to directors cut!
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-12,we are ready for death stranding 2!!
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,best new addition is having the new game coming this year on june. sick trailer as well
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-13,"cant wait for 2, absolutely amazing game"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-16,i got death stranding saved to my play later list since the 2nd game is in full swing i should really get around to playing it
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,this is the first time that i've actually seen gameplay of this game.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-21,"i recently started playing death stranding directors cut on pc. have to say, i'm really enjoying it so far. looking forward to ds2  i just hope it comes to pc sooner than later!"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-11,cargo cannon is more useful for shooting sleeping gas cargo into mule and terrorist camps or just launching cargo at 200mph straight into an enemy npc if youve got good timing.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,greatest walking simulator ever made
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-12,started playing it 2 days ago. interesting game so far.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"played it near the end of 2021, start of 22 and if i had known theres a directors cut coming, id have waited. the improvements to qol are great and wouldve saved me some time here and there. its one of my most favorite games, even though the story has its weaknesses. ds2 is the only game in a very long time i thought about picking up at launch, if that says something probably still wont, lol."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-16,also the monster energy drinks have been replaced. i still go back and play the original just to have that lol
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-13,normally i'd say this is a game you can dillydally around in and do the campaign at your own pace but this is one of the few games i can say you should focus on the campaign first and do everything else in the postgame.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-15,i played the ps4 version during 2024 and platnium the game looking at this updates making me think i played in the hardest difficulty
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-11,im proud to say that i completed the non directors cut last year the hard way i didnt know you could add the directors cut to the main game
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-21,just started playing the game last week
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-13,finally got to play it on xbox and was in love with it wish the second was too
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"wait, the gravity gloves weren't in the game originally? i couldn't imagine playing without them"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,would be nice if sam learned some doom powers
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-14,"looks so great. once it goes on sale again for xbox i will 100 percent be picking this up. shame that the sequel isnt coming to xbox, at least for the time being."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-17,"to say it's an experience is very true, it's like stardew valley in a sense. the story is there to give you a push, it's about the vibes as much as the plot"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,keep on keeping on
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,thank you for the guide ign
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,way ahead of its time
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-11,"not everyone's cup of tea but if you sip it once, you'd want more and more."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-13,"i platinum the game, and i still play it"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,kojima saw all trailers and said hold my beer
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-14,gotta reinstall this! didnt realize how much extra stuff there was
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,keep on keeping on lol love this game had me gripped from the start n that was just seeing how much stuff could carry then fall down hill n lose it all lol think first few hours was messing about more than taking it serious lol
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-13,wow. didnt know such a difference. like a different game. a cyberpunklike improvement lthanks. now wondering if better to wait to play the second one for years. ha. fyi xbox shadow dropped death stranding directors cut for 19.99 sale. routine matches this in subsequent sales. show the love for hideo
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,118 honestly a combine apc would've been such a better fit here.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-11,"one of best ign videos. i'd love a channel that does this. where they talk about how the game has evolved over the years, with it's updates. and is it worth playing? or not?"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,its such a good game i totally understand some people dont like it can see why but for me i love the chilled
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,glad ive waiting until now to play the game so could get the directors cut
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-12,could have been another scifi rpg. turned into one of the most unique games of all time.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-16,got a little bored of this game when it released on ps4. been playing the directors cut on ps5 and its amazing! seeing it in a whole new light.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"i loved the game but need to go back and play all the extra content before the sequel . i really loved the cyberpunk content , especially the yaiba bike ."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,2 is bouta be a masterpiece
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-11,am thinking that i should finally finish this amazing game  experience
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,i should play this at some point lol
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,game right here!
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,playing this again until death stranding 2
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-11,almost like the game should be coming out in this state  maybe 2025 is the year i give it a try.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-14,masterpiece
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,thx
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"after ds1 i will wait ds2 for pc, i gave money to 2 editions of ds on ps4 and pc buyers got the same thing in a single edition,it is no worth rush nowadays,worth wait more"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,can't wait for the movie......i think norman reedus would be a good sam.....
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-13,i forgot this finally came out for xbox i guess i'm going to check it out
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-13,so you can't get the gun range unless you have it on the ps five directors cut? i was hoping to use that on the ps4 pro.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,i don't think the original releases on ps4pc got these updates. i think these are exclusive to director's cut only.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-19,i just beat this game amazing
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,1010 ups workers recommend.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,such a confusing but in depth story
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-13,"nooo waayy cyberpunk, might have to check this out, fedex stranding here i come"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,be a postman simulator next
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-20,got platinum on ps4 and ps5. starter a new game again. dont know what wrong with it but the screen turns black alot search for hdmi. happens only on this game. and chapter 5 with ziplines lose connection with online connection and go offline. and after loading and get connection back all the ziplines and things have changed to other places so its not gonna be nice try build lines. it need a update
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-24,"i agree with most of this. it's a more balanced review than the previous one, so i can only assume he held down the triggers while making it."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-22,i love how theyre doing a directors cut even though clearly nobody ever said no to any of kojimas ideas
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-24,"dunkey finally discovered the truth he keeps playing the same strandtype game because he, by nature, is a strandtype gamer."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-31,i love how this game made me prioritize two extra pairs of boots over ammo.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-25,can't believe dunkey decided to make another strandtype video
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-29,"it was like kojima created the covid19 as a complimentary feature to death stranding, as it help player feel more immersed into the world building, where desolation is persistent but you're always reminded of company."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-24,"i cant believe dunkey gave us the second strandtype video, truly generous of him"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-08-25,"death stranding is so immersive because mostly it feels like what i imagine a real life in a post apocalyptic world would be like. not all exciting gunfights and heroes battling the forces of evil, but a gruelling, tedious life of mostly mundane work and constant hardship. on that level it connects with me in a way that other games dont."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-24,4th 5th and 6th playthroughs will be wayyyy different
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-25,he made this whole video entirely because he saw that line about a mule in the game. fucking legend.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-25,love how dunkey has conditioned me to say psychomantis whenever he says psychomantis.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-20,"my favorite part of the game was going into safe houses, turning on the music playlist, and reading my missed emails. this game made me feel so connected to people that werent real. to the point that i found comfort in it."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-24,this is the one of the greatest plot twists in the dunkey cinematic universe since leah destroyed dunkey's jake paul poster.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-11-08,"me death stranding is amazing, kojima's best work. plays it once dunkey death stranding sucks ass. i'm on my third playthrough."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-24,can't wait for the rerevisit 2 years from now when dunkey's played through the game 5 more times
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-29,for me the best part of death stranding was finishing a zip line or a piece of road and booting the game back up and seeing it have dozens or hundreds of likes from other players. or starting a structure and finding it finished by another player. those elements i think were probably better when the game launched and it was more active but it gave a very satisfying feeling to the building mechanics that i havent had from other primarily single player story driven games.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-11-04,i spent 66 hours of my life on this game. i would finish work every day and just come home and focus on building roads for my fellow players for 2 hours. i managed to build a road for the entire of the main map. was weirdly addictive knowing that i was helping my fellow gamers.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-25,"babe wake up, a new strand type video dropped"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-28,"man, whenever dunkey gets semiserious and makes a genuine review like this i'm taken aback by how good he is at it"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-02-12,"despite all the downfalls, death strandings overall atmosphere is one of the most unique ive ever seen. you just have this brooding, melancholy feel the entire game and the soundtrack is honestly very fitting for the game. just my take though."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-24,"dunkeys entire youtube career has been implanting the phrase jokers trick in our heads by repeatedly referencing it, so he can make me laugh by saying jokers truck."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-24,dunkey has a really good way of talking about games in a way that shows he takes them seriously while still making it funny and fun to listen to.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-25,"like garfield, death stranding is a movie about layers."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-01,517 what the hell does this even mean? i think this is norman reedus actually asking this when reading the script and they just left it in because.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-24,the lovehate relationship dunkey has with this game is always fun to watch
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-28,the only music he listens to is radiohead. and my boyfriend took that personally.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-11-01,"it does kind of boggle my mind that this came out precovid. the core premise of humanity being so isolated and alone that oxytocin is literally an essential supply as in food, water, and oxytocin is such a post pandemic concept. that he came up with that beforehand is kind of amazing. i'd love to have his knack for ideas."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-05-22,i can't tell you how many times i've watched this video and the bark at 604 still catches me off guard!
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-24,dunkey i was actually having fun while playing death stranding well thats something i never thought i would hear
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-25,"i agree with a majority of dunkey's points, and to add this game feels like it started out as something much simpler but kojima kept walking in and said, hey, what if we add this? and no one told him no, while sony kept sending him blank checks."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-24,this review feels far more measured and in depth without sacrificing humor or critique. nails all my problems with the game but also finds what's buried beneath that.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-29,death standing was my everything when i was pregnant. i almost completed it and went back to it after having my son. it's terrifying.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-24,this game makes you really feel like an amazon driver.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-25,you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself fall in love with strand type games.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-25,"ah yes, the game about how our parents got to school back in the day."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-12-20,"i did not expect this from you. but thats actually a compliment. i did the performance capture for deadman and some of higgs, by the way. also provided facial data for bb. sam hugging deadman was my idea."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-24,"honestly it's really refreshing when you go ahead and decide to take a serious approach on a video, i really enjoy the insight you bring into what you're analyzing"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-27,"i kinda just appreciate the fact that death stranding was weird and not for everyone. kojima made something he wanted to make, knowing not everyone would be into it, and i can respect that."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-25,"trust me, once you play death stranding for the 87th time, that's when it really starts to get good."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-19,death stranding might be the most surprising game i have ever played. because i did zero research before buying it aside watching some clips on gpu benchmark videos. i thought it was going to be a fun sci fi  climate change themed parcel delivery rpg. then there was like an invisible predator dog and superpower babies in vials and all sorts of scary stuff and i was very much wtf.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-27,"i remember watching the first trailer and thinking wow, the plot of this game is gonna go completely over my head. then actually experiencing the plot, and thinking no, not like that"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-24,i love that you continue to reexamine games even when you didn't have a good experience of them the first time. breaking down pieces of art takes time and you still may come out hating it. what sets you apart from most reviewers. big respect dunk. you keep dunking
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-29,"having never played this game, that i am the beach line had me in stitches lol"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-01,"what i like most of the gameplay is the building by other players, theres a heartwarming yet lonely feeling of freezing through the snow and just ahead you see a timefall shelter playing the most soothing tune"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-24,"for me, the connecting with other players was what made me love the game. so many games that try to integrate multiplayer aspects into single player games does so as adversaries. dark souls and the like, where players invade you to impede your progress. this was different though, even though i never saw them i felt like i was helping other players with their journeys while they helped me with mine. coming back to a bridge or ladder i built and finding it with hundreds of likes, knowing people used it to make their journey easier made that game that much better for me."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-25,gotta appreciate dunkey's quality and perspective of gaming as a media.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-01-06,honestly the soundtrack alone in those moments when you enter certain areas are fucking beautiful and made the game for me.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-03,cant believe kojima created covid so that dunkey could start relating to this game. what a thoughtful guy
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-24,the only music he listens to is radiohead you fucking killed me
Action,Death Stranding,2021-11-15,"i bought this game to prove how stupid it was and i ended up loving it and beating it and now i am so close to getting platinum lmao wtf. i hated watching people play it, but then playing it myself i'm fucking addicted"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-25,putting up a zipline network across the entire country was my favorite part.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-09-23,"552 i was not prepared man, nice once donsley"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-24,"see, despite how he may come across as a player, dunkey really excels as a critic because he can actually take a second or third look and reevaluate whether he was right or wrong about something. he's done it with the last of us, he's done it with red dead redemption 2, he's done it with league of legends, and now he's doing it with death stranding."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-11-01,sam what is that? everyone gives him a 1000 slide powerpoint presentation on what hes asking about.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-24,"i feel like death stranding has the same problem a lot of apocalypsedystopia stories have where there is this need to force a opponent so the protagonist can beat him and win, when most of the time just the general odds the protagonist faces are enough to create tension."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-11-14,"is death stranding one of the greatest games of all time? i couldnt decide for you. it sucks major ass, but it has been 4 years and i keep playing it and i always cry when i see port knot city on the horizon. this game is everything i hate about video games and yet the application in this singular video game keeps me playing. and ill keep playing this game forever. is it good? i still dont know. but i do know that its poignant, its beautiful, and its unforgettable"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-26,my brother swears by the fact that nobody could understand the game until after the pandemic. if you look at the reviews by days before and after the ratings are completely different
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-24,wow dunkey was really patient enough to make another strand game vid. respect
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-25,just want to chime in and say splinter cell chaos theory is still excellent all these years later
Action,Death Stranding,2023-06-29,"this is a perfect representation of it. death stranding is a beautiful, frustrating, annoying, amazing mess that i personally love. it never bores me. and the way it's grown on dunkey is absolutely amazing."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-01-22,"sounds like a very provocative art house film that you essentially hate on the first viewing, but for some reason you're compelled to return, again and again... and by the fifth viewing it's one of your alltime favourites."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-26,"i had this game sitting in my steam backlog for months, finally decided to just give it a try. it's such a bizarre game and janky at times but i'm really enjoying it somehow lol"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-25,"replaying the directors cut i realized that if you skip every dialogue when you connect to a distro center and play the benny hill theme whenever amelie shows up, the plot becomes like 27 times better"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-02-10,"dunkey put in the hobbit at 347 for us true fans, thanks dunk."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-11-17,the bark when the girl said sam had my sides on orbit.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-24,i like seeing you go back and reevaluate games in your catalog in a new light
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-24,"given how huge of a mario fan dunkey is, it only makes sense he'd come around to the more modern strandtype games."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-16,"as someone who likes hiking, nature, cycling, dystopian scifi, techwearfictional technology, low roar rip, and being alone, i will probably be playing this game until i die. i realize a lot of people hated it because they wanted it to be something else... but i absolutely love it"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-24,as a former bike messenger i honestly feel this game captures the difficulty monotony and tedium of the job perfectly i think kojima researched bike couriers while making it
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-25,"god damn that fragile bark caught me so off guard, i weezed heavily"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-25,"man, i'll never forget the connection we formed with guts man."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-05,when i played this game i really felt like a real death strander
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-24,"i love this far more than the og death stranding video , it feels less harsh and more like a brilliant and engaging criticism , i feel like i really understand dunkeys thoughts on the game"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-24,604 it's unbelievable that i've already replayed this scene like a thousand times and even so i still laugh at all of them.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-11-03,"if you look more deeply, you can see the story of kojima since when konami kicked him. he cannot trust anymore and wanted to stay alone but one of his closest friend, guillermo del toro never let him down and help him to reach new people, build connection to make his new studio. bb represents his passion, video games."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-05-06,i still think the first time you meet hartman in person is one of the coolest cutscenes ever.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-24,i always love these more indepth videos. theyre probably my fav dunky content
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-24,"the things i found really smart and creative in ds , i the communication between players , i played the game day one and take a break for a month when i came back, other players builds highways, bridges , the game was evolving thanks to players helping each others to make delivery easier for everyone, i think that is the true meaning of strand type games , really good video as always"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-25,death stranding is my most favorite game i hate. this review nailed exactly how it made me feel.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-07,i get why death stranding didn't connect with a fair few people but i honestly think it is an amazing game the landscapes are stunning the music is amazing a lot of the actually mechanics i really really enjoyed using and the whole idea of connection and being stronger together is a really beautiful message to convey yes kojimas writing can be goofy and less than stellar at times but he makes up for it in terms of his ideas and how unique his stories feel i also think in terms of visuals and design him and yoji shinkawa are a legendary duo i platinumed it on release played about 125 hours and i still go back to it now to wonder around and soak in its incredible atmosphere its not a perfect game but let's be honest no game is.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-25,this is like when anthony fantano doing his redux review for my beautiful dark twisted fantasy and still gave it a 610.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-25,"i'd like to take a minute to point out that not only is dunkey hilarious, he can write. some serious work went into the script for this one!"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-24,i love this review . i love how even though death standing isnt a perfect game you hit all of it flaws but also hit all of its perks. its an acquired taste like i commented in your other review and i can definitely see how people can see how its not fun but i think everyone should try it once to see if they like it. great re review
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-12,"now that i'm playing it again death stranding it's a hard game to explain. in some ways it feels like it was very rushed, and that's even ignoring the stuff about vehicle collision. the balance system really is very weird, i just walk around the entire game holding r2l2 and i can go pretty much anywhere with no risk of falling over because i am 'balancing'. i get the impression that you are supposed to feel like you are engaged with the process by having to pay attention to your balance, but i can carry huge, huge stacks of cargo on my back which are more than 1 storey tall, but as soon as i try to carry something in one hand, my balance is completely ruined. some people say it's just a boring game about making deliveries, but delivering stuff isn't actually the goal of the game, it's just a means to an end, which is to reconnect the country as is explained through the story. if you don't care about the story then the game is simply not for you. i think that the story has a lot of interesting ideas, but like dunkey says, kojima spends a lot of time over explaining these ideas. he has always been inspired by movies and cinema, and it seems like he really wants to take as much advantage of the actors he has hired as possible, and use the mocap technology he has access to. at least the stuff like emails and discussions are mostly optional for people who really want to understand the plot better. in terms of actual game design, the idea of a solomultiplayer world where players are connected to each other, but never actually see each other, isn't totally new this indirect connection is what 'strand type gameplay' basically is. the concept existed with games like dragon's dogma, where you could send your 'pawn' computer controlled counterpart to be hired by other players, and they would learn about things they see in other game worlds, and bring that knowledge back with them the next time you log in how to fight new enemies, use new items, attack combos, etc. that game allowed you to rate the pawn out of 5 stars for things like appearance, usefulness, etc. the pawns made by other players would also inhabit your game world even if you never used them, and walk around towns and the environment  other people made the generic npcs in your game. in death stranding, there aren't really many ways to actually engage with other people except for giving likes, leaving shared items, buildings, signs, or choosing to deliver packages left behind by other people. it was written to be thematically relevant, because the game was all about how people seek likes and validation to give their life purpose  without other people to engage with, there isn't as much to do in the game, and there isn't much to do in life. sometimes you might log in after a while of not playing and discover that a bridge you built has a few thousand likes, and the whole concept is that you did a good thing, and people like you for it. human connections are a big part of the plot, but we are supposed to appreciate that more by having to rebuild that connection. the emails and discussions talk about the concepts like 'the multiverse' and everyone always asks sam 'how do you manage to get so many deliveries done so fast?' and the hint is that all of the people playing at the same time are collectively working as the same 'sam'  everyone is working together to help each other complete the same game, and that is a very kojima thing to have this big concept which is a bit let down a bit by the mechanics on that note, this is probably why dunkey couldn't drive a truck over 5 ladders, because they wanted someone to build one bridge that everyone could use  a single tool which requires less maintenance, that everyone can contribute resources to, whereas ladders are temporary and will degrade no matter what. some bridges built by other people in my game have nearly 1 million likes in 2023. the other big, optional project in the game is rebuilding the powered highway in every section. if you take time to work on this it can let you bypass nearly every frustrating obstacle, and keeps your vehicles and equipment battery charged. the same thing applies to creating a zipline network. but like dunkey pointed out in his original video, you essentially bypass all of the 'gameplay' balancing, navigating, fightingavoiding enemies to create a super fast network, but this is actually what people do in real life  they try to create the most efficient delivery networks possible to get the best rating. no one is interested in if their delivery person had to walk through wind and rain to make a same day delivery, they're wondering why they didn't send a truck."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-24,353 the only music he listens to is radiohead daaaamn that was so on point
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-24,"i watched dunkey's first video as death stranding was downloading a day or two after the game came out and i think that really helped me enjoy the game. i went into it with super low expectations, like alright fuck, a lot of people hate this game, and i really think that helped me come out the other side of it with a satisfied smile"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-24,i love that in metal gear 2 it has a lot of weird specific functions like giving a guy food poisoning instead of just shooting him
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-09,now dunkey gonna snap on death stranding 2
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-24,"dunkey doesn't hate death stranding, he's just mad that he likes it"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-24,this is legit one of your best reviews yet. amazing
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-24,"s tier dunkey video. enjoying seeing your real perspective on these games, while still keeping that humor aspect"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-29,when he said i am a mule i remembered that he once again dropped another strandtype review. bravo vince
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-29,the core of death stranding  a game based on traversal and trail creation  would be great for a new oregon trail.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-25,the random grunting at 750 had me dying ahaha
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-25,this might be in my top 20 dunkey videos. i don't often associate this channel with humility but having the capacity to give something a second chance and ability to judge with a fairer perspective makes me respect you a lot as a reviewer and a content creator
Action,Death Stranding,2023-07-30,"i got through it, because i looked forward to getting the next unlockable equipment, gear, cosmetic plus another star on norman's pants as the clients are appreciative and the starmeans you maxed the rep with a station feels earned. the star shows how committed of a gopher you are and it looks and feels nice tacking on another star every time. the only big negative about the game is that once you get to last few chapters the game essentially sets you on rails until you finish the game taking about a few hours to conclude. during these last few chapters the game finally decides to pull back the curtains and finally explain and connect the dots about the story. also, they have you sit throughyou run around on the beach waiting for the credits to end the entire credits screen before they finally finish connecting the dots and end the story soon after. after completing the game you look at what you've accomplished, people you helped, the experiences, all the items you've acquired and feel fulfilled and appreciate the journey from the very beginning to the very end. would i play it again? not unless i feel nostalgic."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-27,"i've played through this game nineteen times. the meadows, the traversal, the wonderful character moments of bonding... worst game i ever played. 710."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-25,its refreshing to see dunkey give the strandlike genre another try
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-24,somehow dunkey can make a 10 minute video that has more depth than 40 minute analysis videos
Action,Death Stranding,2024-09-18,i like how the most replayed part is a dog bark
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-24,didn't like base game. didn't like director's cut  ign
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,death stranding is the perfect example of a game you'll either love or hate.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,"damned if you do, damned if you dont. they literally fixed your complaints about the game and you complain that they fixed them."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,it's hilarious ign got the same guy to play the directors cut.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-16,"carrying boxes were boring initially, but once the story picked up , it had a meaning. the way this story unfolded slowly and the well designed maps made this game a strange and beautiful experience.."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,"he enjoyed it less, yet reviewed it higher. that makes perfect sense."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,ign in 2019 delivering cargo is too tough. 6.8 ign in 2021 you made deliveries too easy now. that defeats the purpose of the game. 7.0
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,we all know cod vanguard is going to get 910 by ign
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,shits on the original for being too uncompromising. shits on the director's cut for making compromises. alrighty.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-07,who's here because it just dropped on xbox?
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,making the same guy who reviewed death stranding playthrough this again must be some inside joke at ign.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,my advise to ppl watching this review video is to mute the sounds and watch the video. if you like what you see then you will like the game. if you dont then you dont.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-27,"death stranding is a hard sell for this generation of energy drink slamming, high intensity multiplayer, three monitor twitch livestream setup gamers. their attention span is too far gone."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,"damned if you do, damned if you don't the ign review"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,"ign 2019 death stranding is a interesting, but repetitive game that can feel overly frustrating and lack satisfaction due to finicky controls and complex gameplay mechanics. 610 ign 2021 death stranding directors cut feels too easy and doesnt give you the same level of satisfaction as the original game apparently, the new accessibility features make the game less of a challenge which hurts the directors vision. 710. oh yeah, its big brain time. also, nice job barely covering things like remastered graphics, haptic feedback, and overall replayability for returning gamers to the title. you know, literally 90 of why we are all here."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,"not going to lie, all the new tools you have for delivery should make the base game so much easier and faster."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,"this game was amazing, it's not suited for everyone, but to me it was a gem of his own"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,"this guy didnt like the game when it was cumbersome, and he still doesnt like it because he thinks it comprised the vision of the game. ok so its a lose lose lol."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-24,"this game is like two games in one, try getting s ranks in some of the more challenging deliveriesi think there is 500 of them. a big part of this game is about efficiency, yes you can deliver your cargo in not the greatest time and in pretty beat up condition and still continue on with the game. a lot of the challenge is about getting your cargo there in the best time, using the bestshortest routes, and getting it there in the best condition you can. for that you'll need to know the best toolsequipment to use, and plan out your routes carefully which adds massively to the challenge of this game."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,"literally just completed the storyline the other night. didnt play it for a whole year! fell inlove with this game again, cant wait for this ps5 version!!"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,"why would they not bring someone else in to do this review for a fresh perspective, we dont need this guys opinion again"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-24,nothing makes ign happy..... except deathloop
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,"cant believe its already been two years since this weird, yet incredible experience released."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-26,it'd be a really funny bit if ign made this guy rereview death stranding once a year lol
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-25,why does it have to be a compromise when someone fixes a mistake or changes their mind based on feedback? arrogance is not a virtue.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,the fact that ign didn't like it means its right up my alley
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,did the reviewer finish the game this time or is it just like in 2019 when you gave it a 6 and then we learned that the reviewer didn't even get past the 4th chapter?
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,"thanks for admitting with 40h fetch quest that you never played the game as intended. this game is much much longer if you play it like it should be played. and btw, wtf the same dude again? why? ign youre ridiculous sorry"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,lol imagine getting the guy who wrote the wildly unpopular original death stranding review to do the review of the directors cut...
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,"you all never give spoiler warnings and it is really annoying, digital foundry did a 20 minute review that was way better than this... step it up ign!"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,never follow reviews experience the game for yourself death stranding was an amazing experience definitely looking forward to dive back into the world with the director's cut on the ps5.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,"after finishing the game, if you find delivering boring then youre doing it wrong."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,if you vehemently despise death stranding without having ever played it your opinion is irrelevant.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,imagine giving deathloop a 10 with its laughable ai but this only a 7. madness
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,wow they've made it so hand holdy the whole point of the game is to traverse the terrain and deliver your parcels to a beautiful soundtrack and have the reward of achieving that goal yourself
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,maybe don't feed the reviewer a pound of lemons beforehand.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,the game makes more sense in the pandemic world
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,"wow ign give this game to the same review guy who didn't like it, bravo!"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-24,ign reviews never fail to make me laugh
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-24,praises the game for adding quality of life features then 3 seconds later proceeds to criticise it for changing.. 1010 for the most ign review ever.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-24,ign it was too difficult and tedious to delivery stuff. 2 years later... ign it is too easy and less strenuous to deliver stuff
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,this guy doesn't like fetch quests yet he gave snowrunners a 8?
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-24,"the original was almost a masterpiece, for me a 910. was definetly one of the best games ive played and completed, the last few hours were truelly epic!!!"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,this game is a 120h  game if you play it like kojima wanted from you to play it. the fact that you say its a 40h game just shows that you never played the game as intended with helping others and enjoying the multiplayer. this was already weird 2 years ago and should have been a review over time.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,complaining about how you couldnt secure a next gen console for 7 and a half minutes isnt a review
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,"being one of the few people who really liked this game, suggondeez"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,"like an artwork in a gallery, not everyone is going to like it and that is ok. that is what art does."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-26,"played through ds 2x, one of the very few masterpiece games imo in 30 years of gaming"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,"so answer me this if you clearly didnt like the game in the first place , why oh why would ign assign you to review the same game albeit improved, instead of getting a fresh pair of eyes on it with a new reviewer?..another baffling decision from the offices of ign"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-02-23,im just gonna leave this here im not trusting any of your reviews after you rated cyberpunk 2077 with a 9 rating before the game was even released and was prepatched. you guys lost your passion and integrity. bunch of sellouts
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,these reviews are supposed to be unbiased reviews based on the game and gameplay
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,death stranding  easy mode
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,"sounds like you simply don't want to like the game. for new dc content coverage 810, for sardonic review, 310."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,why couldn't someone else review director's cut? this dude clearly didn't like the game when it first released so why is he reviewing it again? seems unfair to me
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-27,so a guy that didnt like the game still doesnt like the game? lmao thanks ign. keep sliding into obscurity!
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,this guys a hater. so sarcastic.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-25,who's here after epic games announced it for free?
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,"so the same guy who rushed the review back then with skipping the multiplayer elements heart and souls of this game btw review the game again. wow. and guess what, he hates it. what a surprise. would hate it too without the main reason people love this game."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,let's balance the likes and dislikes on this video as well
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-23,you can tell this dude just wants to play games like gta and cod
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,seriously why is this guy reviewing this game?
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,this game is 1010 .
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,"you couldn't give it higher score because of your first review  this game is great and unique. most of open world games are boring for me but suprisngly death stranding wasn't, it was kinda addicting."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-07,not every game is for every one. they could've brought another reviewer to join or take over the review of the director's cut.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-25,"it's hilarous how people get upset about the repetitive gameplay in ds and then spend weeksmonthsyears in other games doing the same missions over and over just to have enough credits to buy some meaningless ingame item that just looks fancy. with ds, as so often in life, the journey is the destination. and that journey is both beautifully disturbing and soothing."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-04,"the reviewer gets his kicks out of being partial, and its amazing he still has a job with ign."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,here's some things that'll make your trips easier? me but why?
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,"one of the best game ever, and ign gives a 7."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,"just like the game itself , the likes and dislikes and comments for this review will be very divisive ."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,ign in the past 10 years is just brain dead zombie reviews
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,this game isn't perfect and had the potential to be amazing but you have to play it. you will never forget this game and won't regret playing it.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,"bro, you are one tough critic, the game has many improvements yet it barely budged your og score by mere two decimals."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,"yea this game isn't for everyone, we all know that. but this reviewer is just bad"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,maybe get another reviewer to do this? it would be nice to hear a different opinion even if it is still ign.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,how could you not enjoy this game??
Action,Death Stranding,2021-12-18,"it's a literal crime that ign let this guy review ds again. just keep him on cod and madden from now on, since cooming over bland regurgitated experiences seems to be his fort"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,imagine saying this masterpiece is 'okay'...
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,"should he have reviewed this again? he obviously didnt like it the first time, and he expressed how he thought the process was boring, but you let him review an expanded version of it? okay"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,death stranding is my favourite game of all time! beyond hyped for the director's cut. some of the new items included look game changing!
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,it is funny how the spoilers went according to the boredom of his review.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-26,everyones mad because he's right. the director's cut is just there to make it more appealing to casual players. the original is the director's cut.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,"why have the same person review it, just one critic"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-25,also walking from point a to b is darn long.. maybe the director's cut smoothen this a bit with a walker
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-24,"the most unique game of last generation, whether you like it or not you have to admit its pretty groundbreaking, ign are just gutted it isn't full of microtransactions."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,"why would this guy review death stranding? he never understood the main game, so why ought he do so again? once more, ign disappoints us, and shows how outoftouch it really is. 610 reviewer."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-01,this is one of my fav games of all time. directors cut is even better.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,"damned of you do , damned if you dont."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-28,identical logic destiny 2 is a phenomenally boring game. you're just shooting enemies over and over again.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,clown of a review in 2019 and a clown of a review in 2021  ign should not even have said anything about the dsdc
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-26,the die hardfan joke was actually pretty funny.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-24,this guy sadly doesn't understand the game. this game is a masterpiece in my opinion.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-11,shouldn't this kid be a toddler by now?
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,"you either love it or hate it. but for me, this game is going to stand against the test of time being how innovative it is."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-30,this is an example of a guy doing the wrong job
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-28,"i'msurprised this guy is still a reviewer. he seems to always find a fault with every game he reviews and even when they try to fix those supposed faults, he still ends up egging on them."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-24,"he gave the original a 6.8 because it was repetitive and tedious, but criticized the directors cut for trying to ease those things lmao."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,you seem to still be missing the point of half the game....its literally making the journey easier for other players ....this directors cut is a chance for players to experience the difference they made ....they are not consessions
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-01,"death stranding is absolutely amazing! it is so fresh, creative, the world is so detailed, amazing performances from the cast, the story, vibe, truly no other game quite like it, hideo kojima is a true creative genius. love the directors cut on ps5, the graphics look gorgeous."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-24,should have given 510 for trying to charge 70 again.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-05-15,its not surprising to me that ign put up this same clown to review this great game.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-18,i say this for everyone that played this game but there is absolutely no better feeling than when someone elses zipline connects perfectly within your network. the fact the game even lets you create proper infrastructure is incredible
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-22,one day i saw a guy with a bridges sticker on his notebook and all i said to him was keep on keeping on. he instantly knew what i meant and it was cool sharing a moment where we both had this shared understanding of a different world and all the hazards in it
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-19,"i like to think die hardman was named that way because he was named after the greatest romance, drama, action, intrigue, thriller, and christmas movie of all time, die hard."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-08-26,"another impressive coincidence is that in danish strand literally means beach. and considering mads mikkelsen is danish, i cant imagine that coincidence being lost on kojima making strand essentially have at least three meanings stranded alone, connected by a strand, and a beachbridgeway."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-10,all im saying is that the second they started playing low roar as you're walking during the intro i was hooked forever
Action,Death Stranding,2023-08-07,"can i just point out that this game was release just as the world was gripped in covid. the message of this game hit me harder during those times. the lock downs, the social distancing everything. kojima has the timing of a saint."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-18,"ashen hollow put out an hour long video, wendigoon released a 5 hour analysis and now gingy comes in with a massive death stranding video?! what a lovely week."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-18,"it's only just now occurring to me that while i heard plenty of criticisms and complaints about this game, i've literally never heard anything about the story of this game, which so far i find absolutely fascinating."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-12-09,"kojima may be an oddball with a lot of unusual ways to convey his ideas, but people often forget how intelligent he is. 22 years ago mgs2 nearly perfectly predicted the absolute mess of misinformation the modern internet has become long before most people could even imagine such concepts. the man has a thorough understanding of humanity, both its virtues and deep flaws, and isn't afraid to try new things."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-30,"thank you so much for 1. making this detailed video. 2. appreciating it's uniqueness. 3. recognizing that it's not for everyone. 4. emphasizing on the messaging behind the game. be a rope, not a stick! keep on keeping on!"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-19,"i think the goofy names are reasonable if you consider the whole premise of the game being rebuilding america using historical means like courier services and such, like there were many civilizations and cultures that only used last names to differentiate who had which role, like smith or brewer or archer."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-30,"honestly this game coming out during the pandemic was such a wild thing. the game came out during a time where these messages of connection were most important, and i am so curious as to where the sequel will go with these ideas. death stranding is a fantastic game, and while i can understand people not liking it and even hating it for the issues it does have, it is still an unforgettable experience and honestly one of my favorite games of all time."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-19,"the reason the drawn heart is important for the voidouts and heartman is because it's originally the symbol for a couple or two hearts conjoining. meaning, it's another symbol for connections."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-10-13,"i like how during the higgs fight, it's really easy to take him out with just the rope and standing out in the open. stick vs. rope was pretty much a hint on how to make the fight easier instead of trying to match him in typical combat"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-01,"3929 people don't realize this is a callback to metal gear solid 1, where a bomb is placed in your inventory without any notification. if you don't see it and get rid of it, you will just randomly explode with no explanation."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-18,i love kojima's naming conventions. cia director hot coldman is a legendary name and i will die on that hill.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-06,"never played the game but the part where you said people can help each other really intrigues me. it almost seems like it subconsciously brings out the best side in you that just want to help others. that is genius, nice kojima"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-18,"i think one of my favorite bits of this game was about a week after i finished it i went around the mountain i planned on platniuming it with the ziplines and connected as many together as possible as to almost make a spider web across the whole thing, made it so you can get from a small outcropping behind the mountain base all the way to the evodevo biologist then back to the timefall farm all with ziplines and then i spent a couple days making myself my own little outpost and upgrading all that stuff to level 3, it was all a great time imo"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-06-28,i love this game so freaking much. this is probably the only game i've ever played that made me cry at the end. the bb theme is still in my playlist and i occasionally return to it.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-09-25,regarding the question of why fragile didnt die in time fall. she was wearing a tank top which covered her organs and if time fall returns to water after hitting something then her core body and organs are all probably the same age as her face. only her legs and arms would be aged.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-18,been waiting for this one. kojima has such an interesting mind with creating stories and even just game concepts in general. death stranding and mgs are both some of the most batshit crazy stories of any game series ive ever played and its both hilarious and amazing
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-23,"its very rare these days for modern games to actually make me feel something in this case death stranding made me feel gratified, scared, thrilled, confused, deeplysaddened, nostalgic, exhilarated, relaxed, heartbroken, and seen.. amongst many other emotions. i completed the game 3 times over and yet i still find myself coming back. i wonder whats in store for ds2"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-26,"i've always feel that this game in reality is about kojima after his fallout with konami and how he could his life back together thanks to all the connections and friendships he made during his career. is a love letter to his friends, to thank them for their support, and that's why all of them they show up one way or another in the game."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-11,the fact that this game is never discussed in the best dads in gaming is criminal. god of war is great and all but i never felt that the boy was in danger. this game you and bb go through hell in back and the fact that i would try to find somewhere to hide in combat to calm him down is insane. it adds so much extra stress in already tense moment. i also love the fact he starts laughing at random moments like saving yourself from falling over or peeing off the side of the mountain. its was a blast to have they adventure with the lil man.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-12-09,this is a great video. i just finished the game and wanted a bit more contextanalysis to make sure i really understood everything i had just played. thanks for all the effort you put into making this
Action,Death Stranding,2023-05-14,"this is the most incredible game i've played in the last 20 years of gaming. it moved me, shocked me, and stayed with me. death stranding changed me. it's left a permanent mark on me. i'll always remember the importance and intricacy of connection. and how connections affect the world."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-05-13,did everyone just miss that amelie's name is the most egregious play on words in the game? in her final credit monologue on the beach she says that her name comes from french ame meaning soul and lie because she doesn't exist.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-26,"you did a great job with this entire video. one tiny nitpick is you breezed over the end when lou comes out of its pod, cuz that sht was so damn emotional. that was the heaviest moment for me, i thought lou was actually dead, and could not believe it when she came back. it was beautifully paced"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-07-17,"it's been like 23 years since i watched a similar recap, and boy did i need to watch this one today. great video."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-06-13,"i've always love how i feel not alone in a single player games i've always dislike multiplayer games especially competitive one since i feel awkward and it's just not my thing, but dark souls messaging and death stranding strandtype mechanics really fits right in my heart. like those moment you shout and other sams would shout back. snowy mountains feel so lonely at times and shouting always reminds me how i'm not alone there. also shout out to low roar, rip ryan karazija, you'll be missed."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-19,"i have played through this twice. love it. especially the way music cues start in certain areas. and both times, i made sure to get my highways built and lay down some useful ziplines for others."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-19,"the weather station is worse than you think, the weather never changes. when playing a story mission nomatter what you do there will be a storm blocking your path, and if you are doing side quests the weather just never moves. i once hid under a rock for a storm to pass and waited a real life hour and the weather never changed."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-10,"in the directors cut where you discover the abandoned factory. i can't believe no one is talking about this, but the flowers at the end of that scene are called blue birds  acronym bb, which is also the one used in the game to define bridge babies ! they're an indirect reference to the dramatic boss' sacrifice in metal gear solid 3. those were white lilies though, shaped similarly, but different flowers. and it was still an almost maternal sacrifice for her pupil, naked snake. within the death stranding universe, as you know, coffin fragile's mother  formed a rebel group opposing to bridge's cruel bb research and actual children sacrifices. she also revealed in the hologram record that she urged peter englert a.k.a. higgs to protect her daughter, as she considered him as a son, fragile's brother! this is a quite shocking revelation, as neither fragile nor higgs ever saw this message it all grows even more dramatic. fragile and higgs thought that coffin left, suddenly and selfishly. they didn't know she was trying to save the bbs. higgs, unaware of this fraternal duty, and defied by amelie, will nuke middle knot city. he will betray coffin's will forcing fragile to sacrifice herself and heroically save south knot city. in the final message left for fragile, coffin said my daughter. my sole remaining glimmer of hope. our future may be broken, but it's not beyond repair. futures are fragile things, but my daughter's made of stronger stuff. she has what it takes to pick up the pieces and put them back together again. i hope. i pray fragile's uniform also became a lot more blue at the end of the game. you already know that the inverted rainbow in death stranding is missing the colour blue because its reality is fragile and cracked, missing the tranquillity of the blue to create harmony in the world. you've also seen that the game is filled with references to america's origins and spiritual native american themes e.g., the dream catcher. another prominent native american symbol e.g., in navajo, cherokee, and iroquois is the bluebird totem, considered a symbol of hope, love, and renewal, announcing the spring season, a new hopeful future through familiar love. thus, i confidently believe this was the reason why the delicate  fragile blue bird flowers were chosen by kojima for that colossal cutscene at the end of the ruined factory! may you all keep on keeping those radiant connections, porters! peace"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-02-26,"amazing video. i cant get enough of this style of video. breaking down a story and themes from a game i have completed and thought about far too much. great information, and you literally cover the entire game beat by beat. i know how much work this must have taken and i appreciate it. one critique though, you say animals arent sentient, and thats totally not the case."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-29,"i had a different experience with the trek back across the country after the boss fight i had built a nice network of roads and zip lines on the way, and the trip back made me so glad i had."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-19,"i've played this game during quarantine and i really felt the connection, i had a lot of time obviously so i really appreciated most of the details. it felt refreshing in the beginning and i enjoyed the gameplay loop"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-20,"im so glad to hear that you ended up liking the game. it was such a unique experience, and it makes the sequel even more enticing for me. you summed it up so well, especially some of the tricker aspects that might stump others. great work!"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-08-16,"played it twice, platinumed it twice, read the books, and i still think about this game all the time. it obsessed me just as much as bloodborne did, which is saying a lot. i understand why many people don't find this game attractive at all, but to me it's almost perfection."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-10-05,"10827 although animals differ greatly from humans, and in death stranding, regardless of whether an extinction entity ee must recognize life and death as we perceive it in order to exist, ill try to help and provide some clarity to your question. while bridget was on the verge of death, her ka, amelie, revealed that she had somehow separated from her ha, which allowed her to think independently and begin continuingdeveloping cognitive thinking outside the physical world in a special way. this separation led her to ponder deeper questions and sparked new thoughts, such as whether viewing extinction as a chance for renewal was truly an opportunity worth embracing. amelie, without her ha, appeared to surrender her choice regarding extinction, making it real through her cognitive growth and a deeper awareness of connection. hartman states that species have strands but does not specify them as physical umbilical cords. regarding animals and dinosaurs in the past, and of whether a species had physical umbilical cords, some may have shown high potential for developing complex traits, such as tactical thinking, social cognition, problemsolving, and spatial awareness along with parental care. also, some displayed vocal and visual behaviors, indicating pathways toward complex communication, situational awareness, and early signs of cognitive development mesozoic era csikisava et al., 2018. what i mean is that im not suggesting this as a direct answer to your question, but rather as a framework to ask a right question, which might be what level of cognitive ability does an extinction entity ee need in order to exist?. nice breakdown in the video. cheers."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-19,"this was a great breakdown and analysis of the story. i've watched so many of these kinds of videos, but your pacing, voice, and insight felt fresh and unique. specifically as you dove into the more reallife similarities or analogies like the egyptian callbacks."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-19,"i find it interesting that higgs during his boss fight, in one of his moves, he hugs sam. is that since he's borrowing amalie's power is that she took brief control of him to hug sam? i know i might be reaching but this game is interesting to dissect and look at all the thing it offers."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-27,"10910 given how amelie seems to innately understand her purpose as an ee, maybe the previous ees also had an understanding of death and what they were to do despite being animals"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-09-29,"i cannot emphasis how unexpected it was for me to fall in love with this game. i was avoiding it when it first came out, echoing other people saying, it's just a walking sim, until finally trying it about four years after its launch when at the time i had zero games to play. i loaded it up, made it past the first hour and and decided to keep going. after hour 3, it was needless to say that i was completely hooked."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-05-25,"not sure if anyone explained this, but the implication is that only ees have beaches. amelie broke the laws of nature by granting repatriation to sam, which in turn caused access to the beach across spacetime. her actions, motivated by guilt, rewrote the way the universe works which accelerated her role in bringing the stranding. it's why her beach is likened to the heart, fueling the other beaches."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-25,"this game had some weird timing, i was playing it during the pandemic, when connections gained more meaning and i could see these connections having an impact during my playthrough. loved it from start to finish."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-18,"it's happened he's actually made a strandtype story analysis in all seriousness, this game benefited heavily from hindsight. in the years after the game came out, i think we've come to more deeply value the connections we've made, and that makes the game's themes resonate more."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-30,"this game is definitely a mixed bag gameplay wise but it was relaxing and pretty meditative at times, although i preferred the deliveriestraversal to the combat. the story was very engrossing and i really loved the characters, world and lore. even sam with his fear of being touched was interesting. the moment where dont be so serious plays was one of the most memorable moments in a game for me, much like the first ride through mexico in the best red dead redemption game. i am a sucker for music sequences like that i guess"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-07-01,"so glad to have found someone who summarized this story and helped fill in some of the blanks i made.. amazing work, i'm going to have to check out more of yours lol..."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-22,man watching this made me realise how different my play through was from you. i almost had none of the frustrations you had with missions except the last mission where you have to travel from one edge of the map to the other
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-24,"the igor death scene will always be one of my favorite cutscenes. it's just such a cool intro, all the worldbuilding and terminology reminded me so much of the matrix and why i fell in love with that franchise too. stoked for the sequel. this game also dropping months before covid was such a fucking trip, kojima is a prophet disguised as a game dev lol. i fell in love with the soundtrack so much i started using it during my runs and lowkey pretended i'm sam making a delivery. this game legitimately is a masterpiece even though people think that's someone being sarcastic whenever it's said. haven't played a game this immersive since, what an experience. great video!"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-05-25,"this is one of my retirement games. in 70 years when im allowed to retire, im going to have at least three or four years to catch up with cool games like these before i die. going to be so much fun."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-05-23,"gingy, id like to inform you that you have inspired me to experience death stranding for myself. and it was the first game in a long time that a game had me glued to it until 100 completionseriously it took like 2 weeks, id play all day sometimes without even noticing. it gives me hope for death standing 2 and i hope kojima and his team can hook me again! thanks for the content man, look forward to new vids!"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-09-12,death stranding feel like the brief moment after you wake up from a fever dream and you try to remember what you were dreaming about.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-09-29,after just playing through the directors cut for the first time and absolutely loving every second i have 1 regret about the time i spent playing and it is that i didnt help more with construction. i was so thankful and felt so satisfied when someone elses construct directly helped me but i got so caught up that i didnt leave enough around for the next person to feel the same about mine.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-18,about damn time we get a video about death stranding.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-19,"an amazing video with some insightful information on the world and details of it. having played through it a couple of times i knew most of this, but the higgs pizza delivery and his pharaoh cloak design was actually new to me. all in all, i quite enjoyed your analysis of the story."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-20,i played this game during the height of lockdown. playing a game about isolation of humanity hits pretty hard when you yourself are isolated and wanting to contact your best friend but can't because of a world ending event.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-02,"941 i find this a pretty strange take. between the beautiful scenery, crazy plot, and figuring out how all the very novel gameplay mechanics worked, i was hooked!"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-10-17,"one little detail to point out. going necro does not cause a voidout when the ka of the body attempts to rejoin the ha. the body is dead but it produces a bt from the now stranded ka. bt's need live bodies to produce a voidout, and aren't inherently eveil. they're stranded and trying to get back to a body so they seek out living people and reach out to them, thus the hand symbol. if people are properly burned, they don't get stranded and no new bt's are made. mama would not have gone necro as her ka was severed with her baby. bridget strand, also, would not have gone necro when she dies, but nobody would have known that at the time of her death. her ka is amile and as such can't be stranded and become a bt. it's possible in game to watch this process happen with a dead body in a mule camp. the bt comes from the dead body and causes a voidout by going to the nearest human. if the body goes necro on the map while you aren't around, the bt will go for the nearest human, but it is possible to kill sever the bt's connection to the living the bt if you are around."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-26,"thank you so much for brining this game to light! it was absolutely amazing and there aren't enough videos that explain how complex and unusual this story is, keep up the great work!"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-19,"from what i recall about the weather, it was either always the same in certain areas or it was inevitably pre planned to trigger for certain parts of missions. this was without fail, if i remember. i remember spending a lot of time trying to figure out what the point of the menu etc was since it was always the same regardless."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-20,i've been a fan of your content for a little while now and i'm beginning to appreciate your videos more and more. getting insight into these games that i would never be able to complete myself i get bored and learning about the stories behind them in this format is quality.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-10-25,"i have an immense respect for hideo kojima and his works. i call him the most insane game developer as he creates stories and experiences that nobody would dare to try in this age of hands on, 60100 gigabyte goliath gaming experiences. he breaks the mold that we've grown accustomed to with the most batshit, feverish yet unforgettable concepts in different ways. anyways uh, i hyperfixation rambled on enough . great video gingy!"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-11-26,i'm in love this game boat  thank you for the recap! will be very handy when we get part two
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-23,"i'm pretty sure the reason why fragile didn't die in the timefall is the same reason why only some of sam's hair turned white instead of all of it. the timefall effect only seems to apply to whatever it comes into contact with, and doesn't seem to penetrate super deep before the timefall turns back into regular water...or else machines would break immediately when timefall touches them and effects more delicate components, rather than rapidly rusting before breaking. my interpretation of it was always that fragile had just extremely old skin from that situation, maybe some very aged muscles. hence why she can still walk around without moving like she has arthritis. the reason she acts like she's not got much time left might just be that she doesn't have long before her skin will die, or become riddled with cancer, due to localised extremely advanced ageing."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-19,the moment between sam and cliff was great. cliff and his story made the whole ridiculousness of the game worth it.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-05-25,i really liked the strange goofy naming conventions in this game. the world is supposed to be scattered and disconnected so everyone using these weird pseudonym names fits perfectly. using your own name is an opening for personal connection and it makes sense that people in the narrative want to keep it to themselves. also cause kojima is a goofball lmao. god i need to replay this game before 2 comes out
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-08,"death stranding is one of those games i'm super interested in knowing what's going on but not interested in the slightlest to play, thanks for the vid."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-17,"wow gingy, this just showed up in my algorithm. what a competent and indepth analysis. it's criminal that you don't have more subs, you now have one more in me. i hope your videos find their way to others too."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-19,"great vid! i really liked how you explained the function of the princess beach part in the story. i could never put into words why despite it being cringy, it was clearly fully intentional and was there for a reason but i was never able to articulate why."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-24,"the way i interpreted cliff's fate was that all soldiers share the ww2 beach due to the sheer volume of people who died in such a short time under similar conditions. statistically, the majority of war deaths in the past few hundred years were in ww1 and 2. like how heartman shared a beach with all the people who died near him, except on such a large scale that it not only brings nearby people into the same beach but people in similar situations across time. maybe after enough time some of those people will get tired of fighting or move on, and things will change again. or maybe if there were a conflict with even greater loss of life the beach would change to match that setting."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-24,"death stranding is a great game and i'm happy i've played it. it is a game and story that could not escape my brain even years after. i played it in peak covid  isolation, nobody to visit, everyone shut down. it hit very hard sometimes. great video to summarize the game, thank you!"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-05,"that part where you talk about lucy and higgs's backstories was a mindblown moment for me. as someone who played through this game without reading any of the emails or text material you picked up, hearing you talk about all this backstory while being 50mgs of edibles high i thought i losing my goddamn mind and made me wonder if i completely missed an entire sections of the game that explained that if i had wiped them out of memory."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-06-27,"first game in a while that made me actually not get bored, people say they find it boring and what now but for whatever reason but this game gave me the most fun, im now currently playing it for the first time and man am i loving it."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-02-16,kojima never disappoints.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-05,if kojima wants to make a movie i'll watch it. itll probably be a movie consisting of mads mikkelsen smoking cigarettes for 5 hours but i don't care. let kojima cook.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-07-07,"in my opinion, the delivery missions were the best part of the game. yeah this is what divides people, but they are why i still play the game even after beating the story and maxing out every prepper star rating. i love the feeling of getting kitted up, loading cargo and setting out on my own into the frontier to deliver stuff. especially in the mountains, where pathfinding becomes a lot more difficult and you need to be creative about it. you do need to get into the role playing aspect of it to get something out of the deliveries, i think."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-24,"gingy, ur content is so clean"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-04,"what a well done video. thank you, gingy! it's been a while since i played ds and this was not only an excellent story recap recap sounds reductive but a fantastic analysis."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-18,"i love this game, when i first got it i was excited like never before...it wasn't what u expected it to be but what i got was still incredible and such an experience that you'll won't find anywhere else on any game exclusive. this will go down as one of my favorite games of all time."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-06-15,"one of my biggest pet peeves in general is wasting time what a weird thing to say considering this game is all about patience, planning, management, and experiencing the environment and atmosphere. while the core gameplay is certainly not timewasting, it's not exactly meant for people who wouldn't be able to stand taking the extra time for instance to take a longer, safer route or spend an extra minute or two in the menus checking gear and cargo loadout. how strange to think that someone could play manage to play through the entire game and yet not have the patience to watch even the qpid cutscenes. personally i enjoyed the brief moments the various short cutscenes and animations provided to relax after every successful trip or delivery. that's not to say i never skipped anything i did plenty of times. but you make it sound like in your experience these animations were such an annoyance that it warrants, in your own words ...definitely a discussion to be had about how much time this game wastes of yours..."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-06-11,"the craftsman is actually really useful to have, as he will gift you custom hematic grenades which pack a real punch. they can take down gold bts with one hit, and multiple bts at once. i've taken a giant bt down with a single custom hematic grenade. the engineer will gift you power legs, the chiral artists mother will gift you chiral boots which will last you forever, the junk dealer gifts you chiral ladders and the collector will gift you the backpack cover which you'll certainly need when you head up to mountain knot city. never underestimate the preppers."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-08-12,as someone that just finished the main story and read every single interview. thank you for clarifying soooo many things. cool video
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-19,"in the first few hours of the game, there was a giant hill you had to climb up, when you hit the top one of the many amazing sound tracks kicked in. this game is truly one of a kind."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-06-18,an absolutely phenomenal story analysis. thank you for your hard work!
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-19,"i played this game twice, love all 60 hours between both runs. cant wait for ds2."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-19,great video. hope you'll do one on returnal. story was very impactful and one of the more deep meaning stories i've seen in a game.

Action,Death Stranding,2023-08-13,"i'm grateful i found gingys channel, this is some of the most satisfying video game journalism i've witnessed"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-16,"man, i cant believe i just sat through a 1.5hour video about death stranding and loved every second of it. now im itching to play it again before ds2 drops. damn you, good content!"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-19,"i like the game enough to get the platinum on ps. although the gameplay is put to debate if you like it or not, the story is good. and don't forget the music. one part of the game when you on a delivery walk the camera is zoom out and the music start to play feels epic to me. i appreciate this story video because i can recall the story again. since, to be honest death, stranding is not a game you might want to play multiple time. so thank you."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-08,"wow, what an opening statement, you sure drew me! death stranding is an unforgettable game because i simply cannot forget about it..."

Action,Death Stranding,2023-08-21,"this game is actually probably one of my favourite games of all time. was great reliving this story, well done!"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-05-04,i spent like 8 hours building an elaborate zip line system through the mountains and i know only 1 or 2 would have gotten it on their side but i tried to make each on optimal and easily connectable to another person without the others. i was basically done. i know i had a few things with a tons of limes and i really felt good knowing i helped. especially charging stations that played songs i thought would be good in the area. game only got better in my mind the further away i got from playing it. i wont play it again other than to see if people voted up my stuff
Action,Death Stranding,2023-08-12,i heard a theory that the reason why people always repeat instructions to the player was because they don't have any one else to talk to

Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-16,"it's crazy that kojima can make a game that ties every loose end well enough to understand every insane twist and turn, and still yet, make you feel like you need to watch an analysis afterward"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-07-29,"i loved this game, i'm a huge scifi fan and this story was so interesting and it could of been a movie but being able to play it instead of just watching. this game is an experience, it has its flaws, but all around i've never played anything like it and i don't think there will ever be anything like it again. building all the roads collectively on my server was awesome. i started it by making the first 2 but once i started asking for the materials by the next day the entire highway stretched across the entire country and that was so awesome to have done, did it on the 2nd playthrough though. thanks for covering this one!"

Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-02,"after all of these years of cryptic messages, sci fi spectacle and philosophical themes the game is finally revealed to be... ...the struggles of a fedex delivery man."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-09,to understand the game and sam you have to walk a mile in his shoes its not easy to explain but by playing the game youre heavily incentivized to create paths for other people to use. to collaborate with other players on building roads. to interact and be supportive of other players. but most importantly to do very difficult tasks alone. its a game that wants to relay the very specific emotion of being alone. and also the systems in the game are incredible!
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-10,it really makes you feel like a mailman
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-03,imagine youre actually a delivery man in real life and play this game when you're at home
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-03,let's consider for a moment the reception of this game had it not been made by kojima.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-09-25,"just finished this game and honestly loved it. if you're feeling lonely and the pandemic is taking its toll, this game is hugely comforting. it was a breath of fresh air and i hope more people give it a chance"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-08,he wasn't kidding when he said that death stranding will be its own genre...
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-04,i figured this would happen when one of the biggest gameplay reveal is all about ladders.

Action,Death Stranding,2025-02-20,"just finished the game after 4 months and i loved it, this game is way more than just delivering packages, the atmosphere, the tension, the cinematics, the story, etc. its just perfect one of the best videogame ive ever played in my life"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,death stranding struggle of the fedex employee
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-02,gran turismo the real driving simulator death stranding the real delivery simulator
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,game gets a 9  you're just corporate shills game gets a 6.8 you're just being contrarian for clicks lol ign can't catch a break. also this people take reviews way to personally. especially when there's a game that has a ludicrous amount of hype behind it.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-11-09,"one of my favourite games of all time. meditative, explorative, spiritual and amazing"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,"it's like winning a food fight, and the prize is a mop and a bucket. ooof."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-24,"death stranding was supposed to connect and bond people together with strands, but it ultimately divided people. the sweet sweet irony."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-18,"delivery guy during coronavirus, now kojima predict the future"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-16,"the game is in between, its like everyone loves it and hates it."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-03,"atleast the reviewer was honest and bold enough to not let kojimas reputation influence him. this does not seem to be fun and he has said it like it is, truthfully."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,for a game that is about connecting people death stranding is very divisive.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-02-25,sure the entire game is a glorified fetch quest. i dont think anyone here will deny that. but its not monotonous like a fetch quest. the experience feels different and when you actually make the delivery you feel validated as if youve achieved something. you just survived climbing a ghost infested mountain with rain that will kill you to deliver a pizza. its silly and fun and the feeling you get when you see an s rank with all those like is a pure dopamine rush. maybe next time focus less on what youre doing and more on what the experience of what youre doing brings you.

Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-14,to say this game is just one long fetch quest is as reductive as saying metroid is about shooting aliens in a deserted planet.

Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-02,i gotta say ......... this seems like the most honest ign review in a while. i cant hate.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-08,"so we finally understand what death stranding is about...in wake of the recent apocolypse, you create the competitor to amazon's delivery service. sounds like a great game alright."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-05-16,"i was walking in the park today, i saw a mushroom so i gave it a like ."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-08,"to the people that liked this game, if kojima didnt make this game, if it were a disliked company like bethesda or ubisoft that made this game and charged you 50 to deliver packages, there is no way in hell youd be making excuses and speak fondly of it. you know its the truth."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-05,it's cool that it's something different....but it really does look boring as hell.

Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,this is going to be the most polarizing game of 2019
Action,Death Stranding,2020-04-03,death stranding was way ahead of time. kojime said this game is the future. now humanity is caged in their homes due to coronavirus. and this hiking simulator helps us remember how walking outside was like.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-05,this game was just a test of loyalty to the cult of kojima. judging from the dislikes he made his point.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-13,it really makes you feel like an uber eats delivery man
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,"lmao, people are getting mad that this guy didnt give a game they havent played a 10 out of 10"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-04-12,we must keep the likes balanced or the world will come to an end in 2021.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-04,this probably should have been a movie
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-07,so many people disliking the video because he's actually being honest of how he felt about the game instead of calling it the best game for reasons that dont make sense. great job ign for giving 1 of the few honest reviews
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-13,this games reviews are so incredibly mixed that even the likes and dislikes are the same
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-30,they giving concord a 710 lmao

Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,i never thought that a kojima game could make an ign review sound like an angry joe rant.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,this game looks like the behind the scenes crew simulator of the lord of the rings
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-17,this game gets better and better the longer you play it. ending made me cry.

Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,i came just to see the dislikes.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-04,the part where he trips and loses his entire inventory and how you have to hold the triggers and balance yourself just to move was enough for me. no thanks.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-08-26,"likes 49k dislikes 49k perfectly balanced, as all things should be."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-04,this game is deserves it's own south park episode.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,i don't remember the last time i've been so focused on a review. shocked at the score.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,amazon delivery courier on acid the game
Action,Death Stranding,2022-09-26,the guy that reviewed this definitely didnt finish the game.....
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-03,what are these dislikes. the reviewer literally shows us whats wrong with the game. i dont like ign either but this review seems fine.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-03,i can see myself saying watch out for that hill!! and crashing all the way down. balancing simulator 2019
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-02,"having a neutral stance on kojima, meaning i won't deify everything he touches, i don't find anything wrong with this review. it's very coherent, unbiased and objective to me, if all the things talked about are really like this in the game, then the game does look very disappointing. did the 19k people who disliked this, did so because they didn't like the review structure or did so because of a childish belief that kojima didn't do anything bad? because all i see are immature reactions to something you still have no clue about, the game isn't out for the rest of the world."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-10-30,"gamers we're tired of these boring fetch quests, give us something new and creative ! kojima hold my ladder !"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,he both literally and metaphorically urinated on this game
Action,Death Stranding,2024-03-22,i disagree with you about not using roads. the goal is to reconnect america and roads are a vital element especially when the character is delivering stuff.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-11-09,"i think the worst part of death stranding is how it was seemingly marketed. it has a somewhat complex story and engaging cut scenes and characters, but the pr for the game was mostly walk around and try not to fall. it took me years before actually picking it up and now i think it's one of the better games i've ever played, tbh."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-17,"yeah, finding that one randomly placed generator from another player when your trike is just about to die is awesome! but literally having to dodge randomly dumped and often very colorful trucks and trikes from other players gets old real quick. even once had a trike blocking my route... like, you needed a pretty good amount of momentum to scale this one steep and rocky hillside, only to crash into a trike parked on top of that hillside and rolling back downhill..."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-13,i loved making hard things mundane. taking a truck and running routes to get 5 stars
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,i was a delivery driver for 6 years and i lost my baby. so this game resonates with me. ive played through it on 3 different consoles multiple times. i love this game so much. it is certainly a niche game though. the average person wouldnt understand or like this game.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-05-07,"i did a lot of hikes in the military and what are called ruck runs, meaning we ran with large and very heavy packs on our back. grabbing both straps to balance yourself is very realistic though and i have no issue with it. you move much slower this way, just as i remember during the ruck runs, but have much better balance and it makes going down or up steep terrain much easier. i'm only 10 hours into the game but i love it and this little feature felt very realistic."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-11-09,"i liked this a lot, and i'm also a big believer in setting your own rules when playing a game. the first time i played ac4 black flag i totally ignored all fast traveling, forcing me to get used to 'life at sea' and finding things along the way to objectives. for ds i'm interested to try this method. i also thought the roads were a bit of a bittersweet reward, as they pretty much remove what's interesting about the game. same with ziplines, which are even less engaging to use. the one thing i think roads do well is to communicate, through gameplay, the idea of humanity ironically beginning to lose its connections all over again even after the reconstruction has begun. it's a very effective representation of the kuralt quote, the interstate highway system is a wonderful thing. it makes it possible to go from coast to coast without seeing anything or meeting anybody."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-05,"this is great man. i love the gameplay to bits but my no.1 issue with it from a postgame perspective is that it becomes a matter of going through menus to select an order, pressing x a couple times as i watch sam fly across my perfect zip line network, and repeat. i thoroughly enjoyed creating that network, but the only delivery i truly remember was the one that takes you to your first waystation after capital knot where i had to bring a ladder and a climbing rope. as rewarding as the roads and zip lines are, they minimalize your engagement with the game to a silly degree. matthewmatosis put it well in his review if you've watched it. the absence of obstacles that are impossible to pass without the right tools, or at least cause more than a minor inconvenience, put less emphasis on preparation, and creativity then suffers also. despite their usefulness, i never once built a bridge or ramp why would i when i've already built a road? if i wanted to load a van up with packages and drive to my destination, i'd work for amazon. some of the gameplay suggestions you bring up have crossed my mind a couple times as i work towards my true 100 of the game, but going offline is a great idea too. when i eventually and inevitably replay the game, i will almost certainly avoid roads and zip lines at the very least. let's just hope ds2 leans more into its gameplay without offering so many ways to avoid engaging with it."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-28,"the only suggestion i have is to remove structures that have no practical purpose  like bridges in the middle of nowhere, and structures that have a better alternative"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-26,"i completely disagree. i think taking away the roads, weapons and shared buildings take away from the spirit of the game, which is life is easier together, make connections and share the burden. what i experience when i rebuild the roads is a sense of awe, this is what made modern society so much better to live in than the past. no longer does a delivery take ages, a perilous journey with little delivered, its now safe and expedient. by just going at it alone, sure, it becomes a challenge, but to me, death stranding is about the initial challenge becoming easier with a little help from strangers."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-16,"the guy doesn't like to use the bolas gun cuz it makes mule encounters easier, but then he uses a weapon that knocks out 4 at a time lol"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-10,"the online is great, until you first meet mama, who says shes been alone and had no visitors, only to pull up and see 5 vehicles parked out front like were about to do a casting couch scene ."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-11-18,i'm doing a replay of the game it'll take me 3 days to do it but the story is worth it by god ill rebuild the fuckin highway again even if it kills me
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-20,"i just beat the game for the first time, after having given up on it halfway through the first time 4 years ago. i didnt see as nearly as many roads, and the mountains were severely lacking in zip lines  other structures! made me kinda sad im loving the post game. i have so many materials at so many centers ive been spending like wildfire!! its made getting 5star relationships soooooooo much easier. i feel bad for people who quit when vehicles were no longer viable! 80 of the gameplay to be had is on foot in my opinion."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-09-10,"i think that when hideo said it was a brand new genre he didn't mean it in a condescending artsy way but in the sense that you have to really give it a chance and reach chapter 3 to see if it clicks with you, it can be a game where you just deliver packages and optimize cargo but there's so much more to play with, so many game mechanics and systems  and the idea of connecting with other players and helping each other out has never been done on this scale with this budget before, its a very solitary and introspective game"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-14,"i find the roads a reward. ultimately once youve passing a difficult path time and time again trying to balance your cargo. having a road to link that area becomes a god send! after all youve already crossed that path times before on foot and solved its complexity. not sure where you find the line in just holding the accelerator to following the same hike path youve already done that takes 10x as long. each to their own i guess, as long as you find enjoyment thats all that matters. think we can all agree the idea of using a baby to connect both worlds is the strangest move in all of gaming. super odd! but overall an outstanding game."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-15,"the correct way to play a game is in a way that makes you happy. i work a 12 hr a day 5 day a week, stressful job, have 4 kids and a mortgage. this game is a godsend for me, the music is perfect, the scenery is gorgeous and the story is 2nd to none. its challenging and decent in length. gameplay is a 5th or 6th thought."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-03-01,this video might bring me back to play it through! i only played a handful of hours before giving the game up.. i didn't know about turning off other players structures. that's what immediately killed my curiosity.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-04-15,"in a way, i think the game itself is aware of that trade off with making things too easy. the roboticist remarks that some porters find a certain skeleton as too functional. like they knew some would prefer harder gameplay."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-14,there is 'no correct way to play a game' though.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-05-28,"ehh, i don't agree, i like the 2 hands to stabilize, it makes sense, more from a gameplay perspective but also in a realistic sense as well, obviously it wouldn't make you incapable of falling over in real life, but would improve your balance, and cutting out roads all together? nah dawg, i'll traverse the landscape a couple of times, but the 6th or 7th time going through an area, i've earned the right to bypass enemies and have a safer easier route to and from. this really shouldn't be titled as the correct way to play, i know you mentioned at the end that you believe this to be that for a 2nd playthrough, but it just seems like you enjoy a more hardcore experience and that's fine, and if the game had been more hardcore i would had still loved it, but i'm happy with it as is, i do hope the next game is more hardcore, but if not, i'm sure i will still enjoy it. so lets just all agree, there is no correct way to play a singleplayer game, unless that correct way is whichever the player finds more fun."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-22,"gotta disagree on the point you made as far as player structures. that fits in line with the games themes of links and chains. the point is that we aren't alone, that we are building upon the progress others as well as we've made to achieve our goal. so no, leave player structures on, it fits the theme."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-12-27,i completed all the roads myself. don't think anyone helped me with it. took so long.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-28,"this is my first playthrough of ds and plan on playing it vanilla and using all the tools the game offers whether it makes things easier or not. i'm currently at porter lvl 201 and just hit episode 8 and i've started to make mental notes of things i plan to change on my next go around. second playthrough will be on very hard difficulty, no hud, disable online player structures and completely avoid building roads as i feel ziplines feel more engaging since you can make an early stop if you want to explore an area you didn't notice before. took me 3 years to finally come back to ds but it's been unlike anything i've ever played."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-21,the correct way to have fun is my way
Action,Death Stranding,2024-09-17,"there's another downside to holding both triggers beyond just making you slower it also reduces how quickly stamina regenerates very noticeable when walking up steep hills. knowing that will only save a few seconds of regen at a time though, so it does still feel a little too cheaty."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-09,this is my rule of thumb when playing any game. play how you want to play and let pthers play how they want to. dont be a backseat gamer. there is no such thing as the right way to play any game except play till you beat it. that simple
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-14,"i have not put more than maybe 10 hours in it. the main reason being that literally every path had been tread and prepped by other players. it was a walking simulator. i'm going to try it again, but completely offline"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-12,i buit all the roades and set up zip line short cuts was my favorite part wish there was more building structures and i wish you could actually go into the bases and bunkers and explore them
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-01,"awesome to come across this video as these are all things i'm doing myself already. i've got an additional house rule i think you'll like. don't ever use crouch during the bt encounters. you can still sneak through with a combination of walking slowly and holding your breath, but it's way more challenging and tense. also if a bt spots you, you can stand perfectly still and hold your breath until they eventually get bored and wander off  but not before you're practically suffocating! very cool."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-06-03,"something i do out of pure ocdness and that barely affects gameplay is arranging my cargo such that heavier cargo is closer to sam's back than lighter ones. i know balance is affected in a vertical axis, i.e. cargo of different weight affects your balance if it's piled lower or higher on your backpack. however, the same doesn't seem to hold true for the horizontal axis, that is how far away the cargo is to sam's back in a perpendicular line. another thing you mentioned, and i swear i'm not trying to brag, is cliff's fights. i played on very hard and i actually found them pretty easy. maybe it's cause i'm playing with mouse and keyboard, i don't know. all i had to do was kill his soldiers first before engaging and taking cover to reload, etc."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-14,"i truly appreciate vids like these. i nearly bought ds director's cut a few weeks ago but i can tell from the walkthroughesque clips from folks, and informational videos like this one, it's just not a game i could get into successfully and i'd be wasting my money. the graphics and work behind it look amazing, unfortunately it's just not my gaming cup of tea."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-20,"exactly how i like to play. offline first playthrough, online the second time"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-23,"i totally agree. i actually just started playing, but i fell in love pretty immediately and decided to go completely offline for my first playthrough. so far, the experience is just exceptionally deep i am clenching every muscle of my body crouch walking by those disgusting bts  and i feel like on a holiday getting to the moments when the camera zooms out and the music sets in. i am still very challenged by the game as is, so i think i might continue to use both hands to balance me for now but it sounds like a great idea for a second run."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-01,i was waiting for years for this video to come out i always wanted to do a video to talk about this but never did thank you for telling the truth about this game
Action,Death Stranding,2024-03-24,ive literally built so many god damn roads solo until two or so away from the damn timefall farm. just hours of beating the crap outta those poor mules for their goodies.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-04-15,that maser gun trick was pretty nifty
Action,Death Stranding,2024-10-05,best house rule lethal combat only.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-04,"i disconnected and didnt use vehicles much and i had a blast. i didnt stop using the right or left triggers though, i never felt like it took away from the game design."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-28,comes off as arnt i cool for making the game harder for myself meaning i have skill? please think i have skill. i played on hard. i didn't even use the gun that makes it trivial.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-26,"i don't mind these things, but a hardcore mode for people with your preferences would be cool."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-03-30,im currently 7hours into my 2nd pkaythrough 1st played roughly on launch.. and your video scratchs that itch that was nagging me.. i will definitely imlplement these tricks into my pkaythrough!!! .. was already thinking about how broken the triggers are in this game... let you know how it goes!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-08,i absolutely see why this 'handicap' is necessary for the game tho. theres soo much to experience in the game that a lot of people still havent experienced because they viewed it as a walking simulator. imagine if even more people couldnt get over the small difficulty cap of keep balance and managing stamina.. i was obsessed with the title pre release but still havent played thru to completion even after discovering thru youtube that the game completely transforms into a better sci fi themed action game than something like 'starfield' or even some mass effect titles once you start opening up the entirety of the games mechanics.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-01,"i'm a huge hideo kojima fan. i own every mainline mgs game, as well as a few spinoff. i was excited for this very strange game, but never got to play it. i recently bought the director's cut, and i'm currently on my way to the second city to connect the towns after you're first allowed to bathe and poop. it's weird as hell, the controls are strange, and oh my god it's a total kojima game with a season's worth of cutscenes.. i love it. i missed having cutscenes in mgsv. thus this game is scratching that cinematic itch. the game is spooky in concept too. it's not scary, per se.. but the idea of what the world is and the beings in it are scary concepts. it's pretty too. i enjoy building things and making donations for other players. still very early in it. maybe have 2 hours of actual playtime so far. gonna dive into it today after i go to the dispensary. you obviously said you enjoy the game. i went into it totally blind. i had no idea what mechanics it had, how deliberate the movement was, etc.. but is there gunplay or a way to fight the beings? i usually do a nokill style in metal gear solid games, but i have a feeling that may not be possible in this if there are guns. but yeah. are there guns? vehicles? and w.. you just mentioned guns. lol for new players, what tips do you have? do shoes degrade? it looks like it does as i have 2 pairs. and do you expand your carrying load ever?"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-02-24,"another correct play, beat every bt you encounter as a must! clear that path back anyway."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-03-22,"i haven't played the game yet, but watching your tips has made me actually want to boot the game up. there has to be something special about this game as i see a lot creators love it. great video."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-10-04,"well, i felt those same things in the game. roads and online structures seems like a reward that lets you chill out ore bore? after you complete a difficult mission"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-01,im surprised my back buttons arent broken
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-02,"yeah but you get the level 3 power exoskeleton very early on and it kinda negated me ever feeling like i didnt bring enough. i mean, multiple ladders and climbing anchors have literally rotted away because i never use them. about 99.9 of the time, theres always a way around something if you just head left or right from your road block."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-16,"making previously hard things being easy is really one of the best parts of them game and its a really good rewarding mechanic the roads are really making you more immersed vis a vis the whole rebuilding american thing a lot of aspects are hard in the game, you just have to find a way to get to them. if you are carrying a lot of cargo you can't really carry anything else as weapons and such. this really makes the game hard, because you have to often choose what you carry. bts are meant to be sneaked easily past holding the two buttons isn't really that op as you advertise it if you are carrying a bomb and sam goes through rocky terrain he needs to train more stopping strength. a lot of mechanics i just don't use because they are often not needed yet again online really helps immersion and its a really good rewarding mechanic when you help other people when you yourself build different roads, ziplines, ladders and such. trying to avoid bt territory really makes the game harder as of the hard terrain most times. p.s. please can someone tell me how can i transfer my save files to death stranding director's cut on ps5 if i had previously played death stranding on ps5 d"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-31,"the combat is actually detailed and has tons of mechanics, but u can easily go with avoiding it too, and not know half the stuff u can do bcos u didnt pay attention, the only thing is it is not particularly challenging in the current state, but i agree that is no issue for this game"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-05,"i have to disagree. the only correct way to play the game is to each, his own."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-12,"i stopped using equipment repair spray and extra boots only. eventually replacing repair spray with the cover it makes it, so you actually have to play the game i might try not using dual triggers and flask i didn't know you could turn off the online stuff. that's cool"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-05-25,"i've been wanting to give this story a second chance for a long time. i love the aesthetic and the story was bizzare enough to keep me intrigued. i just didn't understand the walking simulator aspect about it. i think i'll revisit as a casual gaming experience, much like how i view skyrim  drop in when i feel the need to and just hang out with it."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-06-13,"i started the game brand new implementing most of these rules and i wouldnt turn back. it is very similar to how survival mode in fallout 4 is, it just feels like the way to play the game and you can never not play it like that anymore."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-08,i just finished my first playthrough completely offline and am looking to do a second playthrough on very hard to finish platinum i'm on xbsx. would you say i'm better off leaving others buildings off or should try at least once with the full online mechanics?
Action,Death Stranding,2024-03-25,im like a hour in and am just confused on what to do i just look at sam and pitty his back hes gotta be hurting
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-06,no guys you dont understand this games gonna take my firewood business off the ground. thank you hideo. youre a real strange one in the best of ways.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-06-23,"still haven't seen the ending, i've been playing death stranding for more than two thousand hours, on very hard structural repairs are a full time job."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-21,"i really wanted to like this game  but  perhaps ill try again soon. these types usually appeal to me, however this literally, and i do mean literally , made my eyes glaze over. 12 hours i lasted."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-17,how did you got the goods from the robotic to the craftsman un 5 minutes without ziplines or roads? i actively think that some of the legends of legends needs to be done with many friendly constructs .. ps i just build 40 ziplines into the map to so i could just easily get some legends of the legends and i still have problems i don't run to delivery cargo cause the time fall can only damage the container so the gods usually get intact. i do think some of the map is barely profited cause people tend to prefer roads but i fell you in my fist playtrough sometimes i went off my way just to explore the map better and found some pretty locations but wen i am going for time runs i go trough roads or ziplines always
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-06,"man, these are the selfimposed rules i didn't know i wanted. i genuinely was super skeptical when you started, but i'm on board and am going to change up my gameplay."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-06-03,i can easily drive my motor cycle anywhere i want feels like i dont need to walk and just make my own generators
Action,Death Stranding,2024-09-17,i play death stranding my way dont really listen to people cause there mostly dont know what there talking about my way is better
Action,Death Stranding,2024-09-20,"the only rhing you said i dint agree with is going offline so you don't see other player's structures. that is one of ghe main points, and mechanic, of the game. you're supposed to see people have been where you are before. you're not alone even though you feel alone. which is why when sam yells other sam's yell back. the core message of the game is connection so turning off your connection feels wrong to me. granted everybody should play the game how they want, and i guess it's not as bad to go offline on a second playthrough."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-26,"you ruined this game for me, was having fun, but now realised most of the joy i found in the game was from bypassing and not engaging with the game mechanics, that is i always hold lt rt when i walk down slopes and i love using roads to pass through a dangerous area. after hearing what you said, yeah, that is just stupid design, by making things convenient, they sucked the joy out of playing the game. i also found building road with online players rewarding, but as you said, that is just too overpowered to the point where i am just holding down my left stick and not thinking at all"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-02,"nothing from what you mentioned made the game less fun for me. i also played twice, the second time i also had rules always avoid bt territories if possible utilizing timefall shelters e.g. or alternative routes use a different route when playing story missions than my first playthrough reduce zipline dependency and use trikes and vans more often i built a full zipline network in my first playthrough always stealth clear a camp which is kind of not optional because of very hard, i also cleared a camp only using catapults. the fun part of the game is planning the optimal routes and building structures as setups for orders, you don't have to turn into a masochist who needs to make walking miserable or rejects other people's structures to feel challenged."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-26,the maser gun works on mule trucks directly?!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-29,"the entire shared structure thing should have been tweaked. structures should deteriorate quicker with roads being an exception so they arent there for basically forever. there should be less structures imported from other players. when it comes to the roads, i wish other players could only contribute like 50 at most and you had to provide the other 50 so you still had the challenge of delivering resources to build each section. i really dont like the roads being built themselves, but some of them take a ton of resources. i tried playing without imported structures and the roads really take absolutely forever to build. i also missed seeing signs and goofy stuff other players would leave."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-11,the epitome of arrogance.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-19,i like all of these proposed rulesrestrictions. death stranding could stand for an additional difficulty level akin to fallout 4 survival.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,this is going to help me jump back in until i finish it before the sequel comes out thank you!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-10,totally agree with you! all core mechanics are broken at the certain point. the coolest similar game experience that works perfect is in the game called snowrunnermudrunner. but it lacks kojima's story obviously  yet i really recommend this game. and this studio makes the new game called expedition
Action,Death Stranding,2024-03-24,if you titled the video how i like to play death stranding i would have no problem. but since you decided to title it like that then i must say this video is douchy and gatekeepery.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-28,"is the game fun, or at least really engaging storywise? im curious about it, but im not sure it will click with me."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-06-19,"to be honest, the only thing that prevents me from finishing it and actually appreciating the game is the lack of subtlety in the narration, and the very poorly written character. i could free roam the game for a stupid ammount of time, i love the gameplay and the contemplative aspect of the game, but the story seems to go nowhere, with a lot of exposition that doesn't lead anywhere and a narrative that simultanuously holds you by the hand explaining its themes through dialogues and loses you with a lore that is way more complicated than it needs. if anything, kojima has good core concepts, but needs to take inspiration from ghibli in the way they treat there character and expose their lore. the best way to play it, in my humble opinion, is not ignore the whole story."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-12,"i've just started playing the game  i'm not sure about the online aspect, i do like the idea of contributing to the world  getting some help along the way , i feel that all the user made structures  roads scattered around will be detrimental  take away from the gameplay, what would your ideal gameplay setting be for a immersive experience?"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-20,"id love to try no hud gameplay after im done with my first playthrough, game really has a lot of indicators to make it playable with no hud"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-10-03,can you create a video with all death stranding menu options explained in detail?
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-10,"i tried playing this when it came out, but the music was way too loud and ruined the ambience for me. can't believe there isn't an option to just disable it. people keep saying the music is integral but i feel like the world and weather would make for such an immersive experience if i wasn't being hit with loud music that is grading to me personally constantly. if 2 has an option to disable it, i'll try 1 again."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-25,i play on foot only and create my own paths
Action,Death Stranding,2024-05-01,"the essential part in the last sentence of the video almost all these tips only make sense in a 2nd playthrough. and even then, many are questionable. it's defintely not the correct way to play. this isn't really the game for high difficulty. if that was the intention, higher difficulty settings would have applied stuff like this, but they don't. even if you build all the roads, which is a lot of work, there are still plenty of occasions where you have to go on foot. i think a better challenge is to 5star every prepperlocation."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-04,"i love this game but hate the story, characters and the combat system, i use it to kill time and do mindless deliveries, i got a trainer that disabled the enemey detection and therefore skipping all bt and mule terro encounters, just me and my bb and our cargo and music doing deliveries. such a relaxingg experience."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-20,i like that the xbox players just started. so all of us are going through. the structures arent egregious yet.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-03-22,i'm doing my first playthrough and i immediatelly decided to ignore roads and ziplines. they completely ruin the fun for me. i'm 23 into the game and i haven't even used ladders or ropes p i sometimes use vehicles though  driving through rough terrain can be fun.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-10-12,"about the road, agree that takes away the challenge, but you clearly haven't completed large scale delivery from corner to corner"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-21,i couldnt figure out how to make roads. the canapult i didnt like. zip lines were good but not always accessable . i found walking my best option and i think thats how it is ment to be played.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-03-07,"i turn off the sharing but all structure of everyone has stayed on the map, the road i built all by myself. i don't see any road that other have built tho"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-06,i wonder if there are mods that could do all of this so that you don't have to playpretend. that would be sick.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-04-04,"i hope that death stranding 2 pulls a doom eternal and really goes you're going to engage with the mechanics we made and you're going to like it. i've played the opening three hours or so of death stranding probably four times over, and i always drop it because i can already feel some of what you're talking about happening, and it's just disappointing. disabling twobutton grip entirely is a good idea... maybe should have been a feature for hard mode like disabling the radar in mgs."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-10-25,i'm playing my first playthough without server connection because it felt too cluttered for me when suff from other players started to appear. meybe next time with very hard difficulty it would be helpful
Action,Death Stranding,2024-10-15,"best way to play this, tooless sam from the beginning"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-15,"i just got this game when i found out that it came to xbox, and i enjoy it a lot. thank you for the info because in online mode, the map looked chaotic with all the blue markers and running around seeing everyone's structures reminded me of the dump. i didn't like it. it just trashed up the beauty of the landscape."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-26,is this game more than just playing a delivery guy? ive never played it
Action,Death Stranding,2024-06-28,there is no correct way to play the game. i play it my way. she plays it her way. that other player plays their way.he plays it his way. have fun. that's the way to play the game. keep on keepin on !!
Action,Death Stranding,2023-12-05,"thanks, im doing my first play through now and following your guide."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-25,why wouldn't they make a hardcore mode without these cheat codes?
Action,Death Stranding,2024-10-14,but cant you just dismantle someone's stuff if you dont like where its placed ?
Action,Death Stranding,2023-11-30,"great perspective! i always thought the issue with this game was its need for accessibility. for example, there are ways to do pretty much 95 of deliveries without any gear at all, it just is more time consuming and frustrating. i feel death stranding needed to better incentivise strategy, because ive seen too many thoughtless runs of the game with people still getting s on most deliveries. i hope this fundamental flaw is addressed in the sequel. however i never thought of the r2 l2 trivializing the moment to moment gameplay, but really that makes alot of sense. gonna try my best to never do that from now on."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-10-19,i wish someone would help me finish these damn roads or even better keep up with repairing them
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-27,going for those achievements too? i made an exhaustive memory chips guide as well! you can see it here httpsyoutu.bexpsb5rcdsue
Action,Death Stranding,2023-06-13,who remembers their first trip to port knot city? that bt area still gives me the chills
Action,Death Stranding,2022-10-11,my main tip is don't waste your time in the east  progress the story and once you get the power skeleton you'll realize how much easier the game can be and then you can go back and screw around all you want.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-14,"my biggest unseen tip is that you can use your rope to tie down cargo on the carrier. nearly nobody knows this, but standing next to a loaded carrier and equipping your rope, target the carrier with l2 and then use r2 to tie down the cargo. a neat little trick"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-06-15,"one thing you didn't mention about chiral chrystals is that every 1000 you have on you reduces the weight of the load you're carrying by 1 kg. it's worthwhile to hoard them on your person, rather than storing them at the destinations. just leave 50100 banked for fabrication, and carry the rest on you. between that and most skeletons, volume is far more of a limiting factor than weight. you can only stack cargo so high, after all."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-22,"i left a couple tips a year or so ago, but i just found another really good one that's fun and i only just learned after hundreds of hours ingame, as well as some helpful stuff about dealing with bt's for newer players. the bola gun at least level 2, idk about lv.1, works on bt's lmao. this tip works super well with the cord cutter you get later on. tie up a bt then simply walk up and cut the cord with no risk. also, remember, sam's urine is literally a bt weapon. peeing a little bit will stop a bt from approaching you. that's why the ability to urinate is on the weapon wheel it's a hint. the game makes bt fields out to be much worse than they actually are, just in general. when you go to a bt zone, you don't need to be worried. just remember you only need to crouch and sneak when your odradek is flipping open and closed at a fast rate, and you only need to hold your breath when it starts spinning. when holding your breath, even very close to a bt, you can catch your breath quickly as long as you stop moving completely before you stop holding your breath, and hold again before you even start to move again. you don't need to nobreathesneak the whole zone, thankfully lol. as a bonus tip that's super counterintuitive if you don't have a bunch of important stuff on you, it's actually easier sometimes to just run in and get caught on purpose. taking down the bt that shows up when you get dragged is more economic than trying to throw a grenade at every single base bt in your path. plus, a nice chunk of chiral crystals to celebrate your victory. oh, and one more if you're gripping for balance with sam's right hand, he can't also hold his breath. release your grip on your right backpack strap before sneaking past a bt or sam can't hold his breath."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-09-21,"just realised tonight that if your low on blood surrounded by bt's and have ex grenades and a vehicle near, throw a grenade at the vehicle and drive off. bt's won't come near and try drag you down. many might know this but ive only been playing for 5 days"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-31,"material hoarding claiming materials to put into private locker is also really helpful for others. i typically store half of my materials, and donate the other half to the shared locker. imagine the joy you'll bring to someone building roads when they find a 1000 metal and 800 ceramic container in the shared locker. roads aren't always solo affairs. once you've donated to a road, you get credit for materials donated by others. journeying ahead to donate a few chiral crystals can save you time and resources. if you're having problems with the sticky gun, after the package is airborne, hold down the triangle ps button to automatically grab and store it. works better than left or right hand."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-08-26,"if you have problems with remembering what materials certain mule camps hoard, place a materials sign within that territory as a marker. as signs can be viewed from the map if you zoom in close enough, you'll be able to track material camps with ease. keep on keeping on!"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-03-02,"im on chapter 6 and its been such a heavy effort to build roads. the npcs say that seeing sam in action gives them hope. likewise, getting notifications that other players usedcontribute to roads i use gives me wind to keep donating materials to scattered auto pavers"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-02-22,the big tip really is to not do any side missions in the first area. just get to the second area as fast as you can because thats where the game really starts and makes the first area way easier. once you can build bikes and exoskeletons and such.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-02-23,"my second playthrough of ds was spent on two tasks getting 5 stars at every delivery location and completing the highway system. by the time i had to transport mama to mountain knot city, it was a simple matter of loading her in a truck and taking her on a leisurely drive, of course stopping at a hot spring to loosen up."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-05,i got another tip. ever fell down a slope and started tumbling or falling? the pissing button equipped. just whip your schlong out while you are falling and come to a complete stop. don't forget to aim
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-01,"death stranding is absolutely amazing! it is so fresh, creative, the world is so detailed, amazing performances from the cast, the story, vibe, truly no other game quite like it, hideo kojima is a true creative genius."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-09-06,"to add onto the tip about finding preppers in deadzones, if you look close enough and zoom in on the map without filters on, you can actually see where their shelters are, so you don't have to run around the whole mountain just to find one person."

Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-01,"it may be well known, but i just discovered after like 50 hours ingame, that the timefall shelters the ones that look like mushrooms or umbrellas, spray container repair spray on you wyen you use them, so stopping off in the mushroom shelter will completely repair all the containers you're carrying to 100 durability. super handy, especially since they tend to exist in timefall areas. if it's actively raining timefall, mushroom shelters will also refill your flask."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-01,"use the otter hood. if you fall into a river or get swept away while wearing the hood, sam will float on his back and paddle very effectively. i've only fallen in or been swept away while wearing the hood two times, but on both occasions i had a number of largesized packages on my backpack and none of them fell off. idk if i was lucky or if that's a perk of the hood, but either way, i was able to get back to shore so easily with sam floating on his back and paddling the way the hood allows."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-23,"climbing ropes, when you make it to the top with one of these, make sure to throw the rope back down so other players can use it, if you leave it at the top, it will remain there until another player throws it back down."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-17,"umbilical cords  i loved it when i unlocked the cutting device on my bracelet. by that point in the story, i wasn't as freaked out by bts and knew how to approach them better, both at a distance with blood bombs and close up by cutting their cords."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-12,started playing this yesterday on my ps5 i didn't play it earlier because everyone was saying it was a walking sim but man i'm glad i gave this game a chance
Action,Death Stranding,2023-10-10,"one more huge tip once you really start to build roads, youll quickly run into the problem of not having enough materials nearby and having to do large hauls from base far away. but if you replay the boss fights specifically the ranked boss fights, you will receive a huge amount of resources once the event is over! definitely helped me out a few times! also, use automatic robot deliveries to complete orders that transport resources to the bases, thats how you quickly top up metal etc. for that base and the xp doesnt hurt either!"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-11-05,"the mountain incinerator spawns some really big chiral crystals! if youre on your way to mountain knot or burning a body, climb up the sides and head to the tower."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-06-24,i've just begun playing death stranding and this instructional was both helpful and intimidating simultaneously. i'm getting older and don't pick things up as quickly as i used to!
Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-28,"a lot of people try to define what a strand type game is and some try to compare it to dark souls but most are missing the point. its not called a strand type game because of its asymmetric multiplayer. kojima called it a strand game because all other games that exist focus on giving the players a stick and death stranding make players focus on using a rope. all the gameplay elements are themed around this strand concept that makes you want to tether things together. it teaches you that you become more powerful the more you can connect things vs other games make you feel powerful by having the biggest stick. my biggest gameplay tip is to build all the roads asap. after that point you can make huge deliveries from northsoutheastwest using the trucks. i also take on deliveries to the preppers you pass along the way. for example i will take 500kg from lake knot to south knot, but also pick up stuff for the collector, engineer, and cosplayer. when i am near these preppers ill leave the truck on the road and take the cargo on foot to the prepper using a floating carrier and carry back any lost cargo or extra deliveries in the direction im headed. i usually like to be on foot. if the deliveries arent timed then you should take your time and pickup the lost cargo and chiral crystals as you journey. upgrade and repair as any other structures as you can. the more you connect with other players the higher chance other players will have to see your structures."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-11-01,"a tip not mentioned in this video, possibly because caedo didn't play it with the dualsense controller. i play on pc and do not own a ps5, but i bought the controller for this game entirely. when you lightly hold both l2 and r2, you can sense which side you're tilting towards, which makes it easy and intuitive to counter it, without looking at the prompts or sam. it's very satisfying."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-05-24,"maybe it was obvious to others, but during my 2nd playthrough i realized there's actually alot more prepper bunkers than the ones you have to visit and connect for the main story, it's worth visiting these optional preppers and delivering their lost cargo if they have any or taking on orders for them in order to connect them to the chiral network so you can build structures, bridges, etc. in their territory, can also get you some neat rewards if you improve your connection stars with them."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-05-09,"a good tip is to complete the side missions from v. you get some pretty nice upgrades. also, ziplines are amazing. i can go from first prepper to the evodevo, to the timefall farm, to the weather station, and back without getting off. side note about the level 2 zip lines is only one of them needs to be level 2 to have a reach of 350m"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-04-07,"1. once you arrive in lake knot city chapter 3, go back to the eastern region and get 5 from all the prepperslocations. you won't come back, afterwards, until the endgame. 2. build all the roads in chapter 3. if you delay it after this chapter, it will be harder to farm materials, because mules will own machine guns and terrorist camps can kill you. in chapter 3 nobody will kill you, because even the terrorists use nonlethal bullets. but after ch. 3, this will change. you can farm metals from the 1st mule camp, located between lake knot and the engineer, and ceramics from the 2nd mule camp, located between the elder and the craftsman. 3. while the mules are knocked down and stock will be replenished when they're up again, focus on completing material deliveries, between various prepperslocations. 4. kill all the mules and terrorists in chapter 6 deadman when you won't have bb with you. they won't respawn anymore until you'll fast travel to another region e.g. eastwest, or change the game's difficulty ... or spend 300h in the game.  you can ignore the sw camp, since it's very hard and tedious to transport the corpses from there. i did it in ch. 5 and bb went into autoexemia after each shooting, so i needed to sleep in the safehouse very often, because of that. don't keep bb too much time in that state because it will weaken the link he has it with you, and you don't want that to happen! 5. try to sleep as little as possible. sleeping advances time a lot. meaning that your structures and the online ones will degrade faster. 6. rule of thumb bring a prepper into the chiral network  do orders for himher until you get 5  rinse and repeat. leave the order for sam the last one to be handled. 7. don't bother with the first preper, until you'll need to go to the mountain cabin, to meet deadman. just don't meet with him and go to those two, to bring them into the chiral network and get 5 from them. as for the veteran porter, he'll unlock his door in the heartman's chapter, once you'll bring the geologist into the chiral network. both of them will have its doors lockedblocked until those specific moments! 8. use the bridge link often. make 30 strand contracts. update those contracts on a daily basis, with people that login daily, have a similarhigher porter grade and bridge link with you. people that login daily are people that will repair your structures and you will see their structures in your gameplay. focus on those that have the green likes  blue likes! if that green number is higher, that means many players, like yourself, are pleased by that player's work  he spent many hours and has built useful structures around the ds world. 9. in order to unlock the truck and the backpack cover, first unlock then maximize the following connections distro south, junk dealer, collector. in this order! don't maximize any of them before unlocking them! 10. use only the chiral boots! they're the lightest and offer the longest durability. you can get a pair by completing any premium delivery to the chiral artist mother. 11. gravity gloves  power gloves  silver hand. plain and simple! you should use, though, power gloves, when you wander in the mountains, to set up your zipline network.  12. all terrain  power  speed  support skeleton. although the all terrain has 60kg less capacity than power, it's a great tradeoff, because the mobility and speed is greatly improved. and you'll have the hip slots available, as well. you will unlock it in chapter 6, by bringing the roboticist in the chiral network. 13. once you bring the doctor into the chiral network, focus on completing premium deliveries to him. each premium package, that he'll receive, will offer you a high capacity blood bag of 1l! which is very useful later on! 16. don't bother too much with the floating carriers and use them only where it's the only option available. unfortunately, even if you tie the cargo, with the strand, packages tend to drop from it. a poorly tested feature, overall. on top of that, it costs chiral crystals to work lvl 1  2min, lvl 2  3min and is limited by kg, not only sizes lvl 1  300, lvl 2  600."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-09-01,"another tip that you didnt mention especially to those new to the game is after you receive grenade pouch, you can go to a private room and customize your backpack so they can fit a alot of grenades and add an extra battery for your usage. even for an experienced player like myself, this feature is one of the most easiest feature to forget abt since for me i rarely stay down in the private room for so long. enjoy!"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-20,"you can actually still get into a truck even when it's full, with cargo on your back, so long as none of said cargo exceeds your backpack's secure strapped volume, as it will be placed on the passenger seat. in addition, the truck will automatically load cargo exceeding your backpack into the truck bed if there is space, and then load it back onto your backpack the moment you get out of the truck."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-30,"not sure if anyone has mentioned this, but i realized something recently. i like to take my truck everywhere. after several interesting routes up the mountain to elder, and some failed attempts that left me turned back around facing back down the the path i came... if you scale a mountain path backwards in your vehicle, considering the truck is rearwheel drive, you can more easily get up the trail. kinda like turning your truck into a downshifted frontwheel drive."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-06-20,"tip! materials in standard orders are for the taking and these excellent deliveries respawn, the distribution centre south of lake knot city gives you 800 metals to deliver to the engineer, take the order to the engineer and before delivering it select 'claim materials' take 800 metal then deliver the order. i call one of my favourite standard orders 'the lake knot city motherload', for best results you need to do order number 511 with a fully constructed road between lake knot city and south knot city with a truck."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-14,if you hold the strand aimed you can counter melee attacks from the mules. it puts you behind them and you can then strap them up. i think you might be able to counter thrown spears the same way. it's been a while since i tried that specific move. i might have just been near a guy attacking when a spear was thrown.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-30,"i just started playing the game and building the roads is my biggest headache other players have been finishing it for me and i feel guilty, i never thought about taking stuff from the shared locker and recycling and then storing those in the personal locker, that's genius! that's helpful for the more hard to get to areas too. thanks for the tips!"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-01,sticky gun can fetch you the rope from anchor point if you aim at it carefully there is no auto aim as one for cargo
Action,Death Stranding,2022-09-13,i'm really enjoying this game. luckily for me i found a data chip when completing a delivery early on in the game which had the ride version of the bike. it doesn't take any damage and the battery is double the standard version. i'm obviously sharing it in my garage for everyone else
Action,Death Stranding,2022-11-06,as soon as i realised the bts stayed away longer by fighting the boss i just started letting myself get caught on purpose. i really don't see any point to making a path and taking them out 1 by 1. it's just more fun anyway fighting a boss having said that once you get ziplines you really have to go out of your way to fight them
Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-26,"hi, very good video tips. another one, when you face a big black monsters, throw them a blood grenade. it will make the impact zone, on their boby, turn to red cristals and they will be really more sensitive to lethals weapons dammage when you'll shoot this zone."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-12,"one slight correction from the truck part around 1330 sam can have cargo on him if the truck is full, as long as it doesn't go above the main section of the backpack basically anything covered by the backpack cover you can get from the collector later in the game. it will sit on the passenger seat next to him."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-09-10,passing through water and being in time fall refills the water container. going to the private room with the vehicle by standing next to it and press c keeps the vehicle contents and does not move it to the private locker. that means you do not have to refill the truck from things moved to the private locker. you keep your vehicle inventory as is. distance traveled is an equation for determining like payout on delivery. if you wish and it is not a timed delivery keep a large delivery in the truck for a longer time while delivering smaller ones. your payout for the held deliveries will be much greater.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-02,i literally just finished this game and thought it was fantastic. such a peacefully stressful game. the turbo on trucks in the snow up a hill can cause a rage quit. such a pathetic slide back down the hill trying to recover lol
Action,Death Stranding,2022-05-04,"thank you so much for making this and pointing out the trailblazing dirt path making mechanic. i swear no one talks about how cool that is and it's like the whole point of this severely underrated game. i think it's important to stress to people who aren't getting into it right away not to linger too long in chapter 2. story progress gives the player so many more tools to complete old orders with. it's good to master the fundamentals before moving on to more difficult orders, but unlocking premium deliveries and grenade pouches asap is priority. analog tilt sensitivity is the name of the game imagine sam is a truck and drive him as such. read emails and pass time in private rooms between grinding orders to level up connection levels since progress will be halted until your read them. some times you have to rest to advance time to receive mail in the first place. i hope to find a caedo structure a make a strand contract!"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-12-06,personally death stranding is a masterpiece of a game and i'm not sure many people can see how incredible it is when on paper it's simplistic yet vast in quality. i absolutely love when i find other players built structures to aid all of us and realizing how we the players are all connected through the chiral network.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-17,you can use climbing anchors to climb up steep surfaces. place one down and start traversing up whatever terrain you are having trouble with. you won't stumble or slide down.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-06,"in deathstranding director's cut, the chiral crystals was mentioned to help sam become lighter 1,000cg of chiral crystals is equal to 1 kg less heavier"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-22,"thank you. as a new player, i'm finding this game so interesting and fun, i can hardly contain my praises. this video will definitely be useful to me and i really appreciate it."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-07,thank you! the most impressive was the blaze trail. that's really a neat detail. it's probably those greenish lines on the map the show the current blaze trails of your player pool.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-03,"love these sort of guides, they give me the tips without undue amounts of spoilers d"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-08-05,my biggest tip is that when you are being attacked by bts when they are swarming around you on the ground you can urinate on them. quick way to get rid of them and not get sucked into a fight with a larger bt!
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-01,"a bit late to the video, but a small addition to the point of always getting more stars from the sites that give you useful stuff like the power skeleton. generally you will have the best upgraded equipment at four stars, there is no need to grind for the fifth early on the fourth star is generally easy enough to get to with a few missing item  order runs."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-01,"another tip for those of you aspiring bt hunters, when covered in blood or tar don't go through rivers! instead, go to your private room, then wash off in the shower. your grenades lvl 0, 1  2 will be generated in larger quantities based of your grime, how much you drink and how many cryptobytes you eat. if you want to maximize your grenades eat cryptobytes instead of using the blood bags, as blood bags add nothing positive other than passive health regeneration. hope this helps someone!"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-15,i stopped playing this game around the end of chapter 8 due to other games i was interested in releasing around the time i started this one but with the reveal of ds2 im stoked to jump back in and finish this game. i was pleasantly surprised by how much i ended up really enjoying this game. its beautiful and has a really nice balance of gameplay and its beautiful.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-10-31,at 1400  use drift button when driving trucks uphill. drift works really well in that case
Action,Death Stranding,2023-08-27,"i am so broke i am contemplating death stranding more so now than before. well, i love this game and i'm grateful to this video. thanks caedo genesis, that's all i can afford to give."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-05-08,"i really have come to appreciate this game, despite its seriously insanely slow pace in the beginning. but just imagine if this world came to pass"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-07,i've played this game for 50 hours and this video still taught me a lot of simple stuff i simply didn't know. i didn't even realise the bt's will only show up on scan if you're not moving. i just simply hadn't noticed it only worked when i wasn't moving. great video man
Action,Death Stranding,2022-09-24,"i talked so much crap about this game when it came out, never giving it a shot. when it was on sale before the director's cut, i thought that i should give it a shot. it quickly became one of my favorite games, the story, the score, the gameplay, everything about it was fantastic."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-10-28,"not sure if mentioned in comments, but you can also use the maser to disable enemy vehicles, stunning any passengers on board and forcing them to exit the vehicle once they recover."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-04,"one little thing with the strand, is that you can actually use it to parry enemy melee strikes. ready it with ltl2 xboxps respectively, when and just when an enemy begins to strike, press rtr2. the game will do a slowmo, and prompt you with the parrymove button. makes the boss fight much easier"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-26,"just watched this after getting to chapter 15. great tips. i tried to avoid spoiling myself too much while doing my playthrough, but some of these tips are really useful for postgame as well."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-05-15,great video and as i've only just got my ps5 i am already well into chapter 3 of the director's cut and loving it. . one really simple thing i hope is something new or i've wasted soooo much time getting off bikes to pick things up is that... well you don't have to get off the bike to pick things up. . it just needs to be stationary
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-06,"it took me a little to notice this, involving a backpack cover. i was trying to use a repair spray or timefall shelter to repair the cargo on my back. i would check my cargo and notice sometimes my cargo container was still very damaged. it took a few more times because i realized the backpack cover i had on doesnt just protect the covered cargo from timefall, it also prevents repair spray from reaching the covered cargo. i usually just offloaded the damaged containers and had then had them sprayed, when that situation happened."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-06-27,"my favorite game of all time. it's an astonishing accomplishment. it's a whacky concept, but you have to play it to see what a feat it is. thanks for the video."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-06,"another thing i didn't hear mentioned about the chiral crystals is that for every 1000cg you have in your inventory your load is lightened by 1kg because of their floating properties. i almost always take out most of the crystals from any terminal and carry them myself and once you start getting a lot of them, it helps out a lot."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-02-05,"i built a zip line from the first city connecting ll of them down till the farm and the south city. with this i reduced the traveling time on built road 30min travel to 5 minute zip line travel. with this i manage to deliver in premium delivery from the south city to the first one within total 30 min travel time instead of 1, 5 hour . this game is a masterpiece."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-26,tip in using a cargo as a weapon even though it says destroyed you can still use it a few times before it disappears so make use of it it deals massive damage. also resting in flat surface is faster to recover.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-11-13,"you can also see timefall bounce of bts if you can focus ahead, instead of on the ground and your odradek. i always just navigated only with the odradek warnings on the first playthrough."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-06-30,tons of depth to item management. game kind of reminds me of snowrunnermudrunner in just hauling stuff with physics being the main challenge
Action,Death Stranding,2023-09-13,"thank you so much for all your info. i just started playing the game and love it so much! i have had like a week of 3 am bedtimes and don't see an end. some of your tips i had already figured out but a ton i didn't even know about. i think i gotta start over now because i got the directors cut. it seems to be alot more stuff, can't wait."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-06-21,playing the directors cut at the moment and im at episode 7. your video helped clear some question i wasnt sure about and teached me something i havent thought was possible. thanks!
Action,Death Stranding,2022-11-22,"1330 you were close about the truck being full and sam not being able to get in with extra cargo. sam can still get into a full truck with cargo on his back as long as the cargo on his back all fits into his backpack or on his arms and legs. if anything is stacked higher than his pack, he can't get in a full truck."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-07-29,"i thought i knew all the tips after multiple playthroughs, but you got me with the last one. in the director's cut you can use zip lines with the carriers!!!! i had no idea."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-09-21,"towards the end of the game i had the whole map completely routed out with ziplines. so the last hours of the game for me were mostly running to one of my posts, press the button and watch sam just fly across the map d ziplines in this game, if placed right, make this game super easy mode, especially since you can attach the carrier while lining d"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-02-26,"i found that the optimize cargo not affecting any gameplay like gravity or balance but it do makes u able to fill empty spaces if u doing this after u set up the way u want it will auto arranged, making your set up on the top of your bag and makes it fall if u slipped so if u have cargo that is sensitive or require a spotless damage dont do auto arrange cargo and make sure the cargo are inside your bag or attached to suit instead of the top of your bag"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-05,roads actually is a crucial item of multiplayer because it gives major boost to received likes. building roads earlier  guaranties that there will be piece of road build by you and you will receive likes from players who neglected building roads on same stage as you and roads evolved automatically for them on later stages of game. if you dint build roads  they expand automatically and you dont receive bonus for those pieces which you didnt built
Action,Death Stranding,2022-09-14,"if you wanna stop faster on the reverse trike then when holding a reversebrake on keyboard also hold your right mouse click for a reverse wheelie to almost stop on a dime no matter your cargo load,... just noticed this on my own today. been playing for 5 days, and this is helping me get around easier on that thing, and i didn't see it in any tip videos yet,.... i did not read all comments though."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-06-22,deliver the damn pizza's right off the bat. more than worth getting done. the rewards for delivering them all. can help a lot early in the game. and help keep your cargo load down.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-09,carriers now work on ziplines. this is a massive change for the better
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-27,"about carrying cargo into truck even if you fully loaded it completely sam can bring with him the cargo in his legs and shoulders, witch is 4s small and the exactly amount of the backpack it is 1xl extra large  1m medium or 2s or 2l large i need to make a video explaining this, about the sizes of the cargos never saw anyone talking about it great video, i've been playing the game since launch on ps4, i'm currently playing offline to get a challenge and your video game me some tips i never thought wish i had director's cut amazing work keep on keeping on"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-04,"you can still drive a full truck with some cargo on you  equipment doesnt count, but you can also have cargo on the back anything that fits into the backpack  2 ls or equivalent and up to 4 s cargos attached to suit"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-22,"i've only had this happen once, but when i was driving a mule truck through their area, they didn't spot me as an enemy until i stepped out and began fighting. great moment, lol."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-10-04,"i've been reading a lot people said this game is a walking simulator. i just bought it few days ago but turns out this game is enjoyable. i just love roaming, grabing package to deliver, making easy way to move putting ladders, rope and whatever it is. this game made me like having a job as a real porter."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-05-20,finally discovering this game in 2023 had a sealed copy since 2019 lol ds is an amazing game and ty for this guide!
Action,Death Stranding,2023-07-25,"there are alot of materials in the ruined shelter by craftsman... just access the terminal where you collect his tools, and open the private locker. great for building roads"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-04-23,"the balloon bts that show up near the incinerator in the central region and around the edge of the map in several spots are super easy to kill, and drop chiral crystals and sometimes cargo like dlhigh density materials. they are always in large groups andnits easy to get 3000 crystals in a few minutes by killing them. they respawn after a few hours assuming you dont rest in a private room and faster if you do."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-05,after more than 50 hours of gameplay i was still finding some of these out. great list.

Action,Death Stranding,2022-06-17,you don't have to change your vehicle's color to instantly repairrecharge it. just store the vehicle and then retrieve it.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-09-19,"my favorite tip that nobody ever knows the bola gun works on bts. when they're frozen with it, they can't send you to the catcher or anything, so once you have the cord cutter you can just walk up casually and send them on their way."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-02,"two tips wasn't mentioned even if the truck is full you can put the first row of things from your back to the passenger seat. also, when you carry a body, you can seat it on the passenger seat and drive with it given you have no other excess cargo on your back nothing hanged on your tool rack and on the suit, etc."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-02-06,"the game blasts you with so many mechanics that i missed some of it, and the ingame tips aren't that thorough. so, thank you!"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-10-11,"just got dsdc from steam it was just on sale half off never new much about it, but now after playing, it is a awesome game the graphics are superb and greatly optimized so there is not a ton of frame spikes. i have a 3080ti max settings and run 144 hz max at all times. also great mechanics,can not believe i overlooked the game for so long like i said it's great. thanks for the video and sorry the comment is a mile long."

Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-18,"also if you come up against a boss bt like a squid or lion, you can hit them with a hematoma grenade or grenade launcher then switch to a assault rifle with lethal rounds and take it down faster."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-02-25,"also, you dont have the road network in the first area. if you are going to put down a zip line, please check what others exist on the map and try and space yours out at least 300m from the other. use cliff tops to your advantage!"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-09-08,i just restarted the game because of how long it was since i played it last. so i guess that makes me a reporter.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-07,just wanted to add that anything you are carrying in your hands can be dropped directly onto your vehicle. saves time from opening your menu and transferring it that way. wish i learned that sooner.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-08-21,just started playing! all a bit overwhelming the amount of stuff i need to do!

Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-16,"as an actual italian i have to agree with kojima, you guys simply do not get this game. you are not meant to put the disk on the ps4 and actually play it, you are meant to use it as a coaster for your drink. its not brain science or rocket surgery, people."

Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-26,"all i can think about whenever i see death stranding is this tweet that described the plot as norman reedus delivers a baby, but not that way."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-20,"its not kojimas fault, he said in an interview he was making the game while blindfolded and with earmuffs on"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-21,i can not believe dunkey forgot the other classic game of the strand genre octodad
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-03,"as soon as i clicked on this video, i knew dunkey wouldn't like it. i really enjoyed death stranding personally, but i could see why dunkey didn't like it. especially how he was playing it, you have to plan your routes effectively and forcing it ends up with a lot of frustration, there's like 10 different routes between all the areas, some risky and hard, some way easier. the waypoint system is fucking incredible in this game, and makes route planning a breeze. for the few weeks i played it, it was my relaxation game. just load up with some packages and away i went, just absorbing the atmosphere and forgetting my troubles for a few hours dunkey said in the past he has no patience, and that's exactly what you need. it's an expository dump and trying to understand the story in parts is exhausting, but possible if you've been concentrating on the story otherwise you'll need a glossary, because by the end it's lingo city and fuckin shit, it gets annoying. i understand why dunkey doesn't like it, but overall i got 100 hours of enjoyment building roads, bridges and keeping on keeping on. if you want to try unhinged kojima scifi weirdness, go for death stranding. just go in with patience and an open mind. there's a lot of good, but the bads can get pretty bad."

Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-03,how do you feel about death stranding?
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-03,"playing through ds and discovering my love for a new band in low roar, only to find out that the lead singer passed away and the group disbanded was a unique sense of loss that will always be a part of my memory of the game"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-18,"i hate to be this person because im generally not a depressed guy but i went through my first real adult breakup prior to playing this game. never really hit me that after spending 5 years with someone always there that they could ever not be there. i lost my best friend. i lost the person that would gladly listen to me and actually cared about my interests. the fact that i no longer had anyone to talk to period, destroyed me and to wake up to an empty bed. i stopped going to work, isolated my self for years i was this isolated mess. then i played this game.this game helped me not feel alone anymore. helped me reach out and start being with my family more. to appreciate them more. even the music ghost by auar in the game helped. its almost bitter sweet because replaying the game again, i'll never feel that warmth i did the first time. but i'll always appreciate it for helping me become a better person."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-03,"funny how when death stranding came out, so many people went on the bandwagon of calling this a walking simulator cough dunkey, when it's so much more than that. because it was completely new and foreign to what videogames used to be like, people dismissed it at first glance. but i'm glad this game has flourished as years have passed. can't wait for ds2!"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-04,keep on keeping on.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-03,what a time to refresh the homepage
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-10,as an xbox player i can finally start my journey too. for a game that dropped 5 years ago looks absolutely stunning
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-03,"the moment i set off with president strand body for my very first proper cargo mission, and i saw that beautiful, green terrain and then a low roar song kicked in... i knew that i was gonna love this game. and i sure did. it certainly has some issues some writing is a bit stiff, more characterization, less repetitive exposition dumps, but it is absolutely a game that i will recommend for everybody. it is not for everyone, but it is an absolutely unique game that deserves to be tried and played. because one won't know if they will like it until they give it an honest try"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-04,"ill be honest, i was one of those people that assumed this game was boring and never gave it a chance. but in the last year this game has been calling for me thanks to the interesting lore, impressive graphics and the legacy that kojima has in the industry. i finally gave a chance about a week ago and ive been loving it! it has much more to offer than what youtubers claimed back when it released. i swear, the only footage i would ever see is simply people walking in the early portions of the game with zero vehicles, combat, stealth etc. all of those old videos seem so disingenuous when i look back at them now"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-03,"i wasn't expecting this video, son. thanks for all the hardwork, we truly appreciate it."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-03,neverknowsbest dropped a three hour video about the history of jrpg's today and then like 30 minutes after watching that i get a notification about this. this is what sundays are all about! 3
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-08,"the most ocdinduced i gotta get that abandoned cargo, addictive, therapeutic game i've ever played that can be picked up any time and lose hours on. the director's cut version really closed the chapter and satisfied gamers with numerous additions to allow this to be played solo wo an internet connection. if you are organized enough, you can travel the world at your own pace despite the ingenious time limit strategic challenge with your cargo via the degradating timefall climate. i hope the sequel doesn't get too outlandish. once i saw the electric guitar gun, i got a bit nervous lol."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-03,"i had a really interesting experience with this game as i was finishing off the platinum trophy. all of my structures and zip lines were decaying and breaking at the same time, it gave me the feeling that this world that i'd connected over 100 hours was slowly dying as i was getting ready to leave it. honestly it was incredibly profound, i've never had a video game make me feel that way before."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-11,"this game holds a special place in my heart. i developed ptsd after almost drowning in a national park. i couldnt be near a body of water for a long time. this game was moved to pc and i decided to try it. with the first mission having to trudge through water it helped me make my first steps to overcoming my condition. kojima and his game made a huge, however strange, contribution to my life. thank you for your amazing deep dive into one of my favorite games of all time!"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-12,"death stranding is one of the most atmospheric games i've played in my whole life! as i love hiking in real life, but don't have the chance, to do so, very often, exploring it's world was pure bliss for me! i really hope, ds2 will capture, what made part 1 great and maybe even improves further on it!"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-12,i hated it for the first 35 hours. put it down. jumped backed in a month or so later. got hooked. got the platinum. can't wait for 2.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-03,"i played most of death stranding sitting in a dark nursery during august and september 2020 over the ps4 remote connection to an ipad while trying to get my then fourmonth old to nap, who was refusing to do so unless i was holding him and blasting white noise. so imagine this room, blackout curtains with very little light seeping through while i have headphones on, but only loud enough to kind of hear the game so i don't miss him making noises since i can't really see his face the way he wants to be held, playing a highly detailed game on a friggin' ipad, lagging half the time, terrified that my slightest movements would wake him. in the middle of a lifealtering pandemic. 3 weeks of that. at the end of the game, i sobbed uncontrollably for hours and still consider it one of the singular greatest gaming experiences of my life."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-03,a 2 hour analysis of one of my favorite games from one of my favorite youtubers? lets goo!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-05,are people finally realizing how much death stranding rules?
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-12,"to someone that couldnt play more than 5 minutes on zelda botw before getting bored for the lack of story.. i loved every second on ds. on every long transfer there's motive, gravitas."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-04,"certainly not for everyone and not without its issues but i'm glad to see it finally getting its due in recognition. one of the most beautiful, layered, characterdriven stories i've ever experienced and unlike anything else on the market! classic kojima, for better or worse."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-05,"i started playing last month and absolutely in love with this game. i've setup a housing in the mountains where the broken builds are and hunt bts. i love that you can mess with people an bts. it takes a great idea to life an death. i would recommend playing this too just a slight note about causing voidouts if a person dies and isn't incinerated within 48hrs, they turn into a bt. now if they happen to die inside a city with no one knowing, that btantimatter will go after a living personmatter thats when a voidout happens. people could die far away from any poulation and just be a roaming bt. antimatter has to touch matter for a voidout to happen. if you are connected to the internet and have seen other players stuff or equipment, they can also help in bt boss fights. right click the touch pad to shout and eventually a players white shadow shows up throwing stuff you may need at you! we can help each other fight together, apart!"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-12,"it's painful that i don't remember who said it in a review, but the phrase 'death stranding is the gran turismo of walking simulators' is one of the best things said in a history of ever."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-03,"the speed at which you're making these videos is wild, i hope you get some rest in between, son!"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-04,"i have 634 hours and 23 minutes to my name with that game. it was an experience, i made that game my second life. ever since i was a child, i wished we could have a giant world we can just walk in. that if i see a mountain, i could scale it. and sure some say that game is skyrim but for me. it was death stranding. the concept of strands. and how every game is connected with other players is so fantastic. it's truly my game of the ps4 era alongside spiderman"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-03,"i was just looking for another multi hour long retrospective to watch. thank you, son!"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-03,"son, i've never been so early on one of your videos. thank you for your voice and your insights and your passion in every video."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-04,"when i find someone who loves death stranding, i know i'm lookin' at a real one. also, thanks for the movie recommendation gonna have to check pusher out!"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-18,"death stranding was the weirdest and probably the most precious game experience i've ever lived through. it was something that grabbed me and kept me in a very familiar, very personal and very lonely way that helped me understand myself and my situation a little better. i felt understood... not by my friends, not by my fellow gamers but by a game that was made by my favourite developer... and the 120 hours i've played and the platinum trophy i have reached never got... stranded away from me. now i'm replaying the game, the director's cut and wow... i'm baffled, and amazed again..."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-04,"death stranding is like the real life we just work and do pir daily job to live by or to get to our own goal, but on the way, we already helping and connecting to each others. i'm a web page programmer, i just create or maintain web page from day to day, nothing fancy and certainly did not save the world. but in my daily life, i could see others code, i could admire someone else solution, and in the end, the code i wrote or the web page i create might help someone else in their life."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-04,this game is so unique to me. i've always wanted to play due to the fact that you can setup things for other people to use. it's such a small thing but that kind of connection is so neat to me. it's the same with the ending of nier automata. something about it just makes the brain happy. the story is also very interesting if not confusing haha! i still get confused if i think about it
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-03,i wasn't expecting a video from you for a while after the metal gear series. but i'm happy
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-31,"death stranding is one of my favorite games of all time. this game wasn't just a game it's and experience. large portion of gamers are used to play the same thing over and over again like cod 1, 2, 3, 4, you get the point. death stranding is a completely different experience. death stranding also changed my outlook on other games, in my opinion death stranding is an art piece."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-16,"the cool thing is if you watch the credits, you see all the players you've interacted with"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-05,"i played through it when it first came out and it really hooked me. i was really into the weirdness of it all and i found the gameplay loop kinda addicting. i recently got the ps5 dc and im currently playing through it again and very much enjoying it. really the only negative thing i can say is that the controls can sometimes be frustrating when in combat like when fighting a big bt or in the combat veteran sequences. but i also wonder if that is intentional perhaps, i mean sam is a porter not snake lol. can't wait for the sequel later this year!"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-04,"there's a much smaller channel called 'the dadliest man' that does very similar content to yours and on his 'final fantasy vii retrospective' one of the top comments is i really hope you're yourfavouritesons dad.  no kidding, this guy even has a similar delivery and cadence to his voice that makes it all the more uncanny.  fantastic stuff really."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-13,its kind of funny that those of us who truly love this game are the mules ourselves addicted to delivery!
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-14,i just hope the next game has an easier to read hud and ui
Action,Death Stranding,2025-02-22,"this is the only game that makes me cry each playthrough. a real masterpiece but, sadly, not for many."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-02-24,"one thing i will say, i appreciate higgs as a character so much more after reading all the interviews. without them higgs felt very shallow to me. he really couldve been better written and a lot thats in the interviews couldve been worked into his story to give us more context for why hes so twisted. having read it all hes a great character though. i hope hes better developed in the sequel."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,so kojima built a place where developer could be well treated and work with passion. instead of being used and discarded....he built outer heaven...cof cof kojima productions.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-16,"you can like death stranding or not, depends on if you like kojima's style. but what is undeniably revolutionary about it, is that it's not a commercial project, thought to include as many customers as possible, recycling popular mechanics, aimed at selling as much as it can. it's purely what the director wanted to do. it really is a videogame as an art, expressed by an artist. and i would love to see more of these kind of games."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-13,best game ive played in a long time. its amazing how weird it is but yet its all pretty much explained by the end. so much more then a walking simulator
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-09,great video. i love this game and have way too much time in on it. i loved when the game was over and they let me just travel around and making deliveries. it's a very relaxing experience on that level and i'll play it with almost no sound while listening to a podcast or audiobook.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-04,love to play this game high asf
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-04,"i love your analyses of games. especially when i have played a game, it feels like you are walking me right back through the feelings i had playing it. there are always things i missed especially some of the media references in a kojima game. it is just a very cozy experience and i think it helps me appreciate the games all over again"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-03,"love this video! i watched a lot of death standing videos, and none of them explain everything in a way that's as easy to follow as you do! bless the 2 hour banger video"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-05,"i've seen an 8 hr summary of the game, still am planning to play it myself and also am happy to watch your take on it, so let's do this."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-03,"as with other reviews youve done of games i played, i cannot wait to revisit this one after hearing your retrospective. and im like 30 min in. this is a good one son."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-04,"oh my god i needed this, ahhhhh keep on keeping on"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-04,"12135 during this fight is when you learn a crucial game mechanic. other players will throw guns, grenades and blood packs to you. you can enter a fight completely unarmed and exit overloaded with guns ect."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-03,"i love norman deedus's performance in this game when he's given more lines, wish he had more but it kinda fits his character."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-13,my fav channel to sleep to. for weeks the same video from you. the one day i just watch a whole 8 hr video of yours in daytime. so sick.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-14,"it wasnt just a walking simulator, it was also a red bulls commercial"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-05,"great review! i just disagree with the assertion that bridgesuca was apparently good at the beginning. ever since sam reaches capital knot, there's an eerie atmosphere in the air bridges staff acts a little authoritarian with sam, they declare openly to him their plan of hiding bridget's death to the public, they treat bbs like machines, bridget tricks sam into signing a contract without his consent, and even the cufflinks are a symbol of the type of society of control they operate  deadman even makes an excuse for their use to sam, saying something like it's for your own good. i think this whole game plays with ambiguity, and the ambiguous moral nature of bridges just becomes clearer at the end they connected many people that were stranded on their own, in a clear parallel to the reality of individuals in late capitalism, but the higherups were ill intended, and they don't fully know the consequences of this enterprise like facilitating other death strandings."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-03,my god son another amazing video. thank you for all the long form content. these videos are awesome and i look forward to everyone. now i gotta go replay death stranding
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-04,"it is criminal that you do not have 1m subscribers. the quality you provide vs. that count is criminal on our end, lol. keep it up, i know you'll get there."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-11,"i love death stranding, and the sequel is pretty much the only upcoming game i'm looking forward to."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-14,"i'm happy this game is for me, can't imagine not being into this masterpiece, or not having the experience i had playing it. i'm more hyped for death stranding 2 than for gta 6, and i'm hyped for gta 6."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-10,thanks to this video i went back to the game and finished it in the same night since i was closer to the end then i thought. your videos always are a treat and i thank ya for them
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-04,"i went to the london part of the death stranding world tour in november of 2019 and met kojima and shinkawa. i got up at 330am, travelled to london and made my way to the event. i then waited in the rain for 5 hours. i had a playstation logo tee shirt on with the word playstation written in japanese underneath. kojima smiled widely and put his finger across my chest saying playstation out loud and i honestly thought i was going to pass out  im not that tall, 511, but when i stood between the two of them for a photo i realised i was a hell of a lot taller than both so i took my chance and put my arms around both of them around their shoulders. youll never see it but the picture i have of that moment is one of pure joy on my behalf and hilaritybemusement on the faces yoji and hideo. a moment i will never forget."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-11,"i really enjoyed the video. it just bothered me that you kept calling lou a he, which she is not, and you call cliff junger but he is unger. otherwise great video."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-05,thanks!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-03,"mads mikkelson really sets this game for me, dudes just a powerhouse and his presence always demands my attention. when he's talking to bb 21450....'s"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-05,"one of the most relaxed and satisfactory games i have ever played. if i felt like chilling, i would play death stranding usually grinding for materials or maxing out deliveries, open a cold one and listen to my favorite hits."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-10,"after watching this video for 10 minute i decided to buy it. my word i wish i had done so at launch, it's fantastic. i do however upset people by describing it as elite , on foot."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-04,"thanks for another great video, i really enjoy watching your breakdowns of games, even for games i have already played. i always learn new things or gain a deeper understanding of the lore, thanks!!!"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-03,thank you for covering the first strand type game
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-03,"i was born near to the rocky mountains and this game came out at a time in my life when i was living in a city where that kind of nature wasn't accessible. i was homesick for the mountains so much and playing it was such a healing and cathartic experience, brought me back to taking acid and wandering around the lakes and forests surrounding the rockies with my friends. just incredible"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-06,"i gotta say, i loved death stranding. not everyone's cup of tea and i'm totally ok with people that found boring his gameplay and chaotic is plot i just appreciated the message this game tried to convey, about the importance of connections, so much that i actually lost interest in the plot of the game just to keep feeling good helping other players building structures and leaving materials or equipment. also, the bring me the horizon song used in the promotional material was an absolute banger  hoping for ds2 to be as cheesy in his plot and characters as the first title did, can't wait to see what kojima cooked for troy baker's character this time"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-04,"i just got platinum trophy few hours ago, it took 211h. i really enjoyed this journey, the way you feel after interacting with others. my play through was quite unique, i play few years on the same save, so even when i came back to known location there will be different structures over time. looking forward to see what kohima and his team do next. thanks, good work, really should watch other your retrospectives after that one"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-13,"death stranding is a weird game and i think the story is kind of dumb too. but somehow i love this game, i played many hours doing stupid things in game, such as doing delivery without bb or travel to the mountain with human delivery. it was a lot of fun."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-05,"it's unger, not junger."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-02-27,this was an incredible video. i've never played the game but i have a friend who lives for kojima. you made me appreciate the game as well as kojima and my friend that much more.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-09,"loved the game. it could be a bit boring at times when you're doing basic deliveries but just progressing constructions or shelters approval felt rewarding enough, especially after you come back the next day and discover other players have contributed to your road construction or completed some other useful buildings on your path. the sensation of playing in cooperation while being alone on the road. at times you could see some other npc porters traveling on foot. i wish i could pick them up in my truck or just escort them for a while listening to their stories. i wish there were more manmade structures to explore."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-22,played the game for the first time around when you uploaded this great timing
Action,Death Stranding,2025-02-27,"the first time i played through the story, i cried my eyes out when i was heading back to the incinerator near the end of the game. now i've just finished another playthrough a few days ago. and even after that i've kept on keeping on, delivering things. i told myself that i don't have to get everyone to five stars, i've got the platinum trophy so i've done that. gonna do it all over again when i get my hands on the director's cut. but still i've taken on multiple orders at once and am hauling two floating carriers behind me as i go. i love this game and it makes me so happy that other people are appreciating it too."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-14,i love these 2 hour videos. good for sleeping
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-03,"5026  impeccable delivery of 'pss and sht'. proud of you, son"

Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-09,only just started playing it so will come back to this video in about hundred hours or so.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-02-07,"when death stranding was released, i played it for an hour and felt it was boring. i despised anyone who praised the game, considering it a disastrous failure of kojima. however, after death stranding 2 was announced and with nothing new in my game library, i decided to give death stranding another try. i forced myself through its boring parts, and after more than 60 hours of gameplay, the game has truly become one of my alltime favorites. the game is like a rough diamond, with an unattractive exterior, but if you spend time on it, you will have an incredibly valuable experience."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-04,"contrary to kojima's vision, i prefer to play this game entirely offline on the hardest difficulty, only benefitting from dev preplaced itemsstructures and doing the rest myself. being limited on the network capacity makes planning that capacity more challenging and rewarding. planning all the tools i'll need feels great and the struggle from poor planning punishing. only gripe is the boss battles are kinda a slog on the highest difficulty. funny i was oblivious on my first playthru of the small thermonuclear device and just rolled on into south knot and was like oh...  more roads were added in the directors cut version that go thru the mountains as well still one of my favorite games i replay every year or two."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-19,my guilty pleasure is watching people experience this game for the first time and i still look for new players and reviewers on youtube. i played this on og release and it's so special.

Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-04,my favourite advertising ever for a video game leading up to release. its also in my top 10 games ever. its an incredible story that ive gone through 4 times and i completely buy its melodrama and love its gameplay wholeheartedly.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-17,encumbered traveling using a tightrope walking mechanic for balancing plus the addition of 1012 hours of cutscenes sums up the game pretty consicely.

Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"rest in peace ryan joseph karazija, you were the entirety of low roar and its gonna make my heart run heavy not hearing your tracks in death stranding 2. your music was and still is a beautifully endearing hug that always embraced my time spent in death stranding, a true cherry atop kojima's unapologetic vision. hope you're doing well on your own beach somewhere mate."

Action,Death Stranding,2023-12-29,"although the game itself is a masterpiece , your impatience in too many instances made it worse. to be honest if you tired  get rest, if you don't feel inspired don't do things. it rather best not being this sloppy  falling so obviously missing the clear steps around just to move straight like a train and failing miserably like a rock through glass... if you don't like the game don't play , otherwise this is not a walkthrough it's a crush down! in too many parts it seems you've so bored that you literally crush your personage to the rocks like a blind madman. what's the point of your activity if you don't like what you do? with all do respect e"

Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-11,the atmosphere and everything about this trailer is incredible. i remember watching this over and over when it was released
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-23,"anyone else going back and rewatching the trailers post game, just for the surreal feeling of finally understanding what we've been overanalyzing for the past few years?"
Action,Death Stranding,2018-01-10,kojima must be sitting there and laughing by all of our theories about this game.
Action,Death Stranding,2017-03-03,the music is brilliant.
Action,Death Stranding,2018-10-13,almost 2 years and this is still one of the greatest trailers i have ever seen.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-02-14,i'd like to say this game was ahead of its time
Action,Death Stranding,2019-09-30,"i love this trailer, because it feels far less like a traditional advertisement and more like a surreal paintingfilm. the music and ambience are mysterious and dreadful. the lack of any dialog gives a feeling of isolation and suspense and makes you concentrate on the world itself. when it was first released, each time i watched it i noticed one new detail after another. the trailer in general feels like a piece of a puzzle that draws the viewer deeper into a rabbit hole. no matter if the game is good or bad, no matter if i ever get to play this myself don't have ps4, this trailer will forever have a place in my heart as a piece of art."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-12,this has to be one of my favourite trailers of all time

Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-09,"i remember when death stranding got announced. crazy to think that it's almost been 8 years, and that we're getting a sequel, an a24 movie, and two new games from kojima."
Action,Death Stranding,2016-12-18,"no gameplay shown, no idea what the game or story is about, yet, i'm so addicted to this trailer. seen it up to twenty times not exaggerating. i'm so intrigued and fascinated."
Action,Death Stranding,2016-12-03,love the score. love the cinematography. love the trailer. yep that's kojima for you.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-22,kojima just straight up put out whole cutscenes from the final game as trailers and still nobody understood a thing.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-28,"one of my all time favorite video game trailers, the part at the end with cliff and the music is so incredible , still get chills after all these years, hideo kojima is a genius"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-05-29,"ohh, it's so hard to form a connection when you can't shake hands. fortunately i've got a good connection to the other side."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-05-30,"the ost is going to be amazing, i really love the music here, it captures the strange, ominous, mysterious, alien like atmosphere..."
Action,Death Stranding,2017-08-04,"death stranding will be something revolutionary, it will change our expectations and views on how games should be, this is kojima in his best, from all these years of experience in game development and his genius, without having to deal with konami restrictions."

Action,Death Stranding,2017-03-16,"i like how when they premiered this trailer, mads taking his nvg off, and everyone screamed, while he was like shhhh quiet.... looks like he was communicating with the audience."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-09,i had this game just sitting on my playstation since release and after the ds2 trailers started emerging i finally gave this game a proper try after giving up the first time after 67 hours. and my god am i glad i did! it took about 70hrs complete the game and get the platinum and i loved every minute of it. what a fantastic experience this game was. the story is kojima's best one so far and the gameplay got really fun longer into the game. can't wait for the sequel now!
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-02,can't believe this was 8 years ago
Action,Death Stranding,2019-07-01,why i can't get bored watching this trailer kojima knows what we like so badass
Action,Death Stranding,2017-06-14,you know its a japanese game when they put tentacles on tanks
Action,Death Stranding,2018-08-07,"there's just something about the ww2 era soldiers being skeletons that is totally bad ass, but when mad stepped out of the shadows commanding his squad in modern military uniform and night vision he looked a thousand times more menacing and deadly, and the he way his goggles flashed off of his head as he told the others to keep silent! the coolness factor of this trailer is high af!"
Action,Death Stranding,2018-10-16,the way that guys helmet and visor disappeared is awesome. tooooooo awesome.

Action,Death Stranding,2018-05-19,"may just be the coolest clip ever conceived, especially with the amazing visuals and music."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-11-23,remember the moment when you had no idea what this is about
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-04,"this is a game where you fight a giant ghost squid hopping rooftop to rooftop chucking grenades full of your own blood at the thing while it tugs down buildings into the murky depths below, and people act like the only thing you ever do is walk. hell that's not even the only method of traversal and you get an electric trike really early on that speeds the game up a lot when you do."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-14,"man. remember when we didn't know, wtf was going on, and now it all make sense. kojima played us like a damn fiddle again."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-08-29,425  look at that smirk! it fills you with chills!
Action,Death Stranding,2017-12-11,"the way the compass at that guy's chest moves at 358, the way that baby's eye blinks at 413 and the way fish swim in the new trailer are hinting something weird is happening to gravitymagnetic poles"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-10-08,i loved this trailer so much and till today i never actually played that game
Action,Death Stranding,2023-12-01,"i'm back here because i see the scene in the game! it's so surpise, this ain't just random teaser cinematic"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-02-25,"kojima truly has a mind of a genius. the metal gear story about nuclear weapons and america vs soviet union, the cold war. if i was a billionaire, i would 100 support his ideas in story telling and would give him all the money and resources he needs. he can take any idea and make it into a true vision. something unique. we need more developers like kojima."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-06,pople in these comments talking about i wish i could've played this version of the game obviously bailed on ds after 5 hours. half of the game is like this!

Action,Death Stranding,2019-05-02,"on one hand, i can't wait for this game to come out so i'll finally understand these trailers, but another part of me loves the surreal mystery."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,whos here after the death stranding 2 preorder trailer?
Action,Death Stranding,2017-03-04,"this breaks the fourth wall in so many layers. i'm still stunned how the world on the other side of the screen seeps into our world and how our world seeps into the world behind the screen. to worlds, in one game. it is not even compareable to any kind of art that i know. i wish you success mr kojima. may this be the beginning of a new era. the era of homo ludens."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-11-20,i love this moment. mads cliffis so cool
Action,Death Stranding,2018-11-17,"127 god i love the ominous music that starts playing here, wish i could hear the full track"
Action,Death Stranding,2016-12-02,"so good to see del toro, reedus and kojima reunited. and now mads mikkelsen too....hype."
Action,Death Stranding,2017-12-10,"it's really inspiring to see kojima apply his love for movies and his original plan to be a movie director in a different platform... it's like he forced it into existence from the very first metal gear game, i don't know the man but it's almost a proud moment having played the polygon format of mgs 1 back in 98 as a kid."

Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-16,"absolutely my game of the generation. such an amazing game, and i have never felt so emotional playing a game than i did during that last delivery. the music and the way you can keep pressing the button to talk to bb. right in the feels. this game is something truly special"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-16,ive been a huge bethesda rpg fan and just started my death stranding journey on steam deck. something about this game brings an element of solitude and tells you to slow down in the rush of life. love it and love your videos man!
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,i watched blade 2 again after about 15 years and was shocked when i realised norman reedus plays as blades sidekick.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-16,"this games amazing, let it take you in, roll with it and enjoy the journey. there really is nothing like it, it actually leaves an impact when you finish, that stays with you, very few games can do that."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-16,"for 30 i said screw it i'll buy it and give it a go. honestly surprised that i'm liking it as much as i have been, especially with it being a walking sim with some combat here and there. the multiplayer component is really cool though, coming across other players lost packagesgear and delivering them back to them at a delivery center is honestly sweet. also all the bridges, ladders, ropes and signs that others have placed that help you out is an awesome addition."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-13,john cena as shepherd is the most upsetting thing ive heard in a while
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-16,i tried death stranding and stopped playing after like an hour lol. came back like a year later and was upset with myself for not playing through the first time. i absolutely love death stranding.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-18,i love the community mechanic of places objects and messages
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-16,"i recently played and platinumed this game, it is not for everyone and there are times it drove me insane but i loved it."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-16,"death stranding is a game i loved, but completely understand anyone who doesnt. one thing i will say is when you get deeper into the game, and acquire more gear, you can make it much more combat based than you would initially think."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-03,"i really hope you stick with this all the way through. it's a long, crazy journey, but it's truly unique and amazing, and like mgs2, has changed many lives, and many people's perspectives and outlooks on life. every single time i'm carrying a large load of groceries or heavy load of laundry, i think about how i concentrated on every step of sam's journey, and if i watched him conquer mountains with just his feet, my menial everyday tasks seem like nothing in comparison"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-17,death stranding is a fantastic game if you just put aside any preconceived notions and play it for what it is. games a massive mood for me.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-18,"this game is a marathon, not a sprint.... literally"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-17,i'm doing my 3rd playthrough on pc now. finally gonna 100 this game and enjoy every single second of it. what an awesome fucking game. i genuinely have no idea how to describe this game to anyone who hasn't played it and even do it 14 justice. playing for the first time again would be sick.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-24,"i didn't like kojimas' book. he kept talking about movies and shows he liked and that you should check them out. bro, proceeds to talk about norman reedus and how he liked boondock saints and first few seasons of walking dead and that we should check them out."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-16,im almost 20 hours into it and im loving it. yea at times its frustrating but its an amazing experience everyone should give a chance
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-16,i felt like this game was one of those that just got overlooked by many because of other games that came out around the time and what was initially shown. it quietly became one of my favorites. would highly recommend giving this one a playthrough. or two.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-29,currently playing the director's cut to prepare for part 2 next year. death stranding is honestly on my top 10 all time favorites list
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-16,if you get caught by the bts or mules this game turns into survival horror
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-19,"i'm so happy to see you're trying this game. if you keep working through to the end you won't regret it. the ending is one of the most emotional, amazing endings to a video game. the lore is extensive and so interesting. as you play more lore is revealed and it so complex and thought provoking. the journey is well worth it and this game is all about the journey."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-16,"that was the most hype intro to a video ive seen in a minute, a editing and dbz narratorquality voiceover, im fucking pumped up and a little existential"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-19,youre going to love it at the end i had a great time grinding through this on the ps5 cant wait for the sequel to come out!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-16,"i'm so glad you finally gave this game a shot i was confused by the symbolism, mystery  scientific paranoia within the world of uca in death stranding plagued by this apocalypse but then it fascinated me when i got all my answers turning into one of my favorite video games of all time"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-17,"i love this game, it's extremely immersive, it's an experience i was missing for a long time in gaming"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-16,you talked shit about this game for so long i'm glad you finally gave it a chance it's so special
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-17,death stranding is my third favorite game of all time. with rdr2 and witcher 3 taking top two spots.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-16,"this is one of my favorite games, and i have never played a mgs game before but i plan to. while i love actionoriented games, this was different and the story, like you, intrigued me and pulled me in. i was fully invested in this game and i loved every minute of it. enjoy! it gets weirder!"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-17,dude it's on sale for a few days as of 111624. xbox. i've never played it and just got it! 20! looks rad!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-16,"never played this game yet, so glad its on the xbox now!!"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-16,1431 best part lol
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-17,"this game makes you think, that is why it is great."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-18,"low roar such a gem, made me cry with some songs in the game."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-21,this is my goty. something a lot of gamers struggle with is that they never get passed port knot which is when the game actually starts. everything before then is just prologue that super slow burns you. kojima explains a lot of it in the documentary called hideo kojima connecting worlds. so excited for ds2!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-16,great video amazing game. enjoy matty. i'm sure others have mentioned this but when you plan your route you can set up multiple waypoints like connect the dots guiding you.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-16,this game is a masterpiece. im replaying it on xbox beciase i never got play the director's cut.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-16,"game is phenomenal, i am glad more people are experiencing it."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-12,"what i found, was that it was hard to continue after the first 10 or so hours of the game. once chapter 3 started it really started to open up. my main takeaways are the ambiance of traveling to new areas. and then the sprinkling of other gamers that assisted me on my journey, the roads collectively built, gaining more and more connections with gamers that never even shared a word with. just knowing and being reminded that the game is being played in seperate gaming universes that bleed into one another, really had a somewhat of a humanity feel to it. found myself doing more to help assist others after missions were completed, and routes were retraveled etc. amazing game."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-16,the story was tough to follow but the gameplay loop hooked me it was very chill.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-17,"great video, it was fun to watch you do vids like these"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-16,"well i thought the game was trash. i was wrong. it runs so good on sx, hooked with the story and the gameplay relaxes me."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-16,this is a goated video matty. more of this please
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-17,the music always hits at the right time in this game. its amazing
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-17,this was great! i loved watching you play what i think is the most unique in a good way game ever made. i want more!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,"death stranding was such a strange and rewarding experience. loved that game. people call it simply a walking simulator, and it is, but the walking is so dang rewarding. every delivery presents unique obstacles and challenges to overcome with many different tools to try to accomplish them."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-17,"this was a fun watch. i hope you keep going and finish the game! i loved watching you go in pretty blind and it looks like you had a fun time. i'll hopefully look forward to hearing your thoughts on defining duke or summon sign. also, i'd never heard dan's name before but thought he may have been a new editor confirmed at the end of the video, i thought he did an excellent job job with this video. matty said he played for 2 hours, the cuts seemed discreet and often completely missable. it was super entertaining and easy to follow, even with 75 being cut out. i'm most familiar with matty from defining duke, and i've probably only watched 10 of his videos over the years. that being said, i really enjoyed this format, and would be interested in watching more like this. best, james"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,you cant judge this game until you get past the first two chapters imo. kojimas mind is unbelievable.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-16,same feelings here. just started recently for the first time and so far its way better than i expected
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-17,this new editing style is sick! d
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-19,"the game gets much better as you unlock vehicles, build roads, can buy materials like ladders and ropes for getting through rough terrain. if you're playing the directors cut, they added even more ways of traveling which are fun to build and link together in order to cover huge swaths of the map very quickly"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-24,"i loved this back on the ps4 and i'm loving it on the series x. the music hits differently this time, adds another layer of sadness almost, when i learned that ryan karazija of low roar passed away at age 40 a couple years ago..."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-17,"just subscribed...because i started playing yesterday, and you personified my exact reactions while playing the first few hours lol"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-17,"it's a great game, one of my favourites and im glad xbox players finally get to enjoy it. only thing your missing out on is the haptic feedback that came with the ps5 release, its super immersive with this game."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-17,"damn matty, high energy and editting on point for this one"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-19,i preordered the game when it first came out. played hours of it on stream. over 9 hours in a single sitting once. couldn't get enough. can't wait for the second one.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-17,yes matty gameplay is back love these videos man
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-17,"this game is all i remember from covid, truly a masterpiece! so so hyped for the sequel."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-17,"back when this released i remember hearing good things, so when it released on xbox and cost only 20, figured i might as well buy it. realized real soon that getting high before playing was a bad idea."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-19,"your initial experience his fun to watch. i own this on ps5 and pc, and now i have it installed on my xbox ready to play again. there are only a handful of games i own on multiple platforms, elden ring, skyrim, fallout 34, oblivion, morrowind, and now death stranding, such a great game."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-17,im glad its getting some love on xbox. its one of my favourite games of all time.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-16,kojima does not miss.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-16,1550 make america whole again
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-21,"just finished my play through of this after trying to play it a couple times since it came out. it just never clicked for me, but this time i was determined to see it through because the trailer for the sequel was so good. im glad i tried again. there is no other game like this game. truly one of a kind in story, presentation, and gameplay that didnt get enough love when it first came out. if youve tried before like i did and couldnt quite connect to it, if you give it time and are patient, there is truly an unforgettable experience waiting for you on the other side."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-18,"this might be a top 10 game of all time for me, i've beaten it multiple times on both console and pc, it's so damn good. really glad more people are getting the chance to experience this weird, but wonderful game."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-25,"1425 that, what the fuk is going on? was the funniest and most understandable feeling ever. i died!!!"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-19,"you have to complete the first chapter in order to fully appreciate this game, you got stealth, combat, guns, bosses, construction, you have to rebuilt america's highways, it is a ton of fun, first chapter is mostly walking and climbing only."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-12,im currently 40 something hours into the game and i am just realizing how well the map works after seeing you use it to look for the best route i mean i just reached the courier title in the porter level. it gets easier and easier to traverse rough terrain as you unlock gear. ive mainly been grinding for materials so i could rebuild the highways and constantly delivering lost cargo to increase the connections with bases. im absolutely loving this game!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-16,loving this editing style!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-16,shout out to dan the editor!!!  great video guys!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-16,my god! you do not stop talking even for a second there. you do not listen to the dialog. you do not listen to the music being played. how in the hell do you wish to play any game like this? jesus christ!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-16,"good video matty, i enjoyed it. talking over that soundtrack has to be illegal somewhere though.. the music hits at just the right moments. really sold me on the game when i first played it."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-17,i was intrigued seeing this pop up on xbox and thought about getting it. thanks for your vid and review of it cause i feel the same about games this year and this one actually looked interesting
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-20,i played back in 2019 on launch day. it actually changed my life.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-16,"i've loved this game since day one. i'm really glad that the opinions surrounding it have become a lot more positive over the years. it's definitely not for everyone but it just has a way of sinking it's hooks into me that i can't explain. there's just nothing else like it. i got the platinum trophy on ps4, ps5 and now i'm working on all the achievements on xbox lol."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-17,i have no idea wtf i'm watching but it's interesting
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-23,you can't not love how brilliantly weird kojima is. everytime i play death stranding i feel like i'm playing metal gear on mushrooms
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-16,"great video matty, fucking loved the intro"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-17,"i missed the 'so i tried playing videos, cool to see a new one!"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-16,"matty, i like your new editors' style. fits your energy."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-16,914 mattys reaction to dude crying is hilarious
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-18,i've been looking for a new aaa experience bro you are in for a real treat w stalker
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-16,how the tables have turned. glad you actually dove into death stranding. walking simulator minimizes the game so much.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-17,"i envy you for experiencing this for the first time, enjoy the game"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-22,"i cant believe youre just now playing this game, but it makes for an awesome reaction video lol"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-22,"im glad so many other people are getting to play this now. i finished it on ps4 back then, and again on ps5. this is such a bizarre, unique experience. it is peak kojima. i think skillup did a great review."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-17,"your critical reviews this year have built you quite a lot of credibility in my eyes. looking forward to hearing a nonspoiler review of death stranding from you when you've finished. i really hope the jump to more mature tones in death stranding is warranted, it looks really immersive and rich yet somehow i remained a sceptic and haven't tried it yet."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-18,one of my fav games. its intense. relaxing and spooky. its amazing
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-17,"damm i havent heard the xbox achievement notification sense the 360 days, so nostalgic."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-01,troy baker fighting a giant robot ronin giggling like a baby with an electric guitar axe that shoots lightning bolts. yep that's pretty kojima
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-03,kojima you know what. let's make this game even weirder.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-01,only kojima can release a nearly 10 minute trailer and leave with more questions
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-27,i love kojima and hes a visionary but yoji shinkawa doesnt get enough credit. his art direction in every kojima game is incredible
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-01,my man hideo went full kojima.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-01,the electric guitar is actually electric. 1010
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-03,"the cool thing about kojima, is when you see his trailers his games actually look like that when you play minding the hardware reqs"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-05,307 kojima calling out kratos i love it
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-01,kojima needs to make a movie because his cutscenes are better that most recent movies and tv shows
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-31,low frame rate puppet man is awesome.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-31,the fact we got this shown off and hideo kojima teasing afterwards that he's working on a new action espionage game that will be a culmination of all his prior work is just amazing.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-03-13,"425 ,this scene can be used as a wallpaper in 4k"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-31,that guitar attack scene got me laughing out loud. kojima doesnt pull his punches and thats awesome!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-03,"i sincerely hope and believe that the new and the last low roar album will be in the game. rest in peace, ryan"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-01,i hope to hear hidden tracks from low roar. we miss you ryan
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-23,a road you rebuilt was used by someone else. a road you rebuilt was used by someone else. a road you rebuilt was used by someone else. a road you rebuilt was used by someone else. a road you rebuilt was used by someone else. a road you rebuilt was used by someone else. other players are pleased with you.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-31,it does feel like kojima responded to people wanted guns so much with that interaction with higgs and sam.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-31,looks like the game's been expanded in every way i could possibly want. w kojima
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-01,love how higgs is sticking to the ancient egyptian theme
Action,Death Stranding,2024-09-16,i come back here at least once per month to rewatch this amazing trailer. i can't express how hyped i am for this!!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-31,this is easily the most bonkers trailer ive ever seen for any piece of media in my life
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-06,"i hope troy baker never goes away, such a great actor. also, can we talk about lea? what an amazing actress. kojima really nailed the whole cast"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-01,653 you can hear the see the sunset line with the guitar notes
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-24,"i just finished death stranding this week... oh man, am i looking forward to this!"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-31,"we're in mexico now, there's big hand tarantula bt's, base of operations is a boat, sam is old, there's a puppet deadman, and higgs turns into a drag queen. kojima is a genius."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-04,"how come no one is asking why higgs looks like amelie now? he now has her hair, hes wearing her necklace, he even moves more. feminine this time around. did he somehow come back from the beach as a mixture of her, similar to metal gear solid 2 with how liquid came back through ocelot?"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-01,"415 what graphic madness this is, simply wow"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-03-06,"i didnt beatb death stranding before the reveal of the sequel, but as soon as it starting playing during the state of play i stopped it, went and reinstalled death stranding directors cut on the ps5, and played it from start to finish in about a months time mostly on the ps portal now im back here. it was worth it."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-31,you know the soundtrack for this game is going to be amazing !
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-05,this is how game trailers should be made.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-31,"by far my favorite sign of this trailer is the new enviornments. savanahs, deserts, the moon, avalanchefilled mountains, it truly seems like it will be an achievement to overcome such harsh terrain and looks to be far more tolerable if not fullon enjoyable in this game compared to the last which was still enjoyable but hard to push through at times."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-03-26,just finished the directors cut  what a journey  looking forward to part 2
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-31,troy baker went full dante with the guitar
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-01,wow the moon scene is incredible
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-01,i do like that sam is more expressive and more comfortable with talking to people this time around.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-16,"robot samurai, guitar that shoots lightning, a puppet man thingy. a giant hand monster. yep, this is some of hideos best work."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-31,when the ship flew out of the bb's mouth i just about fell out of my chair
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-06,"unrestrained kojima is something to behold. still pushing technical and artistic boundaries, but even more baffling than ever before."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-04-02,652 anyone else notice he's playing bb's theme but metal?
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-03,higgs is the one villain i love. his voice actor is amazing.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-31,oh it's kojima so this will be weird after watching the trailer ....yeah
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-06,046 that tune hits hard..so nice little touch so majestic
Action,Death Stranding,2024-05-19,351 are we going to egypt to study about their findings on afterlife and death stranding?
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-04,"305 mimir was just chilling, then bang, stray shots out of nowhere"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-31,i really hope that there is a tribute to ryan karazija of low roar.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-31,once there was an explosion...
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-14,528 this entire scene is next level stuff
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-01,"was the puppet man saying really sam, the buttocks?, a funny reference to mimir hanging on kratos's backside in gow?"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-31,the gow reference with the puppet was awesome. he looks great.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-01,that electric guitar was electric!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-09-19,that shot with the giant moon as backdrop is insane
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-31,"yoji shinkawa is an absolute beast, these games would not be where they are today without him"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-31,norman reedus and the funky fetus 2  beach day
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-04,"even if it leaves us with questions, i always appreciate the amount of details and art that goes with these shots that only kojima knows how to produce? truly looking at a genius in his craft."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-03-15,that music at 814
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-01,low roar we will miss you
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-31,"a lowframe alan wake puppet as your guide  thats the most kojima thing ive ever seen higgs back with a joker face, ironman suit and with an electric guitar that shoots lasers and also used as an axe  i stand corrected"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-31,kojima sure does know how to make a game engine sing for him. what a gorgeous looking game.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-09-21,"just finished death stranding directors cut and im hyped for this. an incredible game that needs way more recognition. the effort put into these performances, the visuals and concepts was something ive never seen in a game. im excited to see whats next for sam and lou"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-31,troy baker goes completely dante ssstyle and i'm loving it!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-08,i'm surprised hideo kojima didn't bring back mads mikkelsen for this considering just how much of a big fan he is of the danish actor.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-01,140 the character models look like they were shot on film and dropped into the game. incredible.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-06-20,more excited for this than gta6
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-01,305 sam tried pulling a kratos lol
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-01,"that guitar fight scene is awesome, dmc 3 meets metal gear rising"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-01,500 as sigrun would say mimir is that you?
Action,Death Stranding,2024-03-11,the soundtrack is at 754 minutes  xan griffin  capricorn feat. wolfe
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-01,those designers deserve some credit for higgs using that guitar as a weapon!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-01,"the low frame rate puppet guy is dope af. edit i am aware this is called stop motion since this is a video game and not a movie, i am assuming they are using frame rate tricks to emulate a stop motion feel. if someone knows more about how that works, id like to know!"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-31,"the guitar fight sequence was wacky and awesome, and i burst out into laughter because its so kojima. say what you will but this game has so many creative and obscure concepts"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-02,"i just finished death stranding. and the ending blew me away, such a genius way of storytelling."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-03,kojima deserves an artist of the century award. what a journey this game is
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-08,"this is probably one of the best composed trailers i've seen in a really long time, i love kojima"

Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-31,"i guess he really meant when kojima said he didn't want to predict the future with his games, the game is going full scifi and digging in even more in the supernatural. for those who don't know, kojima said in his podcast if i'm not mistaken that after the pandemic he scrapped what the original ds2 script was and started all over."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-02-19,"this song gives me this specific vibe. a kind of warm unconditional love for someone youll never get to meet, someone who due to your efforts get to live and experience life with only a small mark from you. kind of like cave paintings from our ancestors, showing we lived here once. in the end we are all connected, after all."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-07-25,"when sam desperately tried to wake lou up, i was blasted with tears, never have i cried like a little child since the past 3 years. death stranding might not be kojima's magnum opus, but it is truly an art that speaks. it is a shame that art can not be enjoyed by all human being, but that is what it is."

Action,Death Stranding,2021-01-19,"an absolutely perfect song to an incredible emotional journey. kojima should be proud of himself for creating a game that not only defies traditional game conventions, but tells a narrative with a powerful message about society, humanity, and connecting together when things become desperate. i cheered at every obstacle a passed, i sighed at every roadblock i encountered, and even got frustrated when the odds went against me. and yet, i loved every second of it. thats how truly powerful death stranding is."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-21,finished the game tonight. made me cry and i'm not ashamed of it
Action,Death Stranding,2021-12-26,"this song hits different when you finished the game. it brings you back for all the journey you've been through, from defeating bts, delivering those packages or even just enjoying the world's view. it concludes them all in 1 song. you can take my heart, death stranding"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-01,"i love that they make music for games... it does not only make them more sympathetic, it also makes the game more memorable."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-22,"here in my country, public transportation was prohibited during the lockdown. during the first few months, i had to walk from my home to the essential places i had to go to, usually kilometers away. i delivered and picked up supplies with goods, do groceries, sent messages, et cetera. you best believe every time i had to go out and walk, i had this song on loop. i will never forget this year. i will never forget this song. p.s. things are better here now, at least, and i finally got a scooter to move around."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-02,"been a fan since the mother we share, but i never expected this. im gonna enjoy this game a lot"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-17,well that was one hell of an ending
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-25,"it may sound like an exaggeration but death stranding truly changed my life. for the first time in my life i really deliberately took my time while playing a video game  taking fun pictures with bb, going the long way during missions, stopping at a mountain's peak to take in the view, and it made me realize i can do that in real life too. i don't need to rush through what i'm doing right now to get to the next thing faster. then, when i reached the end of the game, it felt like i was starting to understand what the game, and kojima were trying to tell us. this is only my interpretation but i think the whole point of the game is to realize how important our connection to others matters to the fabric of the world. the more hostile, far apart we are from each other, the more vulnerable we are to the extinction of our society. the more we stay connected and make a conscious effort to help each other without asking for anything back like when you put down a ladder or a bridge to make somebody else's traversal a little easier because you remember how much you struggled at that specific spot, the more resistant our world becomes to decay. i was late on the ds train and i had mid expectations from the game before buying it because i had seen some reviews like dunkey's video on it. i was completely wrong. i have never felt about a video game like i feel about death stranding. i have never felt as connected to other players as i felt while playing death stranding, and after finishing the game i actually took its mantra to heart and put the connection i had with others irl at the top of my priority list. thank you kojima  team, and i can't wait for death stranding 2, i'm not putting any expectations on it other than i hope they put that same importance on helping each other."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-01,it sound so optimistic in contrasts to death stranding's dark world. love how it all fits though in a surreal way!
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-02,only true legends are here before death stranding is released
Action,Death Stranding,2021-01-11,"this is seriously one of the best songs i've ever heard. haven't played the game, but i love chvrches. powerful music here."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-03,"after all the promotion, this song is what has me hyped for death stranding"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-30,humanity is a very special thing to exist in this reality of world rather implementing as a weapon or a tool...death stranding is just a masterpiece to experience the entire journey as a role playing porter....hideo kojima should be given oscar for the achievement that he made in this game...
Action,Death Stranding,2021-06-30,i had this song played at my dad's funeral. i introduced him to chvrches and particularly this song before he died and he said it was instantly likeable. this song hits hard for me now. but what a song to remember him by..
Action,Death Stranding,2021-05-18,"this game is misunderstood masterpiece. you can only judge it fully when you play it yourself. damn the amount of feels i had in the last few hours, and then the plot twist was a gut punch  this game will forever hold a special place in many hearts."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-02,this might be the most positive comments section ive ever read. and well deserved too. ive been a chvrches fan for years and saw them live last year so i dont want to sound like i havent enjoyed their music. but can we get a whole album like this!?
Action,Death Stranding,2021-07-10,"this is my song to my wife 15th of june 2021 when we got married. in the evening i gave her one final gift, a music box custom made with our song of a 10 year relationship and then played this song in the background. telling her she can take my heart and will hold it together as we fall apart. she cried in my arms and said i will love you till the end of time, always and forever. i love you amber davies"

Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-01,i can already tell this game is going to be a religious experience.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-03,"i finished the game like 2 weeks ago, still cant stop thinking about it, i missed lou! thanks kojima! keep on repeating this song!!!"

Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-14,"as a chvrches superfan, wasnt 100 sure on the song when i first heard, but after listening a few times it is honestly now one of my favourite of theirs, this must be for the end of the game or the beginning, no way is a song like this going to be slotted somewhere in the middle, its something that i feel like would tearjerk if something devastating were to happen in the end"

Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-17,"let's open up to the sky askin' it for closure 'least we can say that we tried but it's never really over what will become of us all at the end of the line? will we live? will we die? isn't this basically the entire plot of the game? trying our hardest as a species to live in spite of an uncertain fate? hell, isn't that the plot of real life?"

Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-02,it's been the best chvrches song for a long time. i really like it!
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-06,"i read a review on metacritic about death stranding he said it was a piece of garbage yet he rated nhl20 and wolfenstein youngblood at higher scores. the media is not happy with this game by the sounds of it and the negatives they are giving about how boring the game is but they are missing the pure concept that death stranding is about connecting. our modern society lacks connecting or connections with people. we are all glued to smartphones, laptops, gaming consoles that we are too busy to build connections outside of those realms. like kojima said in the bbc newsbeat episode, this game even playing alone it makes you feel like your not alone. the asynchronous multiplayer aspect makes you connect with people that have built bridges across rivers that you couldnt cross or stored gear that you needed and liking what other people have done. its all about being human."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-01,this is so cool. the fact the death stranding and kojipro are able to inspire other artists to create such beautiful things is amazing!
Action,Death Stranding,2020-04-25,"finished the game today and what should i say? yes i cried and yes death stranding is an absolute masterpiece, in every possible way!"

Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-15,"i knew that when the song started that that was it. it made me sad. i think i never was so sad when a game ended, simply because i wanted it to go on and on and on. kojima, you are awesome."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-11-22,its no accident that the beat is like a heartbeat. such a great song and honestly one of my top songs of all time. such a treasure
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-07,why death stranding is a good game? because people who finished it never says it was bad.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-17,"verse 1 let's make a toast to the damned waitin' for tomorrow when we're played out by the band drowning out our sorrows what will become of us now at the end of time? we'll be fine, you and i let's draw a line in the sand, keep it straight and narrow we had it all in our hands, we begged and then we borrowed what will become of us all at the end of love when we've stopped looking up? chorus you can take my heart and hold it together as we fall apart maybe together we can make a mark in the stars we embark and keep us together as the lights go dark verse 2 let's tell the truth, just for once, asking for an answer now that it's all said and done, nothing really matters what will become of us all if we dare to dream at the end of the scene? chorus you can take my heart hold it together as we fall apart maybe together we can make a mark in the stars we embark and keep us together as the lights go dark verse 3 let's open up to the sky, askin' it for closure 'least we can say that we tried, but it's never really over what will become of us all at the end of the line? will we live? will we die? chorus you can take my heart and hold it together as we fall apart maybe together we can make a mark in the stars we embark and keep us together as the lights go dark and you can take my heart and hold it together as we fall apart maybe together we can make a mark in the stars we embark and keep us together as the lights go dark"

Action,Death Stranding,2021-05-30,"i hadn't played any games of kojima's, but i'd heard of death stranding from the first trailer and how different and cryptic it was. i was interested to see what kind of story and atmosphere it would bring, but forgot about it until i first discovered this song. i knew i wanted to get the game just from this song, even if it was in some genre i didn't normally play, or on a console i had! i super enjoyed the game! i listen to the soundtrack on a regular basis, and relating it to the context it played in the game adds another layer to the music"

Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-05,"i'm not sure what's weirder, the guitar saber that shoots electrical pulses, or baby lou giggling in cyber samurai form as he fights to the death"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-01,only kojima would do a 9min release trailer with multiple endings.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-01,"what's crazy about hideo kojima games is,when he puts out a game, the trailer is exactly how that game looks when you play it."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-05,"kojima sense of visual style is a masterpiece, he totally goes all out in his vision. it just amazing to see that there's no one holding him back and he has all the freedom to explore his creativity"

Action,Death Stranding,2016-06-14,i have no idea what just happened but i'm hyped
Action,Death Stranding,2017-11-29,when this trailer first came out i felt a huge personal connection to it. at the time my wife and i just experienced our 3rd loss miscarriage in attempting to have kids. an emergency surgery on my wife due to a blown out fallopian tube and a scraped out fetus. i was shattered but numb. catatonic. then this trailer came out and i watched it not knowing what to expect since kojimas use of imagery. seeing the newborn laying next to norman and him picking up the infant gave me some warmth like a long journey for the 2 and they made it. but then the sudden vanishing of the baby welled up my eyes with tears. i was attempting to hold them back. and the camera panning down to reveal his cross like csection scar on his stomach. the flood gates opened. i felt like life was stolen from me after seeing the trailer. the song from low roar and the trailer fit so well for me. it allowed me to finally mourn. an anchor was released from me. i severely needed the weights lifted. bottling all the pain up like a typical male. it wasnt healthy. 2 more losses for me and my wife i continued to watch this for my own personal therapy when i would feel like a zombie going through the motions in life. im happy to say me and my wife after a huge battle with consistent losses we we are 29 weeks pregnant. had to turn to science and go the ivf route. expecting a baby girl. you can feel free to judge or make troll comments. but this trailer is something special to me. im more than sure when the game comes out that it wont have anything to do with an experience that i had. but it wont stop me from playing the game. i just want to close this with saying a simple thank you to hideo kojima.
Action,Death Stranding,2016-06-14,"as long as this game makes tons of money, gets great reviews, and has konami crying in the car, i'll support this regardless of how weird it looks lol."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-20,"you came here after the ending, didn't you?"
Action,Death Stranding,2016-11-20,when you watch a normal game reveal trailer  cool looks like a good game hopefully its good. when you watch kojima's game reveal trailer  wait what..............
Action,Death Stranding,2016-11-06,at the same time that it says a hideo kojima game the song is saying i'll keep coming. i think kojima is sending konami a message.
Action,Death Stranding,2016-06-14,"damn kojima, didn't you just leave konami? this guy works fast, looking forward to this."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-08,"london bridge is falling down, falling down, falling down. london bridge is falling down, my fair lady."

Action,Death Stranding,2016-06-14,"he eventually finds himself inexplicably stranded on a slimy expanse of hellish black mire which extended about him in monotonous undulations as far as he could see...the region was putrid with the carcasses of decaying fish, and of other less describable things which he saw protruding from the nasty mud of the unending plain. a portion of the ocean floor... thrown to the surface by a volcanic upheaval, exposing regions which for innumerable millions of years had lain hidden under unfathomable watery depths.  dagon, h.p. lovecraft"

Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-22,"i just recently finished death stranding, and i so wish i could forget everything and play it all over again. the experience, the emotions, the story, the environment, everything about this game blew my mind. it was the hype from p.t. that really got me into video games in the first place, and the fact that i got a ps4 just in time to experience the hype for ds, i feel an odd sense of nostalgia and relief being able to play this game in the first few months of its release. im really excited to see what kojima has planned for the future!"

Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-11,"it is actually quite fascinating how this old trailer is close and representative of the final game, particularly of its plot and symbolism. when i saw it the first time, i was sure that it was just the surreal hodgepdge which kojima had put together just to show anything whatsoever on e3."
Action,Death Stranding,2016-06-14,how much acid did hideo do when he came up with this
Action,Death Stranding,2019-06-13,"even after all the trailers and the release date reveal, the first trailer has got them special kind of feels"
Action,Death Stranding,2016-12-03,the baby doll has the same scar as norman
Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-16,"the best trailer for a game, period. the music is perfect. the trailer kept people intrigued. the game at the end, even with its flaws, is a masterpiece."
Action,Death Stranding,2016-06-14,"come one kojima we get it, you made the game kojima productions, by hideo kojima, a hideo kojima game, script by hideo kojima, produced by hide kojima"
Action,Death Stranding,2016-06-14,hideo kojima must love norman because he was supposed to be in silent hills before konami canceled it
Action,Death Stranding,2016-06-15,"i have no idea what kind of game this could possibly be, but i hope its an amazing work of storytelling and makes enough money to make konami cry all over their pachinko machines."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-08,who is here after the release. !
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,i just like how there are still tons of mushroom clusters outside of conan's shelter in the game from people constantly peeing there.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,they didn't mention that the players keep peeing on conan's location in the game
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,"for what it's worth, conan wasn't just a joke. he was a bright spot in a very dark and heavy gaming experience. ps! thanks for the hat, conan."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-05-28,knowing that guillermo del toro was integral to norman reedus' career makes sam and deadman's interactions extra wholesome.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,"wouldnt it be strange if conan, norman, del toro, and kojima collaborated again for this supposed new silent hill project? conan can be a long legged creature design or a boss for sure!"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,conan looks like a ps1 character next to norman.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,212 norman my poop is a weapon some lady in the background oh yeah
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,conan is the first strand type talkshow host
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-25,the poop grenade is actually pretty useful
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-23,the way he moved his arms when he said how the character doesn't want to be touched is exactly how the character reacts when someone tries to touch him in the game's cut scenes.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-22,moral of the story always say yes to hideo kojima.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,i want norman reedus and conan to do a clueless gamer for death stranding together
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,norman reedus and his fetus
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,death stranding was such a phenomenal experience. i can only see norman reedus as sam porter bridges and i finished the game months ago
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,death stranding was over sold and then under appreciated imo. its a fantastic game and story. geared more towards relaxing gameplay than action but still satisfying and rewarding.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,its sooo weird to look at him moving after playing this game for weeks
Action,Death Stranding,2021-04-04,"at 53 years old, norman is the best looking 30 something year old i have ever seen."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,i can't believe he said poop on television
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,"the world really needs sam porter right now, my toilet paper hasn't arrived yet"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,"can i say poop? norman reedus, 2020"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,234 love conan and andy's evil laugh haha
Action,Death Stranding,2021-03-13,"i'm loving this game. i feel it will be a cult classic, not given the love it deserved after launch, but it will slowly find its audience over time, those who go in with expectations in check, undriven by hype."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,"i made it my goal to not fully progress through the game until i met conan obrien. worth it. that otter hood was not just adorable, but its saved my deliveries multiple times. awesome game."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-21,amazing how relevant a story about an isolated world cut off from one another and a delivery man who doesn't want to touch anyone became so soon after it released.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,i love norman he's so sweet and down to earth
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-14,norman looks like he shouldnt be wearing a suit.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-10,having conan's hologram chilling by my ziplines to greet people as they walk up w his silly hat and crazy poses is just the best.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,the interview ive waited for
Action,Death Stranding,2021-01-27,"as a director, watching all the little normanisms in death stranding honestly excited me so much. it really feels like i'm watching actors act, rather than just be there to fill in a model and get a cutscene made and sold. it feels like a feature that would have been a joy to be part of."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-14,im glad to see actors and such open up to being in video games. what a wonderful time we are in
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,"this show has only improved since its beginning, and it keeps getting better. conan is awesome"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-13,you went from silent hills to this and what a reward it was waiting for. i understand others not liking it but i find this game a damn pleasure. thanks norman for being our main character.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-12-26,i love how norman reedus sounds super proud telling conan about the poop grenade
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,"hideo came to my city to promote the game and meet fans. he mentioned in the interview that norman reedus, while coming across badass because of his walking dead role, actually has a 'cute' and nice kind of character irl. i found that hard to believe, but here we are..."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-02-07,"phenomenal game! the games movement physics, the beautiful environment and the amazing sound track make this one of my all time favourite games.its very different but in a great way.loved it!!!"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-03-23,such a great game. sam bridgesnorman reedus really makes the game for me. one of the few games that really jerks some tears out of you.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,norman has such a gentle yet firm spirit  he seems like he calms a room just by his presence
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-13,can i say poop? not on nickelodeon meanwhile at nickelodeon people order our patties!!!
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-14,a guy named hideo. love that.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-13,the only game where i actively cared about delivering packages.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-15,i really enjoy hearing norman talk about this character of his in particular. kojima did a fantastic job imo in terms of the themes chosen for this game. keep on keeping on.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,"thumbs up if you want clueless gamer brought back!!! come on conan you got to interview kojima san and got to be in death stranding, most gaming journalists didnt even accomplish one of those things!!!!!"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,see the sunset the day is ending let that yawn out there's no pretending
Action,Death Stranding,2023-02-11,"i feel death stranding is the best game produced in a long, long time. it's so difficult to encapsulate and explain why to people in a succinct way yet unfortunately too many people brushed it off early, but there really is an incredibly creative, ambitious, gorgeous, and frankly very fun and fulfilling game in there. i believe it's a game that will find its due appreciation as time goes on, it may have been a bit much for people who didn't know what to expect, but in the meantime, we have death stranding 2 with reedus, elle fanning, lea seydoux, and others to look forward!"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,"i still think about ds, such a wonderful game. that bb theme moment, good lord."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-24,this dude did a amazing job as sam theres truly love for this game original af and slept on thankyou hideo and all actorsactresses
Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-15,"started playing death stranding again a couple weeks ago as the directors cut came out. i know it got mixed reviews, but its basically my most enjoyable gaming experience ive even had."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-14,"death standing, the game that made everyone a clueless gamer."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,"i loved death stranding. definitely not a conventional game by any means, but one of my favorite games in years for how immersive and unique it is."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-02-12,the game was absolutely beautiful. cannot wait for part two
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,i've been waiting for them to talk about this since the game came out
Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-17,"this game was definitely a breath of fresh air in a decade or so of nothing but cod, bf, and witcher 3 clones. i loved it."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-10-31,death stranding is incredible. most excellent experience i have had. a master piece.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-16,"the graphics on this game are easily the best on any mainstream video game that exists. if you have an oled, the landscapes and everything else seriously look real."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,i wanna chug 5 monster energy drinks for some odd reason
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-14,"i can listen to him speak for so long, his voice is relaxing"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,"conan, thanks for the otter hood really saved my skin a couple of times"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,throwing poop grenades and conan gives you a otter hat. otter hat!!!!!
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-25,"this was posted a year ago, i get it. just wanted to say thank you for adding your talents to one of the most beloved visionaries of our gaming generation. death stranding is art that so many of us crave from our preferred medium, and you supported it, and so, us. hideo, norman, conan and so many others i expect you won't see this but it means a lot to me to be able to say thank you."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-14,death stranding was fantastic and oddly addicting. i put 117 hours into the game because i could not stop building stuff. hahaha. i even made a little short animated parody as well recently.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-02-19,130 that's how masterpieces are made
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,i like his voice. it's so gentle
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,norman reedus carrying feetus
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-12,loved sam in death stranding! conan was hilarious as well. definitely one of my favorite games.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-20,i just started playing ds for ps5.... i'm inlove with this game
Action,Death Stranding,2021-12-16,"after 100 hours of death stranding, norman reedus feels digital"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,"when hideo calls, say yes you hear that konami?!"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-14,"this game is so much fun, i'm on my 145th hour now and just looking for ds content to devour on yt. i really like how strange the game is, how all the players are connected with each other. norman reedus really fits in to the role of sam and seeing conan was such a fun surprise. some minor things feel maybe too weird, but even the fecal matter grenades make sense. a definite 910 game."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-13,this is the first strandtype of interview
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-17,thank both of you. death standing is really a wonderful game
Action,Death Stranding,2021-01-16,keep on keeping on.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-17,playing the game again right now for thr pc release... and really i think this might be a record or something for the most detailed and robust use of mocap of all time. sam is super believable and expressive as a person inhabiting the world. and the acting from reedus is great both vocally and classically.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-05,norman has no idea how clapping works ahaha loved ds tho 150hrs of delivery
Action,Death Stranding,2021-01-18,233 norman saying its great like hideos got a sniper rifle trained on him
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,"i really enjoyed death stranding, but i swear to god, i never knew conan was in the game."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-31,hearing kojima being talked about on a talk show is so cool
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-23,im sam! helloooooo?!?
Action,Death Stranding,2023-02-06,215 can i say poop? god i love him
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,"jimmy fallon, take notes! this is how you interview your guests. let them talk and tell their stories with no interruptions."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-09-27,i delivered packages for conan.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-12-15,death stranding is by far one of the best and one of the most profoundly strange video games of all time. i am entirely convinced that not a single person was sober during the entire production of the game and it is a masterpiece.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-11-06,norman reedus just exudes joie d'vivre. what a powerful aura.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-04-01,005 he does the clap haha
Action,Death Stranding,2021-01-12,this actor is amazing and has the look as a zombie slayer. nice
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-15,i guess i would also say yes if hideo kojima hit me up
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-14,021 conan on death stranding looks like palpatine lol
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-13,"when i started playing i was like hideo wtf is this the game irritated me for the first 6 to 8 hours of playing it. i was trying and doing all sorts of things you're just not supposed to do. walking, climbing and driving where you shouldn't do any of those things. i wanted to quite several times but thank goodness i didnt! i kept playing and kept learning. i think after 10 maybe 12 hours of playing, without noticing the game grabbed a hold of me and didnt let go untill after i saw the credits roll!"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-11-23,"since i loved darryl dixon so much as a tv character, its awesome to see norman compare sam porter bridges to his walking dead counterpart. i just finished the story to death stranding last night. wickedly deep game with a lot of lore written in via npc emails to the character, and log interviews with a ton of backstory."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,"best game last year thoroughly enjoyed the world, characters, and gameplay."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-25,"when i first saw conan in ds, i was absolutely dying laughing..."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,conan should be the psycho mantis for the upcoming metal gear solid film.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-03-21,conan's cameo in the game was really funny
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,the great conando kicking ass.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-15,norman sounds like such a surfer dude.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,god i love death stranding. it's sad people don't give it a chance and hate on it because all they think it is is walking.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,"my poop turns into a grenade i am not a fan of poopfart humor, but for some reason this phrase had me"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,i am playing death stranding now
Action,Death Stranding,2021-01-09,norman looks much younger in the game than irl. man i loved his performance in death stranding.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-12,conan having a really hard time remembering hideo kojima's name lol
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-29,"the only talk show host that will actually get himself into things others wont bc they were told no. like he gets himself into so much that makes him a better host to enjoy, with so many things but like cmon a game. no one does that idc how much they care"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-19,"kojima doesn't want you to suffer, he wants you to reduce the suffering of others  the best line about death stranding i've come across in any review."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-06-26,"death stranding is literally the definition of i had to walk, so you could run"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-19,i think the statement when you stop playing for yourself and start playing for others hits the nail on head on what makes the game so amazing.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-04-30,funny how some dude's girlfriend understood what so many gamers and professional game journalists failed to understand.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-19,it's a revelation that the weight you carry is not yours alone. everyone is walking the same difficult paths and everyone feels overencumbered. daym
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-19,using the office's scene to compare kojima and konami's relationship had me dying lol
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-19,"mr rogers , because when you look for the helpers, youll know that theres hope me"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-21,"after reading an article about kojima's departure with konami....i thought i had lost everything, but i found out that i had a lot of connections. like sony people, like norman reedus, like geoff keighley. i really wanted to reconnect with these people that i thought were really important. im sure that death stranding is what kojima experience..."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-19,"this isn't a review of death stranding, this is how death stranding convinced me video games have potential beyond belief i almost cried"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-20,kojima doesnt want you to suffer. he wants you to reduce the suffering of others. shelby
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-20,this nonreview was actually the best review ive seen and gave a clear reflection of the message being told.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-01,so nobody's gonna talk about the amazing singing at the end? alright.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-27,"whether you love or hate death stranding, we should all applaud when someone tries to push how high they can fly. you blew me away. this is what people not getting and hating the game for no reason"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-21,so kojima got tired of people on the internet being assholes all the time and made a whole ass big deal video game to teach us all to be nice? what a cool dude.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-19,"gfr hideo kojima puts his name on every game he makes tom clancy sweats edit holy sht people, we all know tom clancy is dead, and he is an author, not a game director. people commenting acts like it's a secret knowledge only the elite know. i'm just making fun that his name is slapped on everything."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-05-27,"i got this game as a gift when recovering from surgery. it was a hysterectomy, so playing a game caring for a crying fetus and the frustrations of falling all over the place wasn't exactly a welcome distraction from my situation. i put the game aside, and in the meantime my husband picked it up. he too quit after a short while! then, he eventually got back into it and convinced me to try again. now it's one of my favorite games of all time. i've finished all the trophies and am going back to play from the start again. it's significantly less frustrating this time, and a more healing experience too, helping me come to terms with not being able to have children. it's ok though, i have a dog and lots of love and happiness. best review ever  you've gained a subscriber! keep on keeping on  edit oh my goodness so much support, i didn't realize. wow, this community is really great, that's so nice. making me emotional actually."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-26,"this was absolutely the best nonreview i have seen all over the internet. gamespot, ign, gamesradar etc, didn't come close to this well written and spoken piece. well done!"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-04-19,did you just....did you just make me get teary eyed over a video game review for a game i have never played? this was a seriously beautiful sentiment.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-05,why are we still here? to reduce the suffering of others?
Action,Death Stranding,2021-06-29,"i rebuilt the entire highway by myself by claiming supplies from the different places, raiding the mules and driving around in a truck to deliver them to the stations. up until that point the game was annoying. then i realised the whole point of the gameplay was to make traversing the environment easier. finished the story now but will go back and create a network of ziplines to take people to every city and npc and then get every delivery done."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-16,"this video sold me death stranding few weeks ago and now, after 70 hours of gameplay i think that kojima deserves every damn penny i payed for this. truly breathtaking experience!"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-19,"not for everyone to me is probably the highest praise in the current gaming era, even if im part of the people its not for."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-18,"to all you porters out there who shared this path with me, keep on keeping on"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-06,"the ending really drove this in for me. there was a moment when navigating the last delivery that it seemed like i couldn't make it. i didn't have many supplies for the long trek initially, time fall rain was everywhere and bts where flooding the entire area. worse yet i couldn't fabricate anything new. so i was running as quickly as i could not to lose the package as i wasn't sure what would happen if i did i thought maybe there was alternate endings and i'd get a bad one. and then i'd stumble onto a barely operational time fall shelter made by another player. there was something i experienced in these moments when complete strangers saved my ass and they had no idea. the hand full of likes given can't really convey how much i appreciated it. and then it dawned on me how there were probably countless players that experienced moments like these in all these structures i've seen dotting the landscape. gone was the perspective that these were just meaningless fake internet points. i finally realized that countless players experienced moments like this. all those structures dotting the landscape looked completely different. even the one off ladder with 20 points seemed like it was likely very helpful for another player. the game has it's problems but it's still one of my favorite games of the last decade."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-19,death stranding looks like the most interesting game i would absolutely hate playing.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-19,this is by far the best review on ds i've ever seen.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-30,begining of review no way im putting myself through so much frustration! end of review maybe i should give it a try
Action,Death Stranding,2020-11-26,"my favorite part of this game is that you do not suffer alone, you suffer together. you support your fellow porters and they support you to the end. in large battles they appear to give you much needed equipment. having completed it two times, i have a great appreciation of the work and love that was put into the game. hats off to hideo kojima and my fellow porters. keep on keeping on."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-19,"735 me, constantly raiding mule camps for truckloads of materials and building tons of roadway sections at a time. it ain't much but it's honest work"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-03,when people search death stranding review this needs to be the first video that pops up.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-14,"i love how bb cries everytime we shoot a lethal weapon, and even more cries when killing a mule or terrorist. just shows that violence isn't the way"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-12-24,one day this channel will be called wife reviews
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-19,i have watched so many death stranding reviews  this was the only one that truly moved me. well done!
Action,Death Stranding,2020-05-01,"this was an amazing way to review this game that no real game reviewer came close to.. wow edit wow i pissed off some people. enjoy what you want to enjoy, i just don't enjoy this game, but do enjoy the story. no hard feelings there"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-19,"this was such a stunning take on death stranding. no ups reference, no boring gameplay but good story generic review. you can tell these guys are both artists because they appreciated the game on a whole other level than game reviewers!"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-04-22,"the first and only game that changed me, before playing i was going on a self destructive path that would've lead me to become a sad cynical person but this game make me realize that it's better to help each other and come together to make the best out of it, to reconnect with people, to keep on keeping on..."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-19,the end hit me harder than i imagined. thank you shelby...
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-19,me before watching  this gonna be really funny me after watching  why am i crying
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-25,"i just beat death stranding and started letting myself look at reviews. this is quite honestly, one of the best reviews for this game. well articulated and meaningful. youve earned my like and sub."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-01-14,"i love everything about this game! none of that happens if you aren't in a hurry. you aren't supposed to be in a hurry with this game. this game is so relaxing, beautiful and genius! if you play it like its designed to be played it is perfect!"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-19,037 it's amazing how applicable the office is to almost any situation.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-19,a year later and still no boyfriend reviews should your girlfriend play animal crossing?
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-19,still remember the time i was like 'hmm this girl is funny. i hope this channel gets some traction'
Action,Death Stranding,2020-06-19,death stranding convinced me that video games have potential beyond belief. love this! i hope this quote makes it onto some kind of advertising for the game.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-19,"sent chills down my spine when you sang at the end. hot damn, that's so good."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-19,how has it been a year is time even real i'm so old
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-21,"755 made me think of bebop youre gonna carry that weight but death stranding says, we're gonna carry that weight"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-05-10,its been like 2 years...but the moment when you come over a hill after a long trek with a ton of cargo and you can finally see your destination at port knot city and it starts playing asylum for the feelings by silent poets...thats the moment where the game clicked for me and stopped being just a video game where you hold the shoulder buttons while you trek across barren landscapes and started being a work of beauty unlike anything else ive ever experienced
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-20,me when i got to the song at the end its a terrible day for rain
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-26,"the weight you carry is not yours alone. everyone is walking the same difficult paths and everyone feels overencumbered. honestly, that was such a beautiful way to put it. i personally loved this game, and i never played a hideo kojima game before. i always dabbled in games that had a narrative, and i was honestly scared of getting into this game because of the negative reviews and how people were saying this game was boring. i'm glad i stuck with it. yes, the game has its flaws and the gameplay can push people away and that's fine, this game is not for everyone and there are things in this game that some people will hate and some people will love. death stranding was an experience for me, there was lots of frustration, tears, and happiness, and to my fellow porters who built bridges, ladders, generators, postboxes, timefall shelters, and much more thank you so much. you made my experience and journey a worthy and beautiful one."

Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-16,"i avoided playing this game because i knew it wasn't for me so i waited years until i was in the right mindset. so i'm finally playing this game for the first time ever because i'm looking for something where i can just chillout. the game is not over the top in spectacle which is nice whenever my cats decide to get on my lap since i know the game isn't intense. you need to have a certain mindset going into this game, otherwise you might get frustrated."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-20,"girlfriend reviews come for the memes, stay for the feels"

Action,Death Stranding,2021-05-16,"man the last 2 mins of this review where such an eye opener, it really hits home with how we all are feeling i guess"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-22,"i've spent so many hours attacking mules camp to collect resources and use these resources to build roads, bridges or anything else that would contribute to the journey of other players. there is something very satisfying in seeing notifications pop up as i play   player id used the bridge you built  player id used the road you built  xxx players appreciated your efforts  xxx likes obtaine  player id delivered a lost cargo as i played i also saw other contributions like bridges, roads, ropes and vehicles left free for use . i made sure to show my appreciation each time i used something prepared by an other player. it's the first time i play a multiplayer game where i never see the other players yet feel so engaged in a common effort to move forward and help each others . the first hours were rough and tedious but it really serves as a strong contrast to how the game expands when you reach chapter 3 60hours into the game and i love it."

Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-19,embrace hope and reject despair i really hope this is a tease for girlfriend reviews danganronpa.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-13,"if the opening hours weren't so cruel, if the traversal wasn't so punishing, all that goodwill wouldn't hit so hard. kojima doesn't want you to suffer, he wants you to reduce the suffering of others. this is the best nonreview i have seen so far of this game. all of the reviews who give death stranding low scores, or those who hate on the game, were clearly missing the point. to be honest, i did miss the point too, i initially found the game boring didn't hate it though, just didn't care. but you have so very articulately eli5'ed to me what had gone over my head by a mile. so thank you. you clearly have an unbiased approach to your observations of games, and for that you have my sub. 3"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-19,"thank you for a great year of content matt and shelby. if death stranding is your exclamation point of a great year of games, i can honestly say your videos are the exclamation point of great content created this year!"

Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-19,most emotional girlfriend reviews every had me teary eyed
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-04,"coming back to this video after tlou2, really fills me with poignant that there are so few heros left in the industry that try to push the boundaries and do something different. and instead of welcoming it we despise and reject it, and then we wonder how the aaa industry devolved into what it is today sigh now time go see what other wonderful things eaactivision did today, cant wait....."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-19,shelby singing bb's theme should be in the original soundtrack of the game
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-23,"this review blew me away. i have never played death stranding, and i all i have heard from others is that it sucks. being told the point behind the game, and seeing it connect people in a new way.... that just wrecked me."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-19,"first nierautomata, and then this. you guys blows my mind every time you explain the core message using perfectly constructed sentences. your words always flows right into my heart and im literally nodding the entire time watching this video"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-15,"i absolutely love the game, i'm only 67 hours into it, chapter 3 i believe.. the first two hours are a struggle.. but when the game opens up, and you begin to literally build bridges, place ladders, picking up lost cargo from literally other players, leaving things behind to help another player, and getting recognised through the like system, building power stations to charge devices for you and other players.. a single player game has never felt so multiplayer at the same time, you never truly feel alone.. helping others, and the feeling of wanting to help other.. incredible game so far and i've barely tapped the surface of it. currently blasting through side missions, which have so far been great. thank you kojima for this masterpiece."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-23,"most review only focus on the gameplay, its like reviewing movies with only its technical aspect like camera angles and lighting, you review the medium, the performance and the art, you deserve an award!"

Action,Death Stranding,2023-12-03,"don't forget to pick sandalweed whenever you get the chance for the case that you run out of shoes. i had a bout of some very organic gameplay when after heading to the junk dealer i went to drop a few packets off at the filmmakers and i zoned out and didn't realize that he didn't want to be hooked up to the network yet and i accidentally put my boots in the recycler. so set off my way back towards distro south of lake knot with just sandalweed on my feet and a ladder to get across one of the crevices. due to having no stuff on me i could just walk past the sensors, but the patrolling car saw me and reacted to me. but since i had nothing on me they just shooed me off and i skedaddled away. then got to the distro, crafted myself some new stuff and two pairs of extra boots, once which i dropped off at a post box close to the filmmakers place in case of any other porter who'd find themself without shoes."

Action,Death Stranding,2023-10-08,"i love this game a lot. reminds me of my hikes when i would go with friends or by myself. having a backpack full of snacks and water bottles. now after playing ds, all i need is an exosuit and 10 boxes of pizzas and a destination of delivery."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-30,"actually, with porter, mule, or demens corpses, they'll wave you off rapidly, same as when you're just carrying equipment."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-12-18,i was playing and my dad saw this and just said norman fetus and just left i havent laughed so hard in a while
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-08,sam begging for a shower like a sim is iconic
Action,Death Stranding,2023-07-04,"yeah, and i'm kind of glad i didn't see those scenes too."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-02,the utter disrespect of sam. i never let him get this dirty or his feet without shoes.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-07-27,so much details in this game
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-21,"there was a time when i started the game i had the first mission going to butt off nowhere in a steep, forest, btfilled area to get to a station. i never carried extra shoes and did not know it was going to actually tear and leave me with no shoes i had to make it back with like 300 lbs cargo and sandalweeds on the road, not to mention the bts"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-23,i'd love if they tried to steal your shoes.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-11-15,ive played this game twice. all the way through. idk if i can a third time even though i love it so much.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-28,"i used to always see this game get so much flak for being a walking simulator but when i actually played it, it was pretty enjoyable. the game had some top tier cutscenes  a ton of unique, detailed gameplay elements you only get from a kojima game."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-11-19,"i never had this happen to me. i mean you can carry up to two pairs of extra shoes, and if you can gather up omnireflector boots or even chiral boots, you're set for life. ahead of all that, though, bridges boots will do just fine. always check your boots' durability bar. it is pretty crazy how effed up his toes can get if you run barefoot for too long, lol."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-05-14,i had no clue about the fact that you can force sam to walk barefoot until his soles start to bleed jesus christ the detail in this game is just 1010
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-09,"ah yes a mule, very representative of the dunkey that thrives within the strand"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-08-13,who runs out of shoes tho. you can craft them everywhere and they cost almost nothing. i always have 2 pairs extra on with me and i never used them because if my shoe gets damage i just craft a new one
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-15,you know. this game have a spot in my heart. sure i play a few hr at the time but it's the game i can come back to once in a while
Action,Death Stranding,2023-08-15,if your playing normal. but on hard they will try their very best just to knock you down
Action,Death Stranding,2023-08-13,"i never went out bare foot, didn't even know it was an option"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-03-08,how exactly does having messed up feet make his face all bloody?
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-27,one of the most incredible games i have ever played. cant wait for ds2 to come out.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-30,"shower me, please!! no"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-10,"this game is amazing. i had it on playstation when it came out, literally got a playstation just for this game. never beat it, moved on to other games and just forgot about it. sold my playstation and moved up to the series x. the other day i was watching a video about this game and how well it was and it just sparked my memories of the game and i thought to myself that i was gonna have to get another playstation to play it again. i get home after a long day of work and start up the xbox and see death stranding on the xbox main screen. literally the same day i just so happen to think about it. it was on sale, and had just launched on xbox that day, out of no where. i had no clue. needless to say im having a blast replaying it! kojima is amazing and does such a good job on ever game, this one is no different. the art is stunning, i mean its so good. music fits every part of the game so well. its like watching a movie at every cut scene."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-08-02,weakest shoes in the world.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-02,"never knew about didn't wear shoes thing, about the shower please i got it once before. i changed shoes every half bar, never let the shoes goes on yellow bar or red bar."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-20,i am so glad i made sure to renew my boots and carry a spare every chance i could. just seeing him pulling off his toenail almost made me puke.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-25,always collect some sandalweed it's free
Action,Death Stranding,2024-06-05,he's begging to use the potty
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-26,if you give a mouse a cookie ahh sequence
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-13,really taking that walking sim to the next level lol
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-28,"the toenail ripping is just a random easter egg you can get if you zoom in on his feet in the private room. i got it my first time there as i was looking around zooming in on everything. first ripped out one nail, next time did the other foot, third time i got a jumpscare"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-02,watching the death stranding 2 teaser with no context felt like a weird dream to me. i understand nothing and i am very confused.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-17,"getting the speed skeleton, you can run on your feet all day. absolutely get the level 3, level 1 drains way too fast for you to make any good use of it. with the speed skeleton, you can run nearly normal speeds, minus the occasional jumping in pain thing, which you cancel running to cancel the animation and keep on running"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-01,can't wait for ds2 coming next year
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-03,the glaze for this game is always insane!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-06-21,the art abd creativity is on other level
Action,Death Stranding,2024-09-28,i've never had bloody feet so far but oh ow ouch i'll always be sure to bring some extra shoes
Action,Death Stranding,2024-04-20,i'm so glad i keep up on showers and switching shoes
Action,Death Stranding,2023-11-23,this game satisfied my adhd
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-11,i recoiled watching sam pull on his toe.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-10,thanks for telling me about the shoe thing. i will make sure i never run out of shoes!!!!
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-15,i went through mule territory with no cargo and they stole my shoes.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-08,"funny because its more likely for the toenails to come off or loose when wearing shoes and socks than they are barefoot. like with that kind of job, keeping your toenails would be a chore."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-01,i love how realistic tha game is as far as movement when u carry to much stuff u cant walk properly
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-17,that looks like daryl from the walking dead
Action,Death Stranding,2024-09-14,"shit really sad, i hope we can get better as a whole. before im old n senile"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-08,im glad that ive always been such a prepared player that i never once encountered that grotesque scene lol. but i really like the idea of injuries in the next game. you shouldnt be able to drop off a 10 meter ledge with 100 kilos of gear without at the very least spraining something
Action,Death Stranding,2024-06-04,i make extra sure to have at least one extra pair of boots on me at all times. now i know what happens yikes
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-12,i always keep sam comfortable and clean any chance i'm able too
Action,Death Stranding,2023-06-21,ugh! god! that nail bit made me cringe!
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-05,"i hope the difficulty setting in ds2 will involve more than just combat, make me actually look for safer roads or take shelter in caves"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-20,haven't gotten to a part where you gotta remove human remains other than like the very first mission you do in the game but that sounds like it's gonna be crazy
Action,Death Stranding,2024-10-07,","
Action,Death Stranding,2024-10-29,my reedus always wears shoes. so i didnt know about that scene until now.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-13,man i want a christmas hat in death stranding
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-12,played this entire game without ever not having a spare pair of shoes.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-29,im going to take such good care of sam from now on.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-02-17,never watched that scene because i always went with an extra pair of shoes i remember that scene where sam take off his toenail was in one of the trailers
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-05,always wondered what will happen if i kept walking barefoot crazy details
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-04,what's with getting dirty and needing a shower in kojima games?
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-14,kojima really is gaming's quentin tarantino.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-10-04,"bro i have never seen that scene because who tf notices when their shoes start to wear out, doesnt go the nearest fabricator to just make another shoe?"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-06-03,"as im beginning my playthrough,i seen that my shoes are going to wear out,and hell i managed to get some rest after the cargo,but the only thing i just worried was the damage of the cargo made by temporal rains"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-02-07,50 hours in and i've never seen that scene nor ever will. when my boots are low ill recycle them and equip new ones before i even get to the boots on my clip
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-27,you dont have to be that dirty face. wait a few minute he will do that gesture no matter what.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-15,"i was reluctant to purchase this game for a long time because everyone said it was, just a walking simulator. although that is basically true, i am having a lot of fun playing death stranding. i dont know what it is but this game is really fun to me."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-12,who's gonna play it again because ds2 hype?
Action,Death Stranding,2024-05-28,poor sam that made me sad
Action,Death Stranding,2023-08-27,i was curious to see what this games about so i searched up death stranding gameplay and this was the first result. after seeing that toenail scene im never playing this game
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-29,sam asks for a shower literally every time i go into the safe room. idk if its a bug or if sam just really loves to take showers
Action,Death Stranding,2024-03-15,since bt's are affected by blood i wonder if you can escape a bt encounter if you have bleeding feet.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-10,"well, they will be mean to you, they just wont shoot at you."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-19,the shoes are literally hanging of his backpack
Action,Death Stranding,2024-03-09,this just made me realize that bts probably can pull you down if your bare foot bleeding..
Action,Death Stranding,2023-08-24,the feet thing happen to me one time but the mules i did not know that
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-21,i never look at him as sam. i always look at him as him. reedus
Action,Death Stranding,2025-02-02,the quality of this game is unbeatable
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-01,i thow up in the sink after the video
Action,Death Stranding,2024-04-30,"man, i'm feel sad about it when he's begging like that..."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-13,i thought he was hungry
Action,Death Stranding,2023-05-28,the foot jumps are was weird
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-19,"did you know, death stranding has basic mechanics that are explicitly explained to you in the course of gameplay within the first hour"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-03,somebody save the baby!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-13,i prefer to just punch out mules on sight with the power gloves even though i got maxed lvl non lethal guns its way funnier to punch out somebody then it is to waste ammo
Action,Death Stranding,2024-06-05,bro who dosnt carry an extra pair of shoes with them. frfr ur weird if you don't.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,"death stranding is coming to pc! to help you get ready, amd gave me a ryzen 3800 processor to give away to you! be sure to like the video, subscribe and click this link to enter httpsgleam.ioknhrpamdryzen3800cpugiveaway"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,"so that's where that motorcycle ended up haha, awesome. the social strand system was definitely a highlight of this game."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-05,gamerswe are sick of fetch quests kojima what about an entire game that is a fetch quest
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,every time i rode that motorcycle i thought of yong top 10 bromances
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-05,a society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in. thats what i got from your review. thanks for sharing.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,yongyea running his hand down his motorcycle one last time yong out...
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,"as a delivery man myself, i've been really drawn to this game. i can't wait to work all day delivering, then come home and play this delivery game. thank you kojima"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-02,"sure glad this video is 1000 spoiler free, not sure what i would have done if it was only 500 spoiler free!"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-05,"after putting nearly 150 hours into this game, getting all trophies, and watching as many reviews as i can i still come back and say this one mirrors my experience more than any other. this game is one of a kind and will be talked about for years. truly unbelievable what kojima achieved here. i can't get this game out of my head even after spending all that time with it."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,good old skill up. his 'brief' review is still 25 minutes long.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-03,"in death stranding, failure conditions dont seem to really interest kojima. i love this."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,and this is why i love skillup reviews. hands down my favorite reviewer and you never disappoint.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-11-16,"the moment that this game really clicks for me is going to port knot city, when you see it on the horizon and then the extremely somber yet hopeful song kicks on. its such a beautiful moment of introspectioni will hold it with me forever"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,i love this guy. he speaks from heart and i want to listen that.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-02,sees mountains the skyrim player in me challenge accepted
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,"he protecc. he attacc. but most importantly, he deliver dat pacc."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-06,media complains games make killers. kojima makes game that focuses on the journey and story instead of violent combat. media death stranding is a boring walking simulator.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,i hope kojima is happy. so glad hes out of konami and running his own ship
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-03,not for everyone that is definitely a good thing. no game or piece of art should be so watered down that it appeals to everyone's sensibilities. that would just result in every game being the exact same
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,1025 ever scaled the cliffs of skellige just to look down and take it all in slide all the way down fixed that for you.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-07,"i just started playing this game recently, it is surprisingly fucking addicting, idk about you guys but this game is relaxing to play. certainly not for impatient people i would think. but yeah this is peak kojima. i respect his risky attempt to create something artful and unique. a 1010 for me because not every game developer has balls to do something risky for a change"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,"you thought of yong for hours? that's love, my man, that is love"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,this is why i love skill up's review. i wish i had found this channel sooner.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-20,this game wasn't designed to make shareholders happy  but it was designed to make the monster energy drink corperation happy
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-15,"this was the review that almost sold me on the game, none of the other reviews except this one and maybe yongyea's were satisfying. but a few days after watching this i realized i had a long weekend with not much to do so i bought it. it's a great game, and another reason why i think gameplay videos don't always do justice to the games."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-02,asynchronous altruistic multiplayer sounds like the nier e run stretched over an entire playthrough
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,death stranding gives me shadow of the colossus vibes. i never thought i'd see another aaa game like that.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,"as a courier, i look forward to shaking up my evenings with this game"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-02-04,"i can't believe it took me 3 years to play this game. this game is freaking amazing, i can't stop playing it even after finishing the story. which was great. not perfect. but freaking great."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-08,"i think kojima made this as a challenge to himself, or an example to the people who hate him. he took this extremely simple idea, taking one thing and putting it somewhere else, and then made people want to play it. think about it, nobody likes a fetch quest in a game. but fetch quests are this game. he wrapped this fetch quest up in social motivation, interesting plot, and beautiful graphics, then gave it a bow and told you please, enjoy. we did, and we are, and we will. kojima is showing us that he isn't done. he's only getting started."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,"be me, a ups employee skill up it's a fedex simulator instant dislike"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-02-16,"45 hours to complete me, who's play time is 122 hrs so that was a fucking lie"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-18,this review is even better after getting further into the game. the beauty in this game is in how it evolves over time. everything seems like it has purpose and truly does make you feel connected
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,"kojima got me to stop thinking about my time, and my experience points, and my equipment, and he got me thinking about others. death stranding is a socialist game confirmed."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,sony again bagged themselves a banger of a game. they definitely are the place for studios to go if they want the creative freedom to make risky masterpieces.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-04,"hands down the best review i've seen on this so far, and i've watched many today"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-09,"kojima, one day during lunch you guuys, the fetch quest is the game"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,this is someone's review of the game first and foremost and it is honestly one of the best i've ever seen.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,1950s we'll have flying cars in the future 2019 addicting walking simulator
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-13,we need community help. we found a secret in death stranding. if you find a mushroom pee on it ! why? because with several players wee wee on same mushroom it makes a mushroom patch node. how is this helpful? mushroom patch nodes attracts unlimited water bears that you can eat  collect. if you are in a critical area that you know everyone will be fighting bad guys  there is no mushrooms then pee in safe place  start one. it takes a lot of players peeing on same mushroom so everyone needs to start doing this. drink pee  let's do our part to make america great  connected again lol
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-15,17 hrs in and having a great time  i do think this game will appeal most to strategy gamers who want to experience an open world rpg with exploration and a strong narrative.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,"absolutely fantastic review. really appreciate the extra effort you go to in your reviews to not spoil, but also offer so much detail with you words. i think a lot wont understand this game but holy shit im so ready to play it."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,my friend works at fedex. glad i can pretend to know what he goes through everyday.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-18,"i finally finished the game now. wow, bravo, it is really rare for a masterpiece to come out, the last one imo was nier automata. and it's even more rare for a game that makes me cry at the end. jesus christ kojima made me care for an virtual baby. in videogames of 2019, this was my biggest and best journey. my personal game of the year."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-04,"i swear to god, this guy could sell you anything."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,i appreciate the care with the spoilers. very cool and a reason to watch this review over all the others.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-01-02,"beautiful review mate, i am absolutely going to go back to replay for the directors cut soon."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-04,"i think something you said here speaks to the nature of humanity. they sacrificed their time so that i might have an easier journey than they did. thats what we do. we create, expand, advance. often in the hopes that those that come after us will have an easier life than we did."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-11,this is exactly what i want to say about death stranding. you nailed it.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,"had a feeling it was gonna be divisive based on the tgs showing, though gotta really applaud kojima for going such a road, you dont see such a thing in aaa games. anyways, you loving it a great plus for me."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-03,yongyea where did i leave my motorcycle?
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,death stranding just delivering packages... god of war just delivering ashes last of us just delivering a girl probably doesnt sum these games up great does it?
Action,Death Stranding,2023-11-05,this games social sphere captivated me more than i thought it would
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,game is not for everyone  oh? i'm interested. nothing worse than games that are for everyone. and as per usual with this channel this is the best review i've seenread so far.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-02,"incredible review, this is exactly the type of information that i wanted. i don't care how fun it is or if it's frustrating to fall over. i wanted to know what was different and what makes this game special, good or bad, there was no doubt we were going to get something new. thank you for the work that you do, this review has turned me from someone planning to play it because they respect kojima, to someone genuinely excited to have this experience."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-02-19,kojima is so fortunate that decima engine came into existence just in time. that alone would take years and years to develop from scratch.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,"the reviews are pointing to good, but slow. i don't mind it. i like to take my time."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,actually kinda hyped up after this review
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,"man, this is the kind of traversal i wanted in ghost recon breakpoint. devs are to scared to do anything innovative with their games."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-06-26,the first time i traversed the mountain next to heartmans lab a blizzard came in and prevented me from being able to see 3 feet in front of me. i got unbelievably lost and panicked before remembering i was simply playing a game and could check the map to see my destination. the game is so immersive that i genuinely feared for my life on that mountain. theres nothing like it
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,this review boiled down to one sentence. this is kojima's finest hour. sold
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,"helping others finish their missions,... sounds like nier to me, sold!!"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,surreal this the first new non mgs kojima game in like 15 years
Action,Death Stranding,2025-02-26,"i am someone who hates inventory management in video games. absolutely detest them. but i loved death stranding. this weird, brilliant, and utterly baffling piece of art that should not work. yet it does. oh, it does."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-02,"wife  honey its 10 pm already time to sleep. me  yes honey, sam is walking right now to his destination... 4 hours later wife   me  delivered!!!"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,"that review shows exactly why i think skill up is the best reviewer. thanks, mate."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,i've waiting for a game to make traversal interesting for years and finally we have one. i love how skillup has the ability to understand this and get it across on the review. something you wont find in the joke of a review from ign
Action,Death Stranding,2023-05-31,"the quest where you transport the lady who wanted to reunite with her lover, then not just a hundred meters out of her place an accompanying melo music plays.. i felt joy.. this game is just so therapeutic, at least to me."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-02,alternate title norman reedus and his funky fetus
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,"this review is one of the best you've done yet. when i heard the video was ending i was like wait, it's already over? a brief review indeed. can't wait to get my hands on this game."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-02,"so this game is truly a walking simulator, while other games usually given such a label are merely arcade walkers."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-01,i recently finished this game. i think you've described this game perfectly beautiful game. i think people are too quick to judge it as people want quick action  missions. its ok to be a bit more calm or slowed down. its good to approach a game in different way it also has aspects of 'kindness' instead of beating or competing with people. brilliant
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,"aw man thank you so much, the only review i needed before jumping into the game. i'm done until nov. 8th."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,the journey is just as important as the destination
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,have had a great feeling this game would be polarizing for a while now.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-29,"legs can get us anywhere, over any terrain. the evolutionary link between artillery  infantry a metal gear."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,"jeez dude don't be so hard on yourself. i really was with you throughout the review. it wasn't hyperbolic, it was real and i understood it. yes a vocal subset will roast you, but a much larger majority wouldn't."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-12,i was uninterested in this game when i saw the teaser trailer. this review has me wanting to purchase it. thank you.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-01,its about 45 hours to complete. me50 hours in and only on episode 5
Action,Death Stranding,2020-11-09,i revisited the game this weekend to do a few more standard orders and was instantly reminded of how much i enjoyed the gameplay loop. i really hope kojima does some sort of sequel in this universe with a similar mechanism.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,"i think this is type of game that will impact future games, like all important achievements in game dev. i can't wait to play it"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,there's no battle royale option. 6.8 ign
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,legend has it... ralph is still using yongs bike to this day
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-23,after 114 hours and 91 in trophy progression all i can say is yer i kinda think this game is fucking brilliant up there with mgs 1 and 3 for me as one of kojimas finest games give this game a chance no matter what the internet tells you it's not for everyone but no piece of art should be.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,"this nier automata feels in this sounds amazing. the connected feeling i felt at the end of that story was amazing, and to base a whole game around that in death stranding sounds like a great shout. nice review as always, always a pleasure to watch."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,aren't we all just wondering in a world trying to delivering packages. i feel i can relate to this game on a spiritual level. such deep thots.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,"but the real question is, does it make you feel like norman reedus?"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-24,"this was such an incredible review!! i've watched reviews both from people who liked the game, and people who hated it, but even amongst the ones who liked it, none of them managed to capture the awe and appreciation that you did here. you've officially sold me on this game hahaha i find it so interesting that people seemd to hate the multiplayer experience  i played the remaster for journey, and it has a very similar mp dynamic that im not sure was in the original one that i absolutely loved. the only difference was that you could actually see the players, but the only ways to interact with them was to let out that wordless beep, or to stand near them and have your robes recharged i think?? it's been a while. nonetheless, simply the knowledge that there was another person on the same map as you made me feel incredibly connected and empathetic. i'm glad to see kojima felt the same way, and i'll get to experience that again!"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,"watching the ign review after this one, feels like playing wwe 2k20 after playing shadow of the colossus"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,"i didn't know how to feel about this game, but your review gave me some valuable perspective and as a result i'm more willing to try it out"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,ok im sold . this and outer worlds and other upcoming games with skillup's incredibly convincing and spot on reviews ..may my wallet rest in peace.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-07,"great review, mate. youre quickly becoming one of my favorite youtubers and one of the few i can actually trust when it comes to subjective, well thought out criticism"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,"ds sounds like a current gen, aaa, scifi...... oregon trail. i love oregon trail."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,it just works kojima
Action,Death Stranding,2020-12-15,"as someone with no interest in ever playing this, i am happy it exists. games should be unique and stand out"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-04,"no one is more wrong than the gamers who try to claim that videogames need to be fun to be good. let's forget about the fact that death stranding is fun, provided you have an attention span that is at least the length of that of an averagely intelligent human.... ....imagine if i tried to say the same thing about movies movies need to be fun to watch,in order to be good. by this logic, classic movies like schindler's list and no country for old men are not good at all, because they're not fun to watch. what an absurdly traditional, rigidly dumb line of thinking lol"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,can't wait to start building roads with bridges to everywhere with the help of other players and dominate deliveries
Action,Death Stranding,2023-12-11,"there's one thing wrong with this review. it says that if i did not like mgs games i won't like ds. that's wrong  i strongly dislike mgs for it's tonal disarray,and approached ds thinking i'll hate it. and now it's my favorite game of all time, simply because it added sincerity to the equation."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,part of me cant stop laughing at that backpack though.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-12-04,"im so sick of the formulaic bullshit of most games today, this seems like a breath of fresh air"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-20,conan looked genuinely stoked and horrified to see himself on screen.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-20,hey mom will you get off my back?! instant classic.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,they really capture the watching your little brother fuck up your save experience.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,my favorite part about clueless gamer is that conan's unfamiliarity with the tropes of video games often leads to him making some of the most salient criticisms of modern aaa games
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,928 roar  i think this is the first time conan has ever seen himself do that. his face
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,clueless gamer is the only video game review i trust.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-20,"i love how its confirmed that hideo kojima knows perfect english but he just doesnt give a whole fuck, gotta love him"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-20,never stop this series
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-27,the fact that this is an ad for the xbox version of death stranding and the samsung tv but is really just an announcement that conan will be in hideo's next game is genius
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-23,923 i think this is the most accurate way how to incorporate conan's growlpur. great job game dev and writers.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,618 i dont think anybody acknowledges how much bley is in pain whenever conan has the controller and can't achieve basic movements even though the instructions are already on the screen
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,116 conan definitely said some smart stuff they had to cut because it was an ad.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-20,love how the most enjoyment conan got from a video game was just constantly falling down hahaha
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-24,"to be fair, conan's expressions when bley explains the plot is a normal expression for any one who gets a run down of any kojima game"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,843 thats the happiest i've seen conan on clueless gamer
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-20,conan is gonna be in death stranding 2! i'm genuinely so happy about this
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,oh my god! i hate him and he's me! ...yeah i know that feeling
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,434 i love that in unison moved their bodies like they were on a rollercoaster together lol
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-23,432 those synchronized body movements show just how comfortable conan and blay are doing these games together
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-28,why did they make me so unfunny and needy? stares into camera. realization coming over her face. hahaha
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,"no way. for a moment i thought this was an old video, still clicked to watch. thank you for coming back clueless gamer!!"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-20,the clueless gamer documents aaron's fashion journey
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,"841 i had almost the exact same expression when i saw conan pop up as i was playing this game. i looked everywhere for him, like a ginger wheres waldo!"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-26,please bring this series regularly. absolutely love this series.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-13,"i'm so glad you did another one, it's my favorite series of yours."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,oh my god. i hate him and he's me. amazing! so happy to see this series return!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,"oh my god! i never thought i'd get to see my hologram from death stranding on here. not my voice, but that's my body scan before conan blips on. i only got the part because i was so nervous auditioning in front of hideo that i acted like a clown. conan, you are my hero, and i am glad i flubbed my audition.just to hear you ask is that my wife makes me smile. your wife is way cooler than me though."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,wow they actually listened to what the fans wanted. just one more reason why conan is the best!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,"i wish they would screen these in front of an audience to add the laughter into the final cut. its funny as hell already, but i feel the crowed reactions add a lot to these. still great stuff from conan!"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-22,conan playing a game with conan cameo inside. lovely love it.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,"you don't get work in hollywood when you get old  unless you're conan, in which case you get to host the oscars. which is the best news from hollywood in a long time."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,you look like you just saved a battalion by jumping on a grenade. they remembered that conan roasting aaron was one of our favorite parts of clueless game along with aaron giving the best defense he can think of lmao
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,647 neil luke get off me!  this is sooooooo out of nowhere i busted out laughing
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,conan patiently nodding and eye rolling when bley is doing the sponsors advertising copy. lol
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-10,yaaaaaayyyy!!!!! so happy with the return to the format that makes this series great! just conan being passive aggressive to aaron while being angry at videogames! keep it up!!!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-20,these are the best videos on youtube  we're back with just aaron and conan like the good old days
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-20,never thought i would see another clueless gamer before gta 6's launch
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,conan seeing himself in the game for the first time is one of the most precious things ive ever seen
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-01,"conan is a tv celebrity, and still he is so excited to see himself on screen in a video game"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,i love how conan refers to his improv as unfunny and needy he is awesome lol
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-20,"mr bley, could you arrange for conan to stumble his way through baldur's gate 3 please?"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,"i wish we could have clueless gamer at least once a month ! i missed it so much and i'm so glad that we finally get another one, plus with conan and aaron d"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-20,i hope in ds2 we have to transport the wandering mc on our backs to a new location just so we can hear conan banter all along the way including what he would say when we drop him.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,"i love this, i hope they do more clueless gamers in the future because these are just some of the best things to watch."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,214 is the moment conan feels those edibles homies
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,"these are so funny. never fails. thank you for continuing to make these, conan! much love and respect! stay healthy, brother!"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,injure her?! shes dead!!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-20,i love how interesting it is to hear the explanation for death stranding and conan just isnt having any of it lol
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-14,people out here thinking conan will be in ds2 but hes more likely to be a scary ginger jumpscare in od
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-03,please never stop this series. it's my favorite of the many favorites of remotes
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,i love that conan didn't stay in the late night box and embraced the internet of it all. now he's in a triple a game that he doesn't understand and leading the podcast charts. truly inspiring. it's too bad he's insane.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-20,its crazy that ive been watching conan for the last two decades. time is a son of a gun.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,"i was just bingeing all clueless gamer episodes yesterday, the timing cannot get any better"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-26,i started screaming when he started playing with the physics of his dead mom.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-04,please never stop this series i had no idea yall were still doing it
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-20,the look of pure joy when conan sees himself
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-20,... it took me a minute to figure out that's just what regular conan looks like. 30 years and i've never seen him without the hair poof.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,"injured our mom, she's dead legendary stuff"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-22,yeesss never thought we'd get another clueless gamer. please do more of these conan!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-17,clueless gamer should be a weekly video series. i'd definitely tune in regularly.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,conan dressing down blay for his sartorial choices was hilarious!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,ive been wanting to see conan play this game for five years! and it was worth the wait.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,"we are so back, another clueless gamer, he's hosting the oscars it's conan's time to conquer again."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-20,"i found you in the game, i almost forgot and frankly, the game has put your character at a very unaccessible location. going there was worth it!"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,"man its so good to see him in this type of content, i miss his show. no matter the mood i was in i could watch him and feel better."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-20,lmao he called hideo to find himself
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,conan to hideo kojima what's wrong with you? d
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-29,"watching conans pure delight watching himself on this game and his riff on himself afterward  pure, unadulterated classic conan."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-22,conan! its so good to see you do more clueless gamer bits! youre so funny and just the goat
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-20,i thought conan would love having all those cameras around him
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,i missed these  please never stop
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,"you can catch bley on twitch frequently watching movies, chatting, playing games, trying to escape from nets. he really is one of us nerds. funny guy too so i see why conan likes him."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-22,i was so hyped when i found conan in death stranding. i still have the hoodie equipped too.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,of course it's gonna be comedy when conan plays it
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-20,so excited for this keep up the great work conan and always stay awesome
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-20,"bley didn't tell conan, that it's tradition to pee at conans house  but other than that it was great!"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-20,please please please bring these back lol. i also hope to really see you in the second death stranding
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-26,conan has definitely had a facelift. he looks great.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-24,most underrated segment of conan's show he has to do these more!!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-20,uploaded only 13 minutes ago i've been waiting for this for so long. absolutely love it!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,533  the best review of this game. 'buy some duct tape'.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,"it took me far too long to realize why conan looked a little different and then it hit me conan, your hair! it's not nearly tall enough!"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,"honestly, conan's reaction to seeing himself was beautiful. i'm going to tease that it took this long to make this episode, fellas!!! i'm really happy for you, conan!"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-22,i am so happy to finally see gaming videos back! this is hilarious! please keep this series up!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,030 it's like the core of the sun itself invented a new brightness
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,158 this is how it is if you try to explain any kojima games.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-20,"conan should have his son beckett in this segment too, he's a big gamer like blay."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-24,this should be used in advertisement school as the example for the perfect ad this is perfect cuz i'll rewatch a million times to the point of having the brand samsung printed in my subconscious.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-07,honestly conan's reaction to being told the story of this game is completely fair
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,did kojima just confirm conan's going to be in death stranding 2....or the horror game he's working with jordan peele
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,using the samsung ad as fodder to rip into bley is peak product integration.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-20,the time has finally come!!
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-13,seeing conan in the game was actually a highlight. didn't bomb at all!
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-07,got mel gibson vibes when conan said merchandising lol
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,355 the wrapped body reminds me of national lampoons vacation where they wrapped the dead grandma in a tarp and put her on the roof of the car!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-20,loved it brought me back to the good old times
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,the return of the kinggg
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-22,"omg plz dont give up this program, i cant live without it big fan from china, i need clueless gamer to upscale my life"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,"gonna be honest, conan's reaction to the synopsis of the game is the same way i felt before, during, and after the game. probably the only game in my life where i was completely lost. i have played all kingdom hearts and metal gear solid games and those, to me, were a lot easier to understand than this game despite having an extremely deep lore to them."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-21,"miss this series tons, need more"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-17,"you guys don't understand, this is the first strand type video. there's a death stranding lookalike shirt for sale at httpswww.whitelight.store as of now! some extra updatesclarifications from late 2020  firstly, the link to brovid19 is almost mind rending given the destruction of jobs and fear of the outside world. secondly, i think the best way to define the political nature of death stranding is that it primarily intends to argue a core humanitarian philosophy, and that philosophy has political expressions centrally, division the us. third, the odradek cutscene has been patched, it's now completely optional. finally, it occurred to me that amelie's dresses are symbolic too. light is connection, dark is extinction and red is a conflict between the two. some people in the comment section came up with fantastic new ideas about the meaning of her name, check them out!"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-04-24,"damn, he's really pushing for the 10 minute mark."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-02-16,the weirdest feeling in the world is putting this on to fall asleep to and waking up to it still playing
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-24,"sorry, boss, i need to take a day off work. why? whitelight uploaded."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-09-27,"welp i finished the entire thing. really great breakdown, gave me a good number of details to mull over that i missed myself. well done"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-04-12,70118 we've been talking for some time now. some time
Action,Death Stranding,2020-12-07,even in the afterlife there is sand. apparently it does literally get everywhere.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-22,"when i first saw amelie's name, i thought it was a japanese pun. amelie spelt in japanese is  a me ri which is close to america which is  a me ri ka so amelie is america without a ka soul"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-02-15,lore theory the repeated exposition and multiple people telling you the same things is because people in ds are all so eager to talk to someone. i work from home and sometimes go days without talking to people outside video calls so sometimes i'll find myself super excited to have dumb mundane conversations. maybe they're just desperate to talk.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-03-29,the entire game was just an elaborate excuse to get an actress to say i'm princess beach and no one can convince me otherwise
Action,Death Stranding,2020-10-14,"some of the cutscenes legit look like they're just straight up filmed scenes, its super impressive imo"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-10-14,"speaking as a writerof novels, not video essaysthis video essay impresses me on an immense level. i cant even imagine what it mustve taken to put together, not merely on the level of content, but of structuring it and editing it into something as articulate and cohesive as this turned out to be. and for it to be engaging across the entire seven hours. thats not merely impressive, its flatout amazing. i listened to and watched this over the course of a couple days, and looked forward to it in between. incredible feat of writing and editing, in every way. not to mention a beautiful thesis statement on the game and its themes."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-24,"from what i've heard, from the incredibly trustworthy source of some guy, the reason for the monster energy drink product placement is one time while hanging out kojima saw the cryptid he was working with, norman reedus, open a can and drink the entire thing in a few seconds and decided that needed to be in the game."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-06-12,"everyone knows isolation sucks.  whitelight, precovid19. we were soon to see how true that statement is."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-09-20,"i could listen to this guy for hours. oh wait, i just did"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-20,"10034 if you've got a huge load, and youre about to blow it, you can maintain that tipping point  whitelight 2020"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-18,subscribers the what review? whitelight yes.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-21,spoilers 5 hours of this video is him reading fragile's actress' full name
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-18,"in 15, minutes, death stranding does ww2 better than bfv. i am offended and 100 agree with you."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-08,"i always figured that bridget crawling towards you after falling out of her bed was supposed to be reminiscent of a bt's movement at least what we would've guessed how they moved from the encounters in the prologue and accentuated by the tarlike liquid spilling out from her ivs, creating black handprints, somewhat hinting at her connection to the beach."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-22,"little fun fact, if you make sam call out during the credits, he screams stuff like is it actually over and this has to be a bug right."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-18,ok let's do it i'm gonna go for the 10000000iq joke hey whitelight... nice job getting over the 10 minute mark thank you thank you i'll be here all night... literally
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-18,7. hours. this video will be in the background my whole day.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-12,"630 i think my favorite part of the hand  death usage is how, for us, a handprint is a sign of oh people have been here. one of the first things we tend to teach kids to do is finger painting or leaving their handprints, and the game turns that into a death omen. it reminds me of the whole it used to be human vs maybe it never was aspect of horror."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-05-07,"10033 if you've got a huge load, and you're about to blow it, you can maintain that tipping state for as long as possible to exploit the speed boost."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-05,damn. clifford is probably my favorite character. he actually manages to hug a guy with a phobia of being touched.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-23,"i also interpret the fragile thing as i'm fragile, but not that fragile as in not the same fragile who delivered the nuke."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-12,i didn't ever wanna touch this game because of how many people said it was bad but i gave it a chance and when the credits rolled i cried my heart out and it jumped to my favorite game of all time.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-12-30,70800 i can't believe i watched 7 hours just to get an we live in a society. bravo whitelight.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-15,"when i saw fragile in the shower i thought ohh possible romance scene and nudity, not like kojima. then i realized she has old lady skin and sam cant touch people."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-09-19,"if this is 7 hours long, joseph anderson's video on death stranding in 4 years from now will probably hit the 24 hour limit mark"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-09-26,"i may be alone in this one, but heartman's backstory is the most hardcore story i have ever heard."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-22,"whitesythe94. ah i see, youtooare cursed with a cringy gamertag created by a younger version of yourself, i feel for you."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-17,7 hours..my god....
Action,Death Stranding,2020-05-05,when norman reedus massages a fetus he's called a hero and a brave man but when i do it they just start yelling how did you get in here and i'm calling security
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-02,"i think of higgs and sam as the angel and devil on the shoulder. the personification of the two options. amelie at least in my mind is using their conflict as a miniature battlefield to see what idea will prevail. testing if optimism will beat out nihilism or vice verse. if higgs wins, so does nihilism, if sam wins, optimism does."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-08,fun fact you can beat metal gear rising 1.2 times before this review finishes
Action,Death Stranding,2020-05-13,"7 hour review? i see, so just the last cutscene then  cool cool."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-18,"ah, something to watch before bed"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-09,"i keep coming back to this video every 2 months or so because its easier than replaying the whole game. this video is an absolute masterpiece, there is something incredible about the way whitelight makes videos and this 7 hour behemoth is no exception. the writing, editing, use of sound. talk about stimulating senses, as someone with adhd i can say this is the only youtube video of this length i can watch over and over and not lose focus or get bored. it's a 1010 and i would recommend this video to anyone who's played the game or even just university students because this essay is a masterclass study of a piece of media and a show in how it's done."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-10-30,thing i recently realized strand is the german word for beach.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-02,"13728 so how bout it? arent you getting tired of the grind? isnt this what youve been waiting for this whole time? a game over?! god, i love that line."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-12-20,the scene where diehardman breaks down infront of sam over what he did to cliff is fucking heart breaking. cant imagine what that type of guilt does to a man like him
Action,Death Stranding,2022-09-08,the only reason the scene at 32300 was so emotional was that absolutely pimpin solid gold bridges baseball cap. it really tied the whole scene together
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-28,70813 it's been a real... tough year ohhhh you have no idea.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-21,"i know it's a small thing compared to the monster that is this game and this review, but if the timefall is so ridiculously dangerous, why are the courier's hoods open faced? that just gives me anxiety. what if norman reedus falls on his back or the wind blows in an inconvenient direction? i've been out in the rain in a winter coat, and even big hoods don't do jack to protect your face when the wind starts blowing."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-02-03,"i'm french, and to me, amlie's name struck me for a different reason. me does mean soul, but in my language, lie has an interesting meaning for this game's purpose. lie is the present form of the verb lier, which means to bond, to connect, to bring together. so literally, her name would mean the soul that connects. i find it appropriate, almost even more than the english lie, if only because she was the reason sam did all of this, the reason sam connected america. what do you think?"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-05-08,"there are many certainties when playing a kojima game weird stuff unexplained, something funny, strange gameplay choices, awesome music, cringe writing that sometimes actually works, and every one of them a unique experience. i honestly cant wait to see what part 2 has for us."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-16,"35654 not telling you to look at something, just trying to remember where i left off"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-02-27,"14039 we live in a post dead space world, i dont trust anyone telling me make us whole."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-11-19,"i am legitimately watching this the second time, that's how good it is"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-10-07,"watched this video so many times, ive noticed the thumbnail change. just proves whitelight cares abt all of his content no matter how old. truly one of the best channels on this platform."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-05-20,"we gotta visit mama, easy fast travel trip me who crossed the mountain to go to mama the what?"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-09-18,"we might have to prepare for a wold where most of us simply don't work looks at the world rn we might, huh"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-18,earth fell quicker to the combine than this video.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-05-26,"i don't know how many others watched this whole video from head to tail, but i did, and i cannot thank you enough for how much efforts you put into it, i didn't sense a ounce of boring in any single segments, and i know how hard for that to be in such a long video, it simply is great."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-11-24,"how convenient, i have a 7 hour trip for thanksgiving tomorrow."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-20,mom go to bed. overly long videoessay man isn't real he can't hurt you overly long videoessay man
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-25,"never played death stranding and probably never will, but i watched this entire video and loved every second of it anyways"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-26,"13215 i think the unsung hero of this games soundtrack, overall sound, and general impact on me was the music that plays during the curscenes, specifically the pieces by ludvig forssell. his work is like a kojima version of the tron soundtrack that just carrys the soundscape of this game"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-05-11,"being a father didn't make me scared.. it made me brave. in order to be brave, we must first be scared. what a fantastic, beautiful, scary, compelling masterpiece of a game."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-30,"after 4 days of watching, i've finally finished this. i've no words to say. one hella of a video, maybe the best one i've ever seen. you've done a wonderful job. cheers man."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-02-22,this looks like euro truck with feet
Action,Death Stranding,2023-02-14,"i do think the devs intent with the mama delivery was that player would cut through the mountain. fast travel is rather dull, after all. by cutting through the mountain, you can link up the roboticist to the uca early if you bring lost cargo to her. then, you can build a zipline over the waterfall to connect to mama's lab. there is also a low roar song that plays as you descend the mountain towards the weather station. imo it's neat how in a chapter about reconnecting two sisters, the most convenient way to do it is by building a zipline connection between mama's lab and mountain knot. it's a marriage of themes and gameplay systems i don't really think anyone other than kojima does in the aaa space."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-11-22,ok but cmon him lighting that cigarette with an ash was probably the coolest fucking thing ever
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-22,god bless you for your suffering and i eagerly await the 10 hour untitled goose game review
Action,Death Stranding,2020-11-06,"would have loved for this video to end with anyway it was okay, 8 out of 10."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-08,"i actually found the bt sections to be tense as hell, i'm around 30 hours in to the game and that hasn't changed. i know they're not all that dangerous really gameplay wise but the visuals and audio in this game are so strong it makes it really immersive."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-20,"whew, okay. 3 days, 5 separate viewing sessions, 7 hours, 15 minutes, and 32 seconds. one of the most perfect formats i've seen to properly analyze and critique a game of such a singular kind. plus, it came out just a few days after my birthday! this video was awesome. i love your channel and the content you create, and this monolith was a completely worthwhile experience. big strand energy"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-02-27,can't wait for the bluray box set of this video to come out.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-24,"this was so incredibly well done, it was honest and well examined. also, the chronological structure was a very smart decision. keep on keeping on!"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-02-06,it's interesting that the most meaningful moments in the game's story to me are the most direct. clifford and sam reconciling in the jungle diehardman unloading his grief on sam at the end. only when it drops the talk about connecting people and actually shows it does it make me feel something.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-16,"funny enough, the rant around 22500 about positivity by necessity and not choice is spot on reading up on it, the feature where you can dismantle vehicles wasn't there at launch, it was added later entirely because people were intentionally getting trucks stuck in places that made them an obstacle. people found the only way to troll in the game and subsequently abused it so much that it had to be patched out."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-15,you know why they call me diehardmann? because your name is john mcclane?
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-19,"i for one would gladly watch 30 hours of mgs15 commentary, critique and understandinghinthint"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-22,"something that really hit me first time in watched the mama baby cutscene that i was surprised you didnt mention is how sam, even with his phobia went out of his way to hold her hand and her head. she didnt fall on him so i wouldnt say he just catched her. idk stood out to me and thought id share."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-05-19,"i got the game on pc based on the first little big of this video. then proceeded to play one chapter at a time, going back to the video to catch up. i think my appreciation for the game was markedly raised by seeing someone else react to the absurd and stupid moments, but also the beautiful and profound. coming back to the same video for two weeks has been an interesting format."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-19,"ds dialogue be like deadman sam, do you know thing? sam thing? deadman yes, thing. it's simple explanation of thing sam oh, right. specific name of thing, denoting sam's familiarity with thing and lack of need for further explanation deadman yes! further explanation of thing"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-09-24,the combine took over the earth by the time the video ended.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-07-05,"seeing these lategame scenes again made me way more emotional than when i finished the game. what incredible writing, foreshadowing and acting."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-19,"thanks for the shoutout, homie. d"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-06-10,"bloody hell. watching this 7 hour behemoth in quarantine was incredible. made me miss human connection quite a lot, considering were all bunkered down like preppers either kojima has foresight or its a fucking incredible coincidence that this released so soon to covid hitting the uk anyway, whitelight i just want to say that this was probably one of the best video essays ive ever seen. love the content and this is no exception"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-18,i finished the 7 hour review of death stranding adding this to my resume
Action,Death Stranding,2023-02-12,"interestingly, the nuke mission worked for me. i was extremely suspicious after the cutscene, and the inventory screen confirming my worst fears sent me into panic mode trying to work out what the game wanted me to do. i also interpreted the cutscene as higgs being unsubtle on purpose, since he spends so much of the game toying with everyone else rather than seriously trying to kill them, particularly how he made fragile dispose of the previous nuke. but you're also right that it could've been executed a lot better. maybe my brain was just in full kojima mode at the time"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-01-03,"i really liked how you can switch from talking about the positives of the game with love and talking about the negatives with crudeness, something that a lot of reviews can't do as they tend to be either too positive or too negative. you really showed how we can love a game despite having some massive flaws, thanks for this."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-04-06,"you may never see this comment, but i wanted to share how brilliant this video was and how expertly crafted it is. you have a masterpiece with this one man, thank you for taking the time to make this behemoth. the 7 hour journey through a game i will never play was amazing. again, thank you."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-20,"just sat through the whole thing. i don't usually make comments on youtube, but man, i have to speak up now. absolutely incredible reviewanalysis. never once during these 7 hours was i bored. happy new year and keep on keeping on!"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-08,"i always interpreted when fragile said, im fragile, but not that fragile as im fragile, but the same fragile that carried the nuke into the city. meaning she had clarity now, as in she was more vigilant and wise than ever before after she was deceived by higgs. of course i only came to this conclusion after the cutscene where you travel to the central region on the fragile express boat, but i enjoyed her character even more after that."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-18,gonna need some monster energy drinks for this one!
Action,Death Stranding,2020-11-09,"i'm late to the party and just recently finished the game. i loved it, but apparently the youtube algorithm sensed i had unresolved thoughts that needed expressing by someone and that it definitely required a 7 hour video to do so. and apparently it was right. unlike the death stranding world, no amount of mashing will allow me to deliver you any more than a single like, and i doubt that is going to be much of an oxytocin boost on top of the 24k other ones you got, but the thought is there. thank you for scripting this, for your humour, your exhaustive hunt down of interview quotes and factoids, your humanvoidout calculations and insightful analysis. crossing the tar lake was actually one moment you seem to miss a genuine option available to the player. if you fail to run across the buildings despite you saying how easy it was, some of us  cough found a different way, and get eaten  the game causes a voidout and you use the crater rim from that to get across instead! keep on keeping on."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-18,until the comments say 7 hours ago all yall commenting your complete thoughts on the video are liars.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-31,ive been having trouble sleeping recently because of these rolling panic attacks and i put this video on one night to distract myself. ive been watching it to fall asleep every night for two weeks now. your voice is so soothing and i love this game.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-18,"ha, that's gonna show that amateur joseph anderson who's boss"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-26,'make us whole again sam' ptsd flashbacks to dead space
Action,Death Stranding,2022-02-22,late to the party watching this but ive gotta say the higgs bomb part is my favourite part of the game just because of how utterly hilarious it is. i dont think ive ever laughed more at a game than during my first play through when i immediately knew that was troy baker within 0.5 seconds and ended up with a nuke strapped to my back with absolutely no reaction from anybody. i feel like from troys kind of goofy deliverance of that part it was intended to be a joke and maybe my humour is stupid but it 100 worked for me.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-03-03,"thank you for the longest video i've ever watched, ever, in my entire life, from any source that exists. and i was entertained for every. single. goddamned. minute. of. it. it took over a day, with multiple interruptions, many pauses as i had to focus on other things temporarily, but by golly, it was awesome. thank you."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-04,"her so, what kind of movies are you into? me it's complicated..."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-10-22,"i just need to say that i started this video while unable to sleep, tired and under the influence of sleeping pills, and the bit about mateo kajumbo gave me what i can only describe as a panicked, gaslightey existential crisis."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-11-26,"the mountain you bring your mother up was the perfect tutorial for how the movement works. it's the only game i've ever played where i had to be careful where my feet landed. sure you get upgrades, but the farther you go, the more complex the environment gets. with snow coming into the play right when you think you've mastered the jagged terrain."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-27,"i'm so impressed that you uploaded all of this and didn't split it up into separate parts. you coulda gotten seven video's out of this! instead, we have a full work day's worth of video right here. something about that feels so damn fitting for death stranding somehow."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-06-20,"if you'd like to support me, you can do so via nebula using my link httpsgo.nebula.tveurothug4000 you can get early access to vids and watch loads of other amazing creators, as well as nebula exclusives!"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-05,i really didn't expect to love this game as much as i do.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-11-10,"the very end of the game, where you go to the incinerator with lou, was the strongest emotional reaction i probably had with any medium, ever. i bawled my eyes out, and my wife was really worried, she thought something horrible happened."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-08,this is the best death stranding video.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-04-02,im 45 . i played lots of games...and death stranding has become my favourite game this generation.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-09-02,the first time asylums for the feeling plays. enough said.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-04-30,i just put 72 hours in and finished the campaign finally. the most addicting game ive played in a long long time and so incredibly polished. a game we are so lucky to experience as playstation owners! the fact you can lay a ladder down for someone else to use and vice versa is simply amazing along with the like system. the gameplay mechanics are just pure genius. i love japan!
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-05,"i am just here to help boost the signal, but i will be back in, like, hopefully a month?"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-11-13,"does anybody else find it quite incredible, that koji has again made an absolutely visionary piece of story, this time centered around the theme of social isolation, and sharing goods as the last, remaining interaction between humans, done by the delivery man? and the whole thing being released just few months before the global coronainsanity? mind boggling, to say the least. it's either this guy is a prophetic genious, or he has an inside man within the illuminati."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-08-24,"this was a game where you had to ignore reviews and play it for yourself. once i did, i absolutely loved the game. it's unique and that is something you can't say about many games these days. almost a masterpiece!"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-02-01,"i love this game. it was a slow burn for me, but im 200 hours in and still playing..."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-05,no joke but i've watched alot of post release videos on death stranding where they try to put across why they love or hate this game and why the game is good or bad but by far this is the best video i've seen on death stranding. well done eurothug you have made a great video for me it's the best 1 i have watched. shame i can only like it once or i would have spammed the touchpad
Action,Death Stranding,2022-09-03,"death stranding is one of the many games in recent years that have shown me the sheer power video games have as an artistic medium. the story, gameplay, world and themes are all incredibly well thought. this is definitely not only one of the best video games i've played, but one of the most touching experiences i've had in entertainment"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-10-19,"damn, if death stranding came out 6 months later during the height of the pandemic it'd be even more poignant."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-11-24,"both control and death stranding are making me love supernatural concepts so much, loved them!"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-12-31,"this game will be more and more loved over time. in a few years it will be recognized for the masterpiece it is, i hope."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-18,"i'm playing this game for 3 years now. my father gave it to me 3 days after it's release, and i played, played played and played. i bassically forgot to play a lot of other games when i got it. i had 12 years, and i was sooooo addicted to play everyday fortnite, but when this game came... i couldn't play anything else! i was ammoused by this world. 3 years later, 1 month before death stranding anniversary, my father passed away. now, i'm replaying this game so i can get the platinum, this is, by far the game who makes me remenber my father. great video! i love it!"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-03-03,"it actually made me cry...i love the characters and was really touched by the story. i'm less emotional than i was a few years ago, so it's not as easy to make me cry anymore. but i felt pure grief and sympathy for a specific character."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-05,"one of, if not the best deep dives into this game. fantastic job this game is truly special!"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-09-02,"i am in a dark period of my life at the moment , and playing this game a little everyday i find so much comfort and solace... from the hardship of setting off alone, to bridging connections and realizing the more you help others the more they help you opened my eyes to a lot of ideas in general, not just when i'm gaming. its quite amazing the positive effect it has on myself and many others!"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-11-21,"when you were talking about films that may have inspired death stranding, it reminds me he was posting a lot of film posters for william friedkins sorcerer on his instagram. a film about four men who have to transport very dangerous cargo over very difficult terrain also containing heavy metaphors for limbo"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-06,"you can clearly see the passion and love put in this video, almost as equal or perhaps more so than the game itself. thanks for doing this eurothug! you just made a fellow porter appreciate this game even more"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-11-05,this video matches the quality of whitelight's 7 hour long masterpiece while somehow adding more points and presenting existing ones in a unique way. thank you for your work
Action,Death Stranding,2024-09-07,"4550 the term rainbow baby also refers to the child born next after experiencing a miscarriage or stillbirth, which is what bb28 was for sam after he lost his unborn child."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-07-15,i cannot believe this video made me love death stranding even more
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-16,"my game of the generation. walking simulation my arse, its the deepest game ive ever experienced. the end credits lol came after 192hrs and im not done, no, now on to chapter 15."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-05,"wow. congratulations on the analysis. death stranding is a lot to unpack, and while the game gives you a lot of space to think about what is happening in the world suddenly you trigger a song and is all so breathtaking. yes, there are kojima quirks and some things are out of place like the bit where deadman is in cliff's beach and goes i'm in a sewer and this is terrifying, but i feel like we are bonding sam. but with his interviews, you get why deaman is more comfortable with lou and sam. and i could go on all day with the things that are not exactly clear like the fact that sam could not go on the beach by himself and why he has all that hand marks on him before the game even starts. or visually like on vietnam that looking up you can see most of the detail of the forest is hidden and only shows on an explosion or when you scan it with odradek. thank you for putting into words the reasons why i love this game. keep on keeping on."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-09,pretty much everything you said in this video is exactly how i felt about the game. such an incredible experience...
Action,Death Stranding,2024-09-29,"funny thing is, i use my vehicles to climb even the most impossible terrain in ds. what a lot of players don't know, is that you can actually climb any thing with the cicada mc 2000 if you jank it enough. once i found this trick out, i rarely ever use ladders, ropes etc... i just pack all my packages and hop in. making my way to deliver. such an amazing game! also great video by the way! a gem of a content here! keep it up!"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-11,"i cannot express how grateful i am to you for making this video. you've perfectly encapsulated why this game resonates with me, and why it saved my life during a phase of crippling depression. i'm now in uni studying game dev so that one day i make games like this. seriously, thank you"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-12,"came back after finally platnuming the game last year and seeing the latest trailer for ds2. its impressive how much lore this game has, and cant wait for the next game."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-04-19,out of all the death stranding videos that i seen since its release back in 2019 this is my favorite one. its the most in depth and compassionate take on ds. i cannot wait to hear your thoughts on ds2
Action,Death Stranding,2020-04-23,"i love this game with every figment of my being. cause i feel i'm connected to this game so much. the loneliness, connections, and walks. my friend picked this game up a while ago and i'm excited to talk about the game with him. i agree with you on higgs. his performance by troy baker is like my second favorite of all time to kratos in gow4. my second is cliff. i'll never forget this game and i'm anticipating kojima's next adventure."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-11-27,its nice to be here with people who truly appreciate this game. ive played video games since the 80s and have never come across one that was so emotionally impactful..
Action,Death Stranding,2020-02-10,"all of this mirrors why i also love this game, it is hard to put into words what exact feelings navigating the world of death stranding fill me with but you articulate it so well! well done!"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-02-06,"i love this review and analysis. you clearly put so much thought in the scripting and pinpointing exactly what you liked. it was very unique and special, thank you."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-05-27,"i just beat the game last week, and everything you said hits the nail on the head. there's really nothing quite like it, and its a world i love revisiting and just being a part of."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-27,150 hour play through. undoubtedly my game of the generation!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-03-13,this video made me cry and appreciate death stranding in a completely different light. thank you for this!
Action,Death Stranding,2021-08-09,i just started playing this game and im hooked. the social element of this game is praiseworthy.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-05-25,this is the first game i've felt an extreme emotional connection with. in the final scene where sam holds lou i cried happy tears. a beautiful game
Action,Death Stranding,2024-10-08,"i have over 1000hrs so far, across two psn accounts, two platinums and i am aiming for a third by playing the vanilla edition on ps4 with no online assist. i still can't put my finger on exactly why this game has captivated me so much, and i feel a total idiot for allowing the negativity around it to influence my decision to avoid it until just before this summer. but from that first chapter i was hooked, and as soon as i had completed the campaign and achieved platinum i immediately ressurected an old psn account and started a fresh new playthrough. no other game has held my attention, inspired my imagination, made me feel raw emotions like death stranding...and i cannot wait for ds2 to drop. great video."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-06,"really enjoyed this game, during release. that ending though! about a quarter way through your video, mate and you're already making me want to replay. good job!"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-05-11,"i know this video is from a while ago, but i finally recently beat this game, and i am so glad the main consensus is that this game is loved, almost cherished, and that kojima knows that. this story touhced me in a way that i didn't know kojima still could, and i've been around since solid 1. the amount of care that people speak of this game is usually reserved for a souls game, and it just makes me happy, and this video really captures the feelings of love this game made me feel."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-05-28,the birthday detail is something ive never seen before and is absolutely crazy!!! this game is so personalized providing so many little details and so much to explore. a love letter for the true video gamers that can get lost in this world
Action,Death Stranding,2020-10-14,"i'm back to this video, 9 months later, i finished the game and now i'm ready to cry again as i watch this video !"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-07-11,i dont know how but death stranding made me appreciate life more. this game is truly a life changing experience and i really do feel bad for those who couldnt get into it.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-10-29,"this is a lovely analysis. learning about that back half of the incinerator was really cool. thanks for showing. that japanese gate standing there reminds me of one of the lines from fragile the timefall fast forwards whatever it touches, but it can't wash everything away. the past just won't let go. i've been playing it a second time. it's such a beautiful game. it's hard to describe. everything in it is so beautifully crafted... it took me a while to realize the seam was where you died. it was a really cool realization..."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-09,youre the first reviewer ive seen that mentioned the higgs journal. a lot of reviewers pass him off as an eh antagonist but i found that there was so many more layers to him then what immediately meets your eyes. you just have to search for the layers yourself through his journals and stuff. i feel like anybody that passed him off as an average villain would change their minds if they discovered all his journals in the game.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-09,this is the best review of the game i've seen so far. congrats. i went playing ds right after i've watch your video.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-10-17,i've been binging your content and i have to say it is criminal that you don't have more subs. your content is too polished and wellwritten to not have max reach. keep up the excellent work!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-03,"people who say why doesnt he just make a movie. this game proves this is better than a movie. i lived part of my life as sam bridges in that world for a year. this is way more impactful than a movie. the game design is genius because it's connected to the lore and the limitations of the medium. so that may be part of why it works so well. for ex, it explains video gameisms in terms of the lore, like you can't die and reincarnate is the central aspect of the story, or there are 'invisible walls' because its unliveable outside those bounds. objects disapear because of timefall which is necessary to preserve system memory. you can't go around killing everyone because you have to dispose of them. there are few npcs because they are underground. that's why i'm not sure there will be a game as impactful because these requirements for a game would be immersion breaking in most stories. they made a game where you can't really break immersion if you tried because it's all connected to the lore of the game. i think this is one aspect i haven't heard anyone talk about which is the game design and lore is kind of meta, it's a story influenced by the video game medium itself. this is part of why it's so odd and surreal, because it'd be like if you looked at the natural limitations of what a video game is and made a story around it. what story would you create if you had these limitations because of the medium character dies repeatedly, there are invisible boundaries in an open world, objects must disapear, any human characters behavior has to be simplistic and programmed. it would be the story of death stranding. i think this is how hideo came up with this, is he worked backwards from the medium limitations and then used creativity and various fields of knowledge to create a cohesive story"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-06,"when the trailer for ds2 came out and i saw your tweet, i realized i'd never watched this video. fantastic insight and thoughts as always, and your ingame cinematography is stunning."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-06-30,"i watched sooo many videos and listened to discussions about death stranding and i think this is the best deepest analysis i have come to. sry for arriving here so late. thank you so much for your incredible analysis of this game. i played this game when my wife was 6 months and i was anticipating becoming a father for the first time. the game's themes about fatherhood and connections with others made this the most emotionally challenging and cathartic game i have ever played. i thought that this game was a masterpiece because it felt so personal to me. but u have shown me that death stranding is a masterpiece also because how everything in the game world has such purpose and meaning. i especially was blown away by your analysis of who those 5 bt figures are in sam's beach. incredible stuff. thank you, i will b sharing this wherever i can."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-12-21,this is the best reviewanalysis of death stranding i've seen so far. every single point was spot on and i especially relate to the opening of the video.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-09-06,i got teared up watching this video it reminded me how beautiful a game could be. thank you.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-05,"congratulations on finally getting this released, i've been looking forward to it for a while for at least as long as you've been hyping it! halfway through, it's as good as expected best wishes in the new year"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-09,"this was refreshing to hear a well thought out analysis. the mass effect trilogy will always be my favorite games, but death stranding is up there in one of my favorites. 1121 they can actually get that highlarge? i hardly ever urinate because i just....don't like that feature. lol but wow is that incredibly high. i'm in post game right now so i'm discovering areas i didn't see before. i can't believe i actually missed the musician and 2 other preppers. honestly i'm kind of worried about if there will still be players to connect with a year form now. i wonder if the game will become more like offline mode or it's going to be just really scare with other players' structures. i loved that unique aspect of the game. 3709 made me laugh. that's my favorite no meme. again thank you for sharing your thoughts."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-04-16,i finally finished it. i had to get past the first 1012 hours to start to enjoy it and by the end i am blown away. this is a great video too and sums up much of what i felt.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-05,i love these indepth videos
Action,Death Stranding,2021-01-20,"i love death stranding as well! i am 300 hours in. i took my time with it and loved every minute of it! working towards the platinum trophy  now. great video, you got a sub from me!  from ireland"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-17,"what an insightful and emotional comment on the game! it has become my favorite, too... for many of the reasons you mentioned, but thanks for also pointing out stuff that i didn't know yet. this is going to make my second playthrough even more fun."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-15,1800 i like how picking up the memory chip makes you bow under the torii.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-05,"like always we can see the work, the passion, the love you put to make this incredible video. thanks for sharing your unique experience and i must say that death stranding is one of my favorite game too. keep up the good work!"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-01-30,"3601 i personally really liked that so much of the backstory was left in the background. it makes the tension and emotion in the cutscenes feel so much more ominous and that feeling of the unknown draws you in deeper to wanting to find out everything you can by yourself. the characters in death stranding had a past together that we as the player will never know every single detail of, and be shown even less, but we work to put their relationships back together regardless of how much we may know or not know."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-11-12,"130 hrs of playtime, playing the directors cut 1st time and honestly i didnt think i'd be so addicted playing this game. it's a masterpiece. great video btw!"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-03-23,"im know im a little late in the conversation but i gotta say this is the most excellent game ive ever experienced, i finished a week ago, 204 hours of pure joy and i wish it wouldnt have ended lol. the story line, aesthetics, music and scenery left an impression that i wont ever forget, sincerely cant wait for ds2. the fact that kojima included egyptian knowledge from antiquity added an esoteric sense to the story, the merkaba is in essence the fundamental concept of humans in a spiritual perspective, much like prana, vril, orgone, chi, ki, life force, was phenomenal to say the least. the music cues with the story line and landscape just hit something ive never experienced. i could go on about this masterpiece but im sure anyone who has played this game knows exactly what im saying. thanks for sharing your outlook on this, nice to know im not the only one that was left with such an impact."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-14,im on my way to getting my first platinum in a game and this is the one i chose since i connected with it so deeply. thank you for taking this deep dive at the game and even reading through the interviews to explain more secrets. im encouraged to read them. i definitely will do my best to explore more as you did.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-30,"thanks to epic games free giveaway i've finally given this game a try and quickly became one of my favorites. managed to redeem both the normal  directors cut. after 100 something hours i've finished the story and manage to 5 star every porter and man that last mission kept me in suspense, i'm not a baby person, matter of fact i quite dislike them but in this game the connection that i made with lou was something special. i almost couldnt go to the incinerator and finish that mission, instead i was just playing the harmonica over and over. also the connection that you make with other players via their structures is amazing, just like you said, the amount of times i got saved by a random timefall shelter was incredible. i made it my goal to build the entire middle region road system. i might work on some ziplines aswell despite me not being exactly a big fan of them, despite their outstanding usefulness. thank you for an amazing video that has put everything i had in mind in a well formed docummentary style. the atmosphere, the music is top notch, one minor criticism i had about the game is about the car and especially truck physics being a little annoying and also that end part with so many end credits being spammed every 510 minutes left me a little annoyed but nevertheless, it's probably the best game i've played in past 5 years."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-16,this is also my favorite game of all time i grew up majority of my gaming career playing fast paced games multiplayer and of course some single player giants early god of war especially took a good portion from me and so fourth so im very use to fast paced 1st person shooters to be specific.. i didnt think i would like ds mainly because of how its played and what not its a completely different game then your average game at least my sense of an average game yours could be different of course but in my opinion it was different it was odd when i first played it i found myself occasionally just getting lost into for hours and not even realizing i even took a week of pto to play it some more ive been playing this for years lol even to this day . i still play it every single day its almost like i need to play it to feel complete in my life. its something new and fresh and i liked how he took the risk of releasing a game like this knowing it was gonna be bad to some and good to others i can see why and completely understand why lots of people dont like it trust me i get it .. but for me this game is a once in a life time gem and i owe so much to it. cannot wait for ds2
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-08,i admire so much how you really inhabit the games you play. i've struggled with immersion for a long time now in my gaming experiences and you're really teaching what it means to invest in these experiences.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-23,"i completed death stranding last night well, this morning  look, i wasn't planning to play for ten hours when i started at 8 pm!, and i'm glad that i was able to finally watch this video. the game's a masterpiece, through and through, and this video helped me appreciate parts of the story that i completely missed out on."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-23,"really great video! i'm really glad you answered or discussed many of the mysteriesquestions i had about the story after finishing the game, since most ending explained videos i saw just summarize the surfacelevel story without diving deeper."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-10-18,dang. i wasn't really ever planning to play this game but now i'm really interested in it more so than i ever was before. great video.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-01,"there's so many details i keep uncovering, and it feels like everytime i return i discover a new thing, like how the knot city entrances look like whales coming out of water and you're entering the mouths"

Action,Death Stranding,2020-10-02,"i had high hopes going into this game and it did not let me down. i quickly realized the importance of zip lines and was able to set up a network to get around the map so much faster. i also enjoyed the character mechanics, but combat was almost unnecessary. great review! great visuals. great gameplay. great game."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-03-20,"absolutely the best video about death stranding on youtube. finished the game a few days ago, you definitely catched and explained perfectly everything. thanks!"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-08,"excellent analysis eurothug, i appreciate your enthusiasm and sincerity , this game was incredible and so beautiful, and so far, your review has been my favorite. thank you for sharing"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-06-16,"supperb essay and i wholly agree with you. as a mountaineer i love the traversal in this game, it reminds me of some of the most wholesome experiences ive had in real life."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-09-03,"as many others have said on here, this is the best video on death stranding i've seen. its a shame it took me so long to stumble across it. everything you stated are experiences i've had also and i wondered if anyone else had as well. i finished the game with tears in my eyes and was playing the post game for a long time. i was at 80 complete, then my ps4 crashed and i lost all my data. i was a bit distraught. all the progress, all those connections, lost. but i realized that's the whole idea of the game. to toil, to rebuild, to reconnect. so i started again from the beginning. here's hoping we cross paths or bridges along the way. keep on keeping on!"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-02-02,take my like. i didnt think this would be so introspective and thoughtful. thank you for this.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-22,this is my first video of yours that i've seen. by far my favorite review of death stranding! i look forward to seeing more of your content!
Action,Death Stranding,2023-08-22,"sent here from adam millard's channel. i've been listening to mostly nothing but people talking about video games lately, so happy to have more."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-07-24,"i feel the same way too, especially since i started playing this game during the pandemic, the immersion was beautiful, storyline, and visualsaudio too. just beautiful. hope kojima creates more games as beautiful as this if not more!"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-05-30,i'm halfway through your video now. god dam can i listen to you talk about this beautiful game all day!
Action,Death Stranding,2021-01-30,"i recently beat this game and was so surprised how much i loved it. watching your video blew my mind as to all the details i missed, how deep, and layered it all is! reminds me of the layered writing of charlie kaufman. such an incredible game, and what a well made video about it, really showcasing your incredible attention to all the little details, i'm so glad i clicked on this to watch. gaming has been such a saving grace for me during this pandemic, this game in particular helped me reflect on the current situation, my loneliness and fears that i've started to accumulate about the outside world. i've always been a loner, it felt very familiar playing through death stranding... i felt connected... and in the end it's the beauty we all share of our love for games, or this one in particular, that drives home the theme of the game, connection. anyways i doubt you'll see this comment, i'm not sure why i'm commenting, maybe it feels good to see someone else who appreciates this game just as much, it's been hard, but like sisyphus, we just need to keep moving forward.... just deliver one more package... one more package... one more try..."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-12-28,that was absolutely amazing!!! i feel that the creator of this video put as much of their heart and soul into making this video essay as hideo kojima and his team did into making the experience of death stranding. a passion project about a passion project.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-12-19,"i'm 80 hours in already and only working on episode 3.. this scares me! i may never see the outside world again! lmbo seriously, i spend so much time trying to organize cargo, plan ahead, plot out orders and dealing with transport issues i.e. should i use one of the bikes or steal a mule truck or use the carry carts..hmm decisions decisions or just walk it in and out.. ugh that takes so long to hike in and out and back and forth.. well i love the game and is the most addictive game i've played yet.. it drives me mad but i love it. watching this video now and have watched so many other for tips etc and i try very hard not to see too much ahead of where i am in my game as to not spoil it. hiking up and down mountains, in steep ravines etc has been so time consuming and so hard. eastern region i realized i was overworking.. missing easier ways to do things. i lost so many bikes... had to hike in and back again. well anyway i like this video so far but now i wanna start my game up! lol i'll take any advice that will help me. thanks and have fun all"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-04-15,"what an enthusiastic video, i like how you adress both the complexity of the narrative and the sheer simplicity of the game being an enjoyable experience."

Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-01,los juegos de kojima son diferentes. ejemplo son sus juegos metal gear en donde el sigilo no es de gusto para el usuario promedio que prefiere shooter y llevar arsenales de armas . death stranding es algo que toma muchos elementos de otros juegos pero de una vision de kojima. para opinar primero habra que jugarlo. por que asi son sus juegos. no puedes entenderlos si no los pruebas por ti mismo
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-09,"yo ya lo compr y debo decir que es un juegazo, todo esta increble y que decir de los grficos.. pero si que molesta un poco que cada vez que salta algo de cinemtica salga el nombre de kojima,"

Action,Death Stranding,2020-11-18,"2020 y recin lo jugu y termin, muy muy hermoso el juego, no es solo caminar, tens una historia muy buena, en mi caso no entend casi nada hasta despus del episodio 10"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-04-15,"muy buen juego, la historia es hermosa, la jugabilidad me gust. le faltaron algunas locaciones y alargar menos la trama la banda sonora es tremenda y mikkelsen es una bestia definitivamente, ahora entiendo porque lo escogi kojima. hay que jugarlo en muy difcil para que sientas todo lo que kojima quera transmitir. 89100 es mi nota porque creo que faltaron algunas locaciones extra. si tienen una pc buena lo recomiendo an ms, es genial el juego, no se van a arrepentir de probar algo muy distinto a lo que la industria nos tiene acostumbrados"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-13,el juego literalmente es un ir de un punto a otro durante 30 horas con cinemticas entre medio. una visual novel llevada de la peor manera y las peleas contra bosses son lo ms triste que he visto en mi vida con diferencia en el mundo de los videojuegos.

Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-11,"i constructed 2 roads all by myself then the likes came pouring in, theb people started to help with the other roads until it looked like a real highway, this game makes me feel like the world still has some good in it left."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-12,"when bts are trying to drag you down, when you escape them actually pulling on you you can actually turn around and pee on the oil to make them retreat."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-13,"when you get the ability to fabricate your truck. theres a row of lights at the back that shows the amount of cargo your truck can carry, once it turns red and all lights are filled. youre full."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-15,one of the most satisfying things is when you've finally gathered enough materials to build the road and see 900likes from people who've used your road it's like you've made a difference in life xd
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-04,be sure to level up your connection with the collector as quickly as possible. he's near the distribution center south of lake knot city. he can be difficult to find and level up but he gives you a backpack cover that you can use to protect items that are on your backpack from timefall and weather. this is extremely useful later in the game when the weather is constantly rough. it was definitely one of the most useful items i had.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-13,"my entire game experience is farming bts to help rebuild everyones structures. i carry well over 12,000 chiral on my person just sprinkling that stuff on every bridge, road, charging station i find. truly feel like im making a difference getting structures up to level 3 or getting a seamless road trip to make a delivery edit the real heroes farm metals edit2 wow look at all those likes!! feels like im playing the game!"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-13,i honestly love how most of this comment section is just people sharing helpful tips to everyone. its really wholesome.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-11,maybe a really obvious one....but something i didn't realize at first you can take shelter from timefall under any bridge!
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-04,i think i spent half my time in this game just building or repairing structures. it's amazing how you can become addicted to the feeling that spending time helping with these is going to make someone else's game a bit easier. i love this mechanic in the game. even though it is single player it constantly reminds you that we're all in it together!
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-17,what death stranding tought me even the apocalypse cant destroy the chemical sludge that is monster energy.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-11,anytime you look up in the sky and see a black lines coming down there will be bt''s in that direction.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-12,lets all help each other out. this.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-11,"if you headshot mules with the bola gun, you will instantly knock them out instead of just restraining them. it can be tricky to hit the headshot, but it is very helpful."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-13,"might already be mentioned by one of the tips in game, but if you throw down a hematic grenade, bullets that are shot through the blood cloud are able to deal damage to bts. same goes for throwing a grenade near a crowd of bts and letting your blood cover them, shooting at the bloodstained parts of the bt also does damage to them. also, there is a memory chip in one of the small caves at the side of the mountain a little to the south east of where you can find 'elder', that memory chip contains blueprints that would let you build a new bike, which has increased battery life and also has shields."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-13,a few times a decade  basically everytime kojima makes a game
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-12,"here's some more tips with game mechanics spoilers, so spoiler alert bola shots to the head instantly knocks the target out, shots to the body only temporarily disables them want to get rid of the rain? put your stuff somewhere safe nearby and let the bts drag you to the boss for that area, either escape the boss or kill it. killing it will net you a whole lot of chiral crystal dust thing if you are in need of some see mules chasing after you? just run them over with your bike or truck. do note that this will damage anything that the mules are carrying there's an optional upgrade for your backpack, a backpack cover. there's already a few guides around showing how you can get it hate going up to the elder on the mountain? instead of going up from the mule camp side of the mountain try going up on the exact opposite. just go south from the engineer's place and there's a pretty easy path for vehicles to reach up there. there's also something cool to see here. you can sleep from the sitting position, in case you need to take a 1020 minute rest yourself there's a center of gravity indicator when you load up sam, the white circle on the floor is the indicator you can ride bikes up ladders the power frames are worth using imho, especially when you encounter terrain that's hard for vehicles to pass through the first time around you can get frostbite on your fingers and toes if you climb around in the snow for too long, it'll last a few sleep cycles and doesn't have negative effects as far as i can tell when a spot gets a lot of pee, it'll attract the floating worms for you to harvest"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-11,the go faster signs give your vehicle a speed boost as you pass through them
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-13,"when you throw a blood grenade at a bt boss, equip your normal rifle and shoot through the blood fog the bullets get instantly coated with blood and deal significant damage to the bt boss."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-15,"after 60hr playing i never notice there is a electric charger at the base, until i saw ur tips. thx"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-14,noobs combat in this game sucks. pros i beat the crap out of everyone with packages.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-12,"i love how people can troll too. i had a fragile item that shouldnt be vibrated much, i was in my truck charging at a generator and they hid a speed boost in the line of sight of the generator, i go to leave and go flying into a rock, breaking my package and forcing a restart, i never laughed so hard"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-19,"another tip when you are crouching, you can use the first person view to go faster. it's very useful in the snow areas."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-11,"might not seem obvious, but if you consume all the items on the table and then use the restroom you get more gnades out of it."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-15,"somebody might've mentioned already, but headshots with the bola gun vs mules is better than bodyshots because it knocks them out automatically, saves you having to run up and kick them unconscious"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-13,"tip that made combat alot easier for me. if you equip your weapon to the weapon rack you can easily access it when needed by tapping the right d pad without having to go into the weapontools wheel. this also allows you to easily put it away when you want your hands free. this works with anything that you attach to your weapon rack ladders, grenades, bola gun, etc. can put the itemweapon away by tapping it a second time. quick weapontool access using the right dpad"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-10,"while i can understand maybe this game isn't for everyone i'm really enjoying it . its beautiful, atmospheric and strange . i'm hooked . thanks for the tips !!!"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-11,when you come across a mule camp and they scan you right away activate your scanner and you'll negate them locating you and you can continue on sneaking into their camp.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-10,idk if the tip is in the video but crouching while going down hill makes it way easier.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-11-30,i connected mountain knot city and the weather station using ziplines. mapping out the zipline network on those snowcapped peaks feels like setting up the warning pyres when gondor called for rohan's aid.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-21,"i played ds on my actual birthday. the game must have pulled my birthday date from my playstation profile. it sent me a happy birthday email ingame. when i rested in my private room, there was a birthday cake on the table, just to the right of the beverage cans! when i exited the private room, and was going up the elevator, they played a cut scene in the hospital room with lisa and bb. higgs came in with a bouquet of flowers and started asking whose birthday it was today. is it mommy's birthday? shakes his head is it bb's birthday? shakes his head. pushes the bouquet into the camera and wishes you a happy birthday! amazing!"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-11,and people were saying the game has no depth. it's kinda sad cause it kills the chances of someone giving it a go.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-11,biggest tip here is that there's a skip for all of the repetitive mini cutscenes.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-11,tip 1 if you time it right you can jump over the mule scan wave to avoid being scanned. tip 2 you can put cargo that you are holding in your right or left hand straight into a truck or onto trike without opening cargo menu. tip 3 any mail that mentions seeing a shiny object is a hint on where to find a memory chip. tip 4 struggling to get ziplines to link up? upgrading a zipline to rank 2 will increase its distance from 300 to 350. rank 3 will however not increase any further. connected ziplines a rank 2 is reaching do not need to be upgraded to reach back.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-12-31,"protip delivering other peoples cargo which you can grab en mass from shared lockers at distro centers or knot cities will get you a ton of bridge link points, both increasing your overall level and also increasing sync level every tenth level. its not exactly clear what it is but it seems to increase the chance of other players stuff being in your world and vice versa, which is extremely helpful as you can imagine!"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-14,"i'm not gonna lie, this game got me to buy at least one monster."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-11,when losing stability crouch and stand up fast and you won't need to hold the triggers to recover your stability. it helped me a lot when i just wanted to run with heavy gear. this helps a lot when making turns.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-12,im only 18 but i played alot of games and i cant remember the last time since i was hooked so much too a game. it surely isnt for everyone. but jesus it is a piece of art for me. finally a dev who tries something completely new and shows a great success of a new genre. im pretty sure we need games like this to improve the modern gaming market. this game is truly one of a kind!
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-13,tip just heard this one havent tryed myself but holding x in the menu to confirm instead of scrolling all the way to the bottom
Action,Death Stranding,2021-01-30,"this game sure gives you a new perspective on life. times are much harder without roads, vehicles and such. we take such things for granted in our everyday lives, but death stranding really shows us what it would be like without them. oh, and im addicted to monster now. thanks, kojima!"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-16,thought i was having a stroke at the monster part. lol
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-12,"avoid dropping off from ledges, but if you absolutely must, use l1 to look down and it will tell you how far the drop is."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-11,"we've invented a hockey puck that can build entire structures, but, at the same time, battery technology still sucks."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-12,you can customize your bag to have a cover that protects it's cargo and prevents cargo being knocked off. need to 2 or 3 star the collector.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-17,ziplines will be your best friend. sooo fun too. making a zipline trails when you travel further west is ideal
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-14,when you watch this video despite already completing death stranding just to see whether or not you already knew the tricks in the video
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-13,"a few stuff i found out. 1. dont sleep in snowy areas, you will freeze to death. 2. when restingsitting down, you can press l1  down button to play with bb. you can press and hold r3 to focus camera on bb. 3. hotsprings have different effects. the blue ones restore your stamina up to an additional 25. theres white,green,brown and blue i have found so far. 4. you can spam the like button to give multiple likes in one go. 5.check post boxes for materials you can claim that are donated or lost by other players in the area. then use it to build roads. 6. if you walked the same path a couple of times it creates a footpath for easy travel, this works really good especially in snowy areas as this will make walking faster by not having your feet deep in snow. 7. if you are brave enough and have a lot of hematic grenades, just let yourself get drag away by bts and kill the boss. the area will be cleared away for a few delivery runs."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-11,thanks for the tip about throwing a grenade at your feet when being dragged under by the oil monsters. i hadnt thought to try that at all. oh and ive only just found your channel it seems fantastic so will be checking out more of your content. thank you so much.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-11,something about this video makes me want to purchase a monster energy drink. no clue why. must be subliminal advertising
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-10,"may have been mentioned already but a useful tip for anyone using the mule trucks in chapter 3, i was previously told you cannot repair them i just figured out that if you leave the truck inside one of the mule bases, they will fix it up once they're not unconcious, obviously you'll have to steal it back from them but it seems a small price to pay to have them fix the ride"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-18,"love the helping out everyone... i spent like 2 hours building the first 2 sections of road when i got to the new territory. then came back the next day, to see even more built. so cool"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-11,"i dont know why but, when people hating this walking simulator, thats allways makes me want to play it more."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-13,"if you're having trouble with getting the rope counter timing, you can shoulder check the mules by holding both shoulder triggers to grip your pack and pressing attack. then while they're stunned, you can quickly incapacitate them with the rope from behind. keeps container damage to a minimum and is useful if there's nothing you can find to break."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-18,the canteen can be refilled when your are walking through rivers or when it is raining. recycle useddestroyed items for building materials. chiral crystal appear more and in larger quantities during timefall storms. there is a clip on the left side of the back pack to carry two extra pairs of boots. the odradek will point at the direction bt is going.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-28,"quick tip  for those struggling to get around the wind farm bts, you can simply go onto the cliff side to the right. but be very careful as it might be tricky. if its already in the chiral network then someone most likely will have placed a climbing anchor to get to it."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-11,oh my god i didn't know you could face the repair spray at yourself. or the saving thing. hells yeah bro thanks.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-11,"make sure you don't leave stuff in the open world and then go far away from it. it'll disappear. if you have to leave stuff behind, build a post box and dump your stuff in there. i learned the fuckin hard way."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-10,thank you. i've been on the fence about ds. i'm going to get it today. monster
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-14,"also big tip here, if you donate any amount of a material to a autopaver you will be linked online to a number of other players who are working on that instance, and the paver will often complete by the time you come back, you will also recieve notifications on when a player contribues."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-02-07,"the grenade pouches you can craft during episode 3 are a game changer. same deal as the utility pouch for blood packs, but let you carry as many grenades as you have pouches installed on your pack."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-11,one issue i had was when you get dragged off to a mini boss fight in the middle of a timefall and your cargo gets scattered. stuff fixed to your suit doesnt appear to fall off so i suggest stacking the grenades to your arms andor thighs to avoid losing them all and having to run through the tar to try and pick them up again before attacking.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-11,"i unironically love this game, i always have been more inclined to immersion than arcadey fun."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-12,when using repair spray don't use it out in the rain. find shelter then use it. far more effective and the can will last a lot longer.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-17,also stealing a mule truck will make hauling all of their equipment much easier.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-20,"there is a breif period after liking something for the first time where you can spam like it, so do that for anything you find useful or anytime you wanna help. today's a good day"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-12,power sliding with o will bring you to a stop usefull for when you have alot of momentum and are about to run into a wall
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-13,im not sure if this has been said but spotting out rainbows lets you know where the bts are at.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-13,let go of the stick and pull both triggers to do a harder stop.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-04-22,"i just bought this for my hubby and i for easter, it is quite addictive. we started playing it 3 days ago and even my kids ask if they can watch us play the game lol. i appreciate videos like this as well as their comment sections because there have been some things in the game where the hubby and i just kind of sit there scratching our heads going now what. i'll admit it took me about 15 minutes and a google search to figure out how to build a generator and how to use the grenades. so thank you for the wonderful content."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-14,"i love building dem roads. then again, i'm addicted to euro truck simulator as well, so it only makes sense."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-12,"a big tip is rather than hauling and hoarding resources like metals, take the time to upgrade facilities you tend to use, or repair them, even if they aren't yours. this can cut down on your cargo load, and level 3 facilities are more resistant to decay and are more likely to be there later when you need them. having access to welllevelled post boxes cheap to upgrade! can give you extra cargo to transport, or just a place to stash a pile of hematic grenades near a bt zone so you don't have to carry them everywhere you go. higher level generators charge you up faster and have a larger radius, and lookout towers are good for spotting cargo of opportunity, tagging mules, or even finding memory cards. another big tip you get likes 'social' likes from players by delivering their cargo, completing supply requests, and upgrading facilites. you don't need a totally awesome bridge to nowhere to farm likes. check those post boxes both yours and others' for dumpandrun cargo to fill out a delivery route and don't wait for someone else to trip on your stuff and like it. lost cargo and 'entrust' jobs can pay in likes pretty well. rumor has it post boxes around wind farm have piles of undelivered cargo..."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-13,"these are actually good tips, unlike other channels and articles that seem to have pretty useless advice. great video!"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-12,"if youre going back to a place youve already been to, use your scanner to see your old foot prints and follow them so you dont have to set markers again"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-30,love the fact that the game is about bringing people together and it's actually succeeding nicely at it
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-31,"300 hours in and loving this game! an unexpected journey i embarked on was rebuilding the highway in the central region. it was a long process as i rebuilt about 95 of it singlehandedly before connecting the areas to the chiral network. now that the entire thing is complete and the central region is all hooked up to the network, i just maintain the roads every few days as i go through the game, completing all the standard deliveries. the highway got me around 800k likes and i can't help but feel pride in my contribution to the world d such a special, special game!"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-12,if you want to keep cargo safe when fighting use a pcc and place the private locker
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-10,"one thing i didn't notice for a little while is that you can press triangle in the cargo menu to optimize your load. also, ranking up at each delivery point is the best thing you can do. this is how you unlock a lot of upgrades to your equipment and items, as well as some customization."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-11,i have watched multiple tip videos on youtube and this is by far the best one. great job!
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-13,when sneaking around bts make sure to change the camera angle so it's over your shoulder that has the adirondack scanner thing lol. then u always know which direction not to go.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-14,"nice vid dude. the detail in this game including the mechanics, are incredible. blown away by it. another that is simple but really impressed me is the fact that sam is right handed. so throwing cargo with your right hand is stronger and goes almost twice the distance as it does when throwing with his left. it tells you this in the game but only when doing a particular objective."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-13,"a good tip is when you can craft the time fall shelters they come with a nice free repair spray as they activate. if it doesn't repair everything in one pass, walk out of the circle and get another free spray down! also the tiny cargo carriers are floating sleds... they have to be attached to you but you can basically shield slide on them... press square to kickpush"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-13,you had me at the map thing. im almost 50 hours in and i had no idea i could shift map elevation to better see where im going. thank you
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-11,"700 one time they knocked off my gear and left me with nothing, so i tried peeing on them and they went away"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-01-31,"something i noticed when resting in the private room is that when bb is making sounds, go check on him and smooth him. most of the time i did that i got an unusual cutscene that is different from the normal scene you get. just something fun i noticed."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-17,"some player made signs have useful effects when you go through them. the go faster one gives vehicles a speed boost, keep on keeping on restores your stamina and well done bb makes bb happy."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-13,you can conserve space by recycling materials then pulling them out again. like the biggest metal you can find is 400 but if you recycle a bunch into a post then you can pull out 1000 metal and it will be the same size
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-11,i cant stop playing ds lol im addicted
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-11,press and hold the activate button when focused on something and it gives a small readout of what terrain to expect
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-14,most youtubers doing the walkthroughs need to watch this damn vid
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-19,"when youre in the lake knot city area, try and build up your star reputation with the preppers. the upgrades and equipment they give you is totally worth it. the distro south of lake knot will eventually give you access to a truck that seems to carry a ton more cargo than the mule trucks. the junk dealer will also eventually give you pouches to carry on your bag like the pouch you have for blood bags so you can carry grenades in pouches, an extra battery pack without having to lug around cargo boxes on your back for those items. also...the cosplayer gives you something i thought was cool. now go explore!!"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-10,by far the best tip video ive found as well. always can count on boomstick.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-12,347 consecutive cqb!close quarters binding
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-11,"prime 2 day delivery, the game"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-25,"my tips do not attempt to walk adjacent to any vehicles while carrying a lot of cargo. sam may inexplicably lose balance and start moonwalking, only to collide with an invisible wall, which deals damage to your cargo. transfer cargo directly from the ground to your vehicle by pressing start and going to the cargo menu right after you exit the vehicle. this will save time and also give sam fewer opportunities to flop over or moonwalk. do not attempt to hide from bts or even hunt them one by one with grenades. this is a waste of time. instead, get yourself caught by them so that you can take on the easy boss, which only requires 10 or so hematic grenades, and can stop the rain for 5 seconds, and rewards you with tons of hematic crystals. just be sure to leave your cargo a safe distance away before you run in for battle like a brave porter. remember to do wheelies with your reverse trike to get over rocky terrain. you'll have pretty much no excuse to leave your bike behind as it can make it through some inedible obstacles, while having a lower probability of damaging your cargo than carefully traversing that terrain on foot, somehow. even if sam is over encumbered, he can still jump into his reverse trike and rocket off like a jacked up jackrabbit. it's like the trike has magic anti gravity powers. don't expect to get any likes on your bridges or structures, no matter how perfectly placed they are. perhaps someone else in another online dimension already put a structure there, so they don't see yours.. or nobody likes you. but never fear, because you can still get lots of likes. all you have to do is drop some resources on the road building structures, and boom! you'll have tons of messages letting you know that people are using your road. and you didn't even have to finish it! try to add resources to as many of these road building structures as you can without actually finishing them. you'll get so many likes to compensate for the likes that you didn't get by actually completing things. keep on moonwalking on. remember to hold l2 and r2 right before you hit the invisible wall."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-14,the first tips video i've watched that was actually new and useful stuff! i can always rely on you for quality content.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-11,"if you bring your truck with deliverables into the delivery station basement pad, you can directly complete the order without carrying onto your back again from the truck."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-12,"130 or you can tap r2  l2 one after the other mimicking each step taken by sam and sprint while also keeping your balance. this whole game is about carrying around extra equipment andor items, just in case."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-18,if you have enough time while escaping from the tar bts in the ground having sam pee on them makes them freak out and dissapate.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-14,i was going to absolutely lose it if the ad that pops up right after the whole monster bit was actually for monster.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-22,it is nearly impossible to tip over while crouched even if you have a huge cargo load.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-15,it's ok to like this game and its ok to dislike it but can we all agree that we should've killed fragile with our motorcycle in the beginning? game would've been way better. also stay safe with that covid19 shit going on! hope you guys are enjoying your stay inside lol i'll try to put out more videos while this shit is going on. keep your spirits up! don't you dare go hollow.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-22,"i play this game everyday, since i work at the post office."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-15,"there are some games that i cant understand anothers dislike for. games i loved so much that when i hear someone with the opposite opinion, im flabbergasted and question their taste... death stranding is not one of those games. i really enjoyed it myself and found it to be an interesting and engaging experience, but whenever i hear someone say they hate the game, my response is simply ...yeah, fair enough. though love it or hate it, we all can agree the story is the pinnacle of kojimas pretentious nonsense"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-10-30,"postapocalyptic, where post refers to a national delivery service."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-08-29,"i made fun of this game from the first hint of it, and when it came out for a year, i mocked my friends for playing it. then i played it, and i couldn't have been more wrong. it turned out to be an experience i will never forget for good not bad, go figure..."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-15,imagine someone just coming by this guy while filming the beginning.

Action,Death Stranding,2021-06-02,"as much shit as it gets, i'd honestly take outofplace monster sponsorships over microtransactions any day"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-09-01,the one part about this game that i'm interested in is the nature. i wish someone took the map and the graphics and made a long darkstyle wilderness survival with it.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-15,"me when death stranding was announced what the hell is this game?!, also me after death stranding is released what the hell is this game?!"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-15,2000 there could be loot boxes in game. 2010 loot boxes are gambling. 2020 game is about delivering loot boxes.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-30,people keep saying this game aint for everyone i think every games just like that.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-06,"for me this game scratches an itch that like, no other game does. i love the feeling of planning out what i need to bring on my expedition, plotting a route on my map, following along as best i can or suddenly having to adapt to an unexpected variable, the feeling of taking a break halfway through where you find a little nook or cranny where you can let sam rest and at the same time, get up from your chair and go make some food, then come back 15 minutes later and continue your journey.. nothing beats that."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-03-15,this also summarizes how our grandparents used to look like when going to school.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-07-02,"i personally like this game, but i cant really recommend it to everyone"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-15,then there was an explosion.. until there wasn't.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-09,"people kept saying the game is a slog and gets tedious throughout but literal opposite happens, the more you play, the less tedious it becomes. the game keeps rewarding you with new tools to improve your travels, like the roads, vehicles, exoskeleton suits and ziplines. and this honestly made me enjoy the game more and want to progress further to receive better tools. great game, if you approach it with the right expectations youre more likely to enjoy it."

Action,Death Stranding,2024-10-09,actman just cant comprehend kojimas silly vision. kojima is on another level of silliness and genius. in all seriousness though valid take on the game and its not for everyone.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-16,"it's better to be simple and deep, rather than shallow and complex. i truly do love hideo kojima, but he can get really up his own ass at times and needs a good cowriter or producer with him to make sure he doesn't go off the rails. the world of this game is amazing, but kojima is just not a good screenwriter so his characters and story just suffer because of it. give him borderline complete control over a project as writer and director and this is what happens."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-26,i remember playing the first few hours and was like what the hell is going on. now i have over 90 hours in it and could some up the story and sound like i had the biggest drug trip in my life.

Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-16,"imagine a world where kojima made short games, he could do all his crazy shit, without a huge time and money investment for everyone involved, and get as experimental as he wants. here's some incredibly well received games, limbo, journey, portal. i love those and i know i could burn through them all in one day if i felt the urge. even if i loved mgsv i can't in good conscience spend that much time on it again, but damn i know i feel comfortable giving those short games my attention and time again."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-03,i almost didn't buy this game based on this stupid review. glad i ignored it and got it anyway. only at hour 15 or so and completely sucked in.

Action,Death Stranding,2020-09-29,so basically an interesting concept and story soured by a tedious gameplay loop. maybe kojima should go into filmmaking.

Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-15,complete garbage game 210 worst gaem evar! written and directed by hideo kojima... 910  truly revolutionary!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-08,"death stranding is simply gaming art.. and it is typical that people will either love, or hate it.. personally i loved it, and it's a gaming experience unlike any i've ever seen before. it is through and through breaking new ground in every aspect of it, and hideo has been able to turn what on paper sounds like a snooze fest, into an amazing gameplay experience for those who can enjoy it's pace. because if you are easily bored, need a steady flow of action, or like to stay to familiar game mechanics, then you're not likely to enjoy this one.. but if you enjoy new experiences, calm and relaxing gameplay, combined with excellent story and graphics  and all out new game mechanics  then you might love this gem. it's certainly a goty type of game, yet certainly won't be for everyone."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-16,"if he doesn't like rain, he won't last a day in washington"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-16,"i just think hideo kojima needed someone to tell him no, and being surrounded by hollywood socialites that really wanted to do an art piece with him was not going to help with that whatsoever. as it stands, death stranding is less of a video game and more of an art film. art films are fine and all, but i wouldn't pay 60 to see one."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-16,you mean they had a character in this game called diehardman that wasnt played by bruce willis?
Action,Death Stranding,2023-02-22,"i just love how everyone avoids saying that this game sucks. story is shit? yes. gameplay is boring? yes. characters are annoying? yes. the world is empty with copy paste locations and not much to do? yes. but hey, it's not for everybody so it doesn't suck you can make the same excuse for any game, bubsy 3d does not suck, it's not for everybody, there are people who enjoyed playing as red cat or whatever he is and enjoyed boring jumping and collecting shit."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-15,"i feel like what was the most damaging thing to the game was the marketing surrounding it. only one of four trailers actually showed what the game was actually about, every other one focused on the story, this created expectations for ds to be something like kojimas other games, most notably mgs. ds is a very different game from litteraly everything else ever released, one way or another some people are not going to enjoy it,and they really should have been up front about that. i personally liked it, ive heard he biggest complain was that its a walking simulator, which is only half true, the whole difficulty and fun of the game is figuring out the best way to traverse terrain with the most cargo, yes you are walking, but you are constantly making choices on how you are getting to your destination, this sometimes includes going through bt areas. and tbh i can see how most people wouldnt like this kind of gameplay. the other biggest complaint was how confusing the story was, and how it had shit writing. i fully agree with the shitty writing, the game has its fair share of good scenes, but holy shit the dialogue is so clunky and cringe inducing, especially with side characters and in the exposition dumps. as for the confusing part, i dont really agree, its fairly complex but totally understandable, the issues only arise when you really get into the details, by that i mean the diary entries, there are so many conflicting lines and pages, so many convenient events and actions. seriously, if you want a good story then just watch the cutscenes, they overall amount to a cool story about nihilism not the edgy kind of nihilism, i feel like i should especify that. tldr you americans cant comprehend art ok?!?? edit if you want to experience ds without playing it, please do yourself a favor and watch this video httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vzg2y5rxlgm its 7 fucking hours long sry for that, but it covers litteraly everything this game has to offer in the most objective way i could find on youtube. if you really want to form an opinion on the game, i suggest you watch it, its really well made."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-15,once there was an explosion a bang which made my gf pregnant
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-15,yes... like mario and princess beach was the line that literally killed my sense of motivation to even help these people. seeing sam and amelie run across the beach for no reason really made me laugh. i just couldn't take it seriously
Action,Death Stranding,2023-09-10,"as someone who thinks this game is an absolute masterpiece and wants it to get every award ever, i should have never decided to see what other people thought of it"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-24,i would have liked to seen the reactions of the critics if the game come out out from a noname studio than kojima
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-15,it's a very unique game so is shagfu.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-16,"uh yeah officer, that crazy man is running around in a meadow in what seems to look like wisconsin"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-05,"doesn't help with immersion either that just about every character is a homunculus wearing the skin of a celebrity pulled from your tv or entertainment news feed. how do i take these people seriously when all i see is the walking dead, my neighbour del torosan, and the villain from casino royale?"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-15,"i'm getting exhausted just by watching. no offense to the act man, i'm talking about the game."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-19,"six i prefer the word courier, now where's my nine iron"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-05-16,i will say my most memorable moment in this game was when i was able to make actual guns instead of the non lethals and i was like fuck yeah i can kill the mule dudes now so i went through and killed a whole encampment. i immediately forgot the whole premise of the game and how death works and later the game reminds me to bring the bodies to an incinerator and i'm sitting there like fuck. i don't have time to bring all of them to an incinerator. i never used guns after that again. but i did kill a few people with the truck on accident and that made me so upset lmao.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-27,i think you need to start adding in my opinion to your titles act man!
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-17,"if he doesn't like rain, he wouldn't last a day in washington. shows washington snowfall from 4 years ago."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-22,"a fucking rainbow, are you trying to kill me? that shit is dangerous ah, yes, companies 0.002 seconds after pride month is over"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-06-02,actually i do need to say the plants are effected if you play the game when timefall happens you will notice that the grass and moss are dieing and growing again
Action,Death Stranding,2023-02-18,"between this and his tlou2 comments, dude has zero media literacy. i really respect his opinions on halo because hes spot on there but damn"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-08-09,"432 it actually does effect plants. at least in game, if you look at the grass while it's raining you can see it rapidly die and then regrow."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-20,"death stranding? more like schrdingers cat standing because no one will tell if its good or bad. i've come to the conclusion that the game is not well designed considering game mechanics. this, however, does not negate the fact it is an open world sandbox that can provide a fresh and much needed creative experience for the player. if you like the game good on you, but understand that the game does not fulfill its best of capability."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-23,"damn, for a game thats all about being a post man, it didnt really deliver im sorry"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-04-05,"this was one of the best, most unique gaming experiences i've ever had. put 166 hours into it on my first playthrough. other than online gamesrdo  gtao, this is my most played game. i'm not even a kojima stan, literally never played one of his games before. but i loved this, so much. the story is ingrained in my brain. it made me feel things only hellblade and plague tale requiem have been previously able to."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-15,i think that death stranding is one of the perfect examples of a game that just simply isn't for everyone. me personally i loved it but i see why others did not.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-04-01,the game can't seem to go 5 minutes without someone spouting expository dialogue or introducing a new mechanic is this your first kojima game?
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-15,"wow, i think you're the only youtuber i'm subscribed to that im aware has disliked this game so far. now i get to see the other point of view."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-15,"when are you going to do, bioshock, a masterpiece?! or why is bioshock so awesome?!"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-21,it's very ironic and sad that the game that was meant to bring people together is dividing them.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-15,"death stranding has been so devisive, i wonder what act man thought of it sees title ah, there we go."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-09,i'm so pissed i paid 50 for this game. i heard all these good reviews of it so i figured it has to be at least decent and after 4 hours of it i had enough. it's not fun...
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-15,death stranding is what you get when there is nobody around to say no to kojima.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-16,there's one good thing about death stranding the fun of doom 2016 triples after playing this game for an hour
Action,Death Stranding,2021-04-11,"hideo kojima is famously known for overdosing on meth and getting to work on his latest game, death stranding"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-03,this aged badly
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-15,"if a story is only good at certain points while the rest is a boring slog, then it's bad, plain and simple. hideo kojima isn't the guy i go to for subtlety and nuance both for story or gameplay. there's a difference between exploring complex themes and claiming that's what your story is about."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-15,love death stranding and all its dumb things. probably because ive always wanted to play a game about resource transportation that isnt trucks
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-21,"remember guys, death stranding is temporary, but doom is eternal."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-11-20,"coming back now to tell y'all this game is worth it. if you just let yourself be immersed in the world, it will be a once in a lifetime experience. safe travels, porters."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-28,why is the entire series of nba 2k so garbage
Action,Death Stranding,2021-07-15,"just a correction here time fall does damage plants and rocks. that's why the world looks the way it does. the roads eroded away, and so did rocks, creating the eerie landscape. the only plants you see apart from a certain area is moss because it can grow almost anywhere, is tiny enough to be affected by time fall entirely and reproduces fast. in fact, you can see it sprout, grow and die in the span of seconds during the time fall. from what i understood trees died out because time fall accelerated the trees' growth and metabolism, not allowing the roots to supply enough water and nutrients time fall only acceletates time for things it directly lands on. as to the cities, i'm sure they were built with some materials made specifically to last millennia. after all, time fall only ages the things it falls on so a thin coating would be enough to keep buildings safe."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-11-10,you cried when an invisible monster walked by but not when your mom died...lmao
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-09,"say what you want about this game, it set a new graphical standard."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-29,the games difficulty is in how much it wastes your time...
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,you joke about pizza deliveries but this game has an actual pizza delivery mission
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,kevduit  the only person in the world who in tutorial mission gets c rating.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,"fun fact, the energy drinks used to be straight up monster and the canteen would convert water into monster too. i have no idea why this is."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,can't wait tell he finds out that he can actually deliver a pizza
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-22,"i love how this game goes so quickly from theres a bunch of spooky ghosts to you got to close to them, now you are being dragged by shadow hands and the world has turned to oil, oh yeah theres also an inky whale circling you like a shark and they call this game boring"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,im so used to getting good ratings on everything up until mountain knot that i didnt imagine getting a c rating in the tutorial stage was possible
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,"i want this in vr, i'm not even joking. imagine rainfall, with bt's, in vr. scary. ass. shit"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-23,"1722  the thing i hate the most about the ps5. they literally sell a digital only console, but you get locked out of all your digital games any time the sony servers are unstable which happens a lot"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-22,"y'know kev, i realize how much i appreciate your more optimistic perspective untainted by cynicism. you find fun in things that other people tend to whinge about."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,"death stranding is one of the most outrageous, hard to follow games i've ever played but i love it so much. once you get the mechanics down, the story can kind of take a back seat while you zen to it. i first played and finished the game while going through a contentious divorce involving kids, so the story and b.b especially really resonated with me. not ashamed to admit i cried a bit."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-22,i wonder how many people were chewing out kevin for not using stealth in the danger zone
Action,Death Stranding,2023-12-17,we have our heading! here we good! man you unlocked some deep rooted shit right there
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,somehow kev finds a way to everything possible wrong thing at every possible time
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-22,"this game is...something. some call it, masterpiece while others call it complicated and most call it, walking sim. i have played through it several times and honestly still cannot word how this game makes me feel. it's definitely one of the weirdest, but most satisfyingly beautiful games i've ever played. hauling large orders, scaling mountains, sneaking through bt territory...all of it just scratches an itch that no other game can. lol"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,"honestly, this game's story isn't so complicated, but when they explain things they do so in the moment, while you're probably focusing on other things or so late in the very long story that you go ''that makes sense'', but it won't help your enjoyment while playing the game. and is a very long game."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-23,"and then i rethink of myself trying not to break anything on my path, being cautious, taking care of the stuff and so on... your video is brilliant d !"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,i don't blame people for not liking this game i can see where there coming from but personally i love it so much i can't even put it into words
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-22,"played it for the firsttime last month, spent about 40 hours after the campaign just building my roads and setting up a zipline network, 1010"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-22,"i honestly love this game. the fiddly controls have a purpose, introducing weight, momentum, and balance in an interesting way. even the grindier elements if you choose to engage with them give you a feeling of accomplishment as you establish a flawless delivery infrastructure across the map, and you get some pretty cool gear for it. the story is of course bizarre and based on somewhat abstract ideas. the delivery of exposition is heavyhanded and still somewhat confusing, but it's usually pretty damn cool and unique. also lol  why do they have you go this way. i played this game twice and didnt even know that area you were in existed lmfao. part of the fun is in your first time playing, not knowing the map layout and trying to figure out how to get across it. when i played through it again it was all much easier and more straightforward bc i knew the best routes."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-23,i straight up want to see you do more of this! i know i'm not alone.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,take your pizza ...... if you only knew
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,when it went on epic for free recently i had the exact same reaction of' might as well give it a shot' only to come away with it being so weirdly enjoyable... it's a true toptier walking stimulator as only kojima could envision
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-22,"we have our heading. here we gooo! i understood that reference, the disney dvd opening titles thing. nice touch"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-22,"i understand why people didnt like it, especially everyone that quit before chapter 3 i swear to god i spent so much time setting up delivery networks and roads etc felt so cool helping others too, i played it during a time where it was snowing a lot where i lived and as i walked in the snow all i could think about was death stranding, me breaking the snow and making a path for others to follow and walk easier i just really loved this game and the vibe, i wish more people would give it a chance"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-22,"i love that after everything we can come to the conclusion that this game really is just.. completely unlike anything we've ever gotten to experience. btw, difficulty only involved the healthbars basically and how much of a sponge they are."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,1435 best ladder use ever
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-22,i am so insanely addicted to this game that i have to force myself to stop playing for days at a time or else i dream about it.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,the haunted story of an unnamed food app delivery driver.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-23,"kev heard low roar tell him don't be so serious, and he sure listened lmao by the way, rip ryan, i'm bummed i only really got into your band after you passed. your voice was something else dude. very soothing."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-12-08,oh i so wish you did a full playthrough of this. your commentary is hilarious.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-22,"why do they make you go this way they don't, it's just you"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-07,"i wish i could wipe my memory and play this game again for the first time... the moment i put two and two together and realized that i had to carry my own dead mother on my back to an incinerator ... i was shook, to say the least"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-23,i've watched a combined 10 or so hours of gameplay from this. i still have no idea what the hell is going on.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,kojima was probably on something when he created death stranding i swear even after seeing the trailers i'm still confused.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-22,i started playing this game a month ago and i'm loving it so far. i'm so glad you're playing this too!! please post more
Action,Death Stranding,2024-10-17,"1657 enjoy this bb, emjoy the shakes"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,thank you kojima for giving us an explosion.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,"you should totally play this again. its so confusing but i think youre gonna love it. on a related note, if youve never tried out a game called prey 2017, i highly recommend it."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-03-07,"so i worked for amazon when this came out, me and my coworkers joked about delivering packages all day just to go home and deliver packages in a virtual world."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-08-06,1658 uhh soothe bb proceeds with baby shaking syndrome
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,this game really makes you feel like an unpaid delivery driver
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-24,734  looks like someone used to watch disney dvds
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,633 i've never laughed so hard in my entire life that was so damn funny omg
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-17,love the commentary!!  don't stop doing these type of videos. any game. just keep doing these!
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,when i tried this game i felt the feeling i had as a kid finding out a new mechanic like wall jumping. this is a masterpiece. never felt so connected whilst alone.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-22,"wall of text incoming, since personally, i loved this game, haha. a lot of people who call it nothing but a walking simulator only played like, the first two hours which is 0.00001 of the game and usually never even unlocked vehicles, guns, time travel... and for people who go the story makes no sense, it's just random and unexplained, the game actually overexplains every single little thing, which i do have kind of an issue with. it sometimes feels like they didn't want dead air, so they fill it with people constantly calling you during your traveling between destinations. the best parts of deliveries are when they leave you to your own devices to figure everything out, it's actually really peaceful... part of the fun is building the highway and setting up your zipline network to speed across the whole country helping people, and yes, you do have pizza delivery missions! i actually avoided the elder because he was annoying me, until i came back later and it turned out he had died i think it triggers if you don't deliver like, a new pacemaker and his meds or something, can't remember. i mean, i liked that mean old guy. so i bit the bullet, reloaded, and did sporadic deliveries for him, keeping him alive to the ending, haha. he even tells you how he knows he's not easy to get along with and how thankful he is to you."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-23,your commentary made this the best death stranding game play
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-29,"dont shake the baby. also, dont tell him things like you are useless, you are weak, you will never be king"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-22,"this is great that hes playing it , i was really hesitant about buying this game because i really had no idea what it was about but im loving it seeing like this!"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-24,157 top tier kevin xd
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,the blood grenades and upgraded versions make this game a cake walk.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-24,most walkie games ever created you not played dayz
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,death stranding is just a shroom trip with extra steps.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-22,bro so close to 1 mill!!!!! congrats brochacho!!! your hella funny and deserve every bit of success m8!
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,"the world music and story is amazing, the story is complex but it does a good job at explaining it. this game is amazing, idc if people find the gameplay boring. not every game has to be super crazy."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-22,2210 umm did this man just skyrim his way up the moutain....with a bike?!
Action,Death Stranding,2023-02-01,i was really skeptical whether i'd like this game or not. after playing for almost 100hrs i can actually say that i love the game. it's unique and the systems implemented for game play are not like anything i've ever played.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-22,1128 now who wants some pizza!? does he know?
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,"wait until you see the ending...... of the ending of the ending of the end. this game made me think i finished it 4 times, then hideo kojima just gently slaps you across your tired face with 2 more hours of content. truly fun game altogether, though"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,kojima wants to make movies so badly
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,"this game is definitely the most fascinating game ive ever played. i love kojima, love mgs so i knew i would love this masterpiece too. the story in my opinion wasnt as confusing as some of the other stuff kojima has done. just an overall amazing experience."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-24,go! goooooooooooo! kev to his video game motorcycle
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-22,"kojima needs an editor or a coauthor that is willing to tell him no, we're not doing that, it makes no sense because he makes these really interesting worlds, but the little things that don't make sense add up very quickly"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-23,been waiting for a death stranding kevduit video for ages. not disapointed.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,"as much as ppl love to shit on this gem i gotta say the amazon delivery experience was pretty dope. unironically, this game had some of the most aesthetically pleasing and detailed maps and biomes in recent memory. this game was screenshot galore, the story was super intriguing and the characters were really well written. gameplay was great although it took its time to get used to and to progress but when it picks up its a blast to experiment with different ways of transportation and the combat had multiple ways of dealing with enemies and bts alike. easily the best experience you can play out there just by story and characters alone."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-22,the story  nice the gameplay  hmmmmm almost boring
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,only took 8 hours to beat the tutorial i'd say he did good
Action,Death Stranding,2024-04-06,this is one of my favorite games cant wait for ds2
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,i need to play this again. i no lifed it years ago from red box and never played it again. i wish phantom pain had the level of terrain movement that this game did.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,the rainbow is gods promise line got my subscription. however you feel about it. the line was a good one
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,this game is a masterpiece. period.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-22,2812 insert building lego noises
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-31,"you had me dying with the taylor swift reference.  i tried this game...then set it aside, only to take my time and actually try it. while some of the story details went over my head, i started to realize that it was actually pretty good. it's definitely not for those accustom to instantaneous action or gratuitous violence."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-02-02,i love how the directors cut steam version of the game doesn't have monster energy during product placement the the original ps45 versions lol
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,"they weponised piss, this game is awesome"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,238 i knew it i wasnt the only one singing that while playing!

Action,Death Stranding,2023-10-06,"i absolutely loved seeing you be so reckless, it's like a playstyle i've never seen because i'm too scared to go faster than walking speed"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-13,"it's still wild to me that this game released just before the outbreak of a pandemic and over two years of lockdowns, selfisolation and people being afraid to get near other people. it's themes and messaging literally couldn't have been more poignant."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-03-12,what is happening???. this concludes the full summary of death strandings story
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,the best walking simulator you will ever play. literally one of my favorite games
Action,Death Stranding,2023-03-16,"they way people fawn over this game do you even know what was going on??? my guy, this whole thing looks like a bad acid trip. outta my face"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,its death stranding indeed. its fine
Action,Death Stranding,2023-03-15,"combat in this isn't a constant thing so when it happens, it's kinda heart racing. i remember running away from a group of enemies and there was a steap hill in front of me that i had to run down. so i started running down the hill didn't have any other options but as i was running down i slipped up and tumbled all the way to the bottom lol then i had to frantically reclaim my cargo as spears are being thrown at me. pretty cool"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,if this game doesn't make you wanna join the amazon delivery cinematic universe nothing else will.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-04,it's hilarious to me that kev took the most random and questionable route with the corpse but also did the whole delivery without figuring out how to do the weight properly
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,gotta try this game.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-22,"what are they gonna do now, stop me!? is stopped"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,hideo put 75 of resources into making open fields look really good and didn't leave must left for much else that explains this game and the way the content is layed out

Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-22,"death stranding is the quintessential example of one of the games of all time it's interesting but it's so strange, kojima is a very creative game visionary"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-23,we have our heading  here we goooo! finally. someone else.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-21,now this is not a game its a masterpiece.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-22,seeing the first 3 minutes of this video me   how? why? why are you like this?
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-22,"so glad to see more content creators give this game a chance. even if the game isnt your taste or style, it is still an amazing game. personally when i found out you can use the smoke decoys as a type of boxing gloves kinda it made me wonder what other kind of items could be used as something different. yes, i threw the bomb around. yes i threw the bomb at mules. and it was awesome!!"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-02-09,as soon as he started singing i'm still stranded i immediately thought of slimecicle.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,kojima is a high art kind of guy who just so happened to choose video games as the preferred medium.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,ive completed the first one 3 times and still have no idea whats going on. 1010.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-11,"as a 3d artist, it all really comes down to time, money and resources. did you know that models are first made in realistic and high resolution, and then scaled down or stylised. not the other way around. artists can easily produce high quality graphics, but you have to pay them, give them adequate time, give them the resources needed for rendering, and not threaten to replace them with ai every month."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-11,kojima is the only person who can put out 30 minutes worth of trailers and still leave us knowing literally nothing
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"they just shouldn't look blurry, shimmery, flickery, ghosty etc."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,the little detail i love about the dollman is that his model generates less frames like hes in one of those flipbooks.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,r.i.p low roar vocalist... ds1 had a lot of combat btw...
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"those environments look incredible. kojima could release a game with no information, no trailers and ship it in a cd case with a giant question mark for a sleeve he's still getting my money."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,damn you kojima how have you made a trailer my favorite peice of media for the month ?!
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,broke my heart when she teleported and the baby fell.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,seeing the baby and monsters makes it feel like if ethan was a postal worker in village instead of killing everyone.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"it's a masterpiece. i loved the first one so much and i cried so hard when he said c'mon lou, one last delivery."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-11,"i remember when the first time i played ds in the middle of night alone, carrying the corpse across the map to deliver it... it gave me a goosebump that even other horror games didn't even gave me... it reminded me when i was staying awake a whole night to watch over a dead relative body at home... the feeling was so surreal..."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-11,630 im pretty sure kojima did explicitly state somewhere that weather events like flash floods are a new game mechanic.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-11,050 keep in mind the game kojima wanted to make and give you for mgs5 that you expected from the trailers didnt happen because he wanted to spend more time polishing the game and konami fired him for it
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-11,"i find it funny just when you thought the trailer's done...oh there's more? and then you think, it's done finally. nope, there's more!"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,even if the game sucks  which i don't expect  this should go down as one of the greatest trailers ever. it got me emotional and i haven't even finished the first game yet
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"it was only about walking until you got the trike, then it was jumping and flying as far as you could"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"thank the horizon forbidden west game engine. i didn't like hfw as a game, but the engine is the crown jewel of the ps5 generation, if you ask me."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,wb should take notes
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,ubisoft needs to watch this video
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"bro, ds1 was my first kojima game. i played it just to see what the hype was all about. now i'm all in. also, 10 most hype trailers ever?"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"after the saints row reboot, suicide squad and the veilguard, i'm sick of purple."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,we dont get games game trailers like this anymore. hideo kojimas the only director out there who can make a trailer that i cant make any sense of and yet its gotten me so hyped! he knows how to make a game exciting. we dont need another fortnight or overwatch out there. goty contender right here
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,surprised jake isn't losing his pizza over this!
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"oh god i miss mgs. mgs 5 was the first mgs game for me after i understood stealth and after that there hasn't been anything like it. stealth as a genre is as good as dead in aaa games. imagine a game similar to mgs 5 where the missions get crazier like the 1960s bond movies, infiltrating a secret base under a volcano, cruise ship smuggling nukes, gold finger's facility or even an air base and exfiltrating by flying off with a jet. so much potential."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"hi falcon,lt's folks"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-18,"547 that is not a gigantic electrical storm its a nebula. after a supernova explosion, when a star explodes, this happens. this means we can calculate the time frame of the earth according to that nebula. i think maybe betelgeuse exploded during this event on earth"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,all i want is a game made by sam lake and kojima together now... please! this feels like calling it a video game is an insult.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,they should look like samuel l.jackson and john travolta are in the room with me .
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,nowadays i am more concerned about optimization rather than the game's graphics
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,very diffirent than the first game proceeds to name things all in the first game...
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-11,"the best thing about death stranding is that its truly its own game it is unapologetic about if you like it or not, its artistic expression."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"545 not electrical storm, its called a nebula"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"aaa isn't defined by the price the game cost the company to make. not from the gamers perspective. amazing graphics amazing story amazing gameplay ubisoft is currently learning this the hard, very hard way..."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-18,"what if mr. not snake is representative of kojima's past... which continues to hunt him and we have to defeat or make peace with his past as a secondary antagonist, his past then informs us on how to proceed and overcome the game's main antagonist."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,let's just hope people give it a chance. i am already disappointed that the 200 dollar collectors edition has no steelbook and is a digital download. that is so far off whoever at sony has been doing this bs needs to be stopped. collectors want physical items.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-11,"i don't mind 80 walking in tranquility. the first game actually helped me, an indoor person, to understand the joyful feeling of hiking."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,not sure if it's the type of game i'd enjoy but it does look beautiful.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-12,"i think nowadays it's more about this is how performance should look like in a aaa game. having good graphics is really not the problem imho. ds2 looks phenomenal but i'm kind of worried about the performance on ps5, not gonna lie."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,the first game was just the foundation and now kojima just went crazy and added stuff to make it better. not to mention the story was pretty straight foward
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"man this looks so fucking good. i can't wait the first one was kojima testing the waters, see how far he can take this concept, and now he is just going all out."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,how they should look. or. what they should look like.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-11,"maybe the second game might be like mgs 2 where he lets us play a different character the snake guy? instead of sam. also, the 'we should not have connected' thing in the trailer really reminds me of mgs 2's theme about social network and the danger that comes with it."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"man, kojima's mind really functions in a different dimensions than everyone elses. can't wait for the plot, knowing kojima ds2 is gonna be wild."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-13,"i agree, aaa should look like that. now if only kojima knew the first thing about pacing or writing dialogue, ds 2 could be a decent game. sadly, he is just a hack with a boner for hollywood."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"ds1 is addictive, people call it a walking simulator but it was so much more"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"the things you called goofy is called creative freedom, and it's nice, we need games that's not overly realistic sometimes."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-11,"every time troy baker is in the mix, i always get excited to see his work in games, that man is a legend to this day i still couldnt believe he voiced joker"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-11,how can anyone watch this stuff and not laugh out loud? first game i couldn't get beyond meeting mommy president before absolutely busting out laughing.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"synopsis i don't know what's going on, but it looks awesome"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,also between this and splitfiction i love it when they announce the release date so close to the date . it comes out in three months. they shouldnt announce and hype these games years before coming out.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-11,i don't think that's an electrical storm at 545. it looks like a nebula. in fact it kinda looks like the crab nebula though the shape is a little off and small detail the crab nebula is 6500 light years away.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-11,"not my type of game, but innovation and different perspective is always appreciated."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-11,"is it possible that the whole mapland in ds1 is still used in ds2 and the things we see in the trailer is actually the same mapland but progressed? all the empty spaces now filled up with new settlements and bases, or even monsters? which means that whatever the ds1 community has built for the past years will still be carried over and relevant to ds2?"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,people who complain ab this being a boring walking simulator after putting 30 minutes into the game have no fucking idea what theyre missing. that trailer alone was a cinematic masterpiece.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-11,545 i don't know if it's due to a mismatch between the script and the visual but in any case that thing in the distance is the crab nebula
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,not my kind of game but i do appreciate his crazy mind and what he creates.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-20,"combat or no combat  the game is phenomenal. i am finishing up the 1st game, and i absolutely love it. the combat or lack thereof, the walking, the building of structures, the trying to figure out what the hell is going on, the graphics, the voice overs...1010"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-11,gigantic electrical storm.. bro thats a nebula xd
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-11,i've played enough of kojimas games to know that 90 of these moments are traditional cutscenes and scripted moments. gameplay wise i would say theyre adding vehicle combat. basically expanding on the road networks from the past. the specific moment captured looks like a boss fight. creating pseudo dynamic interactions with specific terrain. basically making sliding terrain a hazard. fire is probably scripted for a cinematic encounter. the metal gear fight is probably a minigame boss fight for story reasons. the world will likely have some largely developed cities that act as major hubs. then the rest of the world will require connecting those cities and resource gathering to build up what is basically sams trade network. or this games version of mother base
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,708 ghetagagoottic
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"sorry, was that roy campbell on the radio in the trailer? wild!"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,050 blowing your what?????
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,he said after ds2 he will be making a more action oriented espionage game like mgs. thats the one im really excited for. i will be playing this too tho
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"man, i loved the first game and i was hoping for a first day pc release... i guess i will have to wait a year or two again for it to drop on pc."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-11,kojima is his own boss now and has no one above him telling him to hurry up and dont go over budget
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,i like this channel but this is such an amateur take on the first game it makes me think he didnt finish it. or a lot of it went over his head
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"for the love of god, never ever say 'how whatever should look like' again. how they should look, great. what they should look like, awesome. how they should look like  no ... please."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-12,anybody noticed the textures in this game? the best i ever seen
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"i know i say that graphics aren't everything, but when meant to be, they should either be photo realistic like in the fox re engine or not bother at all"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-11,one monotony simulator was enough.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"omg, the f doll bro  when it holds its arms up  435 dying"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,konami let's do a remake of our old games! kojima let's make a new badass game with our old character cameo on it!
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,indie game dev here. i would still make inovative games if i had a big budget.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-15,11 minutes of gameranx fangirling about deathstranding 2 3
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"reminder that aaa is not about graphics, but about the depth of content and normally technical optimization and innovation"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-12,"654 no one hears a word, they say, has the memory gone are your feeling numb"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"yet to actually watch the full video, i personally think the idea of having aaa be a category is subjective. some of my fav games in history arent triple aaa. triple aaa stands for high end graphics and a main stream game made by a big game publisher or developer. would love other inputs as to why triple a is a term used for what is essentially high production quality coz honestly as i said ive never seen a point to call games that"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-12,what if the first one was just a prologue lol
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"i dont gaf about how good a game looks. can a aaa game maintain its designed performance ? does it have a cohesive artstyle? does it maintain its quality? thats all i care about. i dont need insanely realistic games. more aaa games should pick a graphical style and maintain it, not strive for seeing each individual speck of cheese dust on someones fingers."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-14,anyone else hope its still 80 quiet walking or just me?
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,the game will probably work on launch too. which is more than can be said by most other triple a games
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-12,439 is that ma dongseok?!
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"hello, falcon!!"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-12,"no one can out kojima, kojima, the guy knows his audience"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,falcon really blowin kojima in this one lol
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,that electrical storm looks like the crab nebula... a supernova remnant
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"nobody knows what the first game was about, now kojimas building a skyscraper on top of that nothingness"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"603 in first game, rocks were breaking and falling from mountains , so i think avalanche is also gonna be part of gameplay."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-11,"director hideo kojima, famous for the metal gear solid series and often pitied for his messy separation from konami, has all the creative freedom in the world, but he cant stop sabotaging an interesting premise with banal and laughably contradictory moments.  jed pressgrove"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-14,"i am sooooo looking forward to this! the first game was a serious joy  weird af, but fun as hell too."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,all games should look as good as indiana jones and the great circle and not be buggy at the same time.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-11,338 some might say it is the gran turismo of walking simulators.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,never preorder...unless it's hideo.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"i really gotta go back to the first one. i got pretty far, but put it down and never finished. unlike all the hate it got, i enjoyed it."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,theres more metal gear references here and there.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-18,"in italy we were amazed to discover neil as it is interpreted by luca marinelli, a really nice actor that stole our hearts in a bunch of italian movies i hope hell do great with kojima"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,looking goty 2025
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"i'm beyond excited! i really hope they keep the ability to see, use and like other people's structures and vehicles. i loved that feeling of watching the area grow with my hard work and others. as long as i can still put my zip lines around like a jungle gym, i will be happy"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-28,"click this link httpssponsr.isbootdevthatguyglen and use my code thatguyglen to get 25 off your first payment for boot.dev. thats 25 off your first month or your first year, depending on the subscription you choose."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-29,"the live announcement that kojima wasn't allowed to accept his award is among the most embarrassing moments in gaming history. konami really did a bold faced villain move in front of a live audience, despicable."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-28,it's so heart warming that kojima being a pretty introverted person made so many connections and had so many people help him through out his carrier because he did his job fondly and helped the industry
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-03,i casually bumped into kojima outside of san diego comic con long time ago. the day was over and he was being escorted to his vehicle. my friend was dressed as big boss and kojima took notice. he asked to take a picture with my friend. its the one photo i will never forget taking! kojima is a gentleman and a genius. its inspiring to see him continue his work after what happened with konami. never give up on what you love
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-14,hideo was determined to become either a film director or a novelist. old mgs heads yeah no shit
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-16,"i love how the director of guerilla just deadass commissioned a box and unique storage device with the entire source code of his engine as a gift. like you said, no attachments, no agreements, just legit a gift. that to me is something that cannot be overstated as a form of actual pure kindness. he wanted to see kojima succeed, nothing more, nothing less. there are seldom moments in the gaming industry like that, but hoo boy, they are more meaningful than we can ever imagine."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-30,"i love keanu, but i'm so glad he went with mads. phenomenal casting."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-28,astounding how even one of the most successful and visionary designers gets told by accountants and executives that it's a dumb idea whenever they present something new. i think its one of lifes permanent issues. people with ideas having to get through a wall of people with no ideas. love the game engine gift. must have been a major moment
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-07,"this whole story is making me emotional. what gets to me is that hideo is making a game about making connections with other even when you feel apart, and his whole journey to create his studio was him feeling alone but then all the connections he's made over the years supported him and gave him what he needed to create his achievements. there's the whole part of his team not understanding the game and questioning the appeal but they still went with it and kept at it until they found themselves having fun. it's just so beautiful that kojima couldn't get a loan because he had no actual results, but then he found a banker who was a fan of his work and gave him the loan. when he wanted a certain building he was denied because his company wasn't publicly traded, but one of the owners was a fan so he was allowed to get the office. the power of inspiring people."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-20,the requeat of kojima was denied. however x was a fan of kojima and allowed him to xyz
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-29,"i'm happy he had so many fans with deep pockets help him out. without them we wouldn't have more kojima games beyond mgs5. never go public, game devs."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-28,"i rather enjoyed death stranding. the gameplay wasn't the most exciting thing in the world, and the story was about as comprehensible as german folktales being read aloud by cthulhu. but kojima had an idea for a weird game that was never going to be a commercial smashhit, and by god, he was going to see that it got made. i really respect that, and it was nice to play a game that didn't feel like i'd already played it a million times before. which is of course, why many people didn't like it."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-30,watching this video made me realized video games are in a cycle of capitalism where passionate people make the industry which then get occupied by opportunist with deep pockets until it crashes down and a new generation of passionate people rebuild it.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-31,"stupidly i listened to the negative criticism and avoided this game until recently when, out of pure curiosity, i installed it and gave it a shot. that was 4 months ago, i'm on my second playthrough aiming for a second platinum trophy on an altaccount. i'm already thinking about my third playthrough and how i want to experience the game, opting to play the vanilla digital deluxe edition with no online assist just me, sam, bb and the environment. i haven't been able to think about anything else, and knowing there is ds2 on the horizon just deepens my fascination with this game. i'm really happy that i gave it a chance and truly believe this to be one of the greatest video gaming experiences i've had so far. this was a great video, i hope it gives somebody else the nudge they need to give it a fair chance."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-06,2248  sam isn't super strong  when he effortlessly carries 80kg of gear with him.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-28,i cant fathom companies making short term gains for long term crashes.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-30,"your motion design work keeps getting better and better. i think this one in particular is probably one of your best yet in terms of editing. i'm not sure anyone else on youtube right now is doing this level of games journalism combined with actually stellar visual storytelling. the iconography and images inside the wireframe diamonds is a small but brilliant little touch from the uiux of death stranding, and i see you for that. everything just flows so effortlessly together. you're always a priority watch for me when you post"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-28,death stranding and the first dishonored are the only game that gives legit and logical reason to avoid both combat and killing. no forcing moral pov to people
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-07,its really funny that he wasnt going to make another stealth game but now is going to make the ultimate stealth game.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-26,"the cool thing about death stranding is that i never really feel alone. i always feel connected because i see bridges and ladders left behind by other porters, roads that are getting built, and signs left behind everywhere so i end up feeling like other people are out on the journey with me, its a great feeling"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-06,interesting to think that death stranding is still technically an indie game
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-29,i remember placing a full set of grappling lines from the top of the mountain in the second map to the bottom skipping over an enemy camp. the best feeling was taking the line from one end to the other.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-27,"when i interviewed kojima around a decade ago, he really is as humble as he appeared, loves a good joke and is very sharp. i even candidly asked him if he would ever consider a game where zone of the ender mechs would fight mgs mechs, he laughed a bit and said unlikely. he also expressed interest in making a game based on grey fox, but there were no plans at the time."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-28,"great video, this man has inspired me for my whole adult life. i'm glad he's doing what he loves and i hope he continues to do so for as long as he wants to."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-28,"it was always my wish with kojima's career that he would be given the keys to his own projects and so far i'm very happy he got that chance and ran with it. there isn't a lot of triple a titles that are like death stranding, something that doesn't try to ape as something that it isn't. i hope he continues to work on projects he feels strongly about because that's when he is at his best. oh yeah, he also has a kickass taste in films, the guy is a total film nerd worth his salt."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-28,"holy shit that was such a good video. i put this on as background but ended up just intently watching all of it. great stories, great research, very well paced. i feel inspired to make things."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-29,"i played this game for 80 hours and i loved it exactly because it is something very different. its experimental in a way indie games usually are able to get away with, yet it has the scope and polish of a big budget game. this is not the usual bogstandard aaa checklist game that is so painfully mediocre to the point it is worse than a bad game. all in all, i am looking forward to death stranding 2 and any future games from his studio."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-10-02,044 nooo why did you cut the clip short i love seeing him walk faster than the platform under him
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-14,"the fact that hideo kojima ran into every possible wall and still managed to climb over it and thrive goes to show how passion and kindness go so far in making it. his vision and connections built upon each other to help him achieve success, and because of that we got to experience more of his work while reinforcing that very image of him. this world is full of struggle and no people, whenever there is creative work at play the risk is always substantial. because people have to like it, otherwise your value and worth gets thrown out the window, unlike if you were to help create medicine or food. what we can get from this tale is that no matter the circumstance, as long as you have a passion and strive for more, never let go of it even within your toughest struggle, because there are others like you who will see the value of your efforts and together bring forth your true potential. a great video!"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-10-18,kojima says that his mother was the only one to believe in him. mothers are the best. a true blessing in life is a caring mother.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-02,"mgs and death stranding are among my favorite franchises not only in gaming, but in media in general. whenever i see people try and argue games aren't art, i just tell them to play any kojima game, and then get back to me. there's always a deeper message in his games. someone once told me you know a good movie when you can watch it multiple times and get something new every time. that's what playing a kojima game is like. the first time is kinda confusing, but on repeat playthroughs, things make a lot more sense. he's a master at giving just the right amount of info to keep you curious but not give away the twist till the very end. not to mention the multihour long cutscenes that could be entire featurelength movies themselves not everybody's cup of tea, i get it, but i love them. he really does push the medium forward, it's crazy to think this was his vision since the nes days. so ahead of his time, but luckily, technology caught up to him. can't wait for ds2 and od."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-31,he looks like he's 45. huge respect to him
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-10,you forgot the most important detail in the game mate. the monster energy sponsorship
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-09,im glad to hear that he is working on a new stealth game. we need at least one more before he retires!!!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-29,"what a brilliant video about hideo kojima. i wonder if kojima misses metal gear solid or if he has simply moved on and poured his love into death stranding instead. he is simply a brilliant game creator. mgs was his baby, and kojimas transition from metal gear solid to death stranding is fascinating to me."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-30,1748 only publicly traded companies can rent there so its a den of snakes...
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-09,death stranding is my favorite game of all time as it pushed me as a gamer and brought in new concepts and game styles that i had never experienced and made me rethink about video games as a whole. i truly think most of the people that dont like death stranding hardly gave it a chance and went in unwilling to try something new
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-01,0059 kojima wearing a duran duran tshirt
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-20,death stranding is to kojima as the star wars prequels are to george lucas. growing up on mgs death stranding felt like a worse rugpull than when you had to play as raiden in mgs2.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-30,"amazing video! man, the more i learn about hideo kojima the more i admire him... he seems like a truly great guy."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-29,thanks for this!! what a fun and easy way to learn about someone so important to so many. respect the hell out of kojima even more knowing his story. 3
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-23,"he was correct when he said ds would take a while to catch on with many players. on the reddit group for ds, over the past few years i've seen more and more people saying how they finally picked up the game after letting it sit on their shelves and now wonder what took them so long to play. they apologize to hideo, like, omg, i was wrong. this game is amazing! i'm so sorry i dissed it before."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-22,understanding what happened between him leaving and making a new game really opened my eyes to something which i have always criticized. games being anounced so early. it's clear he had no choice. he needed backing. he needed people to believe or else no one would back him personally and financially.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-30,what an excellent documentary. loved seeing all the concept art. ds is such a beautiful game and i'm excited for the sequel.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-31,never played death stranding but the description of the community system reminded me of the messages in dark souls.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-28,"great video as always. i didn't expect the details of his childhood and the influences he had from that going into this, but it added a lot and made me see his work in kind of a new light."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-10-27,"crazy that kojima is 61, because he literally looks like he's in his 40s. even considering that a lot of asian people don't age the same way as westerners he looks really young"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-01,"holy changing title sherlock. how many times did the title change? first his coworkers thought he was crazy, then companies hated him and now he overcame his enemies. the arc of this video's changing titles is so crazy hahahaha"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-09,man... imagine if kojima had just become some random pharmacist.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-09-21,"after playing the game i was so thankful that the live multiplayer system was passive. it had the intended effect of me thinking about other players who might have been there and anytime i was out of laddersgear but saw one placed by another kind player that ended up helping me out made feel really glad. only to watch this documentary and now realizing how much he fought for this idea, makes me feel even more thankful of the games existence!"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-19,"the likes was so confusing at first, like do i get anything for having likes? as i played on and on, i will voluntarily likes a rope or ladder just because this dude just put it in the most convenient place for to scale the mountain. whenever i see somebody liking things i've laid down, it really made me feel happy knowing i did help other people out there. such a great vision hideo"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-16,im just playing it for the first time with the xbox release and it is definitely one of the most unique games ive played. i could see how its not for everyone but i love it.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-29,"great video, good luck growing your channel."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-05,"god i can't wait for death stranding 2, i'm so glad that people like this can get to the position they do"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-08,thank you so much for putting this together!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-23,"in an era where most games lack innovation and are filled with predatory means of monetization, death stranding was a fresh breath of air regardless of people liking the game or not."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-30,"amazing video, im hitting the bell and never missing another upload kojima is god"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-13,"the likes being worthless is what makes them special. you didn't give me likes because you wanted to reward me, you gave it likes by using it and appreciating it."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-29,"i don't see or hear anything in this video that implied kojima's colleagues were enemies. if anything, this felt more like a nothing personal, i just want to make my own original games situation."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-14,"the fact that so many people were saying the concept of ds wasn't going to work, and yet it found it's audience, just makes me feel so happy, because this concept of connections and helping other people out is truly so special, especially in a time when it was so dark and isolating. i can't even begin to explain just how much this game means to me, and i'm so thankful that kojima stuck to his vision because it was a truly spectacular and unforgettable experience."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-15,"this video is incredibly well done! i've watched it a few times now rewatched it recently because of the lastest ds2 trailer just because of how well put together it is. great job! kojima really is a once in a generation kind of creator and death stranding is wholly unique. there's literally no other game that can give you the same experience that ds can. the way kojima talks about making games reminds me of that quote by henry ford that said if i would have asked people what they wanted, they would've said faster horses. kojima has the vision and tenacity to persist with his idea even when everyone around him says no and now, because of that, he has built a brand new ip with a sequel on the way, a brand new studio, and already has multiple projects lined up all in less than a decade. really inspiring stuff! keep on keeping on!"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-29,the only part i'm confused at is since they didn't have computers they drew the logo by hand  there is no way they like didn't own a computer...
Action,Death Stranding,2024-09-10,"it has to be exhausting to deal with teammates and people who keep saying your ideas suck. add guns, no, where are the weapons?, no, how is this going to be fun?, youll see when we put more work into it. gotta give kojima props for sticking to his vision of the game in the face of so many negative perceptions"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-31,"as much as i have nitpicks with the combat in the game, the game finished it for the first time recently made me cry and feel it made me realize how isolated people are still in this postpandemic world. to all people, go outside and experience, no headphones, maybe set your phone to do not disturb and just vibe out, and meet ppl."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-02-16,"story time my wife and i were walking around the tokyo area and we stopped by shinagawa, where the shinkansen stops. before going to see my grandma, we decided to check out the local area. we found a cool park and walked around. was a really good time. eventually, we got hungry. so, while walking around to find a restaurant that looked good, we decided to check out the restaurants in the building his office is located. as we entered, i saw the statue for his company and had no idea what it was at first. i just thought it was cool. i approached the statue and noticed a sign saying kojima productions and was like holy shit, is his office here? i am a longtime metal gear fan and loved the concept for death stranding as it was being unveiled. i hadn't played it at the time we visited, so i didn't know of the new mascot, but now that i'm finally playing the game chapter 6 now this video gets recommended to me. life is pretty interesting, i must say. love it!"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-09,"your videos keeps getting better and better, glen! wonderful video!!"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-02,if hideo kogima cant get a loan from a bank without someone personally loving his games who can?
Action,Death Stranding,2024-10-01,hideo kojima needs to be reigned in. him and konami need each other. konami needs the artist with a vison. kojima needs a team to keep him making something playable. we've seen what each puts out without the other and it's always halfassed. the best of their works was together.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-05,where's the part where the team said they hated it?
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-28,i think i found this video to be different than all the rest and also better. i think it shows how you're improving in your videos
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-21,"just say yes to whatever kojima offers you the level of respect for kojima is crazy, everyone needs people that hype you up like this"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-26,bro looks younger than me but he's twice as old as i am
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-27,"it's not who you are, it's who you know that matters. this is the key to kojima's success as an independant creator."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-09-11,its crazy how everything he received pushback about is what made me fall in love with the game. so excited for death stranding 2
Action,Death Stranding,2024-09-27,"i gasped when i heard that his mom passed during the development of death stranding, thats so heartbreaking"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-09-23,"i doubted kojima's walking simulator but 4 years later when i couldnt find a game to play i decided fuck it why not play death stranding lets just give it a shot. i tried it a bit, got so intrigued at the start, and got so immersed the more i played. i finished it and it ended up being one of the best games ive ever played in my life."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-09-10,"i respect the guy but his vision seems to have come at the cost of professional relationships. he really screwed over david hayter with mgsv, with david only finding out he was passed over on the project in favor of kiefer sutherland after he phoned someone on the production team and asked if they were going to set up recording sessions. kojima never even told david in person or apologized. furthermore, he made hayter audition for every single game featuring snake, even though the character had been synonymous with hayters signature voice. again, great visionary but i think he prioritizes his vision and getting renowned actors in his projects far more than being loyal to his existing staff."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-10-25,pure art this game
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-28,i really want this guy to do a video on the dark soul series
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-10,"i remember a lot of people hating on the game who didn't get it calling it a parcel delivery simulator but the longer u play it it gets better, better gear, routes transport ect. ect, man when i explore a new area and see the black clouds i get nervous and anxious lol almost wanting to just go right by but most times i'm forced to go for the mission, can't remember any other games making me feel like that"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-17,this is why kojima is such a gem. someone who reminds me of what i still want from games. a true innovator in the industry.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-07,"first of all as an obvious metal gear fan, and someone who loves themes that kojima explored, death stranding really did had flaws but not at mechanics at gameplay ironicly at acting story pacing, and world building logic, it litteraly needs to its own video to explain this but for short i think sam uniting world without any ideology or belief sounded really wrong and illogical, people change their entire mindset just because you help them ? at the game rather than we are uniting people we are litteraly just giving internet connection to locals, funny enough sam also doesnt give any emotions properly he is mostly has one facial mimic  why da heck im here look and almost nothing else, i can say the same for rest of the cast too, i really didnt like the acting i cant see any mimic properly and even when they do it looks strange  i think they are trying to give a24 movies strangeness feeling which looks ridicilous  , characters just looks strangely too screen, and omg the dialogues, does kojima realy thinks anyone even the greatest minds talk like this in real life, people at death stranding does not have character but concepts and at a game that you dont have a enemy to defeat  i know rigs exist but he is not the main concern  and main focus of the game is the people we meet, i think it really fails to do so, i can understand the fustration of people who says they didnt like gameplay but i think they need to give it a chance and gain access to main map of the world  i think its at 3rd or 4rd act of the game  which becomes something very extra ordinary and i have never seen before."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-28,"i imagine many of the people who dislike death stranding never made it to the central region. the starting eastern region is pretty underwhelming and is basically a big long tutorial area. the game really opens up and comes into it's own once you reach central region. to anyone who bounced off this game after only playing few hours or so, i highly recommend giving it another go."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-19,the fact he went straight into a sequel for death stranding has me call bs on all the stories about him hating sequels.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-25,playing this game during the pandemic really hit a note. the whole asynchronous crossplay is such a great idea that i hope to one day see it implemented in other games as well. all the haters of this game have clearly not played more than a couple of hours into the story. once the game opens up it just keeps evolving. there is a point when you reach about 80 through the story and you think to yourself this is probably it. there's no more new mechanics . and then the game just keeps giving you more upgrades and expanding the playing field even more. it's a masterpiece in storytelling and game design that i will never forget!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-28,''mixed reviews'' 8085 metacritic scores ain't mixed. any highly rated game will have reviewers that claim it's the worst thing ever made.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-09-14,this video felt like its made from chatgpt
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-05,death stranding is a masterpiece.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-09-30,fantastic from beginning to end! really great mini documentary you've made there! i'm already recommending this to a lot of people!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-20,"i love that you pointed out the whole vibe and feeling being the core of hideo and the game because it shined a light on what makes this game what it is, a feeling, emotion, vibe, whatever you want to call it. i know in the west it didnt do as well and i dont think it gets the credit it deserves, even i left it for a bit at the beginning but every time i play, i become more enveloped in it and the best and most accurate compliment i can give is that it bleeds emotion, isolation, just this particular feeling that in media simply cant be felt elsewhere"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-01,"kojima should have attended that award ceremony and accept the prize. after all, he was already fired. konami couldn't do anything about it. if it was a lifetime achievement award, that's nothing to do with anyone but the recipient of the award."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-27,growing up is realizing kojima was just as bad as konami. love his work but his recent stuff shows he always needs that homie that can tell him no.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-24,"only you dislike the vision, take responsability for your own words, screw ign."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-09-20,really appreciate you putting this out!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-09-09,"i like how there is a common pattern where kojima isn't supposed to get something and the plot twist is but x is a fan of kojima and chose to greenlight his deal nevertheless kojima doesn't know a guy, he knows multiple"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-28,fine ill play death stranding again
Action,Death Stranding,2024-09-13,"i never liked the game, but i enjoyed certain parts."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-09-25,why the team disliked making a mailman game. seems obvious imo
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-10,"i just started playing, i knew the game existed long ago because seeing normans face caught my attention, was hinged on twd when it was popular but it all makes sense now. the story, the character, the bts, the long paragraphs of mail to read. i havent gotten far other than what the main plot of what youre supposed to do, but man this guys mind is amazing, this is art, ten fold. not just a game with a good idea, this for him is how i saw making music. its not as complex as making a whole game but trying to express that moment, what youre feeling, hearing seeing in his case and feeling the music. it was healing, especially when it came to being alone. it felt like i was communicating with someone who knew me better than anyone else."

Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-25,"kojima is almost 60 and the man looks like he's in his thirties, damn!"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-26,"when conan entered the room , kojima looked like he had a quest for conan"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-11-23,what is absolutely hilarious is that kojima not simply scanned conan just for fun but that he really put him in the game and in a perfect way  i laughed so hard when i first encountered him ingame xd
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,"damn, there really is no limit to costco's benefits."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,to that one person who wooed when conan said hideo kojima i feel you
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,2019 a hideo kojima office odyssey
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-23,conan saying what is wrong with you? to hideo kojima during the child birth cutscene will forever be hilarious
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,kojima is such a theatrical guy lol just reaching his office is like a scene out of 2001 space odyssey.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,i love the fact that almost every one of conans jokes is at his own expense. its very generous.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-31,hideo kojima getting more attention than the people that fired him
Action,Death Stranding,2021-07-04,kojima is a serious auteur who revolutionizes games and their technology but he's always been a great sport with a sense of humor even within his games. he's the best! kojima also knows english well but he's somewhat self conscious and almost always prefers to speak his native japanese because he wants to fully and accurately express and articulate his ideas.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-20,"conan says hideo kojima's name the one dude in the audience woo! ah, a man of culture i see"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-05,344 he's delivering a pizza kojima starts laughing because he knows
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-25,"kojima looks like hes having so much fun, hes a kid that never grew up. that is why conan and kojima work so well together."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-05-23,227 conan panicked for sec when he realised hideo understood him
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-11,"conan, your character in death stranding is really popular. it becomes a popular spot in the game."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,the fact that conan also has a costco card shows that hes a man of the people
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-27,studio how many celebrities do you want in death stranding? kojima yes
Action,Death Stranding,2020-09-09,the scariest part is that he is an actual character xd and i played the game without watching this so when reedus first met conan i was like wait a damn second....thats conan
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-26,i like how this bit wasn't for the studio audience whatsoever.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-10,"conan mentioned pizza, and there really is a quest in the game, where you have to deliver a pizza in under 30 minutes rofl...."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-18,it was really nice of kojima to not take his work so seriously and put conan in there
Action,Death Stranding,2020-12-09,"i always enjoy watching conan trying to hide when he's actually impressed under some kind of snark. it's funny, but you can also tell that he was just blown away by kojima and his team's work."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,"did gueillmo ask you to change his body ..,laughed for 3 minutes"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,omg that part with kojima glowing while conan opens the door had me laughing like crazy
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-13,"ok so the game is awesome and everything, but what really surprised me and made me respect hideo kojima even more is that he asked conan if he wants to be in the game and then he actually got to be in the game. i mean how awesome of a person can you be to make such casual decisions like that for a game you're been developing and making for soooo long. hats of for kojima. takes really heart to be so cool about that."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-06-23,535 i don't know how many times i've replayed that part. the reaction cracks me up everytime.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,"spoiler alert conan is the final boss of death stranding to defeat him, you have to figure out a way to get past conan's invincible comedic aura, which is actually blended with strands of his beautiful red hair. one touch of the aura would be... a death stranding."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-31,"when conan says he wants to be a hero, everyone else in the room is smiling because we all know what usually happens to npcs in hideo kojima games."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-19,kojima is enjoying his life he does the things that he loves so that's why he looks young
Action,Death Stranding,2024-04-21,"4 years later and people still don't realize this video wasn't made to promote death stranding, it was made to promote costco"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,"sony after geoff keighley, who else do you want to put in death stranding? kojima every. last. one of them."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-04,kojima is so cute. despite being a man in his 60's!
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,please do a clueless gamer with normal reedus
Action,Death Stranding,2020-09-22,"hideo is so relatable, i love how they introduced him with the aura of light, awesome"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-13,its funny because conan is a character in the game!
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,never in my wildest predictions would i ever have seen kojima and conan together. what a time to be alive!
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-12,i am so happy i didnt see this until after i finished the game. running into conan was the best surprise from the whole game!
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,323 conan was like this guy is more insane than me. if only conan knows that you can pee as norman reedus
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,conan is the only host who can pull off this interview with hideosan and not make it awkward.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,kojima is such a nice guy and seems really chill.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-08,"i had no idea he was in the game until i ran into the wandering mc. aside from main characters, he and the cosplayer are my favorite preppers so far. it was really cute reading him talking about how he met her and how impressed he was with cosplaying. as a cosplayer, it melted my heart and made me grin ear to ear. so wholesome!"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-11,"he's gonna deliver a pizza , and you know what ? it's gonna take more than 30 minutes damn he's been right all along"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-08,"greetings, wanderer. why have you come here? perhaps in pursuit of the legendary post you have found in a realm known as facebook? alas, your effort shall prove for naught, for what you seek have long eluded these hallowed plains. it is forever lost to the grains of time, for i have seen it spread amongst the general populace of the flawed social kingdom of facebook. the true meaning of this comment is forever lost, and you will never know why it has garnered ten thousand approvals from brave souls."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,conan has something that other talk show hosts don't have the ability to make real people laugh
Action,Death Stranding,2020-12-30,just caught conan in 'death stranding' in my first run through yesterday. such a cool cameo in an amazing game! i'm kinda glad i didn't see this! thanks conan for your humor when visiting japan!
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,first time saw kojima  what is wrong with you? after playing his game  what is wrong with me?
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,fun fact conan and kojima are the same age.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-11,conan what role you took in developing the game kojima yes
Action,Death Stranding,2021-12-24,"kojima is amazing. death stranding was really great, well everyone has their own taste in games but i loved it. amazing work, game where killing is an awful idea and the whole surreal feeling in it was just what i wanted without knowing about that i wanted it. i wonder what is kojima up these days?"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,conan o'brien a man denied his talkshow.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-25,"oh, my god. what's wrong with you?  conan the rest of us gamers have been wondering that for nearly 30 years, conan"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-13,conan what's wrong with you? we've all been wondering that for a long time.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-07-16,"say what you want about death stranding, but like kojima for being down to earth, humble and ambitious"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-28,"hideo.... are you there...? kojima appears kept you waiting, huh?"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-13,"conan 'he's a delivery man. he's delivering a pizza' laughter occurs well, actually..."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,what is wrong with you?!  conan to kojima 2019
Action,Death Stranding,2022-02-09,to this day i'm still playing this game. it's very therapeutic and visually peaceful
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-25,"im still heart broken over silent hills. edit wasn't expecting so many likes, still wish silent hills could've been a thing, but i'm glad kojima is doing his own thing now without konami."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,see this is why i like conan much more than evey other talk show host. hes a man with good taste
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,what is wrong with you? a question every single one of hideos fans has wanted to ask.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-06-22,hideo kojima feels very nice person to be with or around.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-09,"436 the reaction on conan is priceless, he looks so shock that kojima willing to put him in the game."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,im definitely buying this game if conans in it
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,seeing conans stomach was the most unnerving part.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-02-08,just finished it. it was absolutely mind blowing! this needs a script from nolan and production from speilberg
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,"my main objective in the game deliver all of the deliveries to conan,even if it costs other survivors their lives editthank you all for the likes,but if it's possible i'm still giving conan all of the packages d"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,"clueless gamer death stranding only with aaron, please."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,how he enters the office and meets kojima was pretty cool
Action,Death Stranding,2022-06-15,hideo kojima is the man who introduced me to the wonderful world of metal gear solid. its sad that other developers picked it up after 5 came out. metal gear solid is hands down the best game series ever. the first mgs is a masterpiece and still impressive to this day. to confirm the excitement of the lone man in the crowd whoo!
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-02,"they look like son showing his father his room with his toys, but they are actually the same age..."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-31,conan mentions hideo kojima that one guy woo!
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,conan meeting hideo hideo oh? youre approaching me?
Action,Death Stranding,2021-04-23,"hideo is a genius and an auteur. that man makes more than just games, he makes dreamscapes."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-25,of course kojima is wearing a joy division shirt
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-25,i always forget ultraman is not well known in america.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,came here after seeing him in death stranding trailer.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-09,there's no way this is where those pizza missions came from
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,this duo feels so strange...but theres something so likable about it.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,that entrance was straight out of a scifi movie
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,"conan the gaming ambassador we don't deserve, but need."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-17,i love how when he talks about video games the audience is just dead silent lol.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,"conan o'brien, the final boss of death stranding confirmed."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,props to conan for doing this. other late night hosts need to step their video gaming up.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,things like this is why the internet loves conan so much more than kimmel
Action,Death Stranding,2023-10-20,i love how the editing team and conan himself know how respected kojima is in the industry. i love you conan
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,this video was criminally short
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-23,i really hope conan knows how important this man is to the gaming industry
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-13,"yes, conans inflatable otter hatlife preserver really saves my life in the game!"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-09-11,"220 when kojima said he is a big fan of mads, he meant it. i was so happy to see the hannibal figurine in the killer suit, i love it so much. amazing!!!"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,424 i love how the audience laughter slowly built up after he said this.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,production who else are we scanning? kojima bring me everyone. production what do you mean everyone? kojima everrryyyyoneeee!!!!!
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,conan  this is not joke! audience  hahahaha conan  it's not joke!! audience  hahahahahahaha
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-11,"whenever i feel like curling up in a ball and dying, conan always saves me. thanks , conan."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,505 his hair is too tall that the cameras couldn't take all of it haha i cant
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,we need more conan gaming with aaron!
Action,Death Stranding,2019-10-24,not only is conan the funniest late night host but hes also the only legitimate nerd. love it.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-04,omg conan's legendary status just keeps growing and growing
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-10,conan whats wrong with you? hk smiles. that moment... conan was all of us gamers playing mgs1s battle on our ps1 for the first time when psycho mantis took control of the whole game breaking the 4th wall.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-01,"wow. for the past 23 minutes, i listened to a man speak my language yet had no idea what he was saying. fascinating."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-03-26,"imagine being a doctor just doing your job, try to save a baby from dying, and basically a nuke goes off. that is an excellent way to loose your reputation, lmao"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-03-08,this video was amazing. i have watched a couple of death stranding explain videos and this one was the first one where i could finally grasp the plot of the game.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-03-08,"a part of me likes to believe that cliff was able to cuss out bridget on the beach for messing his life, his kid's life, his wife's, and life in general."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-30,"side note the stranding is accidental amelie has seen sam many times on the beach before, but at various stages of his life but nonchronologically when she see's baby sam wash up, she already knows him and heals him without thinking. this baby sam is the cause of bt's in the world chronologically but she might be unaware that's the case"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-06,prank 'em john! aight you already know. falls down a 5 foot drop with a voidout bomb strapped to his back
Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-05,i think kojima should help direct a actual good scifi series with his writing. i think we all would love to see kojima's ideas on the big screen.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-03-25,"i walkrun along with this game in place, i'm not taking my ps4 anywhere, and i manage 10,000 steps a day. it also makes the game way more immersive. edit i got an exercise bike! now i bike while i play"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-05,"science fiction at it's best. pseudoscience, archeology, anthropology and a distopian future without the usual tropes. it was also uncanny how kojima predicted the covid pandemic since the game shares similarities. ironically, the many zen moments the game provides served as a calming experience during the hard lockdowns in the past few years. i also liked the asynchronous multiplayer aspect where together you aid in eachothers journey. in an era with a plethora of battle royales and recycled tropes, this game was breath of fresh air  on a high budget. though nor perfect, it has been one of the most profound games i've played in all my gaming years."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-12,"a theory as to why the ee feels a need to destroy is so evolution can proceed when life outgrows the planet, maybe the ee is there to ensure life can continue  like how a forest fire is essential to the forest's health. and if gaming harry's theory is fact, then this is the ee's first time as a creature's as complicate and emotional as human, allowing it to push back a natural occurrence because of sam's love. and maybe the ee evolves as life does, learning with each avatar and reset, and this is the extinction it evolved into consciousness like humanity had. even hartman said that humanity's consciousness has changeshifted with the face to face with the stranding. and now that dooms has been released into the world of matter, will it carry over to the next reset? is all of creation on a path when the matter and anti matter realms will be undisguisable? and if so, what purpose will the ee have if death has no meaning?"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-02-05,"amazing summary of the entire games story. the story is so complex it took me a while to wrap my head around it, but i didn't even make the connection ee was in a different dress, i just thought amelie couldn't decide what she wanted. was gripped the whole way through your video, nice work!"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-03-15,this is my depression game and honestly its been the best help ive had in years
Action,Death Stranding,2022-03-13,"this is one of the few games where i finished it and was awe struck, now i have a good idea of the story and the lore but hopefully this vid can round out all the stuff i might have missed."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-07,"thank you for this 'cliff notes' version of this game, the first 20 mins grabbed my attention...then i just couldn't stay iinterested past the 2 hr mark and it's nice to finally get it in a format i can understand"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-01,"i love this game, its fun to play when you just want to chill and travelexplore and look at the beautiful scenery. then if you get to feeling up to some action its never too far away. this video makes me want to play it now, but sadly im without a pc now"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-17,"death stranding is one of if not the only game that's still stuck in my head for a long time, the good consistent storytelling, world, character and the whole vibe makes it different from any other game. definitely loved to play this game all over again"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-02-15,death stranding is literally the only game that would instantly benefit from a film adaptation. the plot driving the story could be greatly improved on in a cinematic setting
Action,Death Stranding,2022-03-15,"honestly i think that the ee is basically a reversed bt. what happens when living cells flow back to the beach. the umbilical cord is key to ee's. bridgette had a chiral umbilical cord, the other ee's have a chiral umbilical cord. additionally, ka don't seem to notice the passage of time being different. ees do, if the sixth ee is to be believed. acting completly differently is also in character as bt's don't seem to recognize or act like normal people, even though both halves were. bt's act like ka that have the needs of ha, unspeaking and having no personality but having the insatiable drive to feed. an ee is a ha that acts like a ka. a beach entity, but having a personality and thought. it's drive to destroy is probably the ha's innate instinct to live, thereby wanting to leave the beach. it can most certainly do that but it will cause massive damage on a worldwide scale. why the sixth will destroy everything is strange though. as bts were witnessed by early cavemen. humanity wasn't wiped then. overall i'm excited for the sequel but they better release to pc. i'm tired of this wait for a year crap sony is pulling."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-29,"ive seen many videos explaining death stranding to some degree but this one was by far the best. excellent layout of the main points, very structured to and to the point with each topic without overexplaining easy to do with this story lol, and excellent descriptions of each character and their powersbackgroundsrelevance. this is one of my favorite games of all time, but i find it hard to explain effectively to people sometimes so i always recommend they watch an explanation video which usually push an hours time, ill be using this one going forward. 1010 video, love this game and cant wait for part 2"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-03-08,726 i know this a sad character. but i have to say that mads is one fine man.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-30,kojima really loves doing the soldier getting utterly fucked over by his government character. lol
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-09,"i had no idea what this game is about, but i played it as a road builder simulator. one day ill go back to actually complete it. this wondeful explanation should help me absorb more while playing"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-22,love playing games that makes me feel dumb for not comprehending the story in full! thankfully there are people who analyse the plot and make these explanation videos!
Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-01,"now that i think about it, the briefing at the beginning sounded pretty straight forward, and if there is one thing i learned when it comes to kojima is that nothing is ever straight forward."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-16,"i loved this. such a great analysis of the vastness that is this amazing story. question though, i always got the impression that timefall was just rainwater mixed with chiralium, did anybody else get that impression?"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-10-07,thank you for this video. so many other people weren't even close to explain what this game is about.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-28,i just finished the game last night and tbh i didnt fully understand the game. thanks for thoroughly explaining it and making it 100 to me!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-03-16,i played through this game 3 times already and havent come up with none of that. thanks for the breakdown. im playing through it at the moment and stumbled on this video. this next play through im gonna pay more attention. it all makes sense.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-06-20,"i loved this despite how slow it started but man the characters, the story...it's fucking amazing. i see why reedus wanted to be a part of this so badly."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-31,"i just finished the game, and i was so confused! i'm so glad i found this video to help me put the pieces together."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-21,"my take is that when bridget and amalie separated so did the ee, bridget was chose an the extinction entity and when her ha and ka separated they both ended up on the beach. but this, the 6th ee had what all others lacked, compassion, the ability to make a choice, and choose if humanity was worth destroying. with her ha and ka separated it locked out the ee from destroying earth any sooner, and with the network being rebuild the ee would be given an opportunity to cause the extinction event sam worked as a bridge to start it when he was repatriated hence why the bts showed up after he was saved by amelie. the ee saw this as an opportunity to bring on the extinction, but through sam and amelies connection she made the choice to lock out the beach, and no longer allow the bts to cross back over to earth and as well as the time fall. a closed beach means no more repatriation, which is what the bts are attempting to do. if bridgets ha and ka never got separated i very much doubt that the extinction could of been stopped if it remained in bridget."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-02,"death standing isn't a video game, it's an experience... a truly rare, amazing experience."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-03-26,awesome explanation! i finished the game yesterday and didn't understand the ending. nice to have a good wrapup!
Action,Death Stranding,2022-10-28,"the best story video i have found yet. very well done! thank you! also, the white, black and red dresses of the ee are the steps of alchemy and the purifying of ones ego to either follow the super ego or id in psychology. the dresses symbolize a transformation."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-03-08,awesome video as always. just wish you did this one sooner. my wife watched me play most of the game and had a lot of questions that i tried to answer but it's difficult since a lot of the lore is in the audio logs and emails that i never listened to or read lol
Action,Death Stranding,2022-03-10,"this is one of the most enjoyable games ive ever played. a true masterpiece. i still play every single day, delivering packages to get eliehuangs numbers of 59 million likes trying to reach 100 million, eliehuang?im only at 1.3 million as of this posting. keep on keeping on!"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-29,"so amelie was an anamoly whose soul and body existed in two different worlds giving her a connection to both worlds. amelie used that connection to create the first repatriate, sam bridges, which resulted in both worlds connecting with each other. as an extinction entity, amelie's goal was to fully merge both worlds through a massive voidout and cause a planetary wide exitnction event. therefore, that must mean that at some point a dinosaur with malicious intent used supernatural abilities to alter the course of a meteor and have it strike earth causing an extinction event."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-23,wow this was a very in depth but simple to understand video. very well done!
Action,Death Stranding,2023-02-06,death stranding is a game about death strandings. what's a death stranding? there have been multiple death strandings...also there is a lady named strand in it... holy shit that's stupid
Action,Death Stranding,2022-03-26,what i want to know is 'why' 'must' the ee destroy humanity? why is it the ee's decision to make to destroy humanity? what's the reasoning for ees to do what they do?
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-14,great vid and explanation.  i still have to be drunk to try to fathom why i'm running around carrying boxes and building roads and getting likes all while avoiding weird invisible things and acid rain.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-22,i love this game as well. i feel like death stranding is a love it or hate it kinda deal. i like the lore is very interesting but confusing at the same time. thanks for laying it all out! you earned a sub!
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-31,awesome videos
Action,Death Stranding,2022-06-08,"i spent 120 hours on this game for the platinum on ps4. then listened to a 7 hour analysis while obtaining the ps5 upgrade platinum. and i still didnt understand the story. however, your video finally made me understand."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-24,"i was late to this game, kept avoiding it for no reason i can explain. this video is brilliant, i loved the game but couldn't always be bothered to read the emails or interviews so this has helped explain loads, keep on keeping on!..... think i'll start it again"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-04,hey great video. i was wondering about the plot of ds. you seem to have summed it up into a short concise video. great work!  thank you!
Action,Death Stranding,2022-03-08,oooo nice. i've seen some death stranding videos and still get confused. maybe this is the one
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-12,this video made me appreciate the game even more. i love this game but ill admit i got lost during the story.beautiful summary!!
Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-27,what a great explanation. played the game 3 times and was still confused.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-02,"1 the ee was wearing a dark blue dress, making it red ameli, white bridget and blue ee. sam's suit has a similar shade of blue to her dress. the 3 lisa wagner characters are literally america 2 what i wonder is why did the death stranding begin with sam's ressurection when bts were perfectly capable of materializing into the world of the living just by a woman having a miscarriage or abortion. did the first bt only become possible once bridget was born?"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-15,"wow, i never questioned whether or not ameliebridget really was the extinction entity herself... or if she was just being used by a much more malevolent force. but now that you have pointed out the amelie in the black dress at the end, i have sooo many questions.  lol now it makes sense how amelie, or rather, the ee, could return in the sequel. my mind is blown, bro."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-06-02,"this is perfect for me. i never have and never will play horror games, i remember any horror stuff all too well. anyway, your videos give me a way to 'see' them in a way far less scary. thanks."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-03-09,finally! i was waiting for you to pick this game up! i really loved the game and its soundtracks!
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-21,"2011 is just perfect. he's thinking jesus christ, she's still talking?"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-07,this really helped. i thought i understood things but the little details that i didn't do add up lol
Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-20,"interesting how the chiralium a play on charon, ferryman for the river styx aka the beach i assume naturally forms grasping hand shapes."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-01,"sam doesn't shoot her  me, a chad, using up all the bullets to no effect"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-18,"i loved this game, steam restarted my save file and i was mad aboout it at the beggining, but after an hour of game time i took that as a blessing in disguise."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-02,"really enjoyed the game, but i think it is a marmite game. you either love it or hate it. nice video, makes me want to play it through again."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-06,dear god... there are treatises on quantum physics that are less complicated than this plot...
Action,Death Stranding,2022-03-15,i'm forever calling cliff dad and noone can stop me i love his character!
Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-01,"hey if you guys want more death stranding content i highly suggest whitlight's 7 hour long video, one of the best videos on youtube no joke"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-03,just the mention of pt brought back memories of a demo i wish had became reality. the boys and me playing it in a barracks room late at night
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-16,as crazy as this sounds i cant believe how straight forward the story is considering its a kojima game.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-08,the only prior knowledge to this game that i have is when i watched like a couple seconds of the trailer and yet somehow this is one of the most interesting videos ive ever watched
Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-10,i truly don't understand how anyone thinks this is better than mgs3 which is kojima's best game imo
Action,Death Stranding,2022-11-26,very good analysis ! thank you for the video
Action,Death Stranding,2022-09-22,annihilation physics  the combination of a particle and its antiparticle such as an electron and a positron that results in the subsequent total conversion of the particles into energy chiral  of or relating to a molecule that is not superimposable on its mirror image. meaning its reflection is not the same.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-03-10,i donno why this game wasn't more popular. the story. the history. the gameplay. i loved it. thought it was a fresh new take on basically a mailman lol.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-21,i feel like kojima really really fought with himself to not make cliffmadds the main character and story focus. but his drive to do something different made him choose to role with the samdelivery system.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-05,615 bt being antimatter touched anything explosion will happen technically everything is regular matter and bt touches floor and boom ... or even air molecules are still regular matter. makes no sense.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-07,"i was hoping that they could keep the mgs story and have it set to a future where nanomachines have gone amok and condensed into chyrillium, which screws with everything and creates a sort of digital clone of earth."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-03-28,hideos always on some next level stuff man
Action,Death Stranding,2023-03-13,"so sams survival is the cause of this extinction basically? i assumed that things had already been set in motion when the first voidout happened. also, interesting how they have a term for sams situation repatriate when apparently its a oneoff that was created by amelie. and somehow a lot of people sam meets know what a repatriate is, though that could be explained by them knowing the president and the story of her adopted son."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-06,game is very underrated. i never thought id enjoy courrier work. the lore is rich and interesting and it is an excellent videogame because it captures the feeling of accomplishment very well
Action,Death Stranding,2023-12-19,the extinction entity wears a blue dress. it's meant to coincide with the colors of the american flag.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-04,this is a lot to take in . but well served . thankyou good lad
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-05,great story for a game! great video too! really well done
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-09,"man i absolutely enjoyed death stranding, loved the story and the fear of running into bts and humans made it more fun, although i didn't like you had to take the dead body to a burning place if you used lethal weapons, it would cause problems in that area of course"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-03-08,keep up the good work man really enjoy listening to you
Action,Death Stranding,2023-09-28,thank you for this friend!
Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-01,i wish i would have saved the the comment that somebody made when the game first released. he very much knew some obscureish greek myth i believe it was greek that showed that almost the entire concept and story of death stranding was taken from it.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-03-11,bro i had this on as background audio and i only just realized at 1310 that this whole time you've been referring to bridget's ka and not bridget's car. because i began thinking to myself hey i don't remember bridget ever driving a car... oh wait the dude just has an accent
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-03,very easy to understand amazing work
Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-07,once you understand the storyline it feels very lovecraftian in nature.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-03-08,"3rd. haven't watched it in full as of commenting, but thanks for the video as always man."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-22,i heard you talk about ka and alot of ha but not one ma which all together makes one heck of a blast.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-08,"this game was just basically an explanation of a philosopher stone gaining sentience the 3 girls which has different color dresses is a 1 to 1 comparison to the 3 stages of philosopher stones. white means birth or the start of something new, red is the process of maturity and preparation of the end and lastly black which is the end of the previous processes then from the ashes of black comes white and so on the cycle continues."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-25,"imaging playing a game for 40hours, loving it and only understand the story after watching a youtube video.  thanks for this video"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-02,i think you or the devs might be wrong about the big five! the first extinction event in rl happened way way before the dinosaurs after the cambrian explosion and then a few more followed before the dinosaurs
Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-02,"fantastic video, keep em coming d"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-03-08,"okay now were a tackling a game i actually know a bit about, cant wait to go down this rabbit hole letsgetitcracking"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-03-10,keep on keeping on
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-22,"all these games and movies have one thing in common. though not an entire story, but a segment, informs us of the future, of which is planned out in the shadows i stopped at a red light this morning, and saw a pom tree cellphone tower. and it reminded me of the original cartoon, sonic and friends, not the cheep remake that replaced it. in saf. the trees are machines made by dr robotic. the santa clause, the scene the elf reads him the clause. so many examples i can state"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-30,this is the best explanation of this game.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-03-04,i dreamed of that beach scene with the dead whales when i was a little kid! the peak in the background and everything. it was night and lighting everywhere though.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-05-16,sir your content is phenomenal.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-08,this is the first death stranding video where things make sense.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-03-09,i've purchased so much death stranding merch and didnt fully understand the story till now lol  good work sir!
Action,Death Stranding,2022-05-28,even though its amazon delivery man of the future simulator it was a totally awesome experience. very peaceful almost like minecraft while youre delivering packages and taking in the scenery
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-23,"play war thunder now with my links, and get a massive, free bonus pack including vehicles, boosters and more on pc and consoles httpsplaywt.linkwritingongames  mobile httpswtm.gamewritingongames thanks for watching! feels good to really love this game now. hope you enjoyed the video."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-23,"i lost my dad last year, when my baby was 7 months old, so it was a rough time. my husband suggested i played death stranding because it might help a bit. i really struggled with it to start with, but it genuinely helped! i didn't feel as alone and isolated. i can't put into words exactly how it helped in the immediate aftermath of my dad's passing, but it did. it was also good to be able to walk around when i couldn't didn't want to go outside."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-24,"i felt like a crazy person playing this at launch. felt like all of the interwebs hated this game, meanwhile, i was in a trance and loved it."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-23,"by the way, timefall only degrades the protective container of the cargo, not the internal item. you would be fine as long as you don't fall and damage the cargo. the recipient doesn't care about container condition, only internal items!"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-24,"unknown used a road you rebuilt unknown used a road you rebuilt unknown used a road you rebuilt unknown used a road you rebuilt 21,342 likes"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-23,death stranding is a game that ive seen and heard more people talk about coming back to and replaying even after all this time. it was kinda unfairly lampooned upon release. its like a movie that got panned upon release only to be called a classic years later.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-23,im always glad to see death stranding resonating more and more with people over the years. i was a bit late to the party myself. i find that its often the most confusing and challenging pieces of art that end up staying with you the longest.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-24,"kojima himself said, it will take years for the players to understand the game. and he was certainly right about one thing, now, more and more people realize what a great experience this game was. like all of his work"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-24,"i'm not going to lie... this is a fate i deserved. upon it''s launch, i overshared my ire for it's basic concept. it's the antithesis to what i had come to know as gaming after all, i had a decent enough excuse. but in the years since, i've become much more of a casual gamer. i lack the time and patience to get good at things, so i play things that i'm familiar with or are simply easy... but this game simply flipped the script in ways i could never have predicted. a lot of the time, the journey is the adventure in the most organic way. before you connect to the chiral network, there's no pois, no paths, no blueprint... and when the story beats kick in with the soundtrack? it's almost haunting, but in a comforting way. and then the world springs to life after linking your cupid! it's strange to say i've made friends here? strangers who'd started the game the same time as me, who i ended up making bridge contracts with. now every time i see their structures in my world, it's a friendly reminder to keep on keeping on. every meticulously placed vehicle, generator, timefall shelter... zipline routes that present themselves as i invest my time in the chiral network. from the dropped cargo to paths tread, and even signs... this is the most positive social experience gaming has given me in a long while, and it's without even meeting your peers face to face. i joked about kojima calling this game the first of it's kind when it dropped, but the joke was on me. i don't even know if death stranding 2 will provide us a similar experience lol. never has a game focused more on being a rope, the stick always proves more popular. this was and is something special, and i'm so glad i was hilariously wrong about it! just got bb back... in going back to reguild the roads for the homies lol"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-23,on my second playthrough i realized that vehicles are noisy and reduce the experience to just holding down the accelerator. so i decided to only use them when absolutely necessary. travelling on foot and with floating carriers is a much more fulfilling experience. turning a delivery in after an onfoot trek just hits harder.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-24,thank you for being open enough to make this video. i love when this game finally clicks with people. this game was most fun after completing the story and having ultimate freedom and fun tools zip lines to work with. i loved death stranding when it first came out and i loved playing it again on ps5.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-24,"can't believe you posted this just now! i played at launch and loved it, but phoned in the latter half with similar feelings of exhaustion. i even tried to jump back in with the dc two years back and just wasn't feeling it at all. something clicked in my brain this month though, and i'm now having the same experience you describe. at its best, there's an almost meditative quality to playing. kojima saw everything toxic and wrong with social media and built this an antidote. happy to be back in this world 5 years later."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-23,"i never understood the claims that death stranding is a walking simulator. meeting death stranding at its own pace and being good at the game coexist with each other that by the end of the third chapter, if you're still conventionally walking you aren't engaging with the game's many methodical means of expression. ropes, ziplines, skateboards that are also storage, power leg suits that let you leap comically high and sprint leg suits that let you break your own personal delivery records. so many of the skill expression is tied to leaving any preexisting ideas of death stranding and expressing yourself through new methods. growth mindeset the rope and fixed mindset the stick is how i would best describe the gameplay. death stranding doesn't make me want to walk it makes me want to keep on keeping on by any means available, both in the abstract and the mundane."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-23,"my friend and i were huge kojima fans, and we all started death stranding on day 1. i got bored of it after 3 days, took a short break of a month then came back to finish it, had amazing experience. my friend grinded his teeth and speedrun till the end, he hated it so much.... cuz he wanted to see the story so bad, he ended up walking his way back... while i took my sweet a time to build the roads and got to drive all the way home"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-23,love your videos dude. death stranding is a game i think about every single day. theres some definitely strange stuff in there but it's locked it's place in my heart and mind.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-24,"loved playing this fascinating game during 2020 xmas lockdown. took it slow, about 300hrs, felt like i was adventuring, creating and helping when in real life it felt hopeless. the world sucked me in like no other and i would love to do it all over again"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-23,it's only now i realize you can get a motorcycle in death stranding. that's all i need i'm sold!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-26,"it makes me so happy that this game finally clicked for you. also good on you for giving a game that you previously bounced off of another trial. that can be legitimately hard to do in today's very crowded gaming landscape. it may have taken you a longer time, but you made it in the end, and that's what counts that sounds like some corny dialogue in the game doesn't it lol. something you said in the first half of the vid and elaborated a bit on later, i think is what really made this game find a place in my heart i feltfullon gratitude towards a reallife player i would never know. as much as gaming has the potential to isolate you and let you escape human interaction, there is also meaningful human connection to be made. and for some reason the relative anonymity of it in death stranding makes it feel even better. it restored just a little bit of my faith in humanity at a time when that was rapidly disappearing. you can't overstate the importance of that. and i think it's exactly what the game set out to do, which is an incredible achievement. i'm glad you mentioned journey, because that is the only other game i could think of that gave me this distinct feeling. i too feel overdramatic speaking in terms like this on a video game but, well, i feel what i feel. after my initial exhaustive playthrough at the game's original release, i returned to the game with the director's cut on ps5 and it's still one of the best uses of ps5 features years later lol, checked out the new features, cleaned up the new trophies, and marveled at fully builtout new highways and paths from other players in my absence. but what struck me most immediately was the flood of likes that came pouring in from hundreds of people who had used my structures. it feels silly to feel something approaching pride for that, but i have so little in the way of that type of feeling these days, that it ended up being pretty meaningful. as a result, i keep the game installed, and check in on it every once in a while, making sure my ziplines, etc, are still in usable shape, and hopefully they will pass that wonderful feeling onto others."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-24,"oner of the most satisfying experience i've had in a game were managing to setup a network of zipline from mountain node city to the lake one, while having a chunk in the middle of the mountains not connected to the chiral network. this implied managing to put those ziplines in the exact pixel it would actually work on, on some very steep mountain ridges, while managing to find the exact spot within the maximum distance that would somehow manage to be in reach of each other over the unconnected territory there's like a 200300 meter section at one point that you can go over. took me a good two hours of mountaineering all over the place, trying not to lose my material to setup this whole thing up, but man was it satisfying to finally be able to bridge that gap and make every single mountain delivery a breeze for the next few hours until i could connect that little section. whenever i think of death stranding, my mind instantly goes to sam perched on top of a thin snowy ridge, trying to line up that damn zipline perfectly. it's like a core memory of the game for me and as i'm watching the video, annother memory popped up. one of the first deliveries on the first map, tripping while crossing the river and watching my whole cargo slowly drift away from my as i frantically run to try and catchup to it, but nothing to grab it anyway, until i stumbled accross another player's abandonned ladder washedup on the shore, which allowed me to put a precarious bridge on the river to grab my floating stuff. and i'm sure i can recall a bunch of moments like that if i try. been willing to revisit the game for a while as ds 2 approches. maybe i will now."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-23,ive been homeless for the past year and a half and the main thing i want to get an apartment for is the ability to play death stranding 2
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-26,this essay feels very full circle for me. i started watching your videos bc of your first death stranding one.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-24,death stranding is the best 200 hour video game i will never replay.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-24,"youd probably enjoy snowrunner as well, where every trip is its own narrative as you try to overcome its challenges. very chill and your story about using a truck to get stuff off a truck you got stuck is exactly the kind of scenarios you end up in! its great fun, definitely recommend."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-24,"i'm pretty sure that death stranding represents an increasingly emergent subgenre of game that i'm not sure how to categorise, but is effectively the equivalent of literary fiction. it's experimenting with a bunch of ideas in more 'meditative' ways than a typical thriller scifispeculative fiction story would do if it just wanted to pull a bythenumbers hero's journey. it is, from an experiential perspective, more challenging and difficult to both literally and figuratively navigate. and like literary fiction, it's hard to pull off, the audience is typically somewhat smaller, and generally older with a different set of experiences and perspectives on life than the audience that the more standard form of media is aiming at. and i wonder if that is part of why a lot of people are coming back to it and finding it more enjoyable this time."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-25,"its something about the way he tells stories they grow inside you, grow with you. then one day you reencounter some notion that opens the floodgates, and though id like to say it all makes sense, the truth is it does all make a sort of emotional sense. none of this is by coincidence mind you."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-25,i'll never get tired of hearing how death stranding won them over.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-26,"i bought the collectors edition of that game. took the entire weekend off work, beat it in that weekend by having an all nighter and absolutely loved it. it may not have been like i thought it would be from when the first trailers came out but it is one of my favorite experiences to this day."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-17,i played back in 2019 on ps4 and it was such an experience. it's as much of a game as it is a piece of art. i didn't realize the cult following it's received in recent years. i just picked it up on pc  i'm so excited to experience this again.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-24,great vid. so pumped for the sequel
Action,Death Stranding,2025-02-03,"its weird, i hated it at first and now its my favorite game of all time the story helped me cope with similar losses that sam went through, mainly losing my child and my father. ill see them on the beach"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-25,"crazy how i found this video when this game finally clicked for me on my third restart. ive now been playing it nonstop for a couple of weeks, when i only played it maybe a handful of times on release"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-23,"i finally bought death stranding after so many years ignoring it because people called it a walking simulator, they couldn't be more wrong, who ever called it a walking simulator clearly haven't played pass chapter 1. this game is now one of my all time favorite, i can not believe kojima make walking fun."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-03,i feel exactly the same. just started chapter 4 and i can tell is one of my favourite games of all time already.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-30,"very insightful commentary and very engaging script here! fantastic video, as always!"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-24,"death stranding is so wonderful, and i'm so happy that people have started to appreciate it."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-24,"in terms of giving something time, this is the same way i felt about elden ring. when i first started it, i wanted to beat the game, like any other. i didn't start truly enjoying elden ring until i stopped trying to beat it, and just tried to experience it."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-24,this is so cool! what a brilliant come back.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-31,thank you for your dedication and hard work to the game. it has inspired many. keep it up!
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-14,"hello, also a i got death stranding for ps4 in 2019, it didn't gel with me and i didn't play it much, and then after some time of mulling over things, games, etc, and started it up from scratch in 2024 on steam for me death stranding player. the 2024 ds2 trailer early on, got me thinking about death stranding again, and then i took the plunge to try it again. i played it on my steam deck, so i could get time in all sorts of times in bed, laying on a couch. also helped that a friend also started playing it at the same time, so i had the benefit of having someone to discuss death stranding things i got big into deliveries. once i got the bridges truck, i got into doing large multistage deliveries of bulk premium deliveries. cargo was my obsession. i think i turned into a mule."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-24,"really interesting to see how your views on this changed, especially having rewatched your mgsv video recently where you came away with the opposite opinion after letting the dust settle. dude, death stranding just rocks"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-24,"i have a different sort of relationship with death stranding than i have with probably any other game. ive been playing it since launch and still havent beaten it, but im just really, really taking my time with it. ill play it for a few days, work on rebuilding some roads, construct gigantic zipline networks all over the map, get every node to 5 stars. and then ill put it down for a few months, and then pick it back up and do the same some more. most games i play for the story or for the characters, and gameplay is secondary. but i almost dont care about the story in death stranding. i pay attention to each cutscene and i enjoy them, but i also dont focus on them and partially as a result of playing the same save file over 5 years, i actually dont even remember most of the story. i love this game for the hiking, for the building, for the deliveries, and for the experience of setting out on another journey. thats my favorite thing about it accepting a delivery, and then planning my trip. what do i bring with me? what do i leave behind? what route should i take? and then making that trek and experiencing the land itself. i know death stranding 2 is coming, but ive not watched any trailers or anything. ive no idea what its going to be like, but i just hope it has more of what i love about the first game, and more ways to experience the journey. i think im near the end of the first game finally i cant believe its been 5 years!, and im looking forward to the sequel. before i play death stranding 2 though, im considering going back after ive finished this one to replay it from the beginning with the directors cut this time. im still playing this first time through vanilla."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-24,you  i have had the exact same thoughts about this game at the same exact times. i just came back to it a few weeks again and love it now.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-23,"not even started watching yet, but i'm so excited to hear your thoughts on this incredible game. it's truly one that hits everyone at different times. everyone tries it and the game plants a seed. then one day, they come back when they need it most and it changes lives."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-26,glad you came to your senses
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-25,i always felt that ds was a game that needed to be enjoyed gradually versus crunching the main story for the sake of a review. early reviewers in particular quickly devoured the game like it were uncharted or the latest nintendo title
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-03,so funny seeing peoples mind change about this game. bought it on release date and still one of my favs
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-25,excellent video! gave a like for its quality and for the use of the word cavalcade
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-24,after i stopped listening to internet grifters i realized i missed out on a great experience when it came to xbox. probably the best most unique game ive ever played.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-24,"mudsnowrunner at the end of the world  i honestly this it pay it forward as a game. i build roads not for my own delivery but for everyone else, not a lot of game is really about community  a game for introvert connection very japanese in a sense but uniquely humane game that shows we are all connected  a beautiful future for us is also beautiful for others"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-24,"this game is basically postapocalyptic euro truck simulator but on foot and with ghosts, i feel like setting the expectations on this instead of an epic action adventure game would lead people to enjoy their time on the game more."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-24,"this is what captured me about death stranding as well on my first playthrough. i procrastinated on the story so much because i just wanted to do the actual gameplay, only progressing it so i could unlock more people to deliver to lol"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-07,"i set off on a stroll from the windfarm and of course i was overloaded but i didn't notice my exoskeleton was almost destroyed, so i made it almost back up to the top of the mountain, when my exoskeleton broke and and my stamina was zero and bt's were nearby so i couldn't even rest, but i slowly slogged my way back to the windfarm and loved every moment of it."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-24,"i had a weird experience with ds. my playthrough took me about a year. i'd play it for a week or so, get really into it, and then drop it for a month or two. rinse and repeat until i finally rolled credits i've never done that with a game before. the gameplay loop is not something i can stay engaged with for long, but the story kept pulling me bsck in. it's an incredible experience."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-25,"this video is spot on! this game is totally unique and unlike any other game ive played, and my feelings for it are exactly the same. theres just something about it that gets you addicted. i dont usually fuss much over the cutscenes and story on my, what is now 3rd play through, but building all the zip lines and roads amongst other players structures is just so addictive. as someone who hikes a lot up mountains, the way i picture a route up is exactly how i would do it in real lifetheres a gap in the rocks there that and the graphics are fantastic and theres just something so satisfying when you reach a new distribution centre or prepper that was hard to get to. i think this game is so controversial because theres been nothing like it before and it scared the hell out of people lol. youll either love it or hate it. p.s. i can only play it at christmas as thats the only time of the year i have time. and thats great because the bridges staff wear santa hats this time of year in the game genius"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-24,in the sea of content. your videos stand out as art.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-26,i am just on my knees and begging that kojima hires a writer to handle dialog. the world building and plot was so much better than the moment to moment dialog
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-25,this game is goat status!! people just have to give it time it starts slow
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-12,"bought it ages ago on sale. decided to play it a couple of months ago on my steam deck. 80 hours later i had to put it down to try and get through the rest of my backlog, but i keep wanting to go back to it!"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-31,ds might be hands down the most unique gaming experience i've ever come into contact with and i'm grateful for that. so glad you released this video now. i might pick the game up for steam deck and get another run out of it!
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-13,"death stranding is a unique game, mostly open world games are followed one rule, the character starts at a ,then go to b to finish their mission, before the mission they give u different ways to go to b, different vehicles, whatever how you want to get b, the b is your target, but death strandings gameplay is the process from a to b. actually mostly game designer spend a lot time to figure out how to make bs mission more fun, only this guy find a the other way how to make people feel that the process of getting from a to b is interesting, of course its not for everyone, some people think its so boring, but my point is no matter which industry it is, pioneers willing to take the risk are essential, even if it may not be suitable for everyone. thats why i think this industry needs some people like kojima, but we dont need everyone to be kojima ."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-08,"honestly death stranding was such a great experiece for me cuz i knew it was about the journey and not the destination, there is no reason to rush and get to the objective as quickly as possible since after the delivery i knew there would be another one and another one and another one, sometimes i would even walk as slowly as possible and this made me feel much more connected with sam, i dont feel like he would be running all the time, hes human after all. ifbig if i was in his place walking through this beautiful desolated world i would sometimes go real slow and take time to notice the details of the place im in, and so i did. a lot of games today have the mentality that you need to get from point a to point b quick cuz the fun happens when you reach it, getting rid of this mentality while playing it was hard, but once i did, damn this game was good"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-20,"took me three years to turn around. at first i hated it. and very vocally too. then i got to port knot eventually and was like ok, more to this than carrying boxes. the mountain traversal added to my love for it. by the end, walking to the incinerator i was crying my bloody eyes out."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-24,i imidiedly feell in love with the game the same way you did
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-29,i've got to play this game. even the bleak beauty of it's environment looks completely original. i can see myself getting lost in it like a tarkovsky film
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-31,one must imagine sam porter bridges happy.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-12,i've played the game twice. loved it both times but even more so second time through doing exactly what you described. i loved finishing the giant highway for example.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-24,i love death stranding
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-24,"this game, the phantom pain, dishonored, pray and deus ex, belong to a rare type of game in which the player is at least as important as the creator, in which the vision of the designers doesn't surpass the reaction of the gamers to it. you couldn't have played this game more differently than i watching you playing with the whole hud on and running all over the place got into my nerve, for one thing, but that has nothing to do with playing it right or wrong. that is, actually, the whole point of the game."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-26,death stranding is my favorite game of all time. seeing people finally come around to it like this just makes me feel even more validated in that feeling. the sequel can't come soon enough.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-01,i like to imagine that there is a player of this game who psyches him or herself up like im the porter who delivers.pain! and proceeds to build the most wildest paths that only extreme porters would dare waste an effort to traverse. stealthcombat porter who carves a path and breaks those conventional safety regulations. bts are merely breakfast. going postal on the old postapocalyptic!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-24,i loved this game for the boring bits and didnt really like the exciting bits.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-02-08,hell yea i love this game still replay it every few months
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-24,"that spray story is exactly why i loved this devicive game. it's pacing is boring to some but every time some travel element was frustrating me, the game gave me an uograde. that tension and delight made it eeem deliberately paced to perfection"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-23,deadstrinding was the best that happened to me during the lockdown.s
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-24,"i really hate to be that guy, but the condition of the goods you're delivering is not dependent on the condition of the containers they're in. container repair spray only fixes those containers and not the goods inside, meaning that if you went through all that effort to fix the containers before delivering them, you just wasted a whole lot of effort for nothing because the goods inside them were just fine already. goods don't get damaged by timefall itself unless their containers are completely destroyed or the container is thrown around, dropped, or otherwise handled in a way that will shake their contents around which is more likely the weaker the integrity of the container is."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-17,"i might not be right but i think the state of the container doesn't effect the rating, only the item inside."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-25,it's a unique game and hooks you to the world and systems... got the platinum on the directors cut and looking forward to replaying it before ds2
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-24,have you ever done a video about red dead redemption 2? seems like it would fit this channel perfectly. it is maybe the most well written game ever made.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-24,"to address one of your lingering criticisms, and this could very well be cope that i've decided a clearly bad aspect of a game i like is good actually, i really don't think the game would be as solid a product overall if the combat felt better. similarly to something like alan wake 1 and 2 i think the clunkiness in its design goes a long way to both communicate that sam is not a soldier, and to dissuade the player from wanting to engage in violence it's annoying, it's time consuming, and even if you win it takes up a bunch of resources that you're not guaranteed to get back from their cache. granted, this is undercut somewhat by way the forced combat sections of the narrative are structured, but it overall really works for me. making the combat more fun or engaging in the sequel would make for a better game experience and a less interesting game, i feel the same about the jump between nier replicant and nier automata where even though automata is by basically all measures a better crafted experience i keep coming back to replicant and i really don't with automata because replicant's frustrating design works to supplement its narrative in a much more interesting way than anything automata does with its gameplay, and i don't really want to see the same happen to death stranding"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-28,"princess beach ha! i gave this game a try and also got sucked into it a couple years back, in spite of kojima having seen that meme about i know writers who use subtext and they're all cowards and taken it as a core principle. it's completely insane, yet still somehow manages to be an experience with sufficient magnetism to overcome all the cringe"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-24,"mario and princess beach is a good joke man, you should rethink your opinion on that joke"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-25,"i love that death stranding is a thing. i love that a high profile name like kojima made not just a hiking game, but also a hiking game that is so controversial that it sticks with people. i love that terrain navigation is a concept in people's minds now and that strand type games  even if nebulous and rare  is a genre now. i just regret that i don't enjoy death stranding a lot. maybe i'm misunderstanding it. but to me, it's a hiking game. in a genuine and affectionate way. i want games that are about hiking, about being in nature, experiencing it as more than a scenery, instead as a playground, as obstacles, as challenges, as not just the space between endpoints, but the goal itself. but ds kinda puts too much weight on the obstacle thing, making it a mere level, making it hostile and unappealing, making the techsolution to avoid nature more appealing than engaging with it. so to me, death stranding is a prototype, one that opens potential, but its direction is not my thing. instead i quite like ghost recon wildlands. play solo, style your character somewhat civilian like, and just hike slowly through nature. i role play taking the easy path instead of the rocky one, because obviously these meachanics aren't in there. but you get so much majestic and magic nature by just playing this game slowly. and after 12 hours of wandering though a valley, up a hill and along some train tracks, you get to do some fun sneakyshooty stuff at your own leisure. now that's my style."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-23,"if you're the type who doesn't at all feel the need to constantly be running in games, if you like taking your time walking around at a normal pace and taking in the scenery, there's few games that can rival death stranding."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-25,glad you gave it another chance. ds is one of my favorite open world games of all time. i really hope ds2 improves alot of the narrative awkwardness from the first.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-19,"i really like those game and love the soundtrack, but i don't believe anyone would give it a time of day if this wasn't a kojima game. most people would play 2 or 3 h and forget about it. can't wait for the sequel"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-13,"still a delivery game on a wasteland of a map, by a guy that wants to make movies and not games."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-07,container damage doesn't affect rating. damage does. if it gets to 100 container damage in time fall it will start accumulating regular damage. example 1. o damage 50 container damage is the same as 0 damage 0 container damage. your graded only on reg damage
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-23,great watch
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-09,i tried it when it came out and spent a few hours with it but i didnt connect with it and i havent looked back. i see people speak so highly of it and i think of how i didnt really give it the time necessary to form a valid opinion on it. that said i think its fair to critique that a game requires so many hours invested in order to connect to.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-23,i'll never forget the american's reaction to kojima calling them out on not understanding the game
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-23,"1143 i fucking swear it wouldn't let me take the zip line with a cart attached, wtf? update?"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-24,i hope one of these days i have the same realization everyone else has had about death's stranding. i feel like i'm missing something that is keeping me from clicking with it.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-04,love the video
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-03,death stranding shouldd be a case study on people that claim x game is not respecting my time. mabey the issue is you not the game.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-25,you should become a post man or amazon driver
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-24,it was a strange one for me as i loved the story but really wasn't a fan of the gameplay. i do the majority of sidequests in most games but here i mostly mainlined it since all i really cared about was the story moving forward.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-23,i love this game i've bought it 4 different times so far haha.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-23,it didnt seem like anyone really used the infrastructure i developed other than the roads. so the game failed to give me the feeling of interconnected gameplay and feeling wanted
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-27,ive never put a game down so often swearing im done only to come back the next day. 56 times. i would still say its just an ok game but i had a fun time with it.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-02-01,i genuinely believe the best thing about death stranding is the gameplay. i believe it has an interesting story great themes but its not an amazing story its a very ambitious one which i respect and in my opinion a very entertaining one but its no masterpiece. i believe the core gameplay of death stranding and the progress u make on your porter sam to help min max the hard journeys over the terrain is the amazing part of the game.

Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-26,i hate how some silent playthroughs have players who play like they have never touched a videogame before. i am very relieved that you dont have this problem. it makes watching more bearable.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-26,watching any game walkthroughs without commentary at night is the best way to fall asleep. just so peaceful and calming
Action,Death Stranding,2020-02-26,the gaming community loves games that delivers and are well balanced hideo deliver and balance... hmmm. guys i have a new idea that will change gaming again

Action,Death Stranding,2020-09-28,"thanks so much for leaving the music in, letting dialogue play out, and playing the game exactly as it was intended. this was an amazing experience i couldn't have gotten from any other playthroughs."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-03-08,after watching the whole walkthrough i came to the conclusion kojima woke up one night all sweaty and decided he had to do everything in his power to make norman reedus life as uncomfortable as possible.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-04-12,the game is pure art. i'm so thankful for games like this. it isn't just a game for me
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-03,"i have no idea why, but i'm infatuated with this game's play loop, something about stacking cargo and delivering it on time and undamaged is oddly satisfying."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-10-09,"anyone just like to leave this playing in the background while they do other things? i find it so oddly calming. the sound design is one of my favourite things about the whole game. i love the alert sounds when sam gets messagesnotifications, i love the clicking noises when you're going down a list or selecting something, i love all of it. i'm a big star trek fan, and it reminded me a lot of the noisessounds used in that world too."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-27,it's literally a walkthrough
Action,Death Stranding,2021-04-30,my god.. i've been searching a walkthrough that played with feeling.. walking slow when it's time to take it slow.. and run fast when in haste.. and you're the only one who did that.. thanx bro
Action,Death Stranding,2020-10-21,this was meant to be a thing to play in the background only. it turned into a three day binge that took me through some feels that i was not prepared for. took me until the final battle with cliff to realize the truth and did not realize the villain until it was revealed. man 1010.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-06-18,thanks for taking a hit and giving us the music too. i really appreciate it.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-03-03,"props to people who actually do these longplay videos, and especially from reading the comments i see that you made sure to read everything and make sure nothing goes unnoticed. i still haven't finished this game since launch because i keep playing on and off."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-05-13,simply beautiful! finally found it full gameplay with music and no commentary. thank you!
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-15,i am watching your gameplays back to back. first the last of us. then horizon zero dawn and now this... each one is a masterpeice... brilliant... and the way you play them you are an expert.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-05-04,"just finished and holy crap. the walking is pretty boring. but that story was insane. cliff was high key the best character. he traversed death, in the midst of an extinction event, seemingly took control of the entire military beech, all in order to find his son. gosh darn. also you are a grade a gamer, you never lost once. i applaud you good samaritan."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-06-17,how am i already feeling nostalgic for this game?? i just played it less than 6 months ago.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-23,love kojima. since the playstation 1 hes been making compelling stories about current or future world affairs shrouded by magic and scifi.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-06-24,"me in 2019 wow this sure is spooky, good thing it won't happen! me in 2020"

Action,Death Stranding,2021-03-02,i was thinking of buying this game but i was not certain. it was by chance that i came across your masterpiece walkthrough. i no longer have the desire to buy this game. watching you play was satisfying enough for me. i cant even begin to describe how amazing this journey is that we decided to walk with you. the actors are amazing but this was like an interactive film. thank you for making this practically flawless walkthrough. you deserve so much more subscribers than you have. subscribed.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-11-16,the one and only problem with this is that you didn't activated the subtitles

Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-02,this guy really made a game based on swiss mountaineers and threw in some norse mythology and his own contemplations on death to spice it up.....and it worked. this isnt a game. this is a conversation....this is art. he legit set up a world for you to explore these themes on your own terms. this guy literally made a digital art gallery and shipped it around the world and sold tickets for 80s.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-02-22,the soundtrack of this game is a masterpiece

Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-04,thanks for making one whole long video instead of chopping it up much appreciated.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-06-25,"i wish there were subtitles but otherwise a really good video. i can't add subtitles myself, sadly. i tried but everything lagged out so bad i just gave up."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-06-05,she literally recorded for a day and 2 hours26 hours respect
Action,Death Stranding,2020-09-05,"deadman feels like an alternate reality eggman, what with his wearing red, being overweight, and a somewhat creepy doctor with a subtle accident and all."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-06-11,"ive been watching this for a few days now and ive noticed your sub count is increasing really fast. congrats, you deserve it"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-14,great job sourcespy! love your videos and appreciate ya leaving the music in! cant wait to get this game and experience it myself
Action,Death Stranding,2020-04-20,norman reetus and his fetus
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-15,"am i the only one who is oh, so thankful that there is a fast forward function"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-12-21,you have my respect sir for this video especially not cut the music. thank you.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-05-28,heartman lying on the bed during the speech is a mood lol
Action,Death Stranding,2022-05-03,tears to my eyes. a true visionary hideo kojima. never stop making games 3
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-12,"me and my partner loved this game, for all the reasons some people said they didn't! we didn't mind the lack of standard combat, or the relatively slow pace. the delivering aspect is intriguing and involves some strategy, traversing the difficult landscape is a challenge, dealing with the monsters requires thought, care, and different methods, and building roads is more enjoyable and compelling than we'd imagined. the whole thing has an impressive mood of uncertainty throughout, is very thoughtprovoking, and has interesting concepts. the voice acting is top notch. we're hoping the sequel is as good, in the same universe, but maybe good in a slightly different way."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-17,11107  sam mom's dies  sam today is a good day
Action,Death Stranding,2025-02-02,"more than halfway thru the game and i wasn't really enjoying it enough to justify the effort, but i was still interested enough in the bizarre story to want to see how it all ended. this is perfect, thank you so much!"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-05-01,omg this game is so amazing the story so wholesome . i just spend that 30h watching this holy shit
Action,Death Stranding,2021-07-02,it was this video that taught me that youtube tells you how many days a video can be.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-06-08,"the death right at the 23 hour mark fucking killed me laughing. other than the scripted required deaths you managed to make it through the entire game with none, only even fell over like once through the whole game, and then sam just decides to flip out and eat shit right down the side of a snowy mountain."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-31,"this game is pretty amazing. there's a lot of details and i even like how interesting everything is. i also like that despite the game being single player other players can still help you out and you can do the same to them. like using another player's structures, delivering another player's lost cargo, and even using they're garaged vehicles when needed. makes you feel connected even when your alone."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-02-12,thanks for the walktrough! at first i abandoned this game years ago but i bought the director's cut and give it a 2nd chance and oh boy was it worth it! it's easily in my top 20 all time games and one of the most interesting stories in all games. i still don't understand some of the things but that's the beauty of it. hope to see you with the walktrough for death stranding 2. keep on keeping on!
Action,Death Stranding,2020-06-29,i cant believe that this video is a day long
Action,Death Stranding,2020-11-26,"145900 i like to think he just left her in the backpack overnight, just leaning against the wall waiting with the other cargo."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-12-09,thanks mate. with all the youtube showponies we do appreciate a non comentary experience.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-05-04,"anyone else find it annoying that every 15 seconds his telecommunications beep really loudly and it always starts off with, sam"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-07-21,"when i got to mountain knot city, i ditched the vehicles entirely then switched to ziplines. game changing. and from heartman forwards, went even back and switched to just walking. i would just bring pcc and floating carriers. there were times were i would just hold up in a corner and pop up a timefall shelter while waiting for a blizzard to pass. game is pure bliss."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-01-05,"wow, i've never played the game, but i've always wanted to know the story of this game and omg. its amazing, the story had a twist. it was hard to understand the story in the beginning, but now after watching this whole walkthrough. i'm glad i spent hours watching it. its clear to say, kojima did an excellent job with the whole game. thank you kojima, you've always been the best at telling stories."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-07,thank you for making this!! i liked watching because i can't afford it and thank you for putting the time and effort into this!!
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-12,lol i laughed when people said this is a walking simulator. but an hour in and the dude is hiking with a body to get it burned and no roads left lol.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-29,lost all my fucking save files when there was 34 hours left. thanks for uploading this dude u saved my sorry ass couple days of work.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-08-02,"hi. thanks for creating this video, is a pleasure to watch. if you don't mind, a suggestion would be to turn on the subtitles in the game. they make things easier for people like me that are not native speakers, but prefer playing the games in english. thanks again, much appreciated."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-25,ive just been playing this game so far its freaking amazing!
Action,Death Stranding,2021-12-11,"really need subtitle man, can understand most part, but better with one. overall good gameplay man 1110"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-11,there is something so poetic about rain that accelerates time on fauna and flora
Action,Death Stranding,2020-12-02,"thank you for playing this game so i didn't have to, i still wanted to see the story"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-09-16,"i wish you put on the subtitles for this, this goes much like your other silent walkthrough which is a problem but nonetheless you put a great effort into this video!"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-25,"the big question, will sam finally get some headphones so he can listen to that awesome soundtrack while making deliverys?"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-29,back in my day playing death stranding we didn't have delivery catapults and we were happy!
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-23,these things were already in the original version stabilizers power gloves different colored suits after beating the game being able to use a carrier on a zip line looks like it would completely change the game for me. ditto for the new roads near the mountains.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-24,the story for this game was one of my favorites ever it was so interesting and engaging the whole way through
Action,Death Stranding,2021-12-26,"death stranding is a beautiful metaphor for life. we all have to carry baggage every day. some day more then others. some days is almost impossible. it takes us so long to get to were we need to. then when we finally get rid of the baggage, we are given more! it never ends. the journey is not always fun. sometimes it flying down a highway. though, mostly it's harsh terrain. where we are haunted by ghosts of the past, and people the wanna beat us up and steal our stuff. we forget what's around us though. how beautiful it all is. in the thick of it, it's all still so beautiful. even after its all been destroyed......"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-26,you have to finish this game before you qualify as a real life ups delivery man
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,"the game was an amazing journey, ill definitely give it another go. keep on keeping on."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-03-30,"kinda a shame its no longer monster energy drink. never liked the stuff, but seeing it for so long during all the gameplay really made me link it to the game. gun range is a big improvement as it actually helps you prepare for the main quest. was just playing it non lethal and sneaky all the time, and then the story drops you in a full blown combat scenario every so often, nothing prepared me for any of that!"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-25,"111 wrong. it is a real ultra wide screen mode with increased fov. there is no content cut from the picture, it's the other way around content ist cut from the wide screen mode left and right to fit the picture of the standard mode into 169 ratio. even the cutscenes have more information now left and right, with the ultra wide screen mode."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-24,heres a lot of things! can we get a mp3 player? no.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-24,"the ultrawide option looks really cool. one of the biggest draws to play games on pc for me is being able to play in 219 or wider  i'd love to see more ps5 games emulate that with topbottom letterboxing like this. with a large tv, cutting the vertical pixels seems like it would be worth the increased fov"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-25,the gloves are power gloves and they were in the original ps4 game
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-25,"bro, epic pulled back this"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-05-27,209 finally his cqc isnt sloppy anymore
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,the robot is so cute! this will be the first time playing the game
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-24,can't wait for the new haptic feedback.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,loved this game on my base ps4. so excited to give it a try on my ps5. one of the most interesting and well conceived games out there. don't sleep on this one due to some basic mother fucker's boring opinions.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-30,being able to ride zip lines with a carrier doesnt sound like a small tweak. that might be the thing to bring me back to the game.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-01-18,"awesome, sadly we still cannot drive the bridges semitrucks"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-26,now it matters even more after epic games mystery game giveaway fiasco
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-21,beware of chiral bridges placed by other players online. some trolls like to place them at the edge of weather zones so players unwittingly run up to them and fall through once the rain starts.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-27,"a few things listed here were already in the original release of the game. power gloves, suit color and pack customizations etc"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-25,"they built a road from mountain knot city, no more zipping around the mountain xd"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-05-24,as someone who only played the directors cut seeing monster energy drinks is the most random thing ever
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,i'll be suiting up for 5th time can't wait for all the new content
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-13,"purchased this a while ago for 15, excited to hop in !"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-12-20,best game made till that date. this game is insanely created with great depth in detailing. sound system is mind blowing.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,excited to play again on ps5 and my new tv!
Action,Death Stranding,2022-01-09,love realizing all this after beating the game lol.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-26,epic pulled the ol switcheroo
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,any hideo kojima game is already a directors cut. so what's this ?
Action,Death Stranding,2022-06-30,"idk, the monster energy really was the glue holding the game together"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,time to go for the platinum trophy
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-25,you are forgetting a very important aspect too that the terrrain has been changed compared to the original. if you played it alot you would notice.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-26,650 stabilizers are already in death stranding standard.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-04,"damn, it's gonna be weird not seeing monster anymore"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-01-09,this dude thought ultra wide mode would make his monitor bigger
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-06,one of the best games i've ever played and it looks like all they've done is made it better. kudos!
Action,Death Stranding,2024-05-28,"just started playing last night, im on 5hrs now."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-07-20,"some of the changes are so small, you wonder why it isnt is just a free update. while others are so antithetical to the game's message and designlike the race track, you wonder why they bothered to expand that when they could have done more to one of the worst aspects of the game. that being the driving"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-14,time to load up the directors cut for the first time before ds2 comes out. glad ive only played this game thru once. confusing but was a very ambitious game i slept on. ds2 looks awesome. metal gear awesome
Action,Death Stranding,2022-01-07,"136 just looked up what director's cut means and basically it's the director's own vision, meaning that hideo prolly didn't even really want the monster energy in the original game so it was replaced or it is manybe licensing expired shits"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-12,"right, couple of things wrong so far. the gloves were in the original version and solar charging sam's battery power was also always a thing. otherwise, thanks for the video!"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,can you transfer safe data from the ps4 version or do you have to start over?
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,"just a comment on 1, digital foundry just did a video on this and both things you mentioned you misleading. quality mode does have frame rate dips, and the ultra wide mode isnt simply adding black bars, it does indeed increase the fov. didnt expect much from ign but just wanted to make sure others know."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-26,they should let you do all the reviews...
Action,Death Stranding,2022-03-22,replay battle memories is available also in older version of death stranding not dc
Action,Death Stranding,2021-11-15,"its sad im contemplating buying a ps5 just to rebuy this game to get a few new features, they know we're weak"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,"native 4k and an almost stable 60fps? the foliage is denser, overall increased texture quality, draw distance increased etc. this is an insane remaster for only 10 more. what suckerpunch should have done with got..."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-04,stabilisers and gloves were in the game before director's cut.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-01,245 that's a lot of damage!
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-26,the first strand type directors cut
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-01,"death stranding is absolutely amazing! it is so fresh, creative, the world is so detailed, amazing performances from the cast, the story, vibe, truly no other game quite like it, hideo kojima is a true creative genius. love the directors cut version on ps5."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,wait what is with the cyberpunk scars on his face? thats the first time i've seen them.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-15,it's disappointing as hell that you still can't use the music player while making deliveries
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-24,at least this time change the score to 6 9
Action,Death Stranding,2024-10-20,i guess i was late when epic was first giving dc for free but later it changed to normal version
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,keep on keeping on
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-24,you always could change sams suit colour post story
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-25,wow. t i think this is the first time that a brand made more sense than not having one. monster energy in the game was a statement about the future of commercialization. bridges energy is just dumb.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-24,they are all solar powered
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-25,this is true and real director's cut!
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-25,higgs is one of the best villians around
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-27,dumb question but how do you get those lines on sams face? 735 for reference
Action,Death Stranding,2021-11-27,is the director's cut content coming to pc?
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-24,why does sam have cracks on his face like a cyborg?
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-25,it really makes you feel like the first strand type game
Action,Death Stranding,2022-03-30,oh monster energy you will be missed.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-05-22,for those who didnt play it. when it drops on ps plus spartacus you defo have to play it
Action,Death Stranding,2025-02-26,"anyone elses turn into a bit of a mule playing this game? i know i did lol. i would find my serif saying ok, one more delivery and i will turn off the game and would still be playing 5 deliveries later lmao. it was quite eye opening for me."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-12-10,is the pc version already the directors cut??? some of those stuff exist already here o.o
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-03,oh so that was why i never seen monster i'm not very far but i've been waiting for monster to show up
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-28,replay boss battles aka getting caught by bt's
Action,Death Stranding,2022-11-24,im sad we dont get to take out the raiders. im too used to fallout and elder scrolls where we raid the raiders and take all their stuff.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-17,"what about the cyborg things on his face, looking like he took trip to night city in between consoles"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,im looking forward to the pc release.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,"kojima, we wants silent hill"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-06,"the real question is, will sam be able to hit that time fall bussy on fragile?"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-17,i've never played any version but directors cut because it's the only thing that was released on xbox recently.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-26,we need more chiral knots damnit!!!
Action,Death Stranding,2022-06-27,does anyone know if the friends tab  under bridge links is exclusive to dc?
Action,Death Stranding,2023-06-05,"this game even the original one, from the beginning was a short story line but extended the game with no reason"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-24,those buddy bots better get s ranked now
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-01,what are those lines on sams face?
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-02,game is so gorgeous man sheesh.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-24,who else is downloading right now?
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-22,this new version on the ps5 makes ps4 players look like were playing on nightmare mode.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-26,why is sam's face looks like cyberpunk augmentation
Action,Death Stranding,2023-12-26,all that was needed was more enemies and variety of enemies.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,"most of these changes are usually added as free content in most of the games, definitelly not even close to ghost of tsushima directors cut"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,440 excuse mewut seeing it in action .... okay
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-26,at least the power lvl.3 and speed lvl.3 are solar powered. not sure about previous level versions buuuut you made a mistake there.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-11,"thank you director, for cutting this."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-29,those gloves were already in the game
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-27,game was amazing! took me 90 hours to beat.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-09,keep on keeping up
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,the gloves thing isn't new...there was gloves in the pc release for combat...
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-27,weren't combat gloves already a thing?
Action,Death Stranding,2023-07-29,you are forgetting that they changed new features on fragile jump
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-06,is there any new footagestory for higgs?
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-02,"the environment is the most impressive part of this game. it looks real, like a photograph of actual landscape in iceland."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-29,death stranding is just one of those beautiful therapeutic games where you can play whenever
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-29,i love death stranding so much. the atmosphere of this game is something you don't see often in video games.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-30,shoutout to the moment when you crest a hill and asylum for the feelings starts playing. its my favorite gaming moment of all time
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-30,"i played offline with no roads or any help from fellow players. man, it makes it so much grittier when your hiking down mountains and avoiding the shadow ghost. i played during the holidays and all the npcs wore santa hats, it was so wholesome."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-29,"look, it's obvious that kojima games aren't for everyone and i'm okay with that. death stranding is one of my all time favorite games. it hit at the right time in my life, as i was dealing with grief and the world was falling apart so the themes were incredibly relevant. what i appreciate about kojima's death stranding is how genuine the story is. there aren't enough games out there that earnestly try to connect with their players. i'd prefer a game that tries and somewhat stumbles in it's execution to just another mascot platformer or super hero action game. to me, such things are dime a dozen. death stranding is a diamond in the rough."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-29,"death stranding is beautifully niche, it knows exactly the kind of player it caters too and sticks to that path 100"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-11-09,"replaying it for the third time, only then do you realize, that in fact, it is you who have become the mule. bravo kojima."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-01,"when you deliver her, the mom emails you and tells you she adopted her as the girls original mom is dead and she speaks no english when she adopts her. a lot of the story is also on the mails and data"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-29,honestly one of my all time favourite gaming experiences. whenever the music starts i just get chills..
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-30,"my mother took her own life a year before death stranding came out. i'm 35 now. i hadn't talked with or seen her in 14 years. death stranding let me be able to have the closure i was never able to in life. was able to carry her body up a mountain, to a funeral pyre and watch her ashes drift on the wind. when i was a kid we went to colorado together. in real life i didn't find out for 6 months that she had died and her ashes sit somewhere unknown to me. i'm not a kojima fanboy and i only played the first four hours and yet it happened to be the most impactful gaming experience of my life. i don't know another medium that can let us existentially process death while interacting with it"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-29,i think kojima is similar to george lucas when it comes to his writing. he has some great ideas but his writing usually has some very noticeable flaws especially when it comes to characters and dialogue.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-10-30,"this video was a waste of my time. it's okay to dislike it and it's okay that people think you're missing points about the theme. it doesn't absolve it of bad acting or any other complaints, but there are a lot of nuances brushed over commonly in a lot of commentary."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-29,i was sceptical but i played this last year. the gameplay is relaxing and somewhat addictive especially when you upgrade your tools. story is weird but u can see past it with an open mind. graphics are great.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-01,i used to love coming home from work and playing this for a few hours. theres something so cozy about it. loved the calm rainy atmosphere. id do a few deliveries and listen to a podcast or something at the same time. pausing it for the cutscenes of course. great game.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-30,"i loved the long cutscenes and the cinematics and not fully understanding the world until the end. the further i went, the more i got to uncover about the story and the characters and it felt great. i wish i could wipe this game from my memory and play it all over again"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-04,kojima knows how to produce an atmosphere that envelops the player...claiming it's just a walking sim is like looking at a monet painting and calling them flower paintings when they're so much more
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-29,in my fucked up brain i justified 99  of the characters in this game being and acting autistic as a consequence of them living in bunkers and shit and reconnecting them with each other is like a from software fan touching grass for the first time in years that's why i didn't mind the japanese woman speaking in gibberish bit .
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-01,"i play this game when i wanna feel like i'm delivering amazon packages, except i don't get in trouble for taking a potty break in between deliveries."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-29,"the story is coherent, its just actually super complicated, maybe over complicated. and its delivered in the weirdest way, but it all makes sense from a to z"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-05-26,"to say the writing of the game is not good is one thing. i can understand that. but to play 90 hours of this and then say the story is hard to grasp is pretty wild to me. this may be imo the simplest story kojimas ever told, and almost everything is answered by the end. i think this happens if u dont pay attention to the emails and interviews sam receives and unlocks throughout the game. though the finale loooong cutscene at the end i feel like also just makes everything clear, but i guess the issue could be that if you dont read the stuff in the game, the games story will definitely feel like unsolved puzzle pieces until the end. the main point of the games storytelling i think relies on if the player was able to have emotional connection with bb and clifford. because if the player does, goddamn the ending moments and reveals of the game will hit soooooo hard. i dont think ive ever ugly cried like that regarding a video game story"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-15,godspeed sir. i bought the directors cut since it was on sale. im watching reviews while its downloading. i just wanted to say youre a real one for telling it as it is
Action,Death Stranding,2024-06-13,"not trying to bash on you, but maybe she's actually a real japanese who happens to stay in the us before the death stranding and now is stuck there. her accent really scream non l1 english speaker who's still learning english. i'm an indonesian and i've heard tons of people trying to speak english with their accent because they can't completely remove their accent, and japanese is one of them. that's why when i heard her speaking my brain immediately went to oh, she's a non american and is stranded in the us"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-12-05,"yeah, gaming needs more creative titles like this havent played yet but i appreciate him trying something totally new"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-10-28,that scene wasn't bad at all... she's japanese bro.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-10,"its really sad that a lot of gamers trash this game because its not a dopamine rush to their brains. its a calm game despite the bleakness and its a work of freaking art. and still, underneath that, the story is incredible. its complex. its kojima. and because its complex, a lot of gamers think its arrogant and boring. theyre missing out."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-22,"i love when someone tells me there will be a link in the description and then there is links to everything but what they said in the description, really shows you care. also you can think something is bad and be wrong just like other can defend things that are bad, your not enjoying something doesn't make it objectively bad just like someone enjoying something doesn't make it objectively good. but coming into a fandom and trashing it wile saying anyone who disagrees is a sycophant isn't a good argument either, it is possible you don't get things or they aren't for you and that's ok you don't need to like everything."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-31,"look at this scene, the acting and dialogue are absolutely terrible  talks over the entire scene."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-29,"i was surprised how much i liked death stranding. it had an interesting and unique story, good characters and voice acting, tense moments when having to engage in combat on your way to your destination, good terrain challenges, fantastic soundtrack, and motorcycles and trucks were a nice addition to mix up traversal and make it more fun. and it's cool how you can form strand contracts with friends to share your world structures with each other. can't wait to see what he comes up with for a sequel."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-04,"the cars not being able to be driven easily offroad is trying to incentivize you to build roads. much like in real life, you shouldn't drive a car up a mountain. similarly, it's not meta commentary to remark that the world is purposefully lonely. that's part of the game inuniverse, not even metatextual."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-31,"i don't know why but to me rebuilding the highway in this game is like crack cocane, it's all i want to do, it is my main goal before anything else, i just love it for some reason"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-23,"the chiral artist voice acting is believable. she is meant to not be speaking her native tongue. i understand what you mean, but i think it works better this way. to humanize her character more. i am bilingual myself, and i've been around people who talk worst than this. this scene was actually huge too. it's the first sam brings people together and not just supplies. it's perfectly fine if it didn't work for a lot of people, but to me... that scene meant a lot."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-24,"a truly remarkable gaming experience i got back into gaming at 40, im a landscaper and a rock climber, spend a lot of time outside and perhaps thats why ds appeals so much, its therapeutic, often banal and mostly beautiful and yet oddly difficult to recommend to anyone."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-12,one of the most underrated gems of our lifetime. a true masterpiece of a game.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-11,man.. the strong suit of this game is it's story. it is all 100 explained by the end and it all actually makes sense.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-11-09,"dude you have no idea about acting if you think that scene you made fun of is bad acting.. it is just an emotional girl in misery who is trying to find hope and i haven't even played the game,it is not bad acting it is realistic, you took acting classes and in exchange it took away your empathy?"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-10-30,"i totally disagree and i assume that you dont read all the interviews and emails. all strange and weird things that are going on in the game are explained. as the story progresses, theres even more explanation by most of the characters. i watched your video and started to play the game afterwards. i was surprised that i understood everything by paying attention. i really dont understand why you dont understand whats going on in the game."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-20,"i was super disappointed when this game came out. it didn't meet any of my expectations between the cryptic marketing and previous experiences with kojima titles. i finished the story twice to get my money's worth and didn't touch it for 4 years. fast forward to 2024, i've purchased the game again for pc and i'm having a wonderful time."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-29,the game is very addictive and calm.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-10-25,dude. finally somebody did some proper critique of the game and raised some pretty good points instead of the old walking sim rhetoric.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-29,"i honestly don't this this dude has ever watched any sort of media. story progression and revealing more parts of a story is a way to keep the audience interested. this game has fantastic story telling, a task that should be boring that has been made fun and interesting, and a great acting."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-07,"it's true this game it is not for everyone, and it's funny a lot of people has connected with it in someway after going through something tough... for me, i lost my job, a ton of money, my studies stopped, my 12yo dog died and my gf stopped our relationship  all of that and in novemberdecember. i was pretty burned out, i could even think, eat, sleep and all. some ad about ps4 games popped out in facebook and i saw death stranding with a 20 off discount so i bought it. holy cow, man... the story, the music, the feelings, the slow start, the weirdness of everything... i was amazed. i cried a few time while playing it and it showed my several points of view about life that i felt related to. after i finished the game i felt kinda empty, some weird feeling was in my telling me i couldn't be like that, drowning in sadness. so here i am, still healing after all that stuff, still listening to ds ost, remembering quotes and keep going forward. i dunno, games changing your life like that are rare and ds came at the right time for me."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-10-18,"i played death stranding while i was having a really rough time, i would say it's the type of game where your enjoyment is tied to your mental state. i really needed it."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-29,i loved this game.. your review was one of the few i have disagreed with your take on a game.. to each his own tho.. i won't ever get angry about someones opinion.. i think for me the game came along at the right time. i wanted a chill game i could take a few hits off the vape pen and just chill on.. the musicthe beautiful areas of the world.. it was all just so cool to me at that time but i could see being in a diff mood and not liking it as much
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-30,"1500 it would be an awesome sign of progression if as you reconnect the infrastructure you get to see more people. imagine starting with a few people you interact with and after lets say 60 of the game you now know 2030 new characters. they do not all have to be flashed out, its ok for some of them to be in smaller groups but it would show people clustering together and forming the seeds for the new civilisation. this would be a nice contrast to the main character who is afraid of being touched and as the conclusion of the game gets near, the main guy feels the grip of his phobia getting stronger, or even getting easier depending on the message you want to send..."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-10-28,"nothing to do with death stranding ,,but dude sounds like saul goodman"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-05,death stranding is a social commentary on how you dont get it.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-26,"i just find luke's critics too often boil down to i dont get the game. such as the humans in the world all appearing as holograms. it meant to enforce the isolation in the world, that few people ever meet face to face anymore. but luke thinks its just the devs being lazy so they dont have to render fully animated people. rolls eyes. another example, the trucks being sluggish to drive. this is how it should be, the trucks are hard to use off road. it incentives building the highway system. even then you might still use other transport methods given the clunkyness of trucks. if trucks were smooth to drive theres no reason to use any other transport method in the game. or complaining so much of the story is incomprehensible when the games ending goes out of its way to explain everything. now, theres too much info dumping which is a legit critic because its just hard for players to remember everything thats been explained. but part of the joy of ds has been the online community and their discussions on the lore of the game and piecing everything together. a lot of the fans enjoy seeing how everything that maded little sense at the start be explained and make sense at the end. its impressive feat to see what seems like, at first glance, to be a pile of nonsense reveal itself to be a coherent and well thought out story."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-29,"i actually really enjoyed this game. i went into it for the story, knowing the gameplay might be subpar. the story got a little weird, but i still felt engaged with it, and the gameplay loop kept me eager to keep playing and obtain that next upgrade that makes exploring a bit easier. i really did like planning and building the infrastructure, trying to be as efficient as possible. the landscape was beautiful to look at and drive through. i did get disappointed near the end though, because i kinda knew the ending wasnt too far away. it made me not really care about the infrastructure as much, since it was soon going to be irrelevant. i had no interest in 'aceing' the missions after i beat the game, so i stopped caring about it a bit. instead of building a large zipline network or anything like that, i just did the bare minimum to get to the end. i was also disappointed by the size of the map. i know others will call me crazy, but i think it should have been bigger, with more methods to traverse the terrain getting unlocked. when you start, and you find your first base, and it pops up on the map of the us, your like wow, this is gonna be epic! as you play the game, you realize that you can drive across america in like 10 minutes. there was never really a reason to go back east, and the west was just the endgame, so yeah i dono....it felt small to me."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-11-06,"critiquing the problems is welcome but saying that this game was outright garbage and a walking simulator is a page out of cocky impatient teenagers. that's what the fan base including me has been so vocal about, this was the same with days gone people bashed it so much that we didn't get a deserving sequel even though the game was actually good had it's flaws but a very good game tbh."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-30,"as someone who has loved kojima's work since the original mgs on ps1, i absolutely loved death stranding for daring to be different and fresh in the stale landscape of boring open world checklists ala ubisoft and....literally everyone else. the traversal of the land was your greatest challenge, the bt's slightly less so. it was an experience that made me love gaming again!"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-07-22,all these youtubers making a living critiquing games act like theyre helping video game development for the future but im glad people like kojima and hidetaka miyazaki dont listen to critique and make what they want. thats whats beautiful about art. no one wants cookie cutter ubisoft games that try to bend the knee the current critical norms
Action,Death Stranding,2022-11-24,the problem with your first video is that some of your constructive criticism was really bad. so disagreeing with it is being a sickafan? maybe some of your points wasnt 100 spot on? like claiming that the map of the game was procedurally generated
Action,Death Stranding,2022-10-21,"the term pretentious is overused so much when referring to a game that doesn't pander to the masses. it's a shame really, once upon a time we could simply not understand something without using a word that no longer has meaning."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-31,930 i dunno. i've met plenty of english speakers who sound like her. it's almost as if nonnative speakers exist in real life.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-18,"1141 this made me think of jojos and how araki names all his characters after musical references, and now i'm thinking how much i would love a game designed and directed by kojima but the story being written by araki."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-30,"hi luke! i totally get your point and i remember being bored at some cutscenes.. i chose to be lenient because i understand that some actors being japanese, the translation and having a different voice layed over can really mess up the purpose of the intended result. now what worries me sometimes is that people tend to stick to negatives and oversee the overall beauty that this game offers."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-03-12,totally agree with you... but keep in mind that the other side of that coin is that we can enjoy your videos while also disagreeing with your critical opinions.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-31,"i loved this game, the end scene on the beach was so emotional and so well done, it was the closest to having a wee tear in my eye ive ever had in a game, no game has had that impact on me before or since. what a fantastic adventure and experience the game gives to the player, the gameplay is addictive and you get lost in the world of death stranding."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-06,"i find it amazing that you're revisiting this game once again and still cant figure out the story. it is a little confusing while you're playing, but by the end i makes perfect sense if you pay attention and buy into the reality of the game. it's really not that hard. i feel like you're overcomplicating it or you're so preoccupied with trying to rationalize everything in real world terms. it's like, the few not super large maps are supposed to represent going from the east coast to the west coast of america. obviously the country is not that small and far more geologically diverse, but its just representative of this physical space and distance, not a literal ontoone scale representation. some people just don't have the imagination to comprehend this story i guess."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-29,sometimes a rope can just not be made of blood is the summarising sentence for me
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-01,death stranding is its own thing and i respect that. i didnt 100 it but i finished the story and i can safely say i would play it again. its very calming and beautiful and slowly becoming one of my favourites.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-29,"that moment when kojima built his spin on truck simulator, but the crowd showed up for metal gear"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-02,"i love death stranding. love the atmosphere, love that i dont understand everyting about it right away, and love the satisfaction of delivering those damn pizzas!"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-30,i just pissed in my cereal
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-30,"preach brother! i absolutely adore cyberpunk 2077. i love the world, i love the story, i love the upgrade system and i love the gameplay. i can say confidently say it's one of my top 3 favourite games of the past 10 years. but i'm not silly enough to claim it's one of the best games of the past 10 years."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-28,"that character in the game with the japanese accent is literally japanese in the game. if you read the letter from her mother, everything makes sense. i wont give a spoiler, but her performance is objectively not bad. its in line with the narrative. unfortunately, what youre saying is without having all the details."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-29,i been very sick of aaa run of the mill games. i have ventured into indies and found the passion i was looking for again from devs. i have also been thinking of death stranding since it was so different from every other game
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-16,the complaint about that one girls voice is one of the dumbest takes i've seen. it's literally one minor character.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-29,"when i played the campaign, i had the online component turned off. i was completely on my own. it was a difficult game, but the challenge felt somewhat rewarding once i got through it. then after the campaign i enabled online and was shocked about how easy was to travel and avoid the bts. there was so much stuff littered across the whole map by online players to help out. i think using online help with the campaign would have made it much too easy, and less enjoyable. also many online players leave some of the the most useless things placed in the most stupidest places."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-11-14,"when this game came out and of course reception was split. many loved it and many hated it. classic kojima outcome. i really liked it. i did see people asking it's just a walking, delivery simulator. how on earth could anyone love this game?!. at the time i had no idea how i personally could answer that question but now if i think about it, there isn't really an answer. the only thing i could possibly say is the reason people loved this game is likely for the same reason people who play euro truck simulator 2 loved that game. or any sim game for that matter. you wouldn't suspect there would be a market for such a game but there is. if you know you just know."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-05,"i just started my 3rd playthrough of dt and i'm still just in awe as i was the first time i played it. death stranding isn't a video game, it's an experience."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-28,"no no, i didn't find anything wrong with the japanese lady acting, it was perfect, it felt like it was her personality."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-01,"i love death stranding, consider it one my alltime favorite game ever and have spent over 250 hours on it but it has very obvious shortcomings and flaws."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-05,hideo kojima is like the quentin terantino of video games
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-10,"her acting isnt bad they did it for inclusion, because like you know there are people who speak like that in the world and they also play video games and sometimes they like to see themselves in said video games"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-05-09,i cant play this 60 game without buying it again because i bought a digital version of the console instead of the physical media version. this was always the end game for digital only consoles. long live physical media
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-17,"i think the filmmaker equivalent of kojima is david lynch. i may not necessarily ever feel like i'm totally aware of exactly what is happening in their stories but i very much enjoy the way that they tell them. beyond that, i think kojima has some of the best visual storytelling in any game through his cinematics...they are very well directed. i also enjoy the way he manipulates and subverts some industry tropes and expectations in really memorable ways."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-18,the fact i know criticism can affect the future is the reason why i despise the abomination that are unnecessaryunfoundedunfair criticism. they can and will affect the developerspublisher choices on the future
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-29,"although the game has its merits eg cinematography, acting etc i think its overshadowed by its uneven script and gameplay. its a solid game but not outstanding"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-17,they use holograms because they are afraid to go outside.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-09-04,i have a love hate relationship with this game. i love how unique it is and the risks they took with the gameplay and story. even though it's not for me i still give it props for standing out and being different from other games.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-05-14,"i think what you're not fully getting with that cutscene is that in the story, i think in one of the emails from her mother or maybe her husband, it's mentioned that she didn't speak english at all until her mother taught her. so english isn't her first language and she's not great at it intentionally. she's translating her words in her head as she's speaking them which is why her speech feels so stilted. idk if you've ever met someone who's learning english as a second language but their speech is very similar. so i saw it less like oh, she sounds that way because the va is reading from a script. and instead saw it as, oh, she's trying hard to translate what she's thinking into a language that is still fairly new for her."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-30,"i absolutely love this game. a lot of the story and typical kojima stuff was lost on me a lot of the time and i would zone out in the cut scenes. but the gameplay always hooked me. man, i'm gonna reinstall it again soon."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-11,"i completed the directors cut last night, second play through and i loved it. cannot wait for 2"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-30,i think kojima's writing process is just thinking of cool moments and then stringing a plot between them. certainly seemed that way with phantom pain at least
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-29,the guy doesnt even know where cannes is.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-29,"i would love for you to check out snowrunner. if you find this delivery journey experience fun and relaxingrewarding... that game's whole terrain and map is alive, in that the mud, snow and water as all physics based. how all the different trucks have there respective purpose etc. i actually didn't expect you to cover kingdom come deliverance, and i really enjoyed that game. was great to see you cover lesser known games"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-05-27,1035 lmao octopusses and whales that swim in tar. it's an acid trip. great insights!
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-29,this game had an incredible soundtrack
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-12,"about the girlchiral artists horrible acting. did none of you guys read the email from her mother? they are not related. the girl is japanese, her parents died 5 years ago and the woman took her in. she barely speak a word of english when they first met. the actor was playing a girl who didnt know a single english word up until 5 years ago and only learned english and spoken to a single person. thats why she speaks broken english. seriously, how come nobody pointed this out?"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-29,"i think the most grating part was how long the game is, and it doesn't feel like it needs to be that long. there's so many side deliveries you can do that unlocks useful equipment that didn't need to be locked away for dozens of hours."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-10,"i love the way the war scenes start in wwi, then wwii then vietnam then the modern era. and it's not so much for the shootout aspect but just the portrayals of the warzones..."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-29,"i enjoyed this game for what it was and how different it tried to be. that being said, i really hope they dont make a sequel to it. i really want to see kojima go back to a more linear format, or something that feels vastly different from death stranding and mgsv"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-30,i'm willing to bet kojima mostly hires friends.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-12,"here because ds2 has been announced  i played 25 hours on pc and never finished it, i've been playing it on ps5 this weekend, sunk around 10 hours in, and i'm enjoying it. always a fan of seeing kojimas visions and game design. also, bloody hell this game is gorgeous."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-30,"1200 i was so ready for luke to compare hideo to neil breen as far as being an eccentric, niche, misguided artist."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-31,lol the whole concept of the story of death stranding i absolutely feel inlove with. i finished it and managed to understand why everything happens the way it is. and i actually believe its the games strongest suit. i think it was the pacing that might be the tough pill to swallow. but believe me i have never been so captivated by a story that purely involves walking as its main loop.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-21,"as an american i really dislike how americans hyperfocus on the negative aspects and just can't see past them. there are always great positives in art, but no they have to always get super hung up on like this tiny f detail"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-12,"the scene with the japanese chiral artist is actually one of my favorites  i understood who and what she was referencing and idk i feel like it makes sense that a lot of the characters are quirky and socially awkward because they are so isolated in this world. the music that played behind this scene also captivated me. idk man, the acting in this game overall was spectacular. i think your opinions are leaning more into the subjective realm"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-17,' we built these cities.. we built these cities with likes and roads..'
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-14,i played for 50 hours and i am still in chapter three. i have been spending alot of time helping build roads and structures with other players. it is weirdly compelling. like going on a long expedition and laying the infrastructure for every one that come after.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-20,"one absolute must tip is to go visit the collector and level him up to level 4, he gives you a backpack cover level 1 and level 2 to protect anything it from time fall."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-17,crouching when traveling down a steep hill helps from losing balance too
Action,Death Stranding,2020-05-06,"you can jump over the enemy ping scanners as they sweep through. if you time it right, and jump right as the orange scanner waves come under you, you wont be detected. the game never tells you this. also, in the loadout screen, sam's center of gravity is shown as a blue circle on the floor."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-18,"tip while taking a break in your private room and slamming monster energy drinks, go to the sink, then move the right thumbstick up, down, left, or right to do various posesactions in front of the mirror. then, very important, hit the square button to snap a picture, you will usually get likes from bb for this. i've gotten up to 40 plus for each pose, great way to get to 5 stars with bb."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-20,"if you get in a truck with an order on your back, it'll put the order into the passenger side, separate from the rear storage arm and leg stuff not affected. if the order is too big for the passenger side, the rest will go into the back. when you get out, it all goes back onto your back. so even with a full trunkboot, you still get 2 boxes of extra space equivalent of 2x200 resources, which i think is the max 'depth' of your backpack before it stacks on top. it's easier to raid mule camps during timefall, as they hide in their tents. even if you're alerted, they won't risk the rain. if they can see you, however, they'll still throw stun lances. keep on keeping on, porters."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-05-11,"reviews made this game seem so boring and grindy. i bought it and started playing, and the next thing i knew, birds were chirping outside because the sun was coming up. a whole day went by, im like wtf? i just turned this on"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-18,i built the entire highway feels good to contribute. easy to deliver stuff esp timed ones.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-03-10,everyone was saying how boring this was cuz its a walking simulation tbh i'm enjoying the hell out of every moment.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-25,"another tip if you use your compass and put a beacon on a location your looking at, it will give you a little visual indicator in the top right that shows you the incline. you can use this to see if there are any canyons between you and the location you put a beacon on, even if you can't see it."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-15,"combat tip if you run  a mule then press circle just before you get to them, you'll perform a quick slide that should not only put you behind the target, but also stagger them, leaving them wide open to a melee combo or strand attack if you're fast enough."

Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-26,"my simple tip is don't waste grenades on bts if you are farming a zone or going to wind farm. just use a pcc and place a storage container placing anything you don't want to get damaged. then get caught by a bt and take out the boss. it eliminates sneaking around in the rain, uses less grenades, and makes collecting much easier. if there is more to collect than you can hold you have a local storage container you can fill outside of danger."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-21,"great vid! here's a few if youre lookin you can pee onnear bts to make them go away  especially if you're creeping around in the snow. bonus, peeing melts snow, so have fun trying to write your name bola guns ko an opponent if you get a headshot their orange icon turns to stars  if they get tied up, their orange icon will be cuffs, and then you can run up to them and hit square to ko them. bolas also let you stun and walk right past a bt if you need to you can surf on the floating cart if there's no cargo on it, and even do kickpushes if you have hemetic grenades and a gun, you can shoot normal bullets thru the blood cloud grenade explosion, and the normal bullets will deal amplified hemetic damage"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-20,"good tip video. a few things though. don't just give a few likes to structures you use. mash that like button until the timer goes down every time! it will benefit yourself as much as others!! don't be stingy! also, don't forget to occasionally add needed material to favorite structures and roads for repairs!!!! if they deteriorate you will have to rebuild them. so in closing, no hoarding of likes or materials!! they are there to share and build, not collect!"

Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-18,"i'm not sure if any other signs boost stamina, however i do know that the keep on keeping on sign will boost your stamina if you run through it ."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-06-22,"the double jump is great, just remember that once you press x for the first jump you need to actually hold the button down before you can get the double jump to activate when you press x again during the jump. it's not just clicking x and x in quick succession like in other games, for the initial leap press and hold x and then while in the jump press x to perform the double jump. i recommend practicing the timing before trying to cover perilous gaps, especially when carrying even a moderate amount of cargo. i haven't tested this myself but i saw somewhere that said you can't double jump if your carry weight has gone past a certain limit, so make sure to do the 'ol trial and error before you're in a situation where you'll be trial and dead"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-16,"i been playing more then 60 hours just doing certain jobs and building bridges. a lot of players say they completed the game within 40 or less hours but i think they rushed it because there is so much in the game. i think its over 100 hours to really complete the game if you played straight through. im in love with this game. the way that kojima made this game is something else and special and unique. it makes you as a player decide what do do next so thats the part where you make decisions when it comes to getting across a certain path or if your vehicle gets stuck and you have 3 deliveries in that vehicle but need to find a way to retrieve them either by hiking and finding another that was used by another player in the game because you might need a latter or rope and if its huge load, you might have to carry that load down and put in your truck or motorcycle then go back up and get the rest. its feels like real life in how this engine works in this game and the obstacles you come across are insane but in a good way and this is when you put your thinking cap on and make a choice in how to get things done in the game and some of these missions are timed like in real life, for example, i came across this situation where i had to pick up medical supplies and a pacemaker for this person and for example if time runs out, that person could die so it can become emotional at times because it deals with real life situations. there is so much in this game and its really deep when it comes to the little things. kojima made a game that other creators never done before and this is truly special. when it comes to music and sound, wow!!!. from the artist to sound, perfection. you know kojima is a big 1980s scifi movie fan such as movies like the running man, escape from new york and others because he added 1980s synth sounds when your near enemy areas or times when your hiking or just driving and he nailed it.. this game is a futuristic game with 1980s scifi sounds with an awesome sound track... it fits perfectly. i havent felt this way in a game since 2007 mass effect and the ending credits music is amazing and now playing ds. hands down, my game of the year of 2019... last year for me was rdr2."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-17,tip if you need to cart a ton of weight. use floating carts ladders and climbing anchors. youll be amazed how far you can carry insane amounts of cargo over rough terrain. ive done this all game and have only recently started using vehicles because the carts helped me build all of the highways
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-21,"when in private room and drinking energy drinks, you can get a fun reaction from sam by shaking the controller as he goes to drink. timing is critical, but he shakes the can and spray the camera!"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-18,"i may or may not have lost a vehicle by driving through a river that, honestly, didn't look that deep."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-12-07,"on repeated actions like delivering cargo, going to private room, recycling, or even the bb flashbacks. do not press options and then skip. once youve already watched a cut scene, the next time it repeats you can skip it by simply pressing circle. makes chugging all five monsters super fast and easy once you watch the 3 or 4 times. this also lets you know if its a bb flashback you havent seen before because pressing circle only skips those youve seen"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-16,"that turn around repair spray is priceless i couldn't believe you had to unload all your boxes, spray them and put them back on, awesome tip!"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-19,"i remember building initial roads for the first time, invading bases like crazy for raw materials, i spent a lot of time on it. then it turned out that when i unlocked the area, some resources can be provided by other players and instead of loading 100 of resources i only needed 13 .... great times d"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-09-27,containers loaded on a floating carrier or a trike require significantly less spray to get repaired than containers carried on sam's back. also batheing in hot springs with a client was such a nice discovery! took mama on a zipline trip across uca. soaked in almost every hot spring on the map. the songs we sang! happa banana ah bee bah bee bah no no
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-28,ropes help cross long rivers. even when your stamina runs out sam continues to grip the rope
Action,Death Stranding,2021-03-04,"use the sticky gun  this was the most underrated and useful gadget i didn't take advantage of until later on, and i was kicking myself for it. you're way more efficient especially in mountain areas not having to go out of your way to walk or go down a slope or ledge just makes things so much easier. this was crucial for me when leveling up facilities and going for certain achievements if you're into that."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-12,"this is the most beautiful game i ever played. it doesnt need to be played, it needs to be understood, not in a bad way. im only in the very beginning, but its atmosphere, its look, the tension, the silence  that is not really silence, the music, the sounds of the environment, are so beautiful. im very excited about whats going to happen in the story and to the world, that we, the players build and create. so far, this game is a masterpiece, an artwork and unique, im glad i eventually bought it after being influenced by badhate comments on yt and very sceptical."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-31,"dont ever put your vehicle in a garage if theres cargo on it, itll disappear! i learned that the hard way. lol unload the vehicle, then put it in the garage after. in your private room, approach the mirror, and pose in the mirror move the analog stick to the left sam flips around with this cute guns gesture. snap a photo, time it just right, bb will give you 45 likes. you can repeat this process up to 5 times! this increases your bond with bb. also, try the same thing by using the stick, usually to the right, sam blows raspberries in the mirror, which also amuses bb. time it right, snap a photo, hell give you about 40 likes or so. you can skip if he does other random gestures. check bb every time you go in your room, theres numerous hidden cutscenes or dream sequences from time to time. if you want to completely clear an area of bts, let them grab you, and drag you away, break free then run like hell until you elude them completely, and they all disappear from that area! if you use the bolta gun on mules, and if you see an  symbol above their heads, this means theyre still conscience, and they can eventually escape. to prevent this, walk up to them and kick them to knock them out! then youll see  instead. i like to teabag them afterwards lol you can taunt and gain enemys attention by pushing the touchpad. hey, come and get me! im right here! you can get bts to warp to you faster and then shoot them with certain weapons. dont forget to always pick up the chiral crystals they leave behind. youre welcome!"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-17,don't skip the story scenes skips one of the dream sequences lol
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-15,"i heard that more likes makes it more likely for that structure to appear in more worlds so if it's a really helpful structure, giving a lot of likes should help out others in their games"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-02-23,"one thing that helped me was always making sure to grab those materials needed for roads. a lot of times, the road printers will be outside the distribution centers so its really easy especially after you get vehicles to claim materials, load up and head out to the printer. if everyone gets in that habit, roads get built a lot faster."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-07,"the specific point in chapter 3 you can check for timefall on the map, is once you finish the mission which requires you to go to the weather station. after that you just gotta click r3 a couple times on the map and it explains it all"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-01,i played for about 5 hours when death stranding first came out and i was liking it but life got in the way and i kind of just forgot to play it. i started again today and have to relearn how to play and these tips are really helping. i love how out there the storyline is.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-19,"quick tips when using floating carriers, you can lift the cargo by hand and release the l2r2 buttons when you facing the carriers. then you will loading the cargo to the carriers real quick.same way when you facing the back of the truck."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-18,"biggest help i found was when using your map, move the cursor over structures to see whathow much of a material is needed. that way you can grab them from a knot before heading out. also, aiming the bolo gun at the head makes for a knockout instead of a temporary restraint."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-06-15,press the callout on the touch pad when sam is resting in a hot spring and hell sing to you. make sure there is a timefall shelter at the entrance of delivery pointsespecially in the mountains. you can use them to instantly restore cargo condition without messing around with spray.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-04,"my cargo usually ends up somewhat damaged while fighting melee with mules, so i've started unloading all of the fragile or important cargo behind a rock or someplace i can come back to after fighting mules. that way they don't get damaged, and i can move around the mules quicker."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-18,i wish i knew how much fun it is to snowboard floating carriers
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-06,i have to say i started 3 days ago so boring but can't stop i'm glad i didn't once i built a road and got a vehicle omg makes me wonder what else i can do it's a feeling no ody who isn't playing can i derstand building a world and making it easier for all of us i love it
Action,Death Stranding,2020-03-30,you can press the square button i think to quickly slide down a ladder. i inadvertently did it after playing mgsv and realized how much time i was wasting slowly climbing down in death stranding
Action,Death Stranding,2020-02-23,"i finished up 3 roads today! i just ran around all day today getting metal etc. it's really satisfying, especially when seeing that other people use them. today i also saw someone put up a request road sign, so it motivated me more just for the sense of community d"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-10-23,the water scanning tip is about to come in very clutch. thank you!
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-03,i didn't understand the like system. i just did it as a thank you to the structures that helped me. i also built roads and returned or finished delivering lost cargo. after completing a delivery for myself my bridge link jumped over 50 points and i didn't know what i did! lol guess i'm just a team player.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-06-10,"i knew everything but this was one of the few tips videos that didn't have someone talking too fast, tripping over his own words. well spoken sir, from a typical youtube nobody"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-03,"i kept seeing the double jump prompt but didn't know it was related to the cargo weight being carried. bb also seems to give some likes for double jumping sometimes. some other tips  when you give likes to something, you can spam the like button and give out something like 100 at a time. there is no consequence.  cargo has 'container health' and 'damage'. once the outer container is destroyed the cargo will start taking damage which cannot be repaired important for deliveries that rank cargo damage.  try to level up the different bunkers to at least level 3 or 4, because a lot of them give you access to some very useful new gear that you can't get anywhere else in the game. when you level the smaller delivery points up to level 5 you can use them as a private rest point. also, every time you level up a delivery point you can get free resource storage, and more chiral bandwidth which means you can build more stuff important if you want to make a well connected zipline network.  sam can throw cargo at enemies if he is carrying it in his hand, and can throw packages further with his right hand this is a loading screen tip. just do a punch, then let go of the cargo midswing. this is a good reason to pick up small bits of lost cargo when walking so that you can use it as a weapon.  when entering a mule camp, they will ping you with an orange scan to detect you at the boundary the one that comes outward about 5 seconds after you cross the boundary. if you time it just right, you can counter their scan by doing one with your own odradek and they will cancel each other out. you can also jump over the orange scan to avoid being detected.  if you have a very full bladder, you will make more ex1 grenades when you use the toilet standing up in your private room the animation shows four being made but you can get like 10 at a time in your private locker."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-17,thank you for not having any spoilers... just looking to understand the mechanics more so i can enjoy this super weird story.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-21,when the bb crying came through the controller for the first time i was so surprised. it was super loud
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-14,"has anyone else driven through a speed boost and accidentally boosted right into a friendly porter, losing 100 likes?"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-20,here is what i wish i knew earlier to accept premium deliveries! to read emails! to provide better service to the elder! realized that cargo weight and load management is right before your eyes. that recovery deliveries mean just that. not to fear mules when you are equipped with a bola gun. that paths and routes are pretty much laid out once you find  see them. what sucks out of control trucks in snowy mountain regions. ... other players putting up meaningless structures and blocking prepper access. ... the hackneyed oradek cut scene when bt's are present i've probably sat through  wasted at least an hour of that combined since you can't skip it. ...not being able to whack bt's from your vehicle. not being able to cross from south knot city to timefall farm. ... no paved roads in eastern region. ... idk anybody got anything else? lol
Action,Death Stranding,2020-12-28,"when fighting mules, you can throw containers at an opponent. when you hold a piece of cargo in your hand, punch and release the cargo. sam will throw that piece of cargo right into the mule's face."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-23,things i wished i knew before it is a walking simulator.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-04-16,"whenever turning when you have a load, hold both triggers to completely stabilize yourself so you'll never topple over. since you can't sprint like that, stop doing that when going straight on level ground."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-08-06,"i just started playing this game, about 10 hours in and i was especially surprised how well kojima was able to simulate the look and feel of mgsv in the decima engine, death stranding looks like it was made in the fox engine like mgsv was. that's a good thing btw if i wasn't clear. i'm enjoying discovering all the minutae the game has to offer."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-09-09,"im playing on steam, had put already 50 hours, im absolutely loving this game. my tip is to always carry a bola gun and a non letal rifle, youll be a nightmare for terrorists and mules, and youll get to steal a lot of materials from them that will help you to build roads and other structures. also, dont dispose of your used or destroyed equipment, all of them can be recycled at stations increasing your stock of some materials aka resins for used boots, metals for used container repair sprays, etc..."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-16,the water tip is worth it alone to know. i can not believe how many rivers i went across and never spotted this  i look forward to future tip videos
Action,Death Stranding,2019-12-02,"i've been fighting bts with hematic grenades for the first time today, didn't know you can have better aim holding r2 after l2. so first hold l2, then hold r2 and release."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-01,the map one would've been so useful to know last time i played so i could've went through the trees that i thought were boulders like a normal person instead of awkwardly scaling a mountain while screaming ''i'm just the delivery boy!!!'' as i crouch away from bts as fast as humanly possible.
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-17,"helpful! thank you! i didn't know too much about the resting feature, other than the fact that it helps your stam, but i had no idea what those little rocks were other than that i could rest at them lol thank you for that! i found out the last one,bb crying sound on the first night i played the game and i ready dislike crying baby soundsidk why, but they trigger me so badly. and once i decided i was not going to play through the rest of the game like that, i looked in the audio tab to change it to tv sound. so glad i did. you can barely notice the crying"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-11-09,"i get so hyped when i see another player has completed a road for me or added zip lines, i then dump a load of mats into another road and together we will repair it all!"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-05-31,my monster drinks just randomly changed in to a non exicting type of drink
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-08,"i've been trying to setup a zip line network, to help the 5 process in the various locations, but quickly realised the number are limited by the chiral network. but you can dismantle old structures, so if you for example removed the safe house you were prompted to create outside of the weather station central region, it gives you 2500 or enough for 5 zip lines. it was then replaced by an online safe house, so you can remove yours but still have access. i've also been building roads, but it's expensive, especially finding ceramics."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-15,"click l3 to drive vehicles fast. really wish the game had told me that. spent half my damn playthrough thinking holding r2 all the way down was top speed. edit people tell me that there is a message that tells you how to boost with l3 that pops of for a few seconds the first time you get on the trike. i maintain it would have been helpful for the game to let you know more than that one time, either each time you get in a vehicle or perhaps idk maybe if the game notices you've been driving 2 full minutes on the freaking highway for 10th time without boosting might be a good moment for a notification."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-14,omfg i've been taking these f'ing boxes off my back every time to spray them.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-11-27,"carry stuff in your hands. preferably the two largest objects you're carrying that are the same size and weight. it's a little tedious to hold down the shoulder buttons but, if you balance the weight in your hands, you can lower your center of gravity, brace yourself, and sprint at the same time. you'll need to fiddle with your cargo if you want to climb a rope and it's not ideal for crossing rivers but, it can really help you cover ground quickly if you've got a tall stack of heavy objects threatening to topple you as you run. also useful for dropping a ton of weight in a hurry if you suddenly have to fight bts. not great with fragile packages."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-03-11,i have spent a lot of time in this game liking the crap out of everything i come across.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-03-17,"something i just found out is that it is very helpful to carry at least one sticky gun with you all the times, that way, if you lose your cargo on places like a river, you can actually recover it"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-23,"great list! only problem i have is the last tip, i feel that my girlfriend coming into the living room scared and confused asking why is there a baby screamcrying? actually completes the immersion."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-01-01,"loving this game so far, got it for christmas, so i haven't gotten all that far yet. so i found this video quite helpfull, had no idea i could check where the timefall would be, super helpfull."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-28,where da hell is the triangle button on a keyboard?
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-21,most people dont realize that the faster you press like consecutively the more limes per press you give. kinda like a mini game to give as many as possible before the timer runs out.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-02-20,"i love how the game connects us, and its really helpful. i need to know whats a good amount of supplies, i need a bola gun, container spray, grenades, ladder and climbing anchor but it seems like a lot and cant pick up more lost cargo. but i need that stuff lol."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-03-15,"im obsessed with these game. like, delivering stuff, making sure it arrives in good condition lmao"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-12-17,the first 20 hours of this game were tedious but in episode 34 the game starts clicking with me.. and now i'm hooked
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-30,"no offence intended but for me at least death stranding was and still is a game i'm so glad i went into as blind as possible and my experience of all the many tips, tricks and techniques of the game has been wholly enriched by that initial lack of understanding and my, and of course sam's, journey of discovery as i slowly pieced things together. whether or not it was the complex lore through countless interviews and emails or the vast range of techniques and game structure i had to learn from the simple act of sending likes to the hours spent carefully scaling treacherous snow covered mountains in order to set up a complicated zipline system and, in turn, raising the available chiral bandwidth in a region so as to further extend them it was the fact that i never felt the game was holding my hand and guiding me along a set path as much as just giving me the rules, regulations and kit required and saying okay, it's all in your hands now the moment i flung a piece of cargo at a mule in sheer panic only to knock him out and realise i could grab random stolen deliveries and smash them over their heads if my freshly fabricated riot shotgun suddenly ran out of ammo then stole a truck and went all death race 2000 on their encampments or suddenly discovered i didn't have to wait for mattel to release a hoverboard as i soared down mountains using my floating carrier as a makeshift surfboard. now, just over 130 hours later, all these things seem second nature but one of the many reasons this game is undoubtedly my goty is that level of freedom and experimentation that comes with being given this open world and tasked with not only exploring it but rebuilding it using all the multitude of tools at your disposal. i was initially highly skeptical about death stranding as i'd been left disappointed by mgsv and all the pre release hype did little to convince me it'd be anything more than an overly complicated pretentious piece of shit bit eventually i bit the bullet and preordered it only to discover a game that truly redefines how i perceive modern gaming and twists and turns new but familiar gaming tropes into an overall experience that i doubt we'll see the likes of for a long, long time ..."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-02-13,"i'm pretty proud of the zip line infrastructure i build in the mountans, it gets you to all the bunkers in no time and through the bt areas."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-11-23,"build all the roads, it makes long deliveries so much quicker you can drive at turbo speed the whole way because you don't use battery while on the power grid strip in the middle. also, i didn't know what the f the otter hat was for, and i stored in a locker and i can't remember where, lol."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-15,just started playing this game so these definitely came in handy. thanks!
Action,Death Stranding,2020-06-27,"if your holding cargo by hand it's indestructible. you can also jump off cliffs unhurt if you do it on a floating crate. you can call enemies into tall grass to stealthily take them out afterwards by hitting the face button. if you wanna make lots of ex grenades you drink one can can of monster then use the bathroom and repeat 5 times, you can also do this by eating cryptobiots."
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-16,"i'm still at chapter 2 trying to get 5 stars for the bases, but i just realized you can fix that broken bike by bringing it inside the distribution centre's garage. makes delivering so much easier with the bike."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-04-17,use the oxygen mask while walking across bt's allows you to avoid hold your breath. watch your batteries.  the collectionist gives you a cover for all the cargo you carry on the back
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-08,"here is another tip , if you lose cargo on the water use a sticky gun"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-14,hey bro. i think you and your channel are underrated. you deserve more subs. killer job on the content. plus all the details. thanks.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-10-15,i played on a buddies ps4 and i made a massive zipline highway through the mountains to every major location possible and a bunch just in coinvent spots in the mountains and i must say totally worth it.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-10-10,"on the topic of jumping while you're on your bike and in a challenging situation, you can also use the same jump feature to get out of a stuck or very rocky road or wherever you might find yourself."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-05-23,i most of the time go through others private houses to get materials and build the roads.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-05-27,my fav lil tip to repair and recharge my truck is to just go to a garage and change the paint color..and in 2 seconds you have a new vehicle ready to roll!
Action,Death Stranding,2020-10-03,"heres an important one it's good you want to help others, but i suggest in the beginning of the game, to just move on with the story. eventually you'll unlock things, like the electric trike, to help you help build structures!"
Action,Death Stranding,2019-11-19,when sam do pee bt get scared..
Action,Death Stranding,2020-04-24,just when i thought i knew a lot about the game and you taught me a few nice new things! thanks for the vid mate!

Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-25,special thanks to playstation for providing me a review copy.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-29,its a very beautiful game try putting game brightness all the way down to 0 it will give you deepest blacks and hdr luminosity to 0 it will take care of the haze in the background and make it more clear
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-25,"i played on ps4  honestly i liked the game, it can become slightly tedious but visually its beautiful."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-11,"while this game is hard to get into for people that require action and a story that takes you by storm, this is one of few games id call a masterpiece, both gameplaywise and storywise. but yes, it takes about 20hrs before you start to get entangled with the story and before youre even handed a weapon but get past that and youll probably love it too"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-12-02,this is a great game. it doesnt seem like it gets enough attention. one of the best ive ever played. im on the higgs right now.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-01-03,"those who say that this game is boring and had to be more violent, i know that they have not understood anything about the plot from start to finish. i am very sorry for this as it is one of the most original games i have ever played. kojima turned out to be great once again!"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-01-11,just finished the directors cut on quality mode in ultra wide. insane visuals!

Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-18,for some reason im enjoying ds on the ps5 more than my first play through. the new knick knacks they added to make deliveries a bit challenging are fun as hell and ive put in about 50 hours and i just barely got to heartman. zip lines help a ton around mountains.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-05-03,i was feeling that intro so hard and suddenly he just skips it

Action,Death Stranding,2022-05-06,"i finished the game last year and deleted it after but i am willing to reinstall the game, just to renjoy running in the field with cargos."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-09-23,"technically very impressive. its beautiful and smooth. its exactly what console owner want, an optimised kindalike top computer to run smoothly all games in a 10801440 60fps at a decent price. dont need to have 234fps in 2160 for the price of a second hand car , i have glasses and tired eyes"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-01-07,this game is probably so good and so interesting but im scared to play and experience it. it looks scary and absolutely terrifying.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-13,hdr in this game is outstanding.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-02-25,as somebody who deliberately skipped the ps4 era im bummed you skipped through the opening cinematic.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-02-08,"im not sure why, but i really like this game, and i enjoyed it thoroughly. i like the world, the gameplay, the story. and these creatures in the game were terrifying."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-24,"i have a ps5 but am playing the ps4 version, really cant even tell the difference. games amazing"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-02-11,i tried so hard to love this game but i couldn't and had to return it.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-09,the video would be better if you didn't go into the menu and change the settings every three seconds. so annoying.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-12-12,"idk why people dont like this game, i always enjoyed it on ps4  ps5"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-09-23,"played the game during the corona period on 2020, what a feeling and what a masterpiece !! kojima always the best of the best ! what a waste for mgs and konami games x"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-12-29,"0350 first, let viewer see all around. dont buzy something we dont know how"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-13,is this another one of those games everyone pretends to like because they think it's smart and they just don't get it? the cutscenes look nifty and all but... running around?
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-18,"i'm absolutely fuming with this , i have my ps4 save files but to play the ps5 version you have to play the ps4 version first ,go to a terminal when you have no orders or active missions and upload saves ps4 data from there . it's the most ridiculous thing i've ever known in all my life gaming, i just wanna play ps5 version but can't because i always have an order or mission open so the option is blanked out to upload saved data to be able to play where i left off on ps5. what the actual f is all this about."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-06-26,"the fact that this game is so boringly fun, its pretty much walking and driving, but then theres some sort of path you cant reach with a vehicle then on your way back you see another and you just wasted 10 minutes"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-03-21,i don't see why this can't be on the ps4 honestly
Action,Death Stranding,2023-12-17,1120 i like how you just skip this part
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-03,isn't anyone else bothered by the movement of the character. i don't know exactly how to say it. like it just feels so rough moving with the character.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-02-13,"anyone who's been to a casino knows that konami makes slot machines, and this game is quite obviously nothing more than conditioning people to get hooked on slots. you can't let go of the controller or sam wipes out, excessive buttonpushing, excessive cutscenes, etc. it's not even a walking simulator, it's a slot machine simulator."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-02-16,daryl a bad ass
Action,Death Stranding,2022-11-05,"el inicio con el tema dont be so serious es lo mejor, porque lo skipeastee"

Action,Death Stranding,2024-05-02,"i just finished the game today, it is a masterpiece. haters say the game is trash or boring simply because they persue the excitement of gaming. if and only if they try to put more time and commitment to feel the emotions of the game, they will feel in a totally different way.."
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-10,"i don't have the income to afford a console nevertheless the game. so i always search for full movie of the games i find interesting and this one has been in my mind for a little while, now it's time to see what's this all about"

Action,Death Stranding,2024-05-17,"massive props to gamers little playground for this! now, honestly i am about 7hrs 30mins into this game according to this vid. i am so damn lost still. this game did such a shit job of defining many things that are constant, and important throughout the main story. i dont think i missed the explanations, but what is chiral network, chiral spikes, how is it bad. what is bt, bb, how did higgs find nukes, how does fragile know higgs is level 7. i dont know the end, but lets be honest guys, the dude in the mask is the villain, and i dont mean higgs. and at this point even the doctor had to have a sus shower moment to convey his own distrust. so why tf are we still running around like slaves doing his bidding? for amalie? man we havent even seen her irl and she herself says almost everyone is dead but shes safe for now, she'll meet us on the beach etc etc. we are the son of the last potus to top it off, like really? we have to run around like idiots initially even though we have a bike. we have to carry massive loads like slaves even though we're also capable oof automated deliveries? we gotta build highways and personal bases too? and to top it off we gotta do some rudimentary bs tasks so that cities join the network, or we do even more so they join. meanwhile mama is capable of doing real time things while being dead or idek. and we cant even get drones to run routes. majority of these shitty tasks are fetch quests, just like a video game. if the bb is attached to sam, why the fuck is the mexican doctor in the middle of a warzone after surgery holding the bb so many questions, such a bad job of storyelling, welcome to the modern world"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-08,it's basically a hiking simulator.

Action,Death Stranding,2024-09-12,"i havent finished the video so im sure my question will be answered but does the bb serve as some sort of metaphor? ive played some other kojima games and watched cutscenes of the others i didnt play, so i know about symbolism and things similar. is it something literal?"

Action,Death Stranding,2025-02-17,its hard to understand
Action,Death Stranding,2024-05-21,"just finished that whole thing, and i have a massive problem with the ending. spoilers below. by the logic of the story that it established, not my own inability to suspend my own disbelief, that ending made zero sense for multiple independent reasons. i could understand if sam was actually the original bb and cliff took him out of the pod to be grow into the adult sam. and i could understand if the bb in the pod throughout the game was some other bb, not sam. but the sam we play as only unlocks his own memories when connected to the bb in the pod, yet he himself grows up outside of the pod. the very last scene tries to wiggle out of this logical inconsistency by implying the bb in the pod was a different person the entire time who sam calls 'louise'. but if that was the case, then how did he have a connection to her to access his own memories as an infant when they had zero connection when sam was an infant or when he was growing up? that's nonsense, and you can't just explain it away with something as trite as some nebulous time loop. now maybe you could argue the memories were held in the pod itself, and that's how both sam and the bb in the pod could both experience them. but this does not work either. the other characters connected to the beach via dolls, not pods. an adult may have been able unlocked repressed memorized by coming into contact with an object from his own childhood, but how does that work for a baby who had no such long term connection to an old object? second independent reason cliff himself went to hell and back to see his baby safe. he literally died cradling his son. and he comes into contact with your bb not once, not twice, but several times throughout the game. he loving looks into his little eyes just like when he was in the flashbacks. there is no way hell, literally even in his hell, that would mistake his own child for some other child. third independent reason everyone sees the bb throughout the game stark naked in the pod, yet not one of them, not sam most of all, could tell the little infant had a vagina rather than a penis? so only now that the bb is out of the pod does he magically know to refer to the baby as a girl?! no, that's where there plot blatantly contradicts itself and proves kojima wrote himself into a corner. something tells me the game's plot was rewritten probably multiple times. there were stories about the game's development going so off the wall that kojima's own codevelopers had to rope him back into a semblance of reality. i remember those stories from the years leading up to the game's release. i bought the directors cut version back when it came out, and the gameplay is so clunky and frustrating that i stopped playing. but had i know the story would be equally frustrating at the end i would not have bothered at all..."

Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-27,i cant wait for death stranding 2 i love death stranding 1
Action,Death Stranding,2023-12-15,death stranding is like blade runner in films. people back then says they're boring and slow but people will start to appreciate the artistic value and the production. death stranding is like that though after few hours in the game started to clique and the action started to kick in like most storytelling.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-07-18,"i should give this game a try. i had friends and other people who told me to never try this game as it's a super boring and tedious game so ive been avoiding it for a good while but later on i have looked gameplay of this and thought that this game might be for me. i love games that does have a sense of adventure, exploration, combat but also just having moments of where you can just walk around and just wonder off peacefully. reminds me of my hikes. edit so i played it and i actually love the game. i love the exploration, how the terrain really effects sam's movement and just how carrying cargo around makes a difference on how you travel. i find the bts the most terrifying thing as i am still learning how to navigate around them but so far so good. definitely not a game for everyone but i felt it didn't deserve the hate it got before."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-07-16,i went through the entire main story and am now halfway through going full completionist and i have never seen that hovering maneuver. that would have been a godsend at any point until now.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-07-21,i am a huge graphics and animation snob. this game seems to be excelling in those departments for sure. i always thought this game was a walking simulator before i saw this video. seems super fun. downloading meow
Action,Death Stranding,2023-05-19,the parry in this game is so satisfying
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-07,the first guy i thought you would drop kick him instead of using strand.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-12,"i had no idea there even was combat in this game, i might have to give it a try"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-07-30,"i happened to be just near that mule camp as i watch this video. the ps 5 version looks so good! didnt know there are chirelium coated bagpack, bike and that jetpack thingy even though i have completed the story. these certainly make him timefall proof. contradictary to the point that chirelium is harmfull for humans but sam is totally coated with it. now that ive started playing the game in very hard mode, gettinv chirelium off the bts has become a hard task. othwr than that, everythings good."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-05-13,"i didn't know before that i could kill these enemies, so i usually just avoided them."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-05-28,this is the scariest delivery man i've ever seen

Action,Death Stranding,2023-03-21,"wait, since when could you upgrade the exo gear to do that and what kind of setup is that backpack"

Action,Death Stranding,2023-12-04,"does the silverhand arm show up in cutscenes or is it gameplayonly?? i know a lot of other equipped items similar to the arm show up in cutscenes, but nothing online, reddit, articles, other youtube videos, ever answer if the arm does..."

Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-09,finally a video that convinced me to not waste my data on downloading this b.s
Action,Death Stranding,2023-09-30,mr kojima is better than all rockstar workers
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-14,why he used shitgren in the last
Action,Death Stranding,2023-07-18,it's mad looking at the gameplay now and realising it's the fox engine for mgsv like the animations and driving and running. it's a cool engine and looks great but i think some smoother more realistic animations would look miles better on that engine
Action,Death Stranding,2024-04-04,this does not look like a walking simulator.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-13,"idk man, kinda looks like a watered down version of the division"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-22,so kojima made a game about being a glorified mailman
Action,Death Stranding,2023-08-22,"personally i won't play it because it looks boring. the idea is good, but the gameplay is boring as hell. honestly i didn't like the combat, it's dull, there is no challenge or anticipation for anything major, i would give it 2 out of 10 compared to metal gear or dead space."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-05-30,how you obtain that jump like austronaut
Action,Death Stranding,2024-04-21,is the protagonist always have that campsite on his back???
Action,Death Stranding,2024-11-09,solved.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-01,i use to think games were so unrealistic they way they carried so much than i saw this game and realized how stupid realistic can make the game. that back pack is ridiculously stupid.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-07-17,tekken 8 gran
Action,Death Stranding,2023-06-28,"i didnt think this game looked fun, never played it tbh. its just metal gear with new characters and story"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-08-17,"i couldn't so this game. at first i absolutely loved it, but after like 3 hours i found it to be incredibly tedious. delivering packages, the same enemies over and over, the incredibly mediocre feel of the combat, avoiding timefall and bts, and the weird lore. i bought ghost of tsushima and completely dropped this game instantly. maybe ill come back. something about the weird kojima characters and bizarre lore with flying oily whales and beaches and strands was just a real bonerkiller. i wanted to like it so bad. also, if you think this constitutes brutal combat, check out ghost of tsushima. you cant even kill anyone in death stranding! its nonlethal mediocre combat, nothing brutal about that."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-04-03,melee combat feels so incredibly awkward in this game.
Action,Death Stranding,2025-02-17,no reticule either
Action,Death Stranding,2023-03-18,"na pocztku ta gra wydawaa mi si naprawd wietna ale im duej w ni graem tym bardziej robia si beznadziejna. w kko jedno i to samo. fizyka w tej grze jest do dupy, strzelanie totalnie zjebane a jedenie pojazdami to ju wogole totalne kurwa dno. nie daem rady poddaem si po dotarciu do heartmana. ta gra miaa wietny potencja ale hideo nie bardzo si postara. auj tylko e powiciem na to gwno asz 65 godzin. a ostatnie 20 byo naprawd na si bo cigle mylaem e ju nie daleko koniec. gra jest za duga i za bardzo niedorobiona"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-03-25,noob use ur gun
Action,Death Stranding,2024-02-20,"i love this game. it's hands down next to metal gear one of my favorite games. but it's laughable because once you get those thrusters, you become so spoiled. deliveries are half as easy. it's wonderful. but you don't get them till later so it's okay, you'll feel like you earned it."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-02-28,i stopped watching because of his aim
Action,Death Stranding,2024-01-16,unsatisfying combat

Action,Death Stranding,2024-09-30,buddy said 20 minutes of gameplay on a kojima game. im smart enough to know that really mean an 18 mins worth of cutscenes and 2 mins of gameplay.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-10-08,the doll not wanting to be put behind sam was probably a subtle nod to god of war
Action,Death Stranding,2024-09-29,love how kojima keeps losing a bit of his sanity with every game he makes.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-10-02,hideo can beat ai with this.
Action,Death Stranding,2024-10-02,"japanese devs i want to make the ultimate cinematic game experience, with real actors displaying real emotions in a realistic setting. ...and the villain is going to be a goth clown commando with an electric guitar that shoots lightning."

Action,Death Stranding,2024-10-04,"what strikes me in this, apart from obviously super climatic and interesting world, are the absolutely top notch character animations. quite ofter even after motion capture post processing the movements look slowmotionish, but here  terrific!"

Action,Death Stranding,2024-09-30,so where's gameplay?
Action,Death Stranding,2024-10-19,"just incredible work from the animators here. no one kojimbo gets so many big hollywood names on board, he captures their likeness perfectly."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-10-03,kojima's best work were still his first 3. his stories now are just simply not as captivating anymore. you can call it creative if you'd like but a story that's all over the place is just not a story at all.
