kinsang,2024-12-13,80,กว่าจะได้เล่นก็ผ่านมาหลายปีเลยทีเดียว ไม่ได้เล่นเกมแล้วล่กขนาดนี้มานานแล้ว ด้านเนื้อเรื่องถือว่าเขียนมาได้ดีมาก เซตติ้งของโลกในอนาคตที่น่าสนใจสุดๆ ตัวเลือกแต่ละอย่างก็บีบหัวใจมาก เลือกไม่ถูกเลยทีเดียว จะเล่นให้จบดีที่สุดตั้งแต่ครั้งแรกแทบจะเป็นไปไม่ได้เลย ภาพก็สวยมาก ขนาดผ่านมาหลายปีแล้ว เสียดายถ้าอยากจะดูครบทุกฉากจะต้องเสียเวลามากไปหน่อย
wapps,2024-12-07,100,the game is really well done and I think it deserves more than where it was put.
Jack4b,2024-12-05,100,"Just perfection. Absolute cinema presented by quantic dream. The music, story and numbers of possible options, a game can’t be more complete than detroit is. Cage with team did great job."

(connor ftw)
Hombre_de_Paz,2024-10-30,100,"Me encantó! se que no están de moda los quick time events.... pero jugándolo al menos en dificultad experto la velocidad con la que tenés que hacer que las cosas pasen te meten al 100% en los momentos de tensión y adrenalina... tremenda experiencia... Cada deicisión cuenta, es tremendo! Son escenas cortas, lo cual permite jugar en un poco rato, dejarlo, y volver luego en caso que no tengas tiempo para meterte mil horas en un juego (ejemplo típico los mundos abiertos con sus tiempos totalmente perdidos). Acá estás jugando todo el tiempo. Tenes 3 personajes viviendo su historia en paralelo. Super recomendable."
Beroow05,2024-10-27,100,"Karakterler, hikaye işlenişi, kararlar... Seçimli oyunların mihenk taşı. Hiç düşünmeden oynayın."
RodrigoKosteski,2024-10-04,100,Muito gostoso! Sem dúvida um dos melhores jogos já feitos! Até hoje se descobrem finais!
kenohej123,2024-09-26,80,"It's a beautiful game in itself. I really enjoyed the game, it was just boring in some places. That's why I deducted 2 points. The gameplay, graphics, etc. were all good. I recommend it."
Jonneeyy,2024-09-23,80,"Tolle Geschichte, wahllose Quicktime-Events (Tastenanforderungen an der Tastatur völlig wahnwitzig), geniale Stimmung, Grafik und Musik."
Mafioso61,2024-09-08,90,"grafikler, atmosfer, hikaye akışı, zorlayıcı seçimler, connor ile yaptığımız görevler vs muazzam oyundur. biraz zaman geçtikten sonra mutlaka tekrar oynayacağım."

Hayasa,2024-08-30,90,"Detroit: Become Human is undoubtedly one of the best narrative games I have ever played. The game immerses us in the harsh realities of life, first through the experiences of the human characters, who can endure terrible ordeals, and then by confronting us with moral choices that challenge our beliefs. The story of Kara and Alice deeply moved me, but even if it doesn’t resonate with you, you will surely find interest in the other characters' narratives offered by the game. This, in my opinion, is one of the game's greatest strengths: beyond the multiple possibilities for shaping our own path, the game invites us to explore the lives of various humans and androids, each facing unique trials. There's no doubt that at least one of the three stories will captivate you. Additionally, this game, besides offering stunning graphics, delivers a wide range of emotions through its exceptional storytelling, making us feel connected to the characters as if they were a part of us."
pestsheep,2024-08-27,80,"High completion rate, smooth story, and comfortable visual presentation, but the plot is indeed a clich é d play of other science fiction works"
Bou-Moncef,2024-08-26,100,This game wooh.i can't describe my feelings. I don't know how there is people didn't play this game yet. For a one who really understand the human feelings and politics . He will be able to live an experience that make him waiting in evry choice he make to see what is the result. What my choices make in that world. If I can save a lot of people in the two sides? Or no I love this game. Thank u for all who makes us live that life inDetroit
stefnmerci,2024-08-17,100,"One of the best games i have ever playied. From the Gameplay to the Soundtrack, for me everything was perfect. Truly a masterpiece ! If you can - go play it yourself !"
akramkimo,2024-08-15,90,one the best story game ever played. it make s you feel soo emotional every time you have to chose an action or thought. and very good graphics .
bezdarns,2024-08-13,100,"One of the best games I've played, in fact has almost infinite replayability, the story is very good, gameplay even on keyboard and mouse is very comfortable"
draemato,2024-08-09,20,"Its too unrealistic and exaggerated. Robots became just exactly like humans in most boring and almost childlish way. This game tries to evoke feelings and make us attached to characters, but ultimately fails to do so. Good graphics and voice acting but plot is just not good."
Argamer12wq,2024-08-08,100,"It was really amazing, the overall story of the game was very deep and complex, the actors were wonderful and the graphics of the game were perfect. But the best part of the game was the variety of endings and the impactful choices in the game, I really enjoyed it."
Ranakin,2024-08-07,100,THIS GAME IS GREAT THE BEST GAME I EVER PLAYED This action of great heroes we are waiting for detroid 2
merciat,2024-08-06,100,"its def my vacorite game of all time. love everything about it, characters, dynamics, realtions and visual aspect"

Erendir,2024-07-23,100,"Oldukça beğendim. Sürükleyici bir hikayesi var, bir bölüm daha bir bölüm daha derken saatler geçebiliyor. Oyunda çok fazla ""oyun"" mekaniği yer almadığı için grafiklere, animasyonlara, yüz hareketlerine ve oyuncu performanslarına iyice odaklanmışlar bu sayede seyir zevki yüksek bir deneyim ortaya çıkmış. Yapabileceğiniz seçimler konusunda gayet çeşitli bence, ulaştığımız sonuçlar da tatmin edici. Müzikleri güzel, beğendim. Ha, öyle her zaman açıp dinle tarzı değil ama yaklaşık 12 saatlik oyun sürecinde hiçbir zaman ""bu bölümün müziği vasat olmuş"" demedim başka oyunların aksine. Bu süreçte bir kere çöktü oyun. Pek bir kaybım olmadı. Bir daha da çökmedi zaten. Bir süre sonra ikinci kez oynanabilir. Tavsiye ediyorum herkese. Keşke zaman zaman bu türde ve bu seviyede oyunlar çıksa."
ElderMist,2024-05-21,80,"Since it is a genre which heavily relies on the characters and the story it is its strongest side. Combination of scenes and different types of gameplay creates insanely good pacing. It has a great story and most of its parts could be replayed with completely different outcomes. However, the Kara line is extremely linear and some storylines end without a proper outcome and showing no final effect of our actions."
beckkyg,2024-05-04,90,[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]
Kurzi,2024-04-17,90,"A very interesting and thought-provoking game about androids, brilliant OST, dialogues written efficiently and in a non-offensive way. There are some plot holes but I don't think they are that important. I recommend"
S2nc1,2024-04-06,90,"Daha ilk 5 dakikasında beni heyecanlı bir hikayeye fırlatan bu oyun bana müthiş bir deneyim yaşattı! Ama hikayeyi bitirdikten sonra tekrar oynarken sıkıldığımı söyleyebilirim, bu tarz oyunlar zaten bıraktığı ilk deneyim ile meşhurdur."
GameAlsoArt,2024-03-17,90,"I learned about and play this game in 2024, when OpenAI has already successfully developed ChatGPT which perhaps to be the most successful AI tech implement ever, and the company is already set off and make its step toward the research of the next-generation AGI. I have to say such thing happened in these days has brought this story into a completely new level. The development of the technology is so fast, it’s much faster than what we imagine and which may out of our control. And as those people in Detroit, we, the human in the real world is begin to feel scared, some of us including some national governments start to limit the research and usage of the AI technology. Are the AI has self-conscious? Is this technology still under humans’ control? We don’t know, but we know we are moving toward the point when we must make our choice."
w1ssh,2024-03-08,0,"The game just won't start, I've searched half of the internet for a solution, but I can't find it anywhere. the game starts for a split second and then closes without any errors! I don't know what to do about it (my PC is powerful). Quantic Dream, please fix this bug!"
gwynbleidd27,2024-02-23,100,"This game really good. I went in without any knowledge of what this game was about and I was very surprised at how good it was. Graphics are insanely good, music and environments too! It offers a really good story with impactful decisions that can lead to a characters death. I thankfully got the good ending. Overall it was really enjoyable game and I would totally recommend it!"
Therealfiocco,2024-02-20,90,A perfect game where choices really change the game. Poor gameplay but perfect story and narrative. Absolutely worth playing.
Nerex0,2024-02-19,100,Detroit tarihin en iyi hikaye oyunudur. Özgün bir hikayeye sahip grafikleri çok başarılı atmosferi çok iyi yani bir hikaye oyununda ne gerekiyorsa hepsi vardı. ayrıca bolca hikaye sonu olması seçeneklerimizin gerçekten bir sonrski adımı şekillendirdiğini hissedebilmemizoyunu mükemmel yapıyor. Aksiyon RPG oyunlarını seviyorsanır hikaye oyunu seviyorsanız bu oyunu kaçırmayın. Bence oyuna haksızlık yapılıyor. Şuana kadar oyunu bizzat oynayamadım bütçemden dolayı ama 3 farklı yerden oyunu izleyerek tekrar tekrar bitirdim. 3 üde farklı sonla bitti ve hikayesi çok iyiydi. Hafızamı kaybedecek olsam bu oyunu kendim oynayıp bitirmeyi tercih ederdim. Bu oyun benim için efsaneler arasında.
AmadouIraklidis,2024-02-12,90,"Wow. An incredible game. As someone who came in with no expectations, I was completely blown away. Certainly an elite tier game. In fact, it borders as an all-timer, if not solidly in the ranks.//So for what stands out about the game//First, the quality of the relationships. The ability to develop such meaningful relationships, the ones I'm primarily referencing are Kara-Alice and Markus-North is always fulfilling. Having relationship development, along a parental axis or a romantic one is so important, and D:BH does it so well. The emotional connection was awesome. It really is a testament to a good game when the loss of a character hurts.//Second, the game managed the multiple story lines incredibly and smoothly. It was an awesome experience, knowing how the three characters coalesce, without the characters knowing, and seeing how they will collide. Truly spectacular.//Third, D:BH really advanced the frontier of the choice-genre. Games like the walking dead from telltale, the wolf among us, life is strange, really crafted an incredible game-type, and D:BH takes it and runs with it, incorporating the emotional impact, leveling up the graphics, and expanding the choice tree immensely. D:BH was able to do the most difficult thing in a choice based game and make it mostly seemless while having so many choice trees.//Fourth, the decisions truly were impactful. And that is difficult, seemingly impossible at times, to achieve. And to take a moment to acknowledge, the amount of work, effort, dedication, and more required to craft so many different choice paths is incredible and results in a satisfying experience.//Fifth, the graphics were amazing. At points, it was nearly indistinguishable whether it was a video game character, or the actual Minka Kelly, or whether it was Lieutenant Anderson or if there was a transition to real life footage.//Sixth, it's an enjoyable experience to play. Not too tense, not like a shooter game where you are constantly on edge, or a slow turn-based game. It rides a fine line between watching a movie and playing a game, and its an awesome experience.//Seventh, the plot is awesome and intriguing. It's a very compelling story about the fight for emancipation, and the struggles of androids who are, for all intents and purposes, actually humans, with a different label.//To close, I can't recommend it enough, this game is awesome, super enjoyable and well worth the experience. One of the elite games in video game history."
Leosensey,2024-02-11,100,"Holy crap, 1. Best graphics in gaming history. 2. did you see typical mission possible variants tree? it's goddamn gigantic, even if you pick up a gun it WILL play in future. 3. The idea of the game itself is very good, machines that look identical to humans are starting to feel emotional and want to stop being slaves. EVERY and EACH of your decision WILL attack you later, BUY THIS THING NOW. (If you have RX 6600 i reccommend upgrading your videocard. in one scene with alot of robots your game will just crash and you couldn't play further.)"
Riri360vr,2024-02-04,80,"I really liked Detroit; it's an astounding story-based game. The graphics are realistic, especially for something released in 2018. The story is very interesting, and I loved the cutscenes. However, I feel like the gameplay itself hasn't honestly been worked on that much. Almost every mission is just scanning random things to piece together the events, which becomes repetitive. In the end, Detroit is a pretty decent game and still holds up today."
Suprizer,2024-02-02,90,Played with my gf and had a blast! Game is so good so really good worth every penny. took around 14 hours to finish but 14 hour of pure joy not one moment was boring!
carnateo,2024-01-28,100,"This is by far my favorite game so far ever. So if you are a story nerd like me,who only what''s a good story, then trust me you will love this game. Love every single decision and second of it. Detroit become"
ioxx,2024-01-19,80,"Un scénario prenant, une vraie claque visuelle et des acteurs incroyables. Enfin un vrai jeu narratif (oubliez les TellTale ) à chaque fin de scène on a accès à un arbre pour voir les choix qui aurait pu amener à d'autres évènements, ce qui encourage la rejouabilité. Le bemol vient du gameplay, car il s'agit bien d'un jeu narratif, et sur les phases d'exploration les perso se trainent un peu (alors qu'on aimerait bien courir !).Le jeu reste une très bonne expérience pour les fans de SF, de robots et de cinéma !terminé en 14h"
kagane,2024-01-11,100,anlatılmaz oynanır derdim ama anlatacağım oyun kısaca 2038 robotların devrimini konu alıyor (tabii başarabilirseniz) bir ton seçimle beraber hiç seçerken aman şuna bas geç olamıyorsunuz çünkü karakter ilişkileri senaryoyu değiştirebiliyor hep seçimlerinin sonuçlarının olması mükemmel ve sadece bir film değir elinizi asla klavye ve fareden çekemeyeceğinize eminim yani biraz tuzlu ama değer
Justifour,2024-01-03,60,"I heard a lot about this game, but it really disappointed me. Yeah, i really liked the way they showed us the future, i get the resemblance and it's awesome. I find it a bad practice to divide the script into three lines cuz it's really hard to make all of them decent and that's exactly what happened in this game. I liked Connor and Hank line, but other two are dull."
janofgold,2023-12-29,100,"This game is insane, I played over 200h to find all final scenes. This game is for everyone"
teenageSpirit,2023-12-26,90,"""This world doesn't like people who aren't like everyone else, Marcus. Don't let anyone tell you who you are.""(c) Karl. A solid and vibe-inspiring interactive game in the cyberpunk style. I advise you to listen to some post-punk like Joy Division or New Order before passing through. Oh yeah, don't forget to check out 1982's Blade Runner. The game has a large number of different branches of events, which makes you want to replay it over and over again. I definitely recommend it to fans of the cyberpunk genre and those who like interactive games for a couple of evenings :) The only thing that confused me was the optimization of the game. On the RTX 3050 there are stable 60 frames with vertical, but there are sharp drops in FPS for 15-30 seconds up to 5 frames, but then everything is normal again.P.S. The only thing that helped me was permanently deleting the folder with shaders in the root folder of the game. Yes, unfortunately this needs to be done before each session and wait 20 minutes for shaders to compile :("
IliaGlobal,2023-12-21,80,"""Детройт: Стать человеком"" - это захватывающее приключение, оставляющее глубокие следы в сердце игрока. Визуальное исполнение на высшем уровне, и каждый кадр словно произведение искусства. Удивительно, как разработчики смогли донести эмоции персонажей через мимику и движения, делая игровой мир по-настоящему живым. Сюжет игры привлекает своей уникальной концепцией и философскими вопросами, которые она ставит перед игроком. В каждом выборе есть вес и последствия, и именно решения, принятые в ходе игры, формируют сюжет и определяют исход событий. Это создает уникальный опыт для каждого игрока и придает игре высокий уровень переиграбельности. Геймплей разнообразен и интересен, смешивая элементы исследования, детективных загадок и динамичных действий. Отправляясь в путешествие вместе с главными героями, вы по-настоящему ощущаете вес их решений и их внутренние конфликты. Несмотря на все положительные моменты, некоторые моменты в сюжете кажутся предсказуемыми, и в некоторых сценах можно было бы увидеть больше вариативности в развитии событий. Тем не менее, это неизбежный компромисс в жанре, где поддерживается сильная фокусировка на сюжете. Саундтрек и звуковое оформление игры заслуживают отдельного внимания, создавая атмосферу, полностью погружающую игрока в уникальный мир ""Детройта"". Голосовые актеры проделали отличную работу, передавая эмоции персонажей и придавая им глубину и индивидуальность. В итоге, ""Детройт: Стать человеком"" - это игра, которая заставляет задуматься, вызывает эмоции и предоставляет игроку возможность влиять на ход сюжета. Несмотря на несколько недостатков, это безусловно одно из наиболее впечатляющих исследований человеческой природы в мире видеоигр. Моя оценка - 8 из 10."
opi3636,2023-12-19,90,"what i like about the game is that it doesn't feel like a video game but at same time it does, as in the simple controls that sometimes you don't notice what your doing and by that making feel like a movie or a tv show"
_matitoooo,2023-12-15,90,"Ça ne m'était pas arrivé depuis plusieurs mois, mais j'ai pleuré aujourd'hui. En jouant à ce jeu. Il est beau. Touchant, profond. La direction artistique est brillante (et il est très bien optimisé !), le jeu profite de l’implémentation de plein de bonnes idées originales. Les commandes sont super, bien pensées (les mouvements de souris par exemple, c'est tout c*n, mais ça renforce l'immersion, on fait véritablement le mouvement de son personnage). Les musiques sont exceptionnelles, elles sont dans ma playlist à présent ! Le doublage français est excellent de surcroît.à mi-chemin entre un film et un jeu, c'est une expérience rare. Merci aux développeurs et à tous les membres du studio. Vous avez réalisé un jeu exceptionnel. Un chef-d'œuvre ! Mateo"
