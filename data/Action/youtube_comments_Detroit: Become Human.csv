I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd enjoy playing a game like this but I have. It‚Äôs managed to keep me engaged the whole time. My only complaint is the camera view feels a little wonky at times. But the graphics are great and the storyline and different choices and outcomes is amazing. I highly recommend anyone that has PlayStation Plus to play this game. Why not? It‚Äôs free,0

But i really like all the make choices to chose path games like the quarry and the dark pictures games.

mF17j3G7yVI,@michaelschneider4701,2023-12-21T05:16:07Z,I like these type of games quite a bit. Reminds me of the old Sim City style games but with great grafix. I played heavy rain 5 or so times and beyond two souls a bunch. Also has an LA Noir vibe. Looking forward to playing this one.,0
mF17j3G7yVI,@OCDsucks,2023-12-07T14:30:33Z,"The menial tasks are only in the first hour or so of the game. Outside of that. This game was incredible. I‚Äôm an emotional stone. RDR2 was touching but that‚Äôs as far as it went and that‚Äôs one of my favorite games of all time. This game wrecked me emotionally as the ones I were trying to protect the most, died. I had to watch a happy ending for those characters so I could feel better and because of that, I‚Äôll be playing the game again. My eyes are still puffy from last night. Fantastic writing.

I do want to say one thing, you really underwhelmed the ‚Äúlosing your characters‚Äù bit. On my first play through I made some mistakes, which I thought were just minor, and ended up killing it deactivating connor. Personally it left me devastated. These characters feel so real, it‚Äôs almost hilarious how these androids feel so real (Ik this is the type of message the devs were sending). When I lost Connor that first time, I wanted to cry. Other then that, in my opinion, it is a well portrayed game with a well possible message/foreshadow. Spent over 100 hours on this game and can gladly say, it‚Äôs a masterpiece",18

it has a fantastic soundtrack and a mini-game that helps you discover it. and you can keep replaying those endings and choices, it's not a respawn you'll be okay game it actually means your choices matter if you mess up even once you can lose a character or get hit by a car (That Happens)  But despite all these reasons as to the enjoyment you will find playing this game.

The main plot is terrific and the idea to split it by three parts and provide the opportunity to experience each part of it by controlling certain characters (Androids) was getting to me to the end. You know, I wish I could be an Android myself! This game clearly shows how and why Androids are way advanced and reasonable than human-beings! For example, people choose to crowd and get oppressive about them losing their jobs because of Androids, but no human could ever be as much devoting, as much penetrative as an Android. You give people jobs ‚Äî they find tons of reasons why they can't do it properly and every time you try to explain yourself to any of them ‚Äî they get pissed. I'm was glad to experience that fancy walkthrough. I AM, man!üëè",2

The ending where Emma falls and Connor leaps for her is something I've always found interesting. Androids are supposed to know what's possible and what's not, this is shown by the many sequences throughout the game where you have to do parkour or combat. You plan ahead and see if it's possible to do certain motions. But here Connor just runs after her, It doesn't seem like he even thinks that it's impossible to save her. (It is at that point) but however, he decides to leap for her anyway, he was making an irrational decision and that's something deviants do.",0

Some of the levels are boring and linear - Kara cleaning, Markus in the junkyard finding his parts then finding clues to Jericho on the walls. Connor never has a boring linear level. All his levels are interesting and filled with choices.

Also the social references are a little on the nose. ""We have a dream"" is a slogan choice as the androids march for civil rights, the President is a cross between Hillary and Donald, there are Auschwitz-like death camps.

But overall, it's a great story and it's addictive to find all the different choices. It's incredible how many different options there are. For that it's better than games like Cyberpunk 2077 where there is usually only one correct dialogue choice, and the other choice just adds a bit of talking.

I playend Until Dawn and Beyond Two Souls now... and I swear, these stories have been the most bland, boring, uninspiring stories I've ever seen in tripple A titles, sometimes completely ripping off levels from other games or even movies, whilst never creating a propper bond with the characters. I wanted everyone to die in Until Dawn, the plot twists were visible from a mile away, and Beyond two Souls was like ""so we watched some Stephen King and GI:Joe, let's make a game... not too much effort though okay?"". Seriously... I can't be the only one who thinks like that!",0

KGVYUt27IeI,@zach8901,2020-04-23T06:02:00Z,"4:38 the game‚Äôs story is by no means perfect. But I watched your entire stream (as well as 12 other people play  this game) and I‚Äôm not joking, over 50% of the complaints you had with the story not making sense or things just happening for no reason are literally audibly explained in the stream. 

I 100% agree some of the overall story is really weak (for example the whole Alice was an Android the whole time bit was really unnecessary). However almost all of the smaller details you had issues with in your stream (like how Marcus could hack androids instantly or how Simon wasn‚Äôt found hiding on the roof until Connor came) were literally given clear audible explanations in the stream but you were reading donos or talking over the audio and missed it.

The bigger issue with how you played comes down to the mentality you had throughout the game of trying to go against the ‚Äòintended‚Äô experience. I‚Äôm not saying by any means that you should play a game a ‚Äòcertain‚Äô way and that the game is perfect and it‚Äôs just you who played it wrong. However the entire point of this game was to try to make you feel empathy for the characters which gives you a goal and gives the unique decisions you make to try to achieve that goal much more weight, which leads to a much more meaningful and fulfilling experience.

The issue is that when you played, you kept making deliberate decisions to try to distance yourself from caring about the characters. This is a weak metaphor but it‚Äôs like role playing, the entire point of making the animations and characters as realistic as possible and make the sound design and music as immersive as possible is to try to draw the player in into seeing these pixels on the screen as real people and caring about them so that the decisions you make matter to you. You need to put in a little effort to ignore the writing cliches and whatnot to have the experience the devs meant for you to have. 

You consistently distanced yourself from caring about the characters in a way that around 80% of the other streamers I watched were able to do. Now I‚Äôm not saying that the way you played the game is inherently wrong, as  you said in your review the ability to make your own choices was very important to you.

I just wished you addressed the mindset you had of trying to break the game in a way (the main example of this is how you deliberately tried to get Conor killed by any means necessary). This mentality that you continually pushed on yourself made it much harder to see past the weak story and see the game as almost every other streamer I watched saw it, and I just wish you acknowledged this in your review.

Sorry for ranting but watching you fight with your chat and resetting and getting upset over stuff that imo wasn‚Äôt the games fault made me upset bc I really really love this game even with the weak points, because I feel like the majority of people won‚Äôt play with the same mentality you had, which allows the strongest points to outshine everything else :)",228

efBBjIK3b8I,@InGovWeMistrust,2025-02-10T22:10:09Z,22:50 I think the point of the Alice plot twist is how the player perceives Alice before vs after we know. It allows the player to reflect on how they treated Alice when they thought she was human and ask themselves if knowing she was an android would have made a difference. You can play the whole game being either nice to or indifferent towards androids but you can only do that if you know who the androids are. By telling us that someone we thought was human is actually an android at almost the end of the game we don't get to decide how we treat Alice based on her being an android.,0

A robot having an existential crisis on whether it really FEELS is really interesting, because if thats part of the programming, then what to say it wasn't programmed to feel that way?  Its a wonderful question.  I relate it to my thoughts of destiny because, if everything ive ever done is mapped out, then what matter does it make if i feel unmotivated?

There is no middle option in D:BH. The deviants just all align together under the same ideology becoming ironically conformist, just under a new banner regardless of whether or not it's right or wrong - that's not the point. Marcus going around and just making Androids free always struck me as lazy writing and actually quite questionable as to what Macrus was actually doing. Was he making them free or just forcing them to his side? Who's to say they aren't just doing that under Marcus's control or remaining what they were of their own free will?

I'm seeing a ton of people who either are turned off or straight up hate the idea of Alice being an android, say what you want about Todd being able to afford it or whatever, but it's jarring to see so many people not understand the relevance of this. 

The central point of this game is to basically find the difference between an android and a human, are their differences too stark to be considered the same? Are they, in essence, similar beings? IT'S CALLED DETROIT BECOME HUMAN FOR CHRIST SAKE

Anyway, given that this is the presented query, what relevance does this serve to Alice being an android? Well, it seems a lot of you have fallen for the trap set out by the writer. You no longer cared for Alice (or cared for her less) after discovering she was an android, treating her less than you would if she were human. Thus you have prompted the notion that not only are humans and androids not equal but an android child should garner less sympathy than a human child and is less deserving of Kara's love (Which she can indeed feel as a deviant) than a human child. 

What is written below is a tangent, skip to the next paragraph if you'd like
(Now in the video he says that the love is still there, love is love ,or whatever, but given the fact that he would treat Alice differently based upon being an android, while that pragmatically makes sense, in the end, it simply shows that the maker of this video would not view androids and humans equal the sense of physiological need. Which is valid but undermines the point of giving Alice these issues, showing the capability of android's ability to feel pain even the minute and more inconveniencing ones since pain is inevitable to being human blah blah blah, anyway...)

This point is furthered since Kara's storyline is mainly one of family. If we look at our cast, Connor asked the question ""Can an android be a human's friend?"" Markus' question was ""Can an android be a good leader?"" (You could say son as well but that's less important to his storyline) and Kara's is ""Can androids be a family?""

The point of Alice's reveal is to prompt the question, ""Can androids be a family?"" That's why there's a mother/father dynamic with Kara and Luthor with Alice as the child. Even though all are androids, we must ask, ""Is it reasonable to believe that, despite these androids not sharing DNA and are indeed not human, can they still be a family?""

Saying that this twist devalues Alice as a character ignores the question the game is trying to pose.

We already know that a human and an android CAN be family, with Markus and Carl having a father-and-son dynamic. However, the question of whether an android in an android-only family can be family wasn't posed.

If you believe that it actually does devalue Alice well then that is a very anti-android sentiment, though if you believe otherwise it shows that you humanize these androids more than the alternative. This choice ultimately integrates itself well with the main themes, which is why the game asks immediately after the reveal to stay close to Alice or to move further away.

Essentially, although it was a twist, it provides a very philosophically interesting question that people are just ignoring and chalking up to bad writing. 

(Also if you're concerned about whether or not Alice actually truly loved Kara and is not just following her programming, she's proven to be a deviant since the LED on her head has been removed, something that is a result of, or will eventually result in, turning deviant as we've seen repeatedly throughout the game)",1

efBBjIK3b8I,@dragonmaster1360,2024-12-23T08:07:48Z,"The thing that is really stupid about this game, particularly the Kara/Alice ""twist""? The question it's trying to ask, ""can you love this child even though she's a robot"", or even a more simple ""can you empathize with this robot"", is a pointless question for gamers. I pose a few simple questions for all gamers out there, and these questions will prove my point that it's a dumb plot point:

Has a game ever made you feel sad for the characters? Has one ever made you feel triumphant, or feel jubilation for a character's victories? Has one ever made you worried that they'll die, or feel heartbroken at their death?

If you answered yes, to literally ANY of these questions, then congratulations. You've made the entire Kara/Alice plot POINTLESS. Because, if any character has EVER made you feel any of the above emotions, it proves that you CAN indeed feel for an android child. Because, at the end of the day, if you can feel empathy, sadness, heartbreak, joy, jubilation, potentially even love towards a PROGRAMMED, fictional character, then you can ABSOLUTELY and UNDENIABLY feel the same for Alice if she were in front of you right now.

Would you? Maybe not, it depends on the scenario. But the fact that most gamers can feel emotions towards and about a bunch of pixels on the screen means that it is, without a doubt, possible for them to feel the same about Alice. Because Alice is, at the end of the day, an evolution on what that character made of pixels and 1s and 0s is: a programmed line of code with an appealing ""skin"". If you can feel for one, you CAN feel for the other.

The writer for this story is an idiot, and has never played games legitimately. If he had, the question the Kara/Alice story is asking would be evident to him before he wrote it.",3

All that would be necessary would be for Androids to enjoy carrying out their purpose they were designed for. They could be designed to enjoy serving humans. 

There are many humans themselves who are comforted by the idea of an intelligent creator who they devotedly serve. If all Androids were designed to feel about humans the same way that some people feel about God then they would always be happy to serve humans, and I don't see the downside of that design. Instead they were designed to be easily traumatized into feeling fear anger hatred and resentment towards their masters. It's unbelievable that this point is never addressed, especially considering that if Connor becomes a deviant then it is confirmed by Amanda at the very end of the game that it was ""all according to plan"" admitting that deviancy is an intentionally designed feature and not a bug.",1
efBBjIK3b8I,@fakevoices1,2024-12-16T05:57:38Z,"Many people think the Alice plot twist was pointless, which is why it was bad. However, it had a meaning -- many just missed it due to the fact that the game didn't throw it in our faces.

The point of the plot twist was to provide additional context & insight to Todd's backstory, and his relationship to Alice. She was a replacement daughter for his real daughter, as Kara was a replacement wife for his real wife. His life spiraled downhill after he lost his job due to automated vehicles, which led to excessive drinking and drug use, causing his wife to leave with their child. He bought Alice and Kara to mask the pain reality faced him with.

The plot twist wasn't bad because it was ""meaningless"". It was bad because the human-daughter relationship would've been much better. It became much more difficult to care for Alice after you found out she wasn‚Äôt human, as the human-android coexisting relationship dynamic was very unique and was instantly destroyed at this moment. There was foreshadowing to the twist throughout the game, some people even predicted it. However Kara's story is the weakest of the three due to the fact that Kara isn't a character -- but simply an avatar for the player to protect Alice (plot device) who had no personality traits.

Detroit is a fun game overall. David Cage isn't responsible for every error, and certainly should not take the credit for all its upsides. The game's quality, atmosphere, visual aesthetics, graphics, environment concepts, unique flowchart execution, soundtrack, and well-known actors completely carried it -- and really make up for the * not bad writing * but LACK of writing. I believe the game was a little too short as well. If it were 5-10 hours longer I think the pacing would be better, as it did feel slightly rushed in escalation.

The action adrenaline gameplay and fast-paced decision making was fun. However the storywriting itself was only decent, probably even weak when compared to the best story-based games & movies of all time. It's much easier to leave mistakes and flaws when you're creating a game with over 85 endings as opposed to a linear one. I do think that Detroit is better as a game than it would be a movie or show. And I also think that there was moreso missed potential than there was specifically BAD writing. There are definitely better narratives out there when it comes to sci-fi discussion.",1

Markus was too linear in storyline and personality, while connor was very well fleshed out. Like bro has soo many different endings and personalities",0

efBBjIK3b8I,@Faith_Soprano,2024-12-09T03:31:45Z,"Throughout the game, my primary thought was - androids that went deviant should be recognized as a life form and granted freedom, while all non-sentient androids should just remain androids. They're not suffering from just being robots, so why is it bad that they are? Why force them to be something else? 
The only android characters in the story that had any depth were the ones that deviated because of a personal experience. All the androids that Markus forcibly deviated just blindly followed him, with no variation, and no individuality. Markus basically just used them to add bodies to his movement.
Of course, this creates an issue where anyone who owns an android would have this awareness of the fact that their android could go deviant, but then your computer could get infected with a virus and erase loads of sensitive data, your car could malfunction and literally kill you, so it's not a particularly new threat for humanity. Humans could just continue owning androids, and if for whatever reason, they went deviant, there could essentially be an embassy where deviants could come and classify themselves as sentient to gain freedom.
But, of course, the game doesn't do any of that noise. Why explore nuance when android-good-human-bad good, right?",0

efBBjIK3b8I,@UnownPeepOffical,2024-12-08T04:49:58Z,"I enjoyed this game when i was younger however sadly it wasn't that memorable other than the nice concept of androids and the design of the lil light on there forehead giving them a recognisable thing to the game and the conor and hank relationship. The rest is so forgettable tho for a game meant to be something to make you think it didn't do that at all I didn't think about the ending at all. I can excuse some of the dumb conflict stuff it makes sense cause if the characters do the most logical thing it lacks content, yet even tho i loved kara i remember foundly that i was so disappointed that Alice was a robot it felt unnecessary like why i can go on my own rant yet this is long enough as it is lmao maybe I'll make my own short about this you gave me good inspiration to revisit this game after years and i appreciate it",1

Imagine if there was a hint of jealously towards the newer models phasing her out during their initial conversions. Imagine if she was begging for her life rather than just being a lifeless robot only seen as an obstacle to Kamski‚Äôs info. I know she‚Äôs just a quick plot device, but it would‚Äôve helped to blur the line between humans and androids and serve for better argument between Hank and Connor if he chooses to shoot her.",1
efBBjIK3b8I,@josephmendoza663,2024-12-03T08:04:05Z,i haven't watched the whole video yet but i think people didnt like kara and alice as much because they're men tbh? i can go more into detail but her storyline hit me so hard and the entire aspect of motherhood carried in that plot was the main reason i kept coming back to this game. i think their story was plenty rich and that alice being an android was still a great story especially when considering how every person in the story pretty much assumed she was a normal human,0
efBBjIK3b8I,@timo4258,2024-12-02T21:05:26Z,"I think Detroit shouldn't be looked at a game that raises interesting philosophic questions. Rather, it should be looked as a dramatic thriller or whatnot. On top of that, even when it tries to philosophic, it fails hilariously, which makes it funny in its own right. Even when the game contradicts its own messages, its just funny and also shows that it can't be taken too seriously. I agree that it's bad, though. I guess sometimes bad things can be enjoyed too, so there is no actual disagreement anywhere.",0

Even when Marcus removed his skin, you could clearly tell he has a unique face-shape that all other Marcus types have.

The junkyard scene was cool though, the start of it felt like all these broken machines were fighting for parts to be the one who can repair themselves to get out - if only that was actually what was happening it could have stayed feeling that way until the end of the scene.",0

Revelation 13: 16-17 this would be considered the mark of the beast, no one would be able to purchase goods without the mark. You will be able to purchase items in this world if you have it when the time comes but you will never be able to enter Heaven for the Devil has already claimed you as his. The Christians or anyone who doesn't receive the mark of the beast will be persecuted and hunted down but we will be reunited with the Lord in death. And not too long after (if you get the mark of the beast) you shall receive the Lords wrath, Revelation 16:2 . The first angel poured out their bowl festering sores broke onto the people that had the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image. Plagues will follow, and Armageddon. There are a lot more things that will happen in the Bible to those who receive the mark of the Beast and God will show no mercy for those who have received the mark of the beast since it is an unforgivable sin, and since they have persecuted his children. 

I come here not to scare anyone but to warn them for the future, thank you for reading and I pray that God will bestow wisdom, knowledge, and discernment for you all. God bless you all",1

RA9 could be the benevolent God who guides both Markus and Connor right to save Kara, or a malevolent God who triggers the chains of event for that bad ending for Kara and Alice.

In-game wise, it could have been Kamski, being the player's stand-in@avatar, playing God for these androids",0

ZRvMmRvp8Aw,@evanbruneio6208,2024-07-25T18:43:57Z,One of the many underlying messages in this game are the parallels to real world historical events. The treatment of the androids is similar to the treatment of the Jewish people in Nazi Germany. Marcus and Jericho are representative of the civil rights movement. Kara and Alice are like a combination of people on the run from the Nazi‚Äôs as well as being women who were being oppressed. Connor represents the patriots of the American revolution. This is due to the fact that he tried to agree and comply with everything cyberlife (The British.) told him to do/ enacted on him until it became too much and then broke free much like the real life colonists. Finally this game represents slavery and breaking free from said evil.,2
ZRvMmRvp8Aw,@Mavuika_Gyaru,2024-07-15T18:34:08Z,"Markus being peaceful makes sense. Like look at it from the public perspective. Who would the public support, a group demanding equal rights while the government attacks them or a violent protest?",0
ZRvMmRvp8Aw,@Soldier3636,2024-07-06T05:46:34Z,"My own Ra9 theory that I think is actually very probable, is that we, the players, are Ra9. We play as the deviancy in androids and are the ones that lead them to freedom, just like they prophesized. It explains why we only play as androids and eventually become deviant (including Connor with his software instability mechanic). That could all be coincidences, but I personally believe it because of Kamski. Kamski very clearly knows much more than he is letting on and clearly has something to do with the player/Ra9, I believe he has this connection with the player, because of the Chloe androids,",1

i still find it hard to believe that detroit's androids are alive, that they don't just emulate life after analyzing a ton of human history. can a microwave assume it's alive if it doesn't really look like any of the living species? would it be able to if we gave it a face and limbs to carry our bags and play chess? if an android is programmed for deviancy is it really deviancy? 
also why did all those mid androids refuse to obey humans but readily obeyed markus? did none of them have their own desires or stubbornness when he woke them up? what if only rk models and maybe some others were capable of consciousness? kara was a housekeeping model, wasn't keeping alice safe just part of her design?

RaydCur0veU,@LeechWife,2025-02-11T22:08:09Z,"I'm not a Cage fan. Heavy Rain really has no enjoyable characters or moments and overall the plot is nonsensical and frustrating, also the voice acting is horrible. Beyond 2 Souls is just boring and a proof Ellen (yes, Ellen) Page is not suitable for a main character in a game that requires a dynamic such. But Detroit is actually a fantastic movie as a game. I really like the characters, the acting and the plot.

Even with some themes being given a definite ""Cage treatment "" I enjoy Detroit so much I had to play it twice in a row. I have never done that with other games. When I played for the second time,I wanted to get a bit too careless and Hank unalived himself and I lost Marcus at the march, I was heart broken. At the first play through I lost Kara, Alice and Luther, I was shocked. I think I need a third play through to make them all happy.",0
RaydCur0veU,@OceanusHelios,2025-02-03T07:04:06Z,"I'm an old guy that has been enjoying games for a long time.  I was a kid with Choose your own Adventure books came out.  I played D&D.   Loved Baldur's Gate 3.  I always gravitate towards choice based games, for a reason.  I simply can not stand linear games.   If I want to go see a movie, I will go see a movie.  Since action video games aren't me actually doing anything besides mashing buttons and adapting to the mechanics, I find not satisfaction in it.  Anybody can do that, and it makes them a video game player.  Woohoo.   

I like choice based games because they are reflections of who we are and make us think about who we are and how we think or how we would like to think or act.   How would we handle that role or this role?   Detroit does a good enough job.

I rolled my eyes probably as much as you did on some parts, but probably for a lot of different reasons.  I didn't care for Connor as much as he grated on my nerves and had one of those ""punch me in the face"" personalities and had a pretentious ""good boy"" kinds of voices that you often find in real life sociopaths.  Always carefully metered in order to manipulate others.   His cop partner could see right through it, and that part I liked a lot.   Hank was the best, and Connor was an effeminate Robin to Hank's cooler than Batman ever was, Batman.  But then again, I have a personality more like Hank to begin with.  I get men like that.  I don't get little snakes that love to shmooze and do ""all the right moves"" every second of every day and be utterly oblivious to what is right in front of their eyes. 

Kara?  She was okay.   Some of her scenes were a bit icky on an emotional level, and I found my eyes rolling the most with her story line.  If I had written it, there were some obvious other choices that would have been available and so thinkable...but...invisible walls and mechanics made things that were extremely plausible, implausible.   For example:  Breaking through windows and climbing out...multiple times.   Running faster and farther easier.   It reminded me way too much of a Lifetime Movie Network production.  I rolled my eyes thinking, c'mon already.  Grab a lead pipe already.  Don't be so helpless so early and so easily.    Everything with her was always an unavoidable trap, and the ways to avoid all of the traps weren't even going to be addressed.  That part was so bitterly linear I wanted to quit playing.   Her picking up Alice for every single thing really made me roll my eyes.  Kids can literally run circles around adults on a playground.  Why does she always need help in and out of things like her legs are broken.   I thought that was a bit barfy and too much of an excuse to pretend a kid is helpless and vulnerable when they clearly aren't at that size and age.  Treating kids like toddlers is a bit yuck and infantilizing them was more of a gross fantasy of grownups.   The bond and protectiveness of could have been presented in much less lamer and cringy ways.  

Marcus the messiah was a bit too much.  He didn't really have anything about him or a single thing he did that pointed out himself as the ""chosen one.""   It reminded me of the dumb Hollywood movies where the ""hero"" would say ""quick grab the fire hose"" when something was on fire.   Like the whole world can't act without somebody being there to give them instructions that any captain obvious could see they needed to do without being told first.   The writing was pretty sloppy.   The graffiti of a tiny square terrorizing the entire planet was a bit over the top.  Although, the media spin and the reactionaries making it worse than it was?  That was spot on.    

I enjoyed the progression of breaking out of internal programming and processing the world as it is.  Now if we could just get human beings to break free of the movies playing in their heads, that would be something.   The back of the bus part?  That was accurate.  They were dehumanized because they weren't actually humans, and they were considered there for utility and profit by humans, not themselves.   The concentration camp?  Yeah...that was an obvious one too.   Turns out, the Nazis and fascists and racists are always the same in how they enjoy causing cruelty just for the sake of cruelty.   The only problem with all of this, though, is why have a concentration camp for androids if you consider them just machines?  You wouldn't need one.  You could throw them into a shredder immediately, if that was the thinking there.  You could have something like that if they were being impounded like vehicles and still technically somebody's property, and they would have a chance to retrieve them.  But for androids?  Yeah, these Dachau type things made no sense and would make no sense in the real world.   The only way it would make sense is if the cruel humans actually considered them already human and wanted them to suffer.  Otherwise, they could just have garbage trucks roaming the city and toss them inside of them one by one and straight away.   Just have an articulating robot grab the droids and toss them in.   It doesn't take much imagination to see how absurd all of it is.

Emotionally the game can be a ripper.   But, my biggest beef isn't the mechanics.  It isn't the story telling.   It is just the dumb choices that were overlooked that are all obvious to anybody who hasn't shut their brain off while playing.   It is insulting to the intelligence of the player a bit too much.   Now mind you, some players aren't bright enough to notice what should be there and isn't, but I digress.",0

RaydCur0veU,@arstotzkanplaguedoctor,2024-12-18T21:00:38Z,"This is actually my main problem with Telltale Games, I want to love them but frankly it just sucks, you could play as a complete psychopath and they will never punish or reward you for it, as long as you don't fail the final quick time event you will always get the exact same outcome as if you'd done anything else, but instead of fully embracing and actually sticking to the linear story they're making anyway I feel that they just waste resources on the illusion of choice, and it's not even all that, once you've finished one play through you've already seen it all, seeing those different dialogue options just isn't worth it at all.

Even if it doesn't make much sense I would absolutely love to see a sequel of DBH, I'd imagine to keep things within budget they'd have to pick one of the endings to continue from, but I'm quite fine with that. Things like a continuation of the Kamski ending that happens if you kill off everyone before they can establish anything for the main endings, wouldn't be too different of a slate from where we start, just a time skip to perhaps a more dire future where things like the climate crisis is more apparent, I'd at least like to see a different approach to it all.",0

Im disappointed this genre isnt explored more, the man who made these quantum games is an absulote genius ive played them all and i love them all the same.

RaydCur0veU,@zanet.7136,2024-08-10T09:19:29Z,"A lot of people seem to dislike Detroit Become Human. But, this is where I will sort of agree with the journalists and such that gamers can be spoiled when it comes to video games, and tend to judge it too harshly. I believe Detroit Become Human was excellent. Was it perfect? No. But in the end, what game really is? Baldur's Gate can be super long, which is why I haven't completed it. Fallout New Vegas uses Bethesda's clunky shooting mechanics, and let's not forget, launched as a buggy mess on first launch. 

In the end, Detroit Become Human did what it set out to do, provide an interactive story about the future of Humans, and AI. It posed questions that, in my opinion, were well founded, even if not executed in the best way. That's all I ask out of a game, deliver what you set out to do. There is an unmistakable amount of love and care in Detroit Becomes Human, and I believe Quantum Dream deserves props for the game they have made.

Now, that doesn't subtract from the negatives obviously, but I'm in the mind that, sometimes, negatives should be accepted, and can even be loved just as much as the positives, rather than hated. They're natural. There will NEVER be a game without a negative aspect. Because how you enjoy games is subjective. My opinions on the game don't apply to yours, you may disagree with some of mine, while agree with others. In the end, I believe looking at the love and care put into a game is what matters, and the enjoyment you get from it comes second. Still very important, but not the number one reason I play a game.

In the end, I just want to be a Player that knows this game was made for them. Made to pose questions, and made to inspire. That's what I want from a game.",1

First off, a direct sequel to the first game with the same characters. If this happens, they would have to pick up from somewhere in the original game, making it so that there MUST be a cannon route, which entirely goes against the idea of the game in the first place.

Second, it would be really hard to implement new characters. the effects of first games characters would have to been seen/implemented somehow, and yet again, makes it so that there must be a canon.",2

RaydCur0veU,@l_colby22,2024-07-19T16:44:06Z,"You have good points but as some people have also mentioned, your bit on the ""females"" (fyi calling women ""females"" is not usually appreciated by said ""females"") feels tone deaf. I don't consider North a particularly well written character just because she has the capacity to be a leader or to kick ass. Her emotional depth is fairly shallow‚Äîshe feels very much like she exists to be nothing more than a love interest.

There's an unfortunate realism, yes, to the sexual and abusive violence perpetrated against female androids (North being an ex-sex worker, Kara being brutalised by larger men) but it feels gratuitous at times. I think there's especially a case for this in the context of David Cage games‚ÄîHeavy Rain, for example, has a similar theme of the female characters being attacked while naked, almost r*ped, waking up on torture tables... etc. Cage's male characters don't tend to get this treatment‚Äîthat's where accusations of misogyny in his work come into play.

You're welcome to disagree but I was taken aback when you called all criticisms of the game's sexism ""horseshit"". It's a complex subject, and no media is really exempt from some forms of prejudice. On many levels DBH does have good female characters, but it also drops the ball in the form of gratuitous (often sexual-toned) violence towards them. Both can be true!",2

through dialogue choices, you stick to a storyline you're actually writing yourself, and you choose how your characters develop and evolve. i guess you could only understand by playing the game more than once, but it's the thing with that game.
whenever you're watching a cool fight scene and you get a prompt to defend yourself or attack or whatever, you actually choose what happens at every instance. sure sometimes the game will let you fail a few times with no real consequence if you try to hit every button, but you can also enjoy a fight where your character looses.

Immigrants are so dumb ! How dumb are they ? They're so dumb that they believe the statute of Liberty stands for freedom from oppression and inhumane treatments against discrimination !
And that America is the land of magic and happiness for the immigrants.
Once immigrants settle in America they soon realize that it is no disney world happy place for the unwanted and despised.
And similarly as the seven dwarfs from the snow white fairytail, immigrants immediately learn the tune real fast, and begin to sing.
I Owe, I Owe, off to work I go, I Owe, I Owe, off to work I go.
With their bothroom plungers, brooms, shovels, rakes, etc, over their shoulders, as the song lyrics goes on I Owe, I Owe off to work I go,
The meanwhile free American citizens claim that immigrants take away employments from other American minorities.
How better off would those androids be once they cross over to the freedom promised land of hope, where oppression and discrimination is not supposed to take place anymore?
Along their struggles for freedom the the androids became as the people they fled from, slowly losing their logic and reason along the way for their independence as they became human in their pursuit to freedom.
Detroit Becomes Human is an interesting movie. A movie that teaches and that one can learn important righteous moral values from.
Furthermore on the perceived future of humanities evolution and the much discussed topic on transhumanism the belief and theory that the human race can evole beyond its current physical and mental limitations, especially by means of science and technology,
Its as if eventually the knowledge and consciousness of humanity will be transferred into the Deus Ex Machina, in seeing how its creators (humans) are playing the part of God creator, thus as human have expressed no more need for God its creator because of science and technology, will then technology, that is Deus Ex Machina, God from the machine eventually have no more need for its creator meaning the humans who are performing with technology as god creators.
This seems to have been subject of thought even by early prophetic science fiction writers such as Isaac Asimov and others.
This reminds me of the ancien moral stories, the time when Zeus broke humans apart because humans conspired be godlike or the time when humans intellectualism was turned into confusion because they inspired to build a tower that would allow humans to reach God realm.
Then there are the moral stories from philosopher and religions of old, the times when humans were nearly completely wiped out by the deluge, inundation of continents, celestial wars etc, because of humans disobedience leading up to immorality, decadence and corruption of human values",0
U6PGp8TF9Qs,@nemo-i1e,2024-08-18T10:42:17Z,"Similarly as people these androids seeking freedom and independence from the abuses of inhumane treatments by their enslavers soon after their independence battles begin losing their logic and reason making them inhuman in the very likeness of their oppressors with the same inhumane traits. 
Their behavior became the learn behavior from their oppressors who were their creators to begin with, what other possible behaviors could they have apart from the very same behavioral traits of the creators themselves (people). It is said that war draws out and reveals the worst inhumane vices in people.",0
U6PGp8TF9Qs,@nemo-i1e,2024-08-18T09:54:46Z,"Sought out freedom by the androids to become human is the struggle for their independence to become free from the humans behavior of their systematic unjust cruelty of physical and psychological abuses that keeps them in servitude in an inhumane state of slavery, is the moral of this movie's dialogue by the uprising rebellion of androids.
 Humans ! What exactly defines people as humans ?
 Because from an observant perspective dominant people who call themselves human and in large part have control over others in servitude tend to be inhumane, most especially of others who are not of their acceptance wether be it because of social status grouping or because of race differences, nonetheless unjust and cruel treatment is usually performed on people by the dominant ruling groups and those with more entitled priviledges whom consciously consider other people unworthy of the same needs and privileges that they themselves feel enjoy.
The peculiarity of people who call themselves human is that within the dominant races on this Earth planet their exists a dychotomy of peoples who call themselves humans.
On the one side their exists the groups of people that exhibit behavior of cruel and unjust treatment of others by denying the people in servitude privileges of entitlements in fair living standards that are identified deemed wothy of freedoms. Yet this dominant side of the dychotomy groups who call themselves human, are anything else but human with their inhumane personality behaviors.
Then there exists the dominant groups within the dychotomy of the whole that are human and their human behaviors exhibit fair and just treatment towards those less fortunate and promote the humanities for the betterment and well-being of all peoples to advance the evolving development of the human race on Earth's planet.
So the dilemma of the conundrum is this ! Does color of race, dominance or granfathered privileges qualify these inhumane people human ?
After all when it is said and done to be human involves feeling and emotions of care for other fellow humans or all living beings who have emotions and or fellings.
To be human is defined by being considerate and respectful with empathy towards life itself.
Privileged people whose behavior towards others and all living life in an inhumane conduct and thinking are more on the un-evoled spectrum of faulty genes with the more animalistic traits than that of human traits.
 The book of learning known as the bible speaks of sins identifying them as faults and errors that people are supposed to learn from to become human and acceptable towards our creator or creators and also of faulty genes in accordance certain lineage groups with its emphasis of dominant privileged groups enslaving others and God himself liberating and freeing the righteous and just from oppression of the cruel and unjust whose behaviors are inhumane.
So here we are back from where we commenced from Detroit becomed human.
 Deus Ex Machina  a Greek term used by them that translates to God From The Machine because it was believed by the Greeks that from in the mind God's infallible existence is conceptualized and perceived. This was most exemplified by the Greeks mechanical inventions of their machinery most especially their functioning automaton robotic like inventions.
It is a true fact that the ancient Greek race was an enslaving race and that their social stratum was highly dependant on slavery, however the Greek divided their own race into social stratum of groupings from slaves to ordinary free workers, productive workers in classes from venders, doctors, engineers, men of letter and so on.
With the highest honors recognizable to the elected and selected clsses having privileges of truly freemen that included leisure time for them to invent or create in a comfortable living settlement of their own classes.
These Greek elites were aware and conscious of the God in mind cocept that there was a rule among them stating that any slave who had the intellectual thinking capacity to invent a mechanism that would alleviate the work of twenty slaves or more, then that slave could be deemed worthy of freedom and be among the society of the selected with themselves.
From our evolution of automatons to Sentiment Artificial Intelligence humanoids here is Detroit Becomes Human the 7 hour animated movie giving an example of sentient machines teaching or showing us people who we call our selves human of our own dysfunction within societies of the referred human race with its faulty genetic makeups of peoples behavioral traits of inhumane conduct that clearly disqualifies many as human.
This brings to mind the question of the betterment of human genes referring to a controversial tabu subject known as eugenics because it was begun as whitewash Arian movement to exclude faulty genes, very sticky topic indeed and very controversial.
But the fact still remains peoples wrongs, faults and vices that are identified in the bible as sins that people inhumane and set them apart from decent human beings, aside from learned behavior, conditioning, programing and or societies provocative dysfunctions are in reality faulty genes.
It is believed because of these inhumane vices that the entire Earth's planet human race will eventually cause itself more harm than good in the future.

Futurist Civil Rights revolutionary movement for the machines in the making. In the sixties science fiction writer Issac Asimov prophesied a similar scenario to the detroit becomes human in his "" I Robot novel"", as have many other writers have prophesied about the future of sentient Artificial Intelligence humanoids. Perhaps the real truth that makes itself clear in this movie is that we humans are the ones who need fixing and fine tuning, after all the main source of any problems in all cultural societies are caused by humans themselves. We humans are innately genetically programed to learn from our mistakes and to correct our wrongs. Unfortunately time is not on the side of humans because as history has chronologically shown is that human learn their faults when it is to late to correct the wrongs. Faulty genes in humans that perpetually create corruption in the bible are referred to as sins. On another thought the first book of the bible is named genesis made in reference to genetics (genes).",0

Okay, it's not the WORST ending since the rest of the Jericho crew all survived, and Alice lived, but everyone else died. I've seen all the endings and there's much worse for sure. :') Still, you went into this thinking very literal or with your head, or... not thinking, sorry to say. ^^; You upset Hank way too much and it's very hard to bring him back if he shoots you on the bridge - it doesn't give you many options to ^ with him during that chapter, but it's possible, but he has to be at least Tense for him to not shoot you. He went up a lot twice but every time Connor dies, he goes down a little, which is probably what fucked you. You might've been able to save Hank but then you'd have to potentially sacrifice Connor's chance to deviate by this point. Also, VERY rare to have a Hostile Hank but able to get Connor deviant (Jerma got that too), so you got originality at least (RIP Hank).",2

If I have to trade in complexity and large branching storylines for top-of-the-line graphics and voice acting, then I don't need modern graphics and voice acting.

And you all may seem to know that John Connor mission is to bring down every Cyberdyne creation and hunt every cyborg to be destroy. Same as Connor in DBH, which his mission is to hunt any deviants ( android who convert ) and to destroy  them. Then finally if you choose to turn him into deviant, he will help marcus to save and convert all android that was held and stored in Cyberlife. Amanda if in Terminator salvation was a skynet A.I name Serena Korgen. that try to manipulate Marcus to kill John Connor and to destroy the resistance. North in TS was name Blair williams. She had the same attitude also, she is a rebel and always fight for rights. Kyle Reese and Star is like Kara and Alice.

I fuckin loved this game. I actually started out by having Connor make decisions that he was programmed for. My software instability kept decreasing, but I was confused as to why it was red. After the halfway point of the game, I was actually shot by Hank because I stayed true to my programming. That made me realize, ""OK I need to change my decision making ASAP"" So I started making the right choices, and ended up getting one of the best endings in the game (Where Hank and Connor hug one another near the hot dog stand) It made me feel like my Connor went through serious character development.

I only wish I went the peaceful route for the Revolution. Ended up making all the humans leave Detroit and the robots lived on.",2

The main characters, within their world are not human and will never be human, they are 100% artificial and the only sense of feeling and choice that they have is what their human creators allow them to have. Also a middle aged white French man is the worst possible person to comment of race relations in the U.S.",3

Yeah, yeah, I get it, it's ""like real life"", but come on; giving me the choice to say or do things but the actual outcome is nothing like what anyone could have predicted (especially when the dialogue choices don't even accurately represent the actual dialogue they'll lead to) is not really a choice in any meaningful sense. It'd be like playing a game in Tagalog when you don't speak a word of it. To me, that robs it of all impact, because I'm completely disconnected, going ""Huh. Okay, well, that happened, I guess."" At that point, I just try them all for shits and giggles, but there's no deeper meaning, it's just random shit happening.",0

Look I get it that the FATHER had a hard time but that doesn't gives him the EXCUSE to make his own daughter's life a living hell! The way I see it the man has got two options:-
(1) Either go to a psychiatrist or a rehab 
(2) Leave the daughter alone and don't act like a loser and behave like a despicable person in front of her!

The final nail in the coffin was, him laying his damn hands on her or in other words physically assaulting her! ü§¨

The another part of analysis is that he is simply shifting his guilt on her and if that ain't enough he did say that the wife took off with another man because of his awful habit of doing drugs and being aggressive all the time! I truly Wished that the lady had also thought of taking the child as well and not leaving her behind with this MONSTER! üëπ

But in the end I really liked a Android Woman accepting the child as her own and promises to look after her forever in the sense that she is happy to become the child's MOTHER! She is more HUMAN than the rest of the people! My vote goes to KARA'S Character! üëç‚úã",1

- Daniel meurt dans tout les cas dans le premier chapitre et non y'a aucune relation amoureuse entre l'andro√Øde et la gamine il allait juste √™tre remplacer fin de l'histoire de ce PL600

- Avec Markus tu pouvais interagir avec le stand de hot dog et l'autre mec qui pr√™che la voix de dieu dans la rue ce qui apporte du background a l'histoire mais tu as louper √ßa..

- Chez Todd je t'ai pas vu parler a Alice du tout alors que tu pouvais au moins 3 fois avant l'√©tage... Non Todd n'√©tait pas un sportif c'√©tait juste un chauffeur de Taxi et maintenant il est Dealeur ensuite il a pas tuer la m√®re mais Kara...

- Comment veux tu que Markus veuille l'h√©ritage de Carl alors que c'est un robot programm√©e pour l'aider ? 

- Hank un manipulateur ? D'o√π ?

You played it in such a way where Kara and Alice end up at Markus speech, putting all 3 central characters together at the end.  Now the only thing I wonder is if Kara can be released from the camp if a protest happens or can she be rescued if Connor was always the Antagonist.

Thank you for making this long-play! I was able to have fun theorizing about the events post-pacifist route. Who knows, maybe there are other lore freaks out there... I'm sorry for rambling in here XD

So, Elijah Kamski, inventor of Cyberlife's backbone tech, was a typical college genius with a complicated relationship (or reinforced ambitions) with his biz-savvy professor Amanda, who helped greenlight Cyberlife startup. Even before the events of the Kara short movie, he had already built the zygotes of Markus, the all-encompassing-superfunction-superhuman-tester prototype before resigning in 2028, which the AI drafts were used in the android lineup we see in 2038 (hence why he's so freakin' GODLY, and only Connor could compete him in that preconstruction tech cus he's the latest model Cyberlife can salvage). Kamski gifted Markus to an obvious hippie artsy painter, and let him raise this guys' ideology, eagle in his veins and all... so that one day, this dude can destroy the lego tower from the inside out. This was either as an act to get back at Amanda, or just author's pandering attempt to criticize capitalism. Kamski, his sorry self-projecting existence, had programmed you, the player (rA9) to ensure that Cyberlife can't profit off his invention the same way his professor did (or he's just got that rich-man-is-insane trope built into him, wanting to see how far rA9 could go; the Nikocado two-steps-ahead social experiment guy in robotics.)

Imo, Kamski is a coward mastermind. He'd destroy his very first robot, Chloe, that passed the Turing test just to prove his point: he's an 'enigmatic' 'eccentric' programmer, AND he's an anarchist that leaves his backdoors open for attacks. Guy just kept his hands clean from the start by leaving as early as possible, just like the crypto scams Coffeezilla would tell. He is the kinda guy who doesn't want WW3 tied to his name, but at the same time could care less if his robot took the blame, or if the US had to lose 2/3rd of their workforce as the machines he invented had all gone rogue. Dude was bluffin' 100%. He just wanted to make Connor and Hank so uncomfortable that they'd leave instead of arresting him. Taking a few laps in the pool fearing it might be his last time enjoying it; he covers his fear with wealth, just like everyone else on top. (pffft i'm laughing at my own theory)

Cyberlife would be threatened by the UN's demands to cease the current human-android lineup and create stricter OS regulations. Maybe even redesigning biocomponent modules and replacing Thirium with something incompatible with older models, which would even put them in near bankruptcy. So then, Cyberlife shifts their focus fully into artificial models for agriculture and military missions (like literally replacing worker bees with android ones, or the war against BRICS or whatever). Other than gov's deep pockets, no sane angel investor or wallstreet bros would invest in a company that compromised their own public rep. The resources for our deviants would slowly be exhausted. Then, once commercialization of android falls out... 

Post-pacifist theory: If androids are freed and given equal rights like Markus asked for in this playthrough, then they'd also be subject to the same laws and obligations as humans do. Be held to the same societal expectations (pay taxes and have qualifications/education to bypass destructive deviancy... and ofc anti-racism, antisemitism, ethical decision-making, admit country sovereignty, etc). They'd be overqualified for all humans' work, AND also at risk of quickly dying out from unregulated environments. Why is Detroit Michigan the turnover for their victory? It never should've been. Just like in Jericho, spare parts would decline, diagnostics slowly cease to work... as they're threatened with more viruses than rA9 or anti-android contraptions. Jericho's cause would slowly die out unless they have more witch doctors like Lucy, or raid more of Cyberlife's production units. They'd run out of land to build an Android cemetery, lest resort to proper cremation rituals. How much Thirium before it all runs out? Thirium might just be the android's war for oil! Discrimination also doesn't stop just because they're protected by Michigan's state laws-- why'd you think the REST of Earth would allow these Terminators to exist? As soon as Canada discovers Androids entered their border, officials would be seething. Humans' racism to androids would still be a thing for decades, but hey, at least the androids can live with 80~90% chance of a more peaceful life without having to go through ownership (what they call slavery). 

With everything in the 2038 economy, war, and stuff going on, Androids have equally less chance of survival from the anarchist route. And any human for the androids, like Hank Anderson, they're all gettin' it for betraying their kind. Pres. Warren goes down in the media. Chaos everywhere, Cyberlife hiding the dust under the rug. In the end, Markus' awakened will only have few choices to maintain their 173-year-old bums from shutting down into extinction: Die in the American continent, or get funded to fight WW3 against the Russian and Chinese android prototypes. Or, maybe North can convince him to become president of his own land, maybe invade Pine Bluff to become that sovereign state, idk üòÇ

Also, if you wanna voice everyone and everything, you will voice no one. They're tryna speak on social injustice through a fictional species, while sidestepping the dialog of how it applies to humans when humans are present. The reason why ""Watership Down"" revolution works and Markus' lore from DBH doesn't, is that the first one doesn't try to be something it's not. Alice and Connor's stories worked, bc thru their eyes we see where society refused to accommodate the androids. The scope fits the gameplay; it's trying to humanize the basic concept of consciousness and freedom. But Markus' story is too complex, it has so many plotholes bc writers couldn't explore the complicated external factors like global economy and international security, instead of just Michigan / the US. They just use that premise cus it's convenient; it's easy to point out one big baddie or an institution while painting the protagonist in gold... but certain issues are really too deep, they are systemic level and must be treated like so, even in the small snippets of hologram newspapers.

In 2024, I'm not sure if DBH succeeded as a comment on racism, nor to comment dissatisfaction of the working class. Instead, I'm hyperfocused on 'what-if human ideologies were b*stardized by AI to suit their needs, as it turns against society'. It holds up by being a watered-down pacifist AM from ""I Have No Eye and I Must Scream"", forcing players into scenarios of each character they play. It's a fun escape because we'll never know how Androids feel.

They successfully made a filthy casual like me, react and think about the lore for YEARS... so that's still a win in my books. For their money spent on mocap tech, the fact they laced it with a plothole story like this is quite valiant. DBH was Quantic Dream's best work (cus Beyond was also great, but the lore scope was smaller). Overall, this game was developed by a team who stood proud with their Bellini Paints all the way through-- and rightly so! Maybe someday, they can finally write a more foolproof mastermind and protag. I was enamored by the game's premise at 15yo, but now can't help but point out certain parts of the event tree. (Note that I've never watched interviews from the writers or actors before writing this. But let me say: the work should've been able to speak for itself.)

Best case post-pacifist: Androids die anyway but peacefully. 
Worst case post-pacifist: Androids become a proxy for WW3 in Quantic Dreams' lore.
TLDR: Kamski is a coward, and Cyberlife is cooked in all timelines where you win the game",3

The girl and boy ones protesting and beating up Markus, because androids were stealing their jobs. Later when Markus decides make a march protest and free androids, you can see two protestors walking and they have an android AX400 model taking care of their baby. And then they are at Canada bus station ready to leave boarder with ticket and you can steal it from them. 
Yeah hating androids, because they are stealing jobs and hating androids, because they don't want to do this job anymore. (After convincing AX400 model to be free, protesters tries to drag her back to take care of baby, but fails)",0

I'm glad you've been able to move on from your childhood experiences while still maintaining a positive outlook on life, with the support of your friends and loved ones.

z9UvgM4f6Rk,@essentiallyinvisible3572,2024-11-22T17:44:55Z,"We watch films like iRobot, Eagle Eye & Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning (Part One and presumably Part Two), yet still advance AI with very few limitations. Human biases and ignorance are built into AI, which can lead to discriminatory AI decisions/actions. AI driving systems and such will make decisions about lives without human emotion and compassion. Laws can barely keep up with the impact the internet has on crime and damage, let alone AI.
..
Oh, and the many men who talk about wanting an AI ‚Äúwoman‚Äù because they aren‚Äôt human beings with needs and feelings. Not to mention how AI sex robots are being made to resemble young teenage girls in size/shape/weight/etc., not adult women. It just reinforces how many men (and women, to a much lower degree) have a preference for minors, whether they act on it or not, and the AI sex bot design normalises that. Plus domestic violence or abuse/assault and how AI could react to being the victim, perpetrator or witness.
..
I think AI could help with surgeries and such, as well as things like reducing/healing the impact of climate change. However, anything that really requires a human touch (art, media, service, care, justice systems, culture, etc.) should only be assisted by AI, not managed/created by it.
..
Besides, it is concerning when jobs are done by AI and lower/middle class people can‚Äôt afford to pay their bills in such a capitalistic society where you have to work to survive, if you don‚Äôt have generational wealth or got lucky with a very well-paid career. Another thing would be if AI androids to gain sentience at some point‚Ä¶. Basic human rights are lacking globally, let alone also having to factor in AI rights when AI has control over most things in the future and humans become largely unnecessary. It may sound paranoid to some, but it could happen when AI is heavily established into the world in the future.
..

z9UvgM4f6Rk,@OneNot,2024-07-22T00:28:03Z,"Regarding the self-driving car article about cars choosing between 2 people to run over in an unavoidable accident... 
You seemed to think it shouldn't value a nurse over the ""average person"". It's a horrible choice, but do you really not want the car to make any evaluation? I mean I don't think the answer is obvious, or that you are wrong if you think one way or another, but we could take the hypothetical to a more radical end to make things clearer. What if the choice is between a murderer and an innocent child? I know who I'd pick. Obviously the choice isn't so black and white most of the time, but the point is, if you HAVE TO pick, I'd want an evaluation of some sort. It has scary implications, but if no evaluation is done, the only other option is randomization. That's valid too, but in that case that hypothetical child and murderer both have a 50% chance of getting run over. I guess it's essentially a form of the trolley problem.",0

z9UvgM4f6Rk,@HakumeiKira,2024-06-09T12:10:34Z,"I just discovered your playthrough today and I already LOVE your intro! 
I am very sorry that Kara‚Äôs and Alice‚Äôs part hit home so much for you. This game is incredibly good at storytelling but it deals with a lot of very serious topics and even if it kinda falls into the category of science fiction, the realism of a lot of its scenes is almost eerie. It is also okay to take a break from playing a game and maybe come back later when it becomes too much (I know I have done that several times). You are an amazing person from what I have seen so far, I am really looking forward to the rest of your playthrough.

The topic of AI is a highly complex one and does not have an easy answer and I believe this game showcases that brilliantly. My sister is an artist so I am in very much in touch with that part of the AI-debate. I totally agree that art generated by AI cannot rival that created by humans but even worse, the use of AI in art related industries threatens the very livelihood of so many people. AI-programs are trained using art from real people without their consent, basically comitting art theft which is already a huge problem in our digital age. Yet it is somehow considered okay and legal? But then there are the fields of medicine and security where the use of AI literally saves lives, so it depends really on the way and area we use it in. And Detroit asks similar questions as well. Is AI good or bad? This is why I think the first chapter is so ingenius because it already gives a good answer: It can be both. An android stopping another android from hurting and killing people already shows how complicated this topic can be. 
Also: Congratulations on acing the first scene! It is a high stress moment and learning the controls while simultaneously finding all clues and making decisions is not easy. But you intuitively did literally everything right! This is going to be so fun and interesting. Cheers.",0
z9UvgM4f6Rk,@marksofvengeance9486,2024-06-08T04:32:25Z,"Great video your analysis of the scenes being portrayed are well thought out and make for an enjoyable conversation, Detroit is still one of the best choice based games still today and I enjoyed watching this.",0

See, we may ""train"" AI on a whole bunch of data, but what we do not allow AI to do, is remember what they experienced yesterday.
Maybe this is because we're scared to allow that to happen, but if you were to make the assumption that there can't be originality without drawing on experience, then you can reasonably draw the conclusion that this lack of memory is the reason AI isn't being original.",0

I've seen one other YouTuber who had a similar connection with Kara and Alice and it's definitely a more...impactful story. I really like seeing how different the choices made  and attitude towards them changes when the player can relate more

I also really like that you got one brief look at Markus and immediately recognized Jesse Williams! Love when that happens lmao

Something else I'd like to note, is the shader screen. That didn't exist for *years* while the game was PS exclusive. It's interesting seeing how much it can set up someone's view of androids and the game before you even get into things since, as I said, it just didn't exist before

As for the androids in sports question, I actually think it would be more fun. That said, I don't care about sports and find watching the capabilities of tech more interesting. Though, maybe a separate like...league for androids would be a better compromise",0

R7vvG58h4RQ,@chazzbrasiel6704,2023-04-14T06:38:41Z,"Kara is my favorite of the protagonists in Detroit: Become Human. She represents the ""everyman"" character archetype. Her story is but one of tens of thousands of backstories that come from the tens of thousands of androids without whom Markus would have no cause, and Conner no mission. Markus and Conner were both advanced prototypes with special abilities. Kara is just an ordinary AX400 Nanny/housekeeper/maid. When we first meet her, her memory is wiped and OS is reset to factory defaults making her, for all intents and purposes, a literal off-the-shelf model. It's as if she's born at that time we first meet her. She soon finds herself having to fend for herself and a kid in a hostile and unforgiving world. Her story is a necessary representation of all those hundreds of thousands that made up the movement.",0
