Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-26,"thought i was getting a fun cowboy game. instead, i got an emotional masterpiece that set my gaming standards to an unreachable level. thanks, rockstar i guess. now no other game feels good enough. 1010"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-21,"b this game is perfect from the getgo to the last scene. i got 100 completion, and it was worth every minute spent b at the beginning of the game, arthur is a tough cowboy, an outlaw through and through. but as the story goes on, he starts looking at his life from a different angle because of certain circumstances those whove played know what i mean ive watched a lot of rdr2 cast panels, and only roger clark arthur morgans actor had been working on the game for five years straight, which is incredible!"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-23,"the best narrative game i've ever played, a perfect prequel and an amazing experience. took me 94 hours to finish and i didn't even play all available side content."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-12,"this is, without a doubt, one of the alltime greatest storydriven games i have ever laid my hands on. i've played a bunch of them and let me tell you that this one will take you on a ride that you wouldn't want to miss. it starts slowly, which may put off some people, but it quickly picks up after the snowy region. the map is huge, full of secrets and treasures. there are over 200 species of animals combined. the weapon variety is also impressive. there are many minigames to choose from. every character in the camp is complex enough to make you care and sympathize with them. some side missions can feel like the main storyline at several points. the world scenery and game mechanics are just incredible. all of this is amazing and already over the top for a game, but the primary protagonist you control takes the cake. arthur morgan is one of the bestwritten characters in all rpgs. he is a deeply flawed man who made some pretty rough decisions in his life. since he is a teen, who takes an example from his outlaw father, to the time when he is found by the gang, he goes against the newly emerging societal norms in the wild west. but most of all, he always believes in dutch and the gang. he does everything for them  he lives, he murders, he robs. and when this is put to the ultimate test, against the clock, his true redemption begins. you will find that behind this immaculately strong personality, there is a scared man. of what he is, of what he will become. after this point, you will begin to realize what i'm talking about and why arthur is so loved by the entire community. he is not perfect, no one is. but he tries his best. take your time to experience this game. once you finish it, there won't be a second playthrough like the first."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-24,"genuine masterpiece, unforgettable. this is a game i got completely and totally lost in, i fell in love with the world and the characters and the beautiful way it uses the gameplay to reinforce the narrative. the soundtrack is so phenomenal, and the writing is actually perfect. genuinely several of the best gaming moments of all time are in this game. the ride back after guarma i will never forget. arthur morgan is the best video game character of all time, hands down. the way the game makes you sit with him and shows you how he feels both through writing, gameplay and missions is genuinely a marvel and i don't think i'll quite play or experience anything like this ever again. it took me a while to get into it, the start is slow and feels a little aimless at first. my girlfriend recommended i push on with it and i am so glad i did. the best game i have played in my life, bar none. the story told here could not be done in any other medium, this is what a big aaa game is meant to be. genuinely inspiring and i can only pray i'll play something half as impactful as this again."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-21,"rdr2 is an incredibly immersive wild wild west experience, drawing players into its richly detailed world. every aspect feels so alive. looking forward to gta6 with same level of quality and attention to detail.  coming from epic i was able to transfer all my progress to steam."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-05,"unfortunately, i can no longer play this game due to login issues with the rockstar launcher. out of nowhere, rockstar required me to verify an unfamiliar email on their launcher. despite multiple backandforth messages, they have been unable to resolve the issue. bewarethe game works fine until it suddenly doesnt, all because of problems with the rockstar launcher. i am hoping that steam will get rid of this third party launcher applications soon."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,"i've been playing this game very slowly as if i were arthur, each day going out doing a little quest, hunting, gambling etc... taking each and every second slowly as it comes. a fantastic offline single player escape."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-13,"best western game ever maden, without doubts. i haven't played much online, i was focused on story. loved characters, van der linde gang, too many missions and side quests of camp or random characters made me fully immerse into wild west life. besides huge open world with different amazing locations makes satisfaction when you simply riding the horse. at first it reminds about gta cuz both games are from rockstar, but for me it's more similar to mafia series where story is more important part of game."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-15,"great game. entirely ruined by rockstar launcher, even in story mode"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,"not able to play this game, since my steam account is linked to the rockstar account, which is using my old email address and i'm unable to reset that, customer service didn't do me any good either, so i had to refund the game. i know it's a great game, but i'm just not able to play it so no can do"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,"best game ever made. blind buy. do not wait for a sale. length 35 hours. the only con is that there is a lot of horseback commutation but it gets compensated for by the beautiful scenery and graphics. 1010, highly recommended."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-17,"amazing story with some impactful choices, amazing characters  amazing stylevibes. the gameplay is quite slow  very deliberate but it commits to the bit so much that i respect it even if it's frustrating at times mods really help with it tho. you are a good man arthur morgan"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,"i really enjoyed this game. the story was good a little slow at times though. i love how this game looks and all the realism, you really feel like your a cowboy. i can't get enough of just riding around and enjoying the view!"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-03,"truly one of the most immersive games i have ever played. the story is simple, like a crescendo to catastrophe, yet the characters even npcs are almost as complex as real people, with each carrying their own burdens, stories, and flaws. their interactions feel deeply human, and your choices will have consequences. the world in red dead 2 is astonishingly beautiful, almost close to real life, and the graphics are equivalent to, if not, better than the current aaa games' standards. the only bug i noticed is when you're riding a horse, sometimes the movement gets messed up when you switch from first person to 3rd person. but other than that, it is a masterpiece."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-01,"this game is literally a fever dream of cowboy romanticism. riding through dusty sunlit walleys, listening to a harmonica at a sundown, purple skies, storms, distant flickers of lanters, winds through threes, this world breathes on its own. so many times i felt like i'm not the main character, but the whole world is. rockstar really knows how to make games feel alive. everything feels slow, it's not type of game that holds your hand, things just happen, and when you start caring and being involved you realise it's not only about the story, it's about the whole idea of the west. moments where you realise all characters have their own lives, you see struggles in them, things unfold with or without you. every single town, every road, all feels so so real. and what hurts is the realty that time changes people, and you loose those same people. i love the idea that every choise that you make is somewhat heavy, not because the game is like ''this will affect the story in this way or that way'', but because you constantly wrestle with who you are and who you could be, because you're an outlaw, and sadly halfway through the game i realized you don't try to save west, you kinda witness it's funeral, and your journey isn't just a personal one, you just witness an era that was actually never ment to last. gangs fall apart, dreams collapse, people go and west fades as well. for me, red dead 2 is flawed, messy, slow,stubborn, but thats the point, just like people and times it portrays, and that's what makes it a masterpiece. hands down the best game i played in my life."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,"for reasons unknown, you have to use the rockstar launcher to play this game and it's a coin toss whether or not the launcher will work. there's no way to play the single player part of this game without being able to connect to the rockstar social side of things for some damn reason. i have absolutely no desire whatsoever to play games with a bunch of people online. i play video games so i can not be around people. why the fuck can't i play this game without being connected to some stupid social club bullshit that i have no interest in? i don't regret buying this game, the short time i was able to play it was fun but for fuck's sake, don't make me have to be a part of some social club for a single player game. i expected better from rockstar."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-19,"one of the greatest games i have ever played, intriguing story, fun gameplay, and a bittersweet ending. a true masterpiece."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,this game is like if if you go to the beach and it is sunny and nice and the the drinks are so cold that your hands get cold and all your freinds are happy your there. but there is one rat there witch makes you sooooo happy of this game
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,"pretty good, basically horsey riding simulator, with a little bit of action."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-17,rockstar and their stupid sign in bs is infuriating. why should i have to sign in to 4 different logins just to play a game offline by myself? what happened to buying a game and then getting to play that game? i refuse to play game that does this crap. if rockstar wants to make playing their games difficult then i wont bother playing.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-17,"great pacing, feeling like im connecting with nature, even tho im rotting in my room"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,"story mode is amazing, but online mode can not be played enjoyably due to all the hackers."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,"giving rockstar's red dead redemption ii all the love it can get because damn what a masterpiece is this. at the moment of writing this review, i'm only 2 hours into the game, yet it feels like a much longer but so wonderful yourney. this is a must have for everyone who loves beautiful graphics, story and characters."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,"this game is on a different level than the others. because it is much more beautiful, more realistic and the story is perfect. i recommend this game to everyone."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,"got nostalgic and decided to play the game for the first time this year. i press shifttab to open the steam overlay and see that i have been in the game for 7 minutes. 7 minutes and i had already met a fucking modder. the story mode is a masterpiece, but the online part of the game is unplayable. get your shit together rockstar. and just to be clear, the modders were also the reason i had not played in a while. so it is not just that i got unlucky once and am basing my review on one experience. this has been going on for way too long."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-15,i came across the kkk holding a promotion ritual of sort where they light a cross on fire. the fire spread to some of the hooded members and they started running around screaming in agony as i watched it happen on the sideline. after some of them had burned to death i told the blackhooded leader that they had it coming and the game rewarded me with honor. 65 would watch kkk members burn to death again and tell them that it was karma.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-14,"red dead redemption 2  a masterpiece with dark sides the story of red dead redemption 2 is absolutely breathtaking. arthur morgans journey through the wild west is one of the best narratives ive ever experienced in a video game. the characters are deep, the dialogue feels authentic, and the atmosphere is so rich that you truly feel transported back to that harsh era. the graphics are stunning  whether youre riding through snowy mountains or getting lost in the swamps of lemoyne, everything looks incredible. its especially impressive that rockstar used reallife locations as inspiration. on top of that, there are countless easter eggs that make the world feel even more alive. but unfortunately, the fun ends as soon as you step into the online mode. rockstar has completely abandoned it. the servers are a disaster, crashes happen constantly, and when you do manage to get into a lobby, theyre often full of modders who take the fun out of everything. prime rewards? forget it  you just dont get them. it feels like rockstar has given up on the online mode entirely and couldnt care less about the community. on top of that, some gameplay decisions are pretty questionable. the horse handling is overly realistic, sure immersion is great, but when you go flying over the reins every time you hit a tiny rock, it gets frustrating. especially compared to the first game, a lot of things feel unnecessarily clunky, even though rdr1 already nailed so much of the gameplay. rdr2 is an absolute must for story lovers and western fans but if youre looking for online action, youre better off playing something else. i can only recommend it for the story only."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-14,do i really need to explain to you why you should buy this game? as of writing its on spring sale for 15. quit reading my damn gibberish and buy the game. you wont regret it and itll be one of the best purchases youve ever made. hands down despite my hours on steam i can tell you this much this game was made with passion and love that you really dont see with modern games nowadays it has the best story im sure weve all heard of it by now and if you havent an even better reason to buy the game. a superb soundtrack seriously if you havent at least heard one song from rdr2 even without knowing the game id be surprised tight and amazing gameplay an amazing and wild setting well written and deep characters fun easter eggs and a boat load more no not the boat that will get us to tahiti boy! anyways do yourself a damn favour and buy this game. its worth every dime
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-13,"probably the best story in all of fiction, very interactive with its environment and characters. like able main casts. arthur morgan is goated, his redemption arc is defined with the color red"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-12,this game is cool but the online so many modder
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-08,"man oh man, where do i even begin. i finally decided to play this game in 2025 for the first time and after completing the main story, i can say it's easily the best game i've ever played. in fact, i don't think there's a lot of games out there right now that even comes close to the quality of this masterpiece. the main story is captivating, emotional and unpredictable, even the side quests are enjoyable and never feel like a filler. the visuals, despite being released in 2019, still looks better than many newer games. most games often struggle to make you remember names or care about the ingame characters, but this one does it effortlessly. the voice acting is exceptional, capturing the emotions and bringing the characters to life. overall, this game is an easy 1010. it's a complete, immersive experience that sets a new high benchmark for my gaming standard."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-04,"easily the greatest story game ever made by mankind. such amazing designs of nature, buildings, characters etc. the story is filled with details that you will most definitely not notice during your first playthrough. i find this great as your second time playing through the story will be as much fun if not more fun than your first time. i usually get a ton of bugs when i play other games, but red dead redemption 2, no. the game runs smoothly and doesn't ever feel boring. the world, though very much just filled with nature still feels so alive. it feels so open and full of life. you can interact with everyone and stumble upon different situations out of nowhere. your decisions really matter to the game, as you have a honor system that follows every move you make. the npcs are really great and unique. other games like gta v has npcs that feel repetetive and boring, as you can't really do much with them. this game really makes the npcs not feel that robotic, something that you will come to enjoy. now back to the story. the side characters are absolutely amazing. i have played through the story mode of gta v and i find the difference between characters there and here to be huge, in the matter of fact, it's almost laughable. the characters in red dead are filled with personality and are so interesting. they all have their unique background while also seeming relatable. the characters are so great in fact that you feel personally tied to them, and their emotions really gets to you. the missions are also quite fun and really does fit the typical scene of rockstar games. all them years i went not knowing much about red dead, as i never play story games, but after thousands of reccomendations from friends, i finally gave it a try. i can confidently say that it is an amazing game that everyone should try. my review alone is probably missing a 100 different things that also makes this game so great. and for the love of god please don't get your whole social media filled with red dead 2 videos while playing through the game for the first time, as you will most likely get spoiled, something that is not fun. enjoy"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-04,"if you're a person who is looking for a game that has deep story, beautiful graphics and some funny moments, i would really recommend rdr2."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-03,ohh i can't explain how good is this if you think this western thing in games it's a problem try this yourself i has so good graphics and the graphics are literally perfect and the psychics are soo good it's like real life try the game yourself and you will see...
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-02,"the story is fire. the graphics are also fire. but man the realisem of this game is crazy, like i dont know any other game with this amount of realisem. just look at the wildlife or the hydrology of this game, you can follow every little stream and have a meaningful connection to a bigger river, there are even dried up waterbeds and rivers where water once flowed and carved into the landscape but its dried up now, how cool is that? would definitely recommend it."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-01,"awesome game! the story and for that sake the world is definitely slower paced, so it won't be for everyone. it's very easy to sink 100200 hours plus on the story alone."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,"this game is, by far, my favourite game of all time. nothing will ever top it for me and i will recommend it to everyone who asks. however, it does have an incredibly frustrating habit of crashing as soon as i load it up every now and then last time it did this was 8mo ago, leading me to uninstall it  then redownload it... which takes 12hrs for me. very annoying but not enough to stop me from loving it"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,"i have had this game for a year and 5 months and have 271 hours on it, i can start by saying it is my favorite game. if you are not convinced if you should buy it or not, let me help you. i will be sharing my points of view on the story, online play, graphics, and some experiences. first of all, the story of the game may seem long at first, try not to skip through it and don't get spoiled. take your time to enjoy it at it's fullest. my mistake was trying to finish it as fast as possible. i only did the main quests and did not focus on the secondary ones. the story is well thought and each action has an impact on it. it can be very random at times but that's what is interesting. the more you spend time in story mode the more you get attached to the characters and are really brought in the universe. the whole plot is so captivating. secondly, online play. at the start it can seem very confusing, it was for me. when i started i had spawned in a forest and had no idea what to do, i stole a horse and ended up in valentine where i instantly got killed. that made me go back to story mode and i came back to online after 5 months. make sure to use a vpn if you do not want people to see where you are. people cannot access your ip address unless they are modding the game. most servers have at least a modder in them. most of the modders are just trying to ruin other's gaming experience by using diverse weird actions like making your horse shoot fire out of it's a or simply just crashing your game. but some modders can be nice and leave you in peace. once you are advanced in online it may become boring but the character costumisation can be fun. you can join a posse and fight another one. there's lot's of events in which you can participate in. there's roles which you can develop and get rewards . or you can just join a huge fight in valentine. the graphics are amazing, especially if you take in account that the game was released in 2019. even if you run the game in optimal, you get to benefit of great graphics and a beautiful scenery. sometimes i just like to stand somewhere and enjoy the views i should probably be doing this in real life. the graphics bring the game such realism which makes the gaming experience wonderful. in story mode it just makes it even more great than it already is. i have met a lot of great people through this game, even if the ages can be very different everyone just gets along. probably one of my best gaming experiences was to integrate a group of red dead redemption players which has only last for some months but it was the funnest times. so many of our inside jokes have stuck to me and i would like to thank them for the times together. i definitely recommend this game, hope this helps!"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,"i only play it for the horses and have it modded to be more as a horse gamehorseback riding simulator, and i absolute love it. the world is so incredible beautiful, it's insane. very much recommended! httpsyoutu.be1qip6ne2wni?sivlghz3636p0opfr"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,"red dead redemption is nothing short of a masterpiece!!! from the moment i started playing, i was completely immersed into its world. its emotional, powerful, and deeply human every choice feels meaningful, every moment feels earned. rockstar has created a world so rich and alive, you can't help but get lost in it. the landscapes are jawdroppingly gorgeous, the characters are unforgettable, and the music lingers long after youve put the controller down. this game isnt just a game... its an experience, a true work of art. red dead redemption is, without a doubt, one of the greatest games ever made. i can't stop thinking about it. simply incredible! now waiting on rdr3!!! rockstargames rockstargames rockstargames"

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-06,"i absolutely love this game. not only is it beautifully made, but the characters main plot and npcs have immense depth and detail to them. arthur morgan is a fantastic protagonist who is morally grey, but still manages to win the hearts of every gamer who picks up this game. highly highly recommend!"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-27,"the experience that red dead redemption offers feels natural. the environment feels like the the midwest, and further more what was happening in the late 1800s. to me, red dead is an eye opening experience that gives us a peek into what life was during this period. the story itself is a genuine masterpiece and it speaks on the themes of brotherhood, family and most importantly faith! all of the characters are so well fleshed out and if you take your time through this game you will see so much and hear so much. it is an immersive experience like no other, because i really did feel like i was a part of the van der linde gang. as you play this game and you start looking up videos concerning this game expect to be brought into a whole world of memes and mangos! enjoy this game for what it is, an immersive experience. some people may not like this game because of how slow it feels and even how the fast travel system works, but that really is what makes this game so different. it's meant to feel a little more slow paced, and really more of an escape. i mean, we have the option to go hunting, fishing, starting random fights after drinking it up at the saloon. keep that in mind, and i can promise that this game will 100 deliver a more than satisfactory experience. as far as modding goes, this game has been out for a while, and you can mod the hell out this game. i've seen gameplay of people driving sports cars and all sorts of cursed shenanigans. however, i recommend at least one full play through without mods, really get a taste of what the developers at rockstar were cooking up. this game deserves a 1210 for just how incredible it was. thank you for taking the time to read my comment. hopefully, you get the chance to experience the game for the first time like i did."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-23,"played the game on ps4 when it came out, played it even more on ps5, still playing it but this time on pc. soooo yeah idk what to say anymore."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-14,"a glorified walking simulator. why people get so excited about the story in this game is beyond me. characters are well voiceacted but unless you are a hardcore wildwest fanboy, it's just boring jabbing and ridingwalking around for a whole lot of nothing. not much in terms of real game mechanics. loot is mediocre inventory ui is terrible, too, character progression minimal and upgrading your camp is below what an average ubisoft game sticks together. the ui is exceptionally terrible, a bunch of menus worse even than starfield which is basically one giant mess of menus. a dozen clicks to save a game and return back to the game. holy cow. character moves slow as a snail in the camp. picking up stuff and opening boxes is slow as hell. i believe it's a grandpa cowboy simulator if anything. but towns looks decent at night, i give it that. but yeah. that's pretty much all that's to it."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-18,"i've played this game until completion multiple times. 5 times on pc, 3 times on console i must say the story is so enriching, no matter how many times i'm playing through it i'm never not surprised by the way the game plays, by the beautiful scenery or by the legendary soundtrack. this is hands down my all time favourite game."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-18,the greatest game i have ever played. bought on sale for only 20 and i keep coming back to it to continously play ste story and explore all the map has to offer
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-15,rockstar makes things way to complicated. i just bought the game and it wont let me play it bc i need to verify my email. but the email is wrong and it wont let me change it. so i cant play the game. its a sad state of affairs when a company this large cant resolve simple issues. ill never buy a rockstar product again.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-19,"this game has taught me that i need to take reviews with a grain of salt. hugely positive reviews and when i play i just cannot understand why. on paper this game is designed for a player like me, but when i play it, i am bored...bored...bored."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,"really what is the problem with this game and opening things? it frequently crashes when open drawers due some neverfixed bug that makes physics go cray cray...... searching houses is hoping not to bug out at this point another inexcusable bad practice is the forced crappy rockstar launcher that even prevents you from playing the game without online connection for those things can't recommend this game. the game itself is pretty good, story is nothing too spectacular.... the world feels fun enough, sadly the brains behind collectibles and challenges made them sooooo extreeeeemely booring...... and they made it so they don't count unless you have that specific challenge unlocked.... like.... you could have completed that previously but it doesn't count unless you are actually on that specific rank..... how dumb of a design is that? it's a shame because the game has a lot of great sides and had the potential to be much much more enjoyable with the side content."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-19,"there are many things to love about rdr2... it's generally a slower pace so fits well with my more casual nontwitch playstyle however, there are definitely more exciting moments ambushes, knife fights, legendary hunts, etc that can be woven in between story progression at will... truly you get out of it what you put into it. there are many more positives like the game's huge attention to detail, but i want to mention, a couple of the things that annoy me only 40ish hours in as other than online that i haven't tried yet these are really the only issues i've found so far that would prevent me from rating the story mode game 1010 1 story quests are treated like missions in this open world and you cannot save while within one.. so make sure you save before starting a mission 2 i think there are other events that while in proximity are also are treated like a mission, in that you cannot save while near 3 your position is not maintained between saves and reloads... you will reload in the area, so don't waste your time strategically saving in a good spot as it will be ignored and your loadin location is randomised. if you feel that you can forgiveignore anyall of these issues than i nothing else to offer to suggest that you won't love playing rdr2!"

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-19,single player is great but the multiplayer is full of so many hackers and cheaters and rockstar will do nothing at all
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-19,"i fell in love with the characters in this game and their personalities. everything feels so real and sometimes i just get lost. i haven't finished the game but for how far i have gotten i have to say that if i were to recommend any gate to a friend it would be this game. i genuinely applaud rockstar for this work of art. i also love the game mechanics like hunting and fishing. the animals add a whole other level to the realism. another reason i would suggest this game is because of the fact that there is almost always something to do. if you go down a road for 5 minutes tops you will encounter a bandit, or other activities to keep you entertained. 1110"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-19,i wish that my only problem is that the game crashed. instead it force restarts my whole computer. in addition! it does not save what i do play. i spent most of my time replaying the same missions. by my last attempt to play the game i had tried lowering all the settings to see if that was the issue and it barely loaded in before restarting my computer. i wish i had read the reviews before buying.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-19,"if you have adhd andor autism not sure which one caused my problem please be careful when you start playing this game. i opened it for the first time and proceeded to play for 25 hours without pausing for anything other than two showers, and, including the showers, a total of four bathroom breaks. i did not drink, i did not eat, i did not sleep. don't be like me. set a timer or something."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-19,"i had to adjust to the speed of play, but once i got into the story and started doing side quests i fell in love. definitely a bit of a learning curve without a controller for the keyboard controls but its overall worth learning if youre interested in a slow paced story. open world also leaves lots of oppurtunity to strike out on your own and do what you want."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-19,"by far the best game ive played to just relax and take in the scenery, rush it and it just feels wrong"

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-19,literally the best game of all time. if someone tells you otherwise they are objectively wrong.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-19,"single player story is an absolute treasure. online mode is impossible to enjoy due to rampant cheaters that the game developers apparently cannot control and cannot seem to prevent in any form. 910 lobbies will have at least 1 modder running around annoying the other players, destroying or spawning assets that shouldn't be in the game. its insane how a aaa company can put out such a spectacularly trash and unmoderated multiplayer option with a cash shop option."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-19,"how to fast travel please read so you will enjoy the game make camp with your horse, sit by fire and you can fast travel to any major places. websites all say there's no fast travel but this is how to fast travel. you do not need to head back to your camp and look at the map like all the websites and forums say, just select camp when your on your horse on the same option as craft on the bottom of selection wheel and then you can fast travel from there. with the updates, they should have a message telling people how to fast travel since they have so many hint messages anyways."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-19,"stopped playing in 2022 and came back in 2025, i've never lost my love for the game, made a lot of friends back in the day."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-19,"i finally got this after i bought the disaster of a launch, monster hunter winds, a poorly optimised mess which didn't run properly at all and looks awful... like really bad. i can't stress it enough. i payed 60 for a game that looks like it belongs on the ps2 i wish i was joking. that being said, i just bought rdr2 because it was on sale i'm only a few hours into the game first time playing and i can truly say i understand the hype, it's unbelievably good. looks incredible compared to mhw which released almost 7 years after this! actual insanity. rdr2 is a super fun game so far and it looks incredible. it definitely deserves all the praise it's received and i'm only 2 hours in and loving it, can't wait to play more. this is how you make a game capcom. shame on you, you bunch of dorks!!"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-19,"red dead redemption 2 is hands down one of the best games ive ever played. the story is deep and emotional, and it really makes you connect with the charactersespecially arthur morgan, who easily became one of my alltime favorite protagonists. the world is insanely detailed, and everything feels alive, whether youre interacting with npcs or just riding around, watching the scenery change. as for the gameplay, its smooth and satisfying. the gunplay feels great, the melee combat has real weight to it, and even the side activities like hunting and camping add to the immersion. this game pulled me in way more than i expected, and every time i go back to it, it feels like stepping into a real, living world. its an experience thats hard to top."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,"this is the best written piece of fiction i have consumed. i never find myself attached to characters, and the end to the main story made me weep."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,"still one of my all time favorite games, only thing about playing on here i found is that it doesnt like to work with headphones unless they are wired. it doesnt seem to like wireless headphones for some reason. still 1010 game"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,what a game fantastic! i still waiting for red dead redemption 3 rockstar thank your this masterpiece
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,"excellent graphics, ai interaction and game play. like a lot of other games, online mode is over run by hackers...needs a private room option."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,gets a bit repetitive but overall a great game
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,do not buy this genuinely it will not start after first play so if you are dumb enough ti buy like me just complete the game in one sitting cause you will not be able to open it ever again having the issue as i write this
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,"red dead redemption 2 is an absolute masterpiece, delivering an unparalleled openworld experience with mind blowing visuals and a gripping story. the level of detail in the world is astonishing, making every interaction feel immersive and alive. from the engaging characters to the dynamic gameplay mechanics, everything is crafted to perfection. whether you're exploring the vast landscapes, hunting, or just living the outlaw life, rdr2 is a mustplay for any gamer."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,"i always come back to this game, at least once a year. red dead redemption 2 is a beautiful tale of the old west, and it takes us along through the magnificent, beautiful scenery of the american wilds. the first time i played this game, i purposefully avoided any spoilers prior to it, and it paid off immensely. you slowly see the gang unravel as more and more things arise and more problems happen and i remember that i just wept like a babe at the tail end of the storyline. i get back to this game because it's a wonderful story. it's compelling, the game itself is beautiful, the characters are amazing and it's just so damn good to experience it. if you're not feeling the story, go do some hunting, or other fun activities. i recommend this game because it's just got everything of what's good in a story. even if you haven't played red dead 1 yet much like myself, though i mean to now that it's on pc, this game will toss a lasso around your neck, drag you through the streets and leave you begging for more of it. 1010 game. if at any point you develop coughing through your playthrough, see a doctor immediately and avoid any stags."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,"it takes a while to get used to the controls and you will hate it at first, but once you figure out how the controls work, you will love this game."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,best character development i've ever seen and insane details. game made me cry multiple times. just wish you could beat up micah in camp
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,"even though its old, still a fun game. the online is so much fun"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,"never have i ever played a game quite like this one. i can go on and on about how unique this game is, with its story telling, atmosphere, music, game mechanics and much more. this game has definitely left a mark on me and has stood out from the 100s of other games out there. this is a game in which there was passion and love behind everything done. this game can truly be called an artistic wonder. 1010 would recommend this game in a heartbeat."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,"graphics are incredible, the story and game play are captivating for hours. i love the freedom and open world that you can explore at all times. 1010 experience"

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,"the game was not what i expected, i was expecting high paced action. while the game does have its fair share of fast paced action, overall this game is very paced and slow. they are creating immersion in a wild west and it is incredibly fun once you buy into that experience. i only play single player and i am loving it so far."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,this game can very much be a masterpiece. i cant say though as all i experienced was sound cracking from the start. was tinkering with windows settings that made it disappear for 15 minutes then returned. heard this game does not like usb headphones. shame as that is what i have and its the only game that does this to me. on top of this it requires rockstar account and with all this ubisoft ea bethesda2k launchers having to update itself nearly every single time i wish to play any game feels like a chore.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,"a mastepiece, all open world game should be like this the world of rdr 2 is so alive so far this game has the best game i ever play best story best gameplay and the best detail game i ever play absolute cinema"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,"probably the best game i have ever played. the story is so good it made go outside more. there is so much to do, and the open world is so immersive. it can also be a bit goofy especially when using mods which is only capable when playing on a pc."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,you know it was good when you spent hours entertaining yourself with the open world without doing any story missions

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,"rdr2 is a stunning openworld game with a gripping story, breathtaking visuals, and immersive gameplay. arthur morgans journey through a dying wild west is unforgettable, though the pacing and controls might not suit everyone. a solid 910."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,i got a little bored with horses and installed the dmc delorean mod. i'm traveling through the wild west with my car and experiencing the back to the future 3 movie. it's pretty good. atlardan biraz skldm ve dmc delorean modunu kurdum. arabamla vahi batda seyahat ediyorum ve gelecee dn 3 filmini deneyimliyorum. olduka iyi.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,"not sure what else i need to say that all the other positive reviews have already said. and what's worse is once you pick up the game and play through the story for the fist time, it'll only raise your standards for how a game should feel to play, how a game should evoke emotions in players. i've played many games, watched many movies and tv shows and have seen many characters liked, loved, hated, and despised throughout them all. and none of them, and i mean not one has ever brought me so much emotion, or even brought me to actual tears the way red dead redemption 2 did with the story of arthur morgan. on one side of the coin i hate this game because of the fact that i'll likely never have a game make me care this much about a character again because it shows that games can reach this level of design and i think that's something more story games should strive for. but on the other side, i love this game for doing it this well because not only is it the first game to make me feel this way for a character. and in the end, the only real downside i can say i have with this game, is that i can't play it again for the first time."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-18,"beautiful graphics, interesting story line. worst save system and pc interface i've ever encountered. for example... saved and exited as soon after the bear hunt as the game would let me. came back to the message that i'd abandoned the legendary animal no recourse except to play the dang mission again. full on garbage! interface issues like having the weapon i wanted out only to have the game decide i should use something. random equipment reallocation, trash ability to store things for later, you know like the chest at camp. don't answer an npc.... he shoots at you and when you kill him in self defense you are the guilty party. glad i bought the game on sale, wished i could get my money back"

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-17,"honestly, i found rdr2 hard to get on with for the first 2 or 3 sessions i played it, the controls are mildly janky to a new player. however, after i got past that sticking point, i began to really enjoy all the aspects of this game, and have spent many hours on it. excellent story, although if i were to make one complaint, it would be that some plot points that you think would be talked about amongst your camp mates, or be made more of a point of, just isnt, and i think that sort of takes you out of the emmersion slightly. it did for me. regardless, the story is still fantastic, the game is fun, and has a lot of twists and turns that kept playing exciting. also has fair potential for replay value. would def recommend."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,"one of the best solostory type games i've ever played. but the multiplayer is terrible and filled with cheaters in my own experience, i'm sure there are cool private servers out there for it though. but i would say the campaign or whatever is worth it alone."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,"100 recommended, from the people who want a story that is very flexible and powerful to the people who want to go guns and blazing or stealth, i feel even the fact that rockstar games made this was enough for me to say take my money, then you look at the trailer aswell. 1010 rockstar, another masterpiece as usual"

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,the best story ever written for a video game. hands down. it's so good you cannot pass up the opportunity to binge this game.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,"after 200 hours of game play, the rockstar launcher wants a verification code from an email i have not used in over a decade. during my 200 hours of game play, i did not sign in with the old account when playing red dead 2. i do not play online, nor do i use the social club. i cannot use my rockstar account that is connected to the email i use. there is no way in steam to change what rockstar account is linked to my steam account. steam support has no options that can resolve this issue, nor do they have a way to speak to a human about said issue. rockstar support is awful. edit rockstar support requires you to know the monthdayyear that you linked accounts. i do not have a photographic memory, and cannot access the email to look at the exact date. they close the ticket without offering any suggestions as to how to find the information they require."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,do you like to burn time with one of the classic games? this is the game the story is rich but the side quests and the free roam is better. just buy the game when there is a sale or you will be bankrupt

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,"h2 tldr version h2 overall score 510 everything in this game is amazing... apart from the actual gameplay. i would pay more money to see this as a movie. hrhr h2 the details h2 b  the good b  the visuals just stunning. you load up the game and it's beautiful to look at and be in as a character.  the story and acting characters are wellwritten and the story is promising. on top of that, the voice actors definitely help bring characters to life  the openworld looks great, feels great, is interactive, you want to get lost in there.  the details you can care about so much in this game, which makes it more immersive. the list is too long, but examples include  temperature, horse bonding, hunger, party camp, the honour level, etc. b  the bad b  the gameplay loop is absolutely horrendous and actively disengaging.  press a button and ride your horse for a few minutes following another character. get wherever you were going while listening to a generic dialogue. shoot mindlessly for 2 minutes until you kill all the bad guys. loot. go back. repeat. at points, you are not playing a game, you are watching the game happening to you.  the mission structure is too restrictive and actively collides with the open world, since even a slight deviation from a set path means you fail.  character movementcontrol is slow, clunky and laggy. opening cabinets, searching drawers, getting on and off from your horse... all of these will be 6s of the same animation every... single... time. b  the ugly b  the menu  inventory saving a game and getting back to it requires you to click through at least 3 menus. oh you died? let me load up the game in a completely different location for you. picking an item from your inventory, where each bottle looks the same, is beyond annoying. hrhr get at full price if you want to pretend you are a cowboy, it will be worth it, trust me get at 50 discount if you can tolerate repetitive and slow gameplay, just to enjoy the world and story avoid if you want to enjoy the story and playing the game"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,"i think that the authenticity of the game is what captured me instantly. sometimes you can see how games are created to fit into a box that is predefined for them. this is a raw, collaborative effort that isn't looking to paint the time period for anything other than what it was. brutal, hard and unforgiving. only 3 hours in and i felt like i've been a participant in a movie. it's exceptional for immersion. i can't wait for rockstar's next offering this fall."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,"came in to this game with almost no reviews, im taking it slowly to take everything in. my first rockstar game too and let me tell you i love it so far! arthur reminds me a lot of edward kenway from assassins creed black flag and i loved him and so far i feel the same for arthur. definitly a must buy especially if the ultimate edition is on sale that's how i bought it."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,"incredible game, 1010 experience. no spoilers  totally worth playing. not going to lie though, there are few issues with bugs throughout the playthrough but nothing major. constant popups about graphics using up memory, npc's glitching out, floating bottles in camp, animals doing weird things in cutscenes. but considering the length of the game, hardly an issue."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,great game. i bought it on the ps4 when it first came out. and now bought it on sale for the pc. amazing game and story line. the npc are funny as hell in this game as well.

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,the bottom line is that this is one of the greatest games ever made. on pc it's even better. never before or since has their been a game as detailed as rdr2. it's an absolute masterpiece in every sense of the word and on pc it's even better than it was on console. being able to play it at 60fps and with mods is a dream come true. it's worth every penny.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-16,only game that's ever made me cry after finishing the main story high honor run. gorgeous in every possible way.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-15,"the best 810 out of ten game you can find. rockstar proves they are still a talented studio that can deliver great open world games, if the story was better it might have been a 910 game. spoilers let me explain, arthur is a great protagonist, but not as good as john in the first game. rockstar was going for a man changing as he realises the end of the rope is coming, but how arthur behaves in the beginning of the game, a loyal enforcer that is a yes man to dutch, to the end of the game, the enforcer that now just questions dutch but still follows his orders, is not a big difference. then its the morality and politics of the game, which bring us to its worst characters, mrs addler and micah, she is mean to pearson and williamson for no reason, also arthur during camp interactions on the camp near valentine, but we are supposed to like her. what she experienced was horrible, and rockstar wanted to make her an avenging figure...while preaching at the same time that vengeance is bad and caused the gang a lot of trouble, just like her killing the o'driscol gun in st dennis, risking not only her life but arthur and dutch, then when we see her on the epilogue she leads a life that wouldnt be possible for a woman in the early 20th century, but also the life the game story and morality warns about, the one of the sword, its deadly for arthur and john but ok for her according to rockstar. now micah, he has no reedeming features, the game goes out of its way to show you no one at camp likes him, like no one, not even dutch pays attention to him at the beginning, but he is necessary for the story so he has to be there, he is racist, a deviant, mean, and a bully, hmmmmmm i wonder who would cause troubles for the gang down the line? the game should have done something to show how he was a wolf in sheep's clothing, but nope, too hard for rockstar to do, it worked with big smoke and the traitor in vice city, guess they forgot how they did it. the morality, the first game dealt with the death of the wild west and what it meant for people living at the time, it criticised the government being like the outlaws they were getting rid off, extortion in the form of taxation, as well as how industrialisation and modernisation caused the abandonment of communities and the struggle mcfarlane ranch went through with banks, the second game shows the pinkertons, who despite your own personal feelings towards them, were only doing their job catching criminals as evil. the gang killed civilians and caused thousands in damages, but its ok because they were multicultural, and let women shoot guns and rob, so you see? the gang is morality right and they were wrong. dont even get me started on the gang that was made of civil war millitias, they believe the same core principles as the van der ling gang, but they are shown as dumb and evil in the game, just as the same of the south, you get tired of the forced morality pretty quickly. finally the story, boils down to the gang going someplace, being dumb, getting caught doing crimes, then get surprised about the consequences while no one says or does anything and complain its everyone fault but their own. i know this story had to follow the first game, but rockstar showed they didnt care, like making saddie a character, no mention of her in the first game despite being so prominent, they wanted their cake and eat it too, they even fumble the opportunity of linking the native american missions to how dutch riled them up in the first game, but we cant have the native characters be evil or dumb, its all dutch fault and they will magically trust him years later in 1911 somehow. the gameplay is good, but even there its not as enjoyable as 1, no ragdoll physics, no strategy for engagements, cover is not even necessary here, and no dueling mechanic, at the end of the day this felt like a different game in the west with the red dead title. its a good game, but dont let people lie to you and present it as a 1010, the first one was lighting in a bottle, it has its small issues but managed to please western movie fans and normies alike, it was a love letter to spaghetti westerns while criticising the romantization of the west at the same time, they tried to criticise the trope of the noble savage on the gang, but showed the natives as noble savages at the same time on red dead 2. i finished the first game on 100 2 times and 1 time roleplaying, a 9.5 for me and you can may even argue that was a 1010, this review comes from a place of love, not hate, and i hope rockstar learns from their mistakes for their future projects. thank you for coming to my ted talk."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-15,"i've been playing video games for 25 years. this is one of the very few that exceeded my extremely high expectations before launch. it's everything i've ever wanted in a game. an immersive world that feels real and you're free to roam and truly do whatever you want. one of the greatest gaming stories of all time. the graphics and attention to detail are still unparalleled. it's been almost seven years and modern games are still trying to catch up to what rockstar accomplished in 2018 with arguably their greatest title. if you haven't played this yet, you need to. it does take some patience, especially in the beginning, but you will be amply rewarded for your efforts."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-15,"main story game is good. online servers are garbage. here's the thing. every guide says its my router and poor wifi. that's amazing. too bad it isn't. i played through everything. been all around the map. it's when another player comes near me that it all disconnects. rockstar. take care of your online servers and the people that play them so i can actually enjoy the game online thanks. love this game more than i can tell. used to play gun on console way back. got gun on steam. red dead is like gun, but 2000x more fleshed out and better. gun, but upgraded beyond belief or possible reason. now if only i could play online without other players turning my internet off that'd be great."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-15,"one of the best story games of all time! i definitely recommend downloading mods. i wouldn't download for the online though because rockstar abandoned it for gta online. the online had so much potential but cckstar is greedy. if you really want to play online play redm, but i warn you the rp fanbase are all rtrded mouth breathers who sit on porches the whole time they play. i recommend if you do play rdr rp don't take it serious because the porch shtters have the admins in their back pocket and there are white knightsstrong independent women everywhere."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-14,goated
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-14,the game is one of the best out there but the steam version stutters a lot even though fps are high and requires additional rockstar launcher that can get you locked out of your game if you forget additional set of credentials.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-14,great visuals and gameplay. you can enjoy the open world map and live as a cowboy. the lagged few places for me but is not a major issue.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-14,"this is a phenomenal game, will definitely be an all time great for me! the story, the worldspace, the user interface, it's all just incredible. my only complaint is how quickly rockstar seemed to abandon the game. there was so much potential with dlcs and multiplayer here. but if you're looking for one of the best singleplayer story games out there, with a beautiful world with endless exploration available, look no further!"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-14,i have never experienced a game that was so thought out so detailed and so beautiful. this game has ruined every other game for me because it is the best game i have ever played. there is so much to do outside of the story and even the smallest places have a lot of hard work and detail put into it. if you are considering buying this game you should! this is hands down one of the greatest games ever made. if you havent had the privilege to play this game you are missing out.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-14,"it took me a few tries to properly get rolling in this game, but once i did, i was hooked. there is something so beautiful about being a cowboy riding around the open country on your trusty horse. the story itself is great, but the immaculate vibes are why i'm really here. i understand why this game is so generally beloved. it's a world i wish i could live in."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-13,"where do i begin. a world that feels real a story that makes you cry. this game came out quite a long time ago now, yet it has not been matched. i wish it didn't require the rockstar launcher, but on this occasion it is worth the extra hassle. it still looks wonderful, there's so much to do but it doesn't feel like pointless ubisoftstyle busywork. to my wonderful palomino, thank you. it was a hell of a ride."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-13,"i just love the fact that i was even able to play this game so smoothly on my last laptop. i gave that laptop away to a dear one of mine but i have a new one and cannot wait to play it again. i will update when i can. at the moment it takes a while to download but that is okay, i am willing to wait."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-12,"my horse had a diet consisting of nothing but pure sugar. he was an absolute beast, thriving on only quick energy and vitamin d."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-12,"singleplayer story mode is very good. the freeroam aspect of the game feels like the whole world is alive, and there are things which can be discovered even after many hours of gameplay. little details and hidden things makes exploring the map an adventure in itself. but there is always something negative too, no game is perfect. i will list some of the bad that if removed, would make the game near perfect and way more enjoyable. the bad 1. the game is not supported with steam workshop and has no mods to experiment and improve the overall gameplay with 2. the vanilla game without any mods has a rather flawed law system, and will get annoying as the npcs in the game are too ''sensitive'' and will most likely start thretening you or shooting you if you accidentally bump on them or dosay something, this takes the immersion out of the game as it feels like the player is the only one who can not ''antagonize'' npcs in towns but they can antagonize the player without the law even caring about it. in most cases the player will be seen as a threat by all the npcs when the shooting starts, and it does not matter who starts the shooting. the player always ends up being targeted by all, even the outsiders in towns. even though it might seem that i wrote more negatives than positives about this game, i am still going to give a positive review since the positives outweigh the negatives. workshop mod support would fix most of the minor problems this game has and add more contentrealism to the game."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-12,fantastic story and play it again over and over and it won't get boring
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-12,"nice story, nice graphics, overall a great game"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-12,"i've put 170 hours into one playthrough of red dead redemption and i still didn't finish the entire game 100, it's crazy how the game just keeps on giving you things to do, learn, and uncover but at the same time manages to not feel boring. i never played the original rdr1 and it took me many years to actually try rdr2, i just had some feeling that i wouldn't like the whole cowboy genre of games, but boy was i so wrong. the whole world feels so alive in rdr2, people going about their normal days, animals hunting eachother and living their own lives, it really felt as if arthur morgan was another piece in this huge world. the story of arthur is also so deep and interesting that i truly felt that i was a part of dutch's gang, seeing how the characters develop and come in and out of arthur's life made me wonder why aren't all stories this encapsulating? however, because i came into rdr2 5 years after it first released, i already had some idea of what was going to happen. but luckily i didn't know exactly how the ending was going to pan out. gameplay, smooth as butter, i don't think i had any issues during my entire playthough. i'm sure if you are reading this, you've played games in the past that really leave a mark on you. whether it's from those long nights online with your friends laughing, the days as a kid when you were playing video games for the first time, or when you play a game with a story so deep that once you finish, it leaves you feeling like you've lost something. well, rdr2 is one of those games, before this, my favourite single player game of all time was witcher 3, i put around 200 hours into that and when i finished the story, i didn't know what to spend my time on next, rdr2 gave me the same feeling but more. wish i could play this game all over again for the first time, an absolute masterpiece."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-12,what a amazing game so immersive even though i love gta 5 red dead 2 makes gta 5 look like gta 3 ot also massively expands on the first game basically blowing away all other games its story is so xcomplex and the ability to choose difffrent actions throughout truly makes this game a 2010
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-12,"thought i was getting a fun cowboy game. instead, i got an emotional masterpiece that set my gaming standards to an unreachable level. thanks, rockstar i guess. now no other game feels good enough. 1010"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-12,"great story and gameplay, have yet to try online but i'm sure that it's just as great."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-12,still very early in the game just raided colms cabin and got the shotgun was looting bodies got greedy ran into the law didnt want to lower my rating so i ran but i still had the default horse and it couldnt catch up and when it did i rode into a tree and died woke up immediately stole a train 1010 game
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-12,fun game for a while until the game mechanics kick in and sends your horse that you ranked up and spent a lot of time with hits a fence and then side steps into a train killing you and the horse and now the horse is gone. if i ended up dying in the game and having to reload in why the heck is my damn horse still dead!
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-12,"this game is phenominal, easily one of the greatest games i've ever played. 1010 would highly recommend if you want stunning visuals, a griping story, and lifelike characters."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-12,"the game is great once you get into it. at first i didn't really care for it, since it's a bit slow, but i really did get invested after a while. when it works, it is really fun. good gameplay, story and graphics. however, i had nothing but issues, glitches, textures not loading, even key people not loading, bugs, crashes, super long loading screens10 minutes sometimes with a m.2 ssd, constant failed sign in attempts on rockstar and many more issues. i reinstalled several times, updated and verified files. same thing. by far the buggiest game i have ever played, and i like sonic games... i would recommend the game if it actually worked right. note i played this with an i9 12900k, rtx 3080 ti and a m.2 ssd"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-11,"masterpiece, this game is gold, it left a mark on me in a way no other game has, it will probably remain my favorite game ever. you can buy this game and play it headfirst, i don't think you'll regret playing it."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-11,this game is like onepiece it takes your entire lifetime to finish but its so rewarding when you do also the combat is some of the best the only problem i have is just that i think they stretch out the game waaaay too much cause im still on chapter 2 with 37 hours i honestly wish they made the chapters a little less long but overall this game gets 910 big booms boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-11,"one of the best games i've ever played, nothing will ever top this experience like the one i had playing this, the story is amazing, the weapons, the characters, and the online aspect when you have the right group, 1010, would play again"

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-11,really fun game to immerse yourself in. story mode is solid but online is tons and tons of fun. there are quite a bit of hackers depending on the game you spawn in but nonetheless a masterpiece of a game. thank you rock star games!
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-11,"not a big fan of the wild west cowboy topic so i'm really really late to this party. but it's worth a lots. plenty of storytelling, good one and great one. not a console player so it feels a lot easier to aim and play with keyboard and mouse. only 2 things i with the game can do better is crafting mechanic and adult activity.  it kinda simple and doesn't affect much. i finish the game before even craft a saddle, or a better tent. and then, all of my 3 stars material being useless since the game doesn't let you craft anything else anymore, beside of medicine.  the adult side nearly finish 60 of the story and then found out about hotel and bathing yeah, i know, i kinda focus on the gun too much at the first town and didn't realize it and that is it. i mean if they already try to add this path, why don't make it fully? why just stop at a little not so much? feel weird, tbh. it'd be better if it doesn't there in the first place."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-11,"rdr2 is more than a gameits an unforgettable experience. the world is breathtakingly detailed, the story is emotionally gripping, and arthur morgan is one of the best protagonists ever written. the gameplay balances realism and fun perfectly, with deep mechanics and meaningful choices. while the pacing can be slow, its a minor flaw in an otherwise flawless game. a mustplay for anyone who loves openworld adventures or great storytelling. 1010  a timeless classic."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-11,"this is a complete open world game, jaw dropping graphics, good story and playability. my only comments on improvement would be the easylinear missions that are mostly not challenging. overall 910."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-11,"this is the greatest video game i've ever played. the storytelling, the character development, the combat. it truly is the most beautiful game i've ever played and everyone should play it. if you play it, do not skip any cutscenes."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-11,"red dead redemption 2 is probably the best game ive ever played. for years, people told me to play the first red dead redemption, but i just couldnt get into the idea. the whole cowboy thing sounded too slow and boring. then rdr2 came out, and once again, people were raving about how beautiful and immersive it was. i still ignored the recommendationsuntil it finally went on sale for 20. and let me tell you, that was the best and most rewarding purchase ive ever made. can a game feel this real? every detail, from the world to the characters, is so well thought out. i love the stories, the missions, the sheer freedom the game offers. rockstar has a way of creating games that feel truly fulfilling, and rdr2 is a perfect example of that. whether its hunting, fishing, racing, or getting into shootouts, every moment in this game feels meaningful. the time period itself adds so much depthyou feel like youre living in that era of rugged freedom. i cant believe i almost skipped out on this masterpiece. if you havent played rdr2 yet, dont make the same mistake i did. this game is an experience you dont want to miss."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-11,so immersive and the scenery is amazing! what i hate is the story ended. i am in my third play through.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-11,"i'd say play the first one then this one, just to not only appreciate where and how the story goes, but to also see just how far we've come in terms of games as a medium. i thought the first game was peak when it released, and i wasn't even into westerns at the time. that's how good it was. and with this game? oof. it's might be one of the best pieces of media that a normal person can purchase. it's that good. no notes. 910. the hunting rng is bullshit. everything else is great. never touched multiplayer and i don't care to."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-10,"this game is an unforgettable masterpiece that will stay with me forever. the story is incredibly powerful, with complex characters and emotional depth that make every moment impactful. the graphics are stunning  every landscape, town, and character feels meticulously crafted, creating a world that feels truly alive. from breathtaking sunsets to small details like muddy streets, the visual experience is unparalleled. the enjoyment is endless, whether you're exploring, hunting, or simply soaking in the atmosphere. story 1010 graphics 1010 enjoyment 1010 i genuinely believe no other game will ever reach the level of rdr2. a true classic."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-10,"h1the best openworld gameh1 if youre a fan of openworld games and have never played this game what do you wait for?? play it now, but if you want something that tells you why you should play this game. i'll tell you. bred dead redemption 2b is an openworld action adventure game from rockstar games set in the wild west. the story follows outlaw arthur morgan and the van der linde gang as they fight for survival in a rapidly developing america. as for the story in chapter 1, many people say it's boring, but for me, who likes to enjoy the story, it's quite fun. h3gameplay910h3 rdr2 focuses on exploration, storytelling, activities such as shooting, robbing, hunting, and fishing, and also random events that can occur at any time, such as encountering an injured person, being robbed, etc. the controls focus on realism, which in my opinion makes shooting quite boring, since the guns of that era were quite slow. but overall, it's great. the difficulty is well balanced. the survival element lets you control arthur's wellbeing, while the honor system determines how the world will respond to your moral decisions. for example, if your honor is high, you will get a halfprice discount in all shops. if your honor is low, when you loot corpses, the drop rate will be better, so you will find more energy, accessories, and food. h3graphics 1010h3 the world of rdr2 is impeccable in terms of its beauty and realism. for example, the lush forests, vast grasslands, townspeople, and wildlife all have their own daily routines. each region has its own unique beauty and wildlife, which helps to enhance the realism of the game. the character models are equally impressive, reflecting detailed facial expressions. this makes the game require relatively high pc specs to produce beautiful graphics. in terms of bugs, i have rarely encountered any in my experience. h3sound  voice 1010h3 during exploration, there is ambient track, whereas during shootouts or heavy emotional beats, it becomes more intense with orchestral pieces. this kind of soundtrack adds a big ratio to the atmosphere to make even the most mundane things, like crossing the plains atop your horse, feel quite cinematic in tone. the dialogues are richly captivating and totally authentic. each character speaks according to their unique personalities and the time period they are supposed to belong to. the succinct tone of arthur morgan or dutch's manipulative charm  the voice acting and writing are incredible! h3conclusion 9.610h3 overall, red dead redemption 2 offers an excellent openworld design and deep story. from the realistic animations and beautiful scenery to the rousing soundtrack and excellent voice acting, every element works together seamlessly to create an immersive experience. while the deliberate control scheme and potential performance issues may present challenges at first, they ultimately add to the games cinematic realism. for players looking for a deep story, rich gameplay variety, and an immersive world, rdr2 is definitely worth every price you spend."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-10,"i didn't know what to say. i kept hearing an unbelievable amount of praise for red dead 2 to the point that i thought it would be above the rating. because of that, my experience was ruined. i felt bored at many moments, even though the story was wonderful and beautiful, the characters were wellwritten, everything was excellentthe world, your impact on the world. in summary, red dead 2 is a technical masterpiece, but it doesn't deserve all that praise.  story 9.510  world design 1010  graphics 1010  songs 8.510  gameplay 8.510 my rating is 9.510."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-10,"play this game! right now! i absolutely love the atmosphere of this world! rdr2 has very detailed gameplay that stomps cyberpunk 2077! phenomenal voice actors! great character designs, makes me feel like im in the world with them! i feel really lonely these days, and playing rdr2 being immersed in arthur's company makes me feel like im in their family ! graphics are great too! but bplease do notb use taa. and use optimized settings if you can! i did run into some crashes, fortunately for me i used ignorepipelinecache to fix the crashing issue! it seems to be working for me so far  i love the dead eye mechanic. makes me feel like im mcree in action. so much fun using it! hunting is really fun too! i did get confused on where i should sell my animal carcass but i figured it out to sell it to a trapper!  i am in chapter 2, and so far, i am putting this game along with ratchet and clank future crack in time and mario galaxy as one of the best video games ive ever played in my life! r did a phenomenal job making a remarkable game with memorable characters! once again, i cant stress this enough. play rdr2 before you die!!!"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-10,"this game is everything i was told it would be and more. i've invested 62 hrs at the time of review and i'm still only on the third chapter. a gargantuan game and getting it on steam sale for only like 30ish aud, i can safely say it is the best game purchase i have ever made. with heaps to do and and a seemingly bottomless list of side quests i can tell i'm probably going to get hundreds if not close to thousands of hours of replay value out of this game. if you haven't played this already, id say its worth the full price. but if you're broke like me then add it to a wishlist and definitely make the purchase when its on sale. you will not regret it."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-10,best open world game ive played has some out of this world graphics... i truly recommend this game
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-10,"the story made me cry, the exploration made me amazed, the small details made me amazed"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-10,"i bought red dead cause i wanted to ride horses and shoot random dudes but as i played the story i felt more and more compelled and trapped to complete it. some of my friends got the game from my recommendation but never got past chapter 2. if you play and think its boring, try and complete the story at least once before quitting. rdr online sucks tho never play that money vacuum garbage bin."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-10,"you may be done with the west, but the west ain't done with you. arthur morgan is one of the bestwritten protagonists in gaming history. if you want an openworld game that actually respects your time and investment, this is it. one of the greatest games ever made."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-09,"top tier singleplayer adventure. the freeroam is awesome and you really feel like the landscape is immersive and small missions are almost as good as the campaigne sometimes. speaking of the campaigne, the storytelling leaves you wanting more. wanting to go back a hundred years in time, move out in to the forrest and live a peaceful simple life. the online aspect is obviously not the main focus but a really fun experience if you have friends who've played the game. i recommend to buy this game if you're patient and willing to spend time playing the game because the more invested you are the better it is i have a friend who rushed the experience a little and he rightly regrets it. take your time and enjoy all this game has to offer."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-09,the story the gameplay the graphics the characters everything is just so amazing
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-09,really great game i played the shit out of red dead 1 on 360 when i was younger and damn it was fun and i used to always try and drive the train i played this game and you can its cool asf really great game even off sale its worth it online is dead unless you play king of the hill or missions or theres just abunch of hackers really should make red dead redemption 3 soon would probley be the best game right along side grand theft auto 6 and mafia old country
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-09,"great story with amazing voice acting. graphics are amazing, and the small details are astonishing. open world that allows you to ride around and explore. the game can be very slow if you want or fairly fast. allowing you to go through the game at your own pace after the first chapter. there is lots of interface to learn but it teaches it very well in chapter 1. the side quests are funny, and the little random encounters are always interesting. gives the game so much life. there are many minor inconveniences, like having to walk in camp, the skinning animation for every animal, etc. the game is not really made to be rushed through. so just be prepared to spend time on it. besides that, there is a good amount of customization, if you're more into action there is plenty of that, or if you want to play cowboy simulator and hunting simulator, there's room for that. really the most open world you'll find in a video game."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-09,"it's good, let me start by saying that. however, it's not an excellent timeless masterpiece. the story is okay from what i have played so far, but pacing is pretty slow and it's not particularly memorable, nor are the characters. it plays just like any other gta or rdd1  it's repetitive. the game play is go there and do this thing  you're a violent gofer, which is reminiscent of any other rockstar games release. now, that doesn't make it bad, but it is very much does what it says on the tin  you know what you're in for. there's absolutely heaps to do, sure, but unless you like performing tedious, mind numbing mini game tasks such as chopping fire wood or carrying hay to feed the horses, they really don't add much value. same with the many random npc encounters, there's lots of whimsical people in the wild west, but the interactions are generally lackluster. it's the same old deal, you meet a whimsical stranger, heshe and arthur have a brief exchange and before you know it, you're off gofering some wild animals for them or some other arbitrary task. having to monitor arthur's weight feels like a frivolous feature and like the game is blurring the lines between realism and a fantastical wild west. i don't feel as though this, and some other features are needed. sometimes less is more... the gameplay and presentation of the game are excellent  it's a 6 year old game, but you wouldn't really know it. the map and character design, wardrobe are all great and it is fun hopping on your 4 legged companion tesco in my case and riding through the beautiful wild west. there's probably little else i could say in terms of positives that haven't been stated elsewhere. at the time of this review i have 22.3 hours of game play, but probably closer to 1215 as i've spent a few hours paused. would ultimately reccommend, but don't touch at full price, wait for a sale."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-08,best game ive ever played but after story online is tough to start
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-08,good game redm is fun too
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-08,"amazing graphics, can't believe it came out in 2018. none of the games nowadays can compete with this. i'm always in awe and throwing my money in that darn gold. this is how i choose to spend my weekends instead of going out to the bars and meet all kinds of turd people."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-08,amazing game with so much to offer and a good story.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-08,not many words are needed for this review the best story game ever. we cant change what's done. we can only move on.  arthur morgan
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-08,"this game is literally one of the best ones i have ever played. it goes on sale heavily discounted often and is well worth the price. the online scene leaves much to be desired and is filled with incentive to spend real world money to beat the killer starting grind in an online world of griefers and hackers. because of this, i would recommend doing the multiplayer with friends, if at all, but the singleplayer story is more than able to stand alone as a masterpiece."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-08,one of the most beautiful maps in a game ever. gameplay and immersion is stunning and appealing. online made me ragequit this game so hard i uninstalled. but here i am playing it again. 1010 would recommend.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-08,"red dead redemption 2 is, without a doubt, one of the most immersive and beautifully crafted games i've ever had the pleasure of playing. from the moment i stepped into the boots of arthur morgan, the attention to detail and the vast, living world captivated me. the landscapes are breathtaking, with every mountain, river, and town meticulously designed to feel alive and real. the story is gripping, heartfelt, and genuinely emotional. the characters are welldeveloped, with each one having their own personality, goals, and backstory. you truly grow attached to them over time, making the journey all the more impactful. the gameplay is a perfect balance of action and realism. horse riding feels natural, gunfights are intense, and the ability to interact with the world  whether its hunting, fishing, or just talking to strangers  makes the experience feel endless. the side missions and random encounters add so much to the world, and i find myself constantly discovering new things. the attention to detail is unmatched. the weather system, the changing wildlife, and even the little touches like how your character's beard grows or how the campfire flickers at night  it all adds to the immersion. rockstar really went above and beyond to ensure that every aspect of the game feels real and livedin. if you're a fan of openworld games, red dead redemption 2 is an absolute mustplay. its not just a game, its an experience that youll remember long after you've put it down. an unforgettable journey that deserves every bit of praise it gets. 1010, absolutely phenomenal."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-08,"the most beautiful but heart breaking game ive ever played, what i would give to play it for the first time again, the whole plot line between arthur and mary sticks out to me as someone who loved a guy but he was a violent guy at times and my mum wouldnt let me be with him, this was worth 125 hours nad more on other devices of my life, it is wonderful, thank you rockstar for creating this masterpiece"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-08,"100 the best game ive ever played truly a joy from start to finish with a well developed plot and complex characters and amazing scenery and mechanics, online mode is also amazing and is such a laugh with friends if you havent played this yet go play it what are you doing? 1010 perfection without a shadow of doubt in my mind"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-08,great solo game to play. storyline is amazing.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-08,best story game in my opinion to this day  masterpiece
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-08,one of the best single player stories i have played in a video game. wish the developers would have supported the open world more amazing game.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-08,"after a slow start into playing this game and many attempts to get hooked, it finally clicked and 100 get the hype. highly recommend this game, you just need to get past the beginning area sadly."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-08,"uma verdadeira obra de arte interativa, mundo aberto vivo e detalhado, a historia  puro cinema umas das melhores que ja vi em um videogame, gameplay  lenta porem as animaes so bem detalhadas o que da um ar de realismo pro game. um dos melhores jogos j feitos ao lado de half life 2, melhor jogo de cowboy j feito. esse  um dos poucos jogos que realmente vale 300 reais que a industria impe, em promoo no precisa pensar nem duas vezes. fico imaginando como ser gta 6 com a rockstar extraindo ao maximo dos consoles atuais"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-08,"great game, but theres a noticeable gap between players who have been dedicated since launch and those like me who only jump in occasionally. the pvp can sometimes feel overwhelmingly difficult and even borderline impossible, but that's not a fault of rockstar. aside from that, this game is a true masterpiece. the graphics are stunning, the story is deeply emotional, and the game play is incredibly smooth. it's no surprise that its won so many awards. it's a game that continues to captivate anyone who plays it. 55"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-07,fortnite is better than this.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-06,"peak of the peak. lowkey the best game story i've ever played, each run i keep enjoying it regardless of how many times i've finished this masterpiece even on console, on i still tear up in the last chapter. i have no words to describe this 1210 game."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-06,"easily one of the most lifechanging games you will ever play. while the mission structure isn't really any different than what you'll find in other rockstar games which can mess with the pacing depending on how you play, the story it provides is one that our earthly population may not truly deserve. rdr2 takes the interesting route of marketing itself as a sequel rather than a prequel. it does this very intentionally because, while it chronologically takes place before rdr1, it should be played after. rdr2 knows that you know how the story ends. dread and inevitability play a vital role in rdr2 as well as rdr1. with this in mind we're given a fantastic story that can stand on its own arthur morgan's story, as well as a thoughtful examination of key characters' backstories namely john marston and dutch van der linde. without spoilers, the arcs these characters are given is top tier, and their relationships with each other make for a very compelling story from start to finish. along with this fantastic story, you're given a superb world to explore, with several different environments and activities to interact with. in this world, there are countless random events that can occur, making the world feel alive outside of your own immediate perspective. while just about every element of the world names, places, etc. is fictional, it is all rooted in real history. a lot of it is hyperbolized for the sake of drama, but you still inhabit a world that captures the feelings and sentiments of the people, politics, and culture of the time period. i can't speak much on red dead online but it seems like it was thought of in good spirit, but not executed well. if rockstar had put as much effort into it as gta online, maybe we would talk about it differently. for now, it just seems like a fun mode to hop into with friends one time, rob a train or two, and be done. overall, there's a reason many put this game towards the top of their greatest of all time lists, and that's because it absolutely deserves it. a video game narrative crafted this well does not come around very often."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-06,the game's nothing short of amazing! the amount of activities you're allowed to do and the level of details are insane! pack it up with a couple of mods and everything goes from great to phenomenal! strongly recommending!
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-06,"its an excellent game, there is no doubt about it. takes some time to get used to the game play with shooting, but after you do, its a vast world to explore."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-05,"this is by far the most entertaning games ever. there are so many small details and the devs do so well on everything, even the small bugs are fun to mess withthese bugs do not affect anything whitch is why they did not fix them"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-05,greatest game of all time... micah is the worst character in pop culture right in front of luffy
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-05,love this game surprisingly has the best horses out of horse games good story line so so fun go and get this game
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-05,"red dead redemption 2 is a game that lives up to the hype around it. the game has an amazingly written story that is both emotional and with some of the most memorable protagonists and antagonists to date, along side a very lively and immersive open world. the amount of the content the game has to offer is entertaining and there is a bunch of it from the main story, side missions, bounties, hunting, fishing, multiplayer etc... this is one of the rare games where i watched the credits to the very end despite the length. if you still have not played this masterpiece over half a decade later, i highly recommended you give it a try. final rating"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-05,"currently and has been the best way to experience the wild west of america in a video game. i've played hundreds of hours on playstation of the single player and online modes, still i find myself returning to new austin for more adventures to this day!"

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-05,nice game.but full of hackers in online. if you need to try this game you need to buy story only because story is very good. if you need to try online full of bitches and glitches etc and mainly hackers and mod users.its your choice.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-05,"red dead redemption 2  an addictive grind with endless adventure i've spent 149 hours in this game, and red dead online still has me hooked. playing as a collector and bounty hunter is honestly some of the most fun ive had in an online game. there's just something satisfying about tracking down rare collectibles across the massive open world or chasing bounties through epic gunfights. even at level 86, i feel like theres always more to do. the world is insanely detailed, and the way it pulls you in makes even simple things like riding through the wilderness feel immersive. farming collectibles, completing bounties, and just exploring never really gets old.  what i love  the collector and bounty hunter roles are super rewarding  the world feels alive, and theres always something to do  progression keeps you engaged for the long run  what could be better  the grind can be slow at times  red dead online deserves more updates  final verdict 910  if you love grinding, exploration, and that classic wild west feel, this game is 100 worth it."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-04,"this is the greatest game of all time. i have never felt such an emotional connection in a video game before in my life. i have watched a lot of tv and many movies, and this is just as good, if not better than any production i have ever watched. at the time of this review, i am on my second playthrough since the release of this game. this time i believe, that i appreciated it even more than the first. everything is so well written and worked that it sometimes feels like real life. i will leave this review plain and basic along as being spoiler free, but i was incredibly touched emotionally both on my first and second playthrough. this game is a work of art and if you haven't yet played it, i could not recommend it any higher. i have played almost every game in the last 15 years that is 'worth' playing and this, by far, is the greatest of them all. graphics 1010 story 1010 sound design 1010 music 1010 everything 1010 the only fault i have is that rockstar didn't make dlc for this game... i believe due to the money cow that was gta 5 but damn, they really should have. an absolute masterpiece of a game, and i genuinely believe, this will never be beaten for me. i just wish there was another 70 hours i could play. 1010  best game ever made."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-04,i recomend this game because of its beauty and the hard work put into it. but the gameplay is a cowboy simulator sold as an action rpg so its dull and the realism make everything slow. i have to force myself to keep playing it just to give it a shot. rdr1 was better
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-04,it's a very fun open world game. the missions aren't like 2 hours long which is good too so you don't get bored easily. i started playing this game with low expectations but soon realized it's probably one of my favorite games.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-04,"the game is an absolute masterpiece from start to finish, however there are quite some issues with the pc version. the game crashes randomly with an unfixable error code, sometimes the missions get bugged and npcs that you need to follow just dont move at all and the movement with keyboard and mouse isn't precise leading you to crash into trees or boulders while riding horsescoaches. i played rdr2 when it came out in 2018 on an one x and during my complete playthrough i haven't had a single issue like the ones above, so i would advise you to play it on a console instead of paying 60 euros for the pc version since the game is much cheaper on console anyways. i will still give it a thumbs up because it's impossible to dislike the game in itself, but if you own a ps4 pro  one x or better, grab it on console for less headaches."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-04,"realy fun and immersive cowboy game. it is full of details, a gripping story, fun interactions, and great gameplay. would reccomend it if you can run it."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-04,hands down the best game ever created. the immersion is insane and the story is perfect. almost 130 hours in and i'm on my second playthrough treating it more like a sandbox game not worrying about main story stuff. spoiler alert i just don't want arthur to get sick again  might just never finish the main story in this save. let arthur live out his best life enjoying the beautiful world around him and hunting and fishing and doing his little side quests. but all things come to an end eventually so i suppose ill have to let it go sometime...

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-04,"the beginning of the campaign felt a bit slow, but then it really ramps up in pace and difficulty, proving why its one of the best games around, with great indepth storytelling along the way."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-04,"very good story line, amazing graphics, runs smoothly. best game i have ever, played worth the money."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-04,massive open world with many side activities to keep you occupied even after completing the story which is very long.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-04,"the story and characters are fantastic, with one of the best protagonists in media history being front and center. the biggest gripes are that a lot of the actual story missions are highly predictable, and therefore lose a lot of their narrativeduringgameplay potential. secondly, the bounty system is wildly inconsistent when combined with the honor system. example you rob a train and everyone on it for extra cash, you end up having to shoot a few deputies before you can make your escape. after selling all the loot, you basically made 150.00. not bad! until you make it back to town and because you have low honor, the prices of almost all goods and services are nearly doubled. you lost money effectively, by successfully robbing a train. and the final gripe the online has been abandoned by rs, and is infested by cheaters on pc. rendering playing completely pointless. in conclusion get in, experience arthur morgan's story, and really take your time to get lost in it's world. when a lot of the elements come together, its truly magical. just force your way through the silly missions and don't be too much of a jerk."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-04,so fun esspesially story mode and stuff i reccomend the game to everyone from ages 10  20
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-04,the game is an absolute masterpiece. its just a shame rockstar treats it like a red headed step child.

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-04,"this game has completely changed the way i approach games. normally, i'm all about rushing through the main story and skipping side quests or challenges. but after playing this masterpiece, i found myself regretting that mindset. i ended up restarting the game, and this time, i took my time to savor every moment. i immersed myself in every side quest, every interaction, and every detail of the world rockstar created. it's not just a game, it's an experience. a genuine masterpiece. honestly, it may not have won game of the year, but it easily couldve been game of the decade."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-04,excellent story game! amazing graphics. truly a rockstar games classic. the game is made for everyone's skill levels.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-03,"when people ask me what i think about this game, i often joke that it's a really good tv show where you occasionally need to press the triggers at random to progress the story. this is an incredibly detailed and well realized world, with very good characters that have impressive depth for a video game story, but my gripe with this game is that all of this is trapped inside of the formulaic and repetitive rockstar formula, with a mission structure that constricts the possibilities of the open space the game gives you and will only let you proceed if you play out your role exactly as it wants and not a milliliter out of step. while that sounds overly negative, i think the story is good enough to be worth playing it, it's well written and compelling, for the most part."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-03,a very fun mixture of action and story with elements of mystery along side tension. lots of content to do aside from the story for many hours of play time. i would recommend this game 910.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-03,"i've already finished this game once, but i bought it again just to experience it all over again. i simply can't get over it. red dead redemption 2 isn't just a game it's an emotional journey that stays with you long after the credits roll. the story, the characters, and the world are so immersive that i found myself laughing, crying, and feeling deeply connected to arthur morgan and the gang. every moment, from the quiet rides through the wilderness to the intense showdowns, is crafted with so much heart that it feels like i'm living in this world rather than just playing a game. no matter how many times i play it, the weight of the story, the beauty of the world, and the emotional impact never fade. this game is a masterpiece, one that i'll never forget."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-03,like a mini movie. amazing story and open world. combat mechanics are great. micah is a rodent.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-03,"hands down the most beautiful and emotional game i have ever played. the world is so intensely beautiful, the map in itself is a character that has a personality of its own. the world is alive, animals that hunt and play and interact with the landscape. you real feel as if it exists without you in it. the characters each have their own storyline as you progress, they grow, they change, they fail. gameplay is slow but extremely rewarding. each chapter is a specific feeling. this game with make you laugh, make you angry, make you cry. its beyond a game  its a masterpiece"

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-02,"just bought this game last month for pc after having played it when it first came out on console years ago. it's even better than i remember probably due to playing on higher graphics and processing than console it also reminds me how far ahead this game and similar games were for the time they came out. i'm glad there has been a resurgence for this game and people are able to relive this game or even play it for the first time, we need games to return to the amount of care that was put into this game."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-02,"second time i played this game after realese! still one of the best games ever made! if you like videogames, you need to play it!"

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-02,"this is genuinely the best game i have ever played. it caters to absolutely everything i could want in a single player story game with a massive open world. the story is absolutely amazing, with lovable and tragic characters that i really got attached to, though i know others have their criticisms of them and the plot as a whole. one thing that i feel is undeniably outstanding is the world. it looks amazing and is so full of life and activity, and aside from it feeling great to be in, there is so much to do. random encounters with strangers, weird stuff that probably shouldn't be there, some isolated house in buttfuck no where that got hit by a meteor, etc etc. that's not even including the actual side missions, which are great in my opinion. combat is satisfying and fun to play and i love the entire horse system. it is genuinely just a great game and i love it."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-02,"very good game with a lot of content, very satisfying to remove people from life with firearms."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-02,"this game is an experience. story and character relations are extremely tight, the world is massive and packed with content, and if i had to describe it with one word, it's simply just alive. gameplay is not enough to carry the game however, very slow and atmospheric, if you play games to get an adrenaline boost, this won't be it.sometimes, there is no action for a good 4 hours online is fine, unfortunately it doesn't get updated anymore, but you can still sink a good 100200 hours in there."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-02,one of the best singleplayer story games i have ever played with great character development and many great scenes from people getting shot brutally to a beautiful sunset.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-02,very rich in story and gameplay mechanics. not much more to say than its an amazing game with beautiful graphics. you have to play it
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-02,"really enjoyable game. i'm not so much into the immersion aspect of the game and found the game to be a bit slow from time to time. however, this didn't keep me from spending dozens of hours in the game. all the characters are super interesting and feel fleshed out. i liked most of the quests and the story kept me wanting to return to the game again and again."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-02,"red dead redemption 2 is honestly one of those games that just sticks with you. the dialogue flows so naturally, it feels so human, the characters are written with such depth that you cant help but get attached, even the ones youre not supposed to like. i could just listen to the characters talk in the camp and it would be a great experience. its one of the best, or the best, open world experience for me, it has so many details that it just feels alive. even though the game released back in 2019, it looks better than most aaa games releasing these days, the landscapes are stunning, every sunset, every storm, its just breathtaking. and the soundtrack? oh boy, its one of the best i've heard, it perfectly captures the emotion of every moment. i decided to go for 100 completion, and honestly, it made me fall in love with the game all over again, the grind made me appreciate the game so much more compared to my first playthrough years ago. every little thing i did, every moment i spent in that world, felt meaningful. its one of those rare games where you dont mind putting in the extra time because its just that good. i think its not just a game, its an experience ill never forget."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-02,story is really good and it just makes you feel like a cowboy in old times if i could wipe my memory and play this again i would

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-02,"an amazing game with an emotional story. easily considered one of the greatest games of all time, and i would agree. if there's anything i can nitpick, it's that the game doesn't teach you enough about the controls and game mechanics. beyond that, i wish there was more story in the epilogue."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-02,"this is one of the most indepth games you will experience, regardless of preference between 3rdperson and 1stperson shooter games. it will lure you in you win and keep you till the end. graphics are nextlevel, even to 2025 standards. the biggest negative i have are about the controls. the pc controls are hard to master throughout the game."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-02,"the bar for video game narratives, motion capture performance, voice acting and world building. i cannot praise this game enough, played this many times now and it's always got new surprises even though i know the story back to front at this point. rockstar, compared to most other studios has an absurdly consistent track record, and i'm excited for what's next with gta"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-02,"one of the best games i've ever played. the detail, the story, the nuance and the vast size of this game are incredible. you can't help but want to keep playing it, there's so much variety for the player to do, you're never bored. once you're past the first chapter you'll be having the best time and won't want to stop. you have been warned!"

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-03-01,"played this game for years. grew up on the first as well as undead nightmare, and it's so nice to be able to have it on pc. the ability to mod the game is really nice, and online seems to be more active than it is on console for the most part at least. couldn't recommend the game more. a true masterpiece  if you're lucky like me as well, you might catch the game on sale for a solid 15 bucks, which in that case you are losing money not buying it."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,great story. best game i have ever played.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,best story game any thing u do can alter the game 1010
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,"good game , good story"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,the best game i've ever played. extremely good story. i love the soundtrack too.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,"probably the most immersive game i ever played, very realistic in a lot of ways. the attention to detail is amazing, the whole map feels alive and nothing feels repetitive, apart from the obvious, hunting, collecting ingredients and such, not that it makes it boring. hunting is really fun, especially some of the tougher animals which can one shot you if they pounce, just rip your throat out haha. even just riding through the countryside is brilliant, the graphics are amazing and not just for a five year old game either. sometimes i would even say when looking across the wilderness at certain times of day it can be practically photo realistic. there's games coming out now which don't look this good. i haven't encountered a single bug, glitch or crash since i started. it runs like a dream even on max settings. such a good game all round. update after completing it so, this is quite possibly the best game ever made, not only that, one of the best stories ever told as well. the story is fantastic, and really sad. so many twists and turns and without spoilers, things that don't often happen in games. there is a point where you think it is over, but then they have the epilogue. that itself is more like a dlc or a small sequel to the game where a lot of stuff gets wrapped up. also the story becomes so dramatic, towards the end, arthur is dealing with a certain thing, which only adds to the gravity and drama of the whole game and it is done so well. absolutely loved this from start to finish."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,this is byfar the best game i have played in my entire life it has countless immersive features and every single npc has a different backstory.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,"very good and realistic game, wish it had more features from the first game much like gta."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,"good game, good story"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,"this game is something i cannot seem to get enough of my roughly 80 hours including my ps4 playtime were heavenly. arthur is such a powerful character that he has singlehandedly altered the way my brain processes art forever. the ending will leave you at a loss for words, just like the story. you will be left craving revenge, which you get in a very satisfying way. saying this game is awesome is an understatement, buy it now and you will not regret a penny. if you want a nudge in the right direction for each ending, read this if you wish upon the best, selflessness all the way shall do the rest. the worst ending shall dawn upon thee, if your greed prevents you from letting john free. even good people like thee, can sometimes succumb to the hunger for money. a bad shell with a heart white as snow, may redeem itself by saving another fellow."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,"rdr2 is a rich world with many options for players to explore their preferred style of gameplay. the graphics are beautiful and the interactions are immersive. as an older game there are some stability issues and the pc keyboard  mouse ui is awkward. online play can be impacted by pvp griefing, but a relatively simple configuration file edit can be used to create a semiprivate world for friends."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,best rockstar story game ever
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,first half of the game is pure and absolute joy.. gets worse as the story progresses.. also theyre adding more bugs as time goes on
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,story is amazing! and deff gets u locked in
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,"i have at least 200 hours on the game on rockstars client but i rebought it just to be able to download it directly to my steam deck. this game is an absolute masterpiece, many people complain about the prologue and i understand that it can be a bit too long and tedious but to me it's not even worth mentioning. if for some reason you have never played this game, please do yourself a favour."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,"i bought this game on 3 different platforms, just to play it trough 3 times. if i could find it on a 4th platform, i would buy it there too, because this is just that good. if i didn't know how good this game was, and just saw all the people glazing it i would call it overrated, but no, this game is as good as people make it out to be a true masterpiece, 1010"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,"despite a surprisingly buggy epilogue none that have major impact, the pc port of rdr 2 delivers the same phenomenal experience as console with the advantage of mods and high framerates. i love it a lot and will definitely revisit it time and time again."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,graphics are incredible. so far story is great as well.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,this is top 5 video games i have ever played. the characters here is where the game shines for me. you are a good man arthur morgan
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,"there's no much more to say about this game that has already been said. it's a masterpiece in my opinion. as for playing on steam, i really recommend playing on foot with keyboard and mouse. with the gun fights, using mouse is a lot easier to get better aim. and for the horse portions switch to a controller."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,incredible game... amazing story... will be a game that i will always have an itch to play. i would recommend this to anyone who wants to play a single player story game and get lost in a world.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-28,"fun, even if you are just starting to play rockstar games. although allow yourself to get used to the controls for a bit. it's not skyrim. which is good and bad. but it is a masterpiece if you're coming from the bethesda world. it does take some time"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-27,fun but some servers online have issues with hackers or not getting into a lobby with friends but overall great game!
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-27,"great game with many small flaws that built up over my play through. lots of actions like shopping, skinning animals, looting bodies have really detailed animations that take way too long after the first time you see it, and the world itself can be a bit of a slog to traverse on horseback. that said, the game can have better views than ones you'd find at a national park and the storycharacters were the main glue that kept me playing. the underlying plot and theme was pretty compelling and it was cool to see how everything inevitably devolved"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-27,"an amazing, immersive experience. it's more than just a game, such a great creation. i wish i could live this experience again as i lived it the first time. i would absolutely recommend this game to anyone looking for a great immersive story"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-27,the single greatest game i've ever played. the reviews and everything said online about it is completely true and i would totally recommended to anyone regardless of what they tend to play. the story is on par with most hollywood and one of the amazing story ever told. the graphics are stunning and beautiful and make you feel like you are arthur riding the horse through the wild west as an outlaw.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-27,"blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness red dead redemption 2, an experience unlike any other game i've ever played. the game of the decade in my opinion. from running with the van der linde gang, helping strangers in their time of need, being outlawed by the government, robbing places, killing pinkerton scum, to giving us a warmth in our hearts that we will never forget."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-27,amazing story heroic characters satisfying gameplay
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-27,"this just might be my favorite game of all time. it is just beautiful in art and narrative. and seems infinitely deep in content. the characters are complex and fully realized, and the open world just begs you to explore. there are constant surprises in what you find, as well as the developers surprising attention to detail. the entire game and the experience of playing it is astounding."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-27,"great game and story line maps are hard to read, but that is on me"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-27,"the game is amazing, and could help you wind down after a stressed day or so. the scenery, the environment, the people,... they are all beautiful. your choices matter, both in the story and gameplay. whether you be a friendly guy helping people out or a ruthless gunslinger mowing down anyone you see, it's up to you. keep in mind that the pace is rather slow. there are no modern means of transport, just you and your trusty horse, and it may feel slow from time to time."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-27,"very good game, great graphics and good shooting mechanics"

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-25,"it is a great game, i got it on sale recently, the depth and detail of the open world can have you exploring forever. i've only gotten to chapter 5 so far but so far the story and characters are all amazing. in the beginning, the pc controls for the mouse and keyboard can be a bit frustrating, esp bc occasionally the tooltips are wrong or inconsistent, but once you get the hang of them, and memorize what does what, then it becomes pretty simple. then it runs smoothly. i'm playing on a 2070 with 16 gb ram, and it runs with everything on ultra with no problems. overall great game would recommend."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-25,"about 80 of the way through my 4th 100 playthrough i have like 800 hours on another account and thought i'm in a good place to review this game best things first the story  after returning to this game a little bit older i'm starting to realise how deeply brilliant the story is. the darkest story of any game i've played, and the only game that has brought me to tears twice. the only other rateworthy category next the gameplay  it's fine if you're just playing through the story, but this shit gets tedious on 100 runs. realism does not equal fun. but i still come back to it every time overall  910  yes the programming gets a bit ass but it doesn't matter. it's brilliantly written"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-25,"best game in history, i could never explain how i felt playing this masterpiece, wow wow wow. best. game. ever."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-25,"i never play video games but red dead redemption 2, that is not a game it's an incredible journey through old american history fightin' for your life and fightin' for your family tryna live your days with honor and integrity  that's not a game, that's an adult thing that's not a game at all that's like fuckin' shakespeare"

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-25,"this game is a masterpiece and worth every penny. i made a big mistake though and it is this being my first time playing a real game. nothing, and i mean nothing, that exists will live up to this game. it has also taken my life, i do nothing except play rdr2. sometimes i skip school to play it, i play it when i come home, when i'm with friends or loved ones, i dream of it. fair warning it's gut wrenching and it will leave you feeling emptiness,"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-25,the best single player game ever. the graphics are truly amazing.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-25,"this isn't my first experience of the game but it is on pc. the differences in quality and performance are much welcomed and it runs like a dream. i need not stroke the ego of rdr2, for it is unquestionably one of the best games ever created. the immersion is unrivaled. a true testament to the aaa industry. the longevity of the online game is a shame, rockstar lose points when it comes to abandoning the online. it could and should have been so much more than it is. that being said, it's a fun extension after you finish the story but you will start to grow weary of the repetion."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-25,"this is more of an experience than a game. it may play like a video game, but the story is one of the best that i have come across. it is a long game, but as long as you get past the snow, you will be hooked"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-25,absolutely amazing and i was completely immersed in this game definitely worth the money and the world and all of the quests you have are many the world is huge not to mention the graphics are amazing! all and all i would say buy this game its worth it!!

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-25,"if you enjoy story mode games this is a must play especially if you have played rdr. cant say that i am comfortable with the price but for the incredible story, gameplay and soundtrack makes it all worth your money. its a shame games like these are becoming more rare these days"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-25,this game was one of the best games i've ever played. from it's great story to it's tiny details it's world has. i even enjoyed just walking through it's world. i will still play this game until gta 6 releases on pc. great game

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-25,probably the most beautiful and detailed environment of any game i've ever played. tons of fun dialogue and stories to found simply by roaming the countryside or talking to people in a town.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-25,"very good game, take it slow though, dont rush through the story quests."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-25,the story and graphics is very good like we cant compare it . worth every penny

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-25,i'd give any amount of money to play through the story for the first time again.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-25,"this is one of those games that you just have to play over and over again. there is so much packed into it that you won't even see 5 of it on your first playthrough. the music? amazing. hell, one of the songs is still on my daily playlist. the graphics? to me, it is really nice. yeah, some stuff still clips through clothing or the saddle, but honestly i'm still surprised at how beautiful the scenery is. the gameplay mechanics? wonderful! i will say, sometimes the horses are a bit of a pain in the ass, but adjusting your controls and turning off steering via camera helps a ton. dead eye really made this a little more noob friendly, haha. the story? i don't even wanna say anything because i'm afraid i'll spoil it. let's just say, everyone i've talked to who played it cried at least once. you get so invested in the gang, honestly it is the best story i've ever played in a game. ever. it is one of those games i can't shut up about if you ask me about it. it is just amazing. buy the game."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-25,"the most fun i have had with a game since breath of the wildtears of the kingdom. i know some glitches are present and no updates have been made in awhile, but the story telling and arthur's character are amazing."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-25,"straight up one of the best single player games i've ever played. however, the online is lacking content and is filled with a niche community of sweats who hunt you down."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-25,"glitchy and frustrating at times, but overall it's addictively fun. it very much feels like grand theft auto with cowboys. i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys beautiful games with lots of areas to explore, hunting, or crafting."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-25,"bought this again on pc after playing over 200 hours on ps4. i have played the main story through and take my hat off to the developers for an amazing plot, but the main area this game succeeds in is the immersive world they have created. the npcs feel as close to people as i have ever seen and the world feels real. from the sound, the movement, the wildlife  everything. absolutely outstanding world."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-24,"very few titles have ever left me with a similar type of impression on my life as this game has. rdr2 is one of the best games i have ever played, and if you are reading reviews to determine if you should indeed play it too  do it, for you will be forever changed as a result. at its core, this game is a cinematic masterpiece of storytelling and action gameplay within a living, breathing world. after finishing my first playthrough, i was left with the highest and lowest of emotions. it felt like i completed a substantial accomplishment, yet i felt paired with heavy grief and remorse. u do not rush this game. u stop and hypothetically smell every single rose in the game, as you'll envy every chance that you didn't take when you are done."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-24,"just buy it when it comes on sale, a proper good sale price its worth it"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-24,"like the original, this game just has unlimited playability. i've played through multiple times on console and, upon finally building a new gaming pc, this was the first game a purchased and started playing through yet again. something about it just keeps me coming back from more. excellent story line and plenty of side missions to keep the casual gamer going for months. i love this style of game and look forward to a rdr3... even if it is still years away."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-24,"very good game, even better when you install like 50 mods in it"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-24,"100 would recommend this game to all audiences. beautiful views, ambiance, and perfectly crafted storytelling. however i would stand to warn that even with best of laptops or pcs, it will lag. as well, i had 40 hours of my game randomly deleted which was incredibly dejecting but i ended up going back to playing from scratch because the game is just that good. regardless of these flaws, it is still a gorgeous game with an even better story."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-24,"stunning graphics, nice open world where you can do and play how you want. enjoyable."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-24,"what a great game. deep and complicated characters, it's like a solid movie. pace of the game is amazing and nothing feels rushed. very detailed and lively world, some of the locations are just as beautiful and real as you were there, some dark and spooky which is amazing too and gives a certain mood  always good to have variety, obviously. some of the sidequests felt too short for my taste, but the main story is unforgettable."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-24,"this game has flaws but storywise it's flawless. the gameplay does become repetitive overtime, the combat is basically hiding behind something then pressing m2 and m1, the stealth is awful and there are still many bugs visually and ragdoll mostly, no game breaking bugs which is a bad rep for such a beautiful game. story is most definitely one of the best if not the best, you'll cry for sure. enjoyability is very good as the side quests are decent, some funny, some dramatic. as a game, this gets a 8.310 from me, as for story, easily a 9.910. also, having to use the rockstar launcher even through steam is insanity"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-24,controls are rough to learn but you get used to it pretty quick. very bittersweet story 1010 execution.

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-24,red dead redemption 2 is my favorite game of all time. even after the story there is so much to do.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-24,"had this on ps4, finished the story mode. picked up again on rockstar and again here so i could get it on steam deck. great sp, doesn't need a review from me. great game. magnificent. hope there's more life in the online and mexico finally comes around again.. 44 hours here at time of writing, but well into 3 figures across all 3. better than gta sp imho"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-24,"the game takes huge patience, once you pass the winter arc you will be rewarded a masterpiece of a game. also, if your graphics card supports it, i recommend updating the dlss version."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-24,its a really wonderfull game.the detailing in the game is fantastic adn ive seen any game like this when it comes to the detailing
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-24,trying to play it on steam deck oled. works great but im struggeling with controles p
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-24,"rdr2 is an openworld masterpiece that delivers an immersive, emotional journey through the fading wild west. the story of arthur morgan and the van der linde gang is rich with depth, moral dilemmas, and unforgettable characters. the world feels alive, with stunning landscapes, realistic details, and dynamic interactions. gameplay is slowpaced but rewarding, blending exploration, gunfights, and survival mechanics seamlessly. while the controls can feel clunky at times, the sheer depth and storytelling make up for it."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-24,"took me a while to get around to play this, but this is a game that keeps on giving and giving!!! well worth it in 2025"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-24,"probably the greatest, most fleshedout and immersive game world ever made. it's already nearly 7 years old, which is insane to me, but it's still one of the best looking games i've ever played, partially due to the incredible optimization. i can't imagine how much love and care the developers of this game put into it. 1110"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-24,"incredible plot, amazing characters design. flawless game i'd recommend. impressive, absolute masterpiece."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-24,first 30min its hard to understand the game mechanics but after that it is one of the best game of rockstar.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-24,"i never really got the hype around this game, thought it would be some boring rpg game but i finally gave it a shot and good lord this game is an artistic masterpiece, i regret not playing this game sooner, please do yourself a favor and buy this game next time it goes on sale i am very biased, you may regret not having a life or girlfriend but you wont regret this purchase 3"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-24,"probably one of the best games i've ever played. i can't even begin to describe how good this game is, it's an emotional rollercoaster. by the end of the game, you'll care more about your horse than your actual dog. 100 recommend to anyone who wants a masterpiece of a game. totally worth the price. the only complaint i have is that there's no soundtrack for the game on steam."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-24,likely the best game i've ever played in my several decades of gaming. top tier quality open world content and the most impactful main story i've experienced. this is a game i will never forget  its that good.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-24,"love the open world concept and the way the honor system works, along with having full control of the system, the attention to detail is truly awesome and i would recommend to anyone."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-24,1110 game!!!! made me cry like a little baby some of the best fishing video games has to offer. this game is the reason why singleplayer story games exist
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-24,"this game is amazing, the story is incredible, the graphics are insane, and you will make some memories with the characters in this game. i definitely recommend this game."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-23,this game will change your perspective on life. it starts slow but give it a chance it's a slow burn. the game really picks up steam as you progress through the missions.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-23,buy it. after beating the single player campaign i had a full mustage.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-23,"h1 story mode h1 unique piece of artwork, masterpiece and must play game. the story is the best western themed game can provide. the visuals are stunning and creates a pleasant atmosphere. the gameplay is smooth, good quality and immersive. h1 online mode h1 total garbage. has too many bugs and loading screens. pve seems fun but can't come close to story mode. pvp is not smooth, matches are too short and aren't fun for me at least. the world itself is perfect for social activities and i think rp mods could make this mode a more interesting place to spend time. h1 overall h1 i had high expectations for story mode and i got more than i expected. so i'm happy and will play it again after years. for online mode, i was disappointed. but it is what it is, no big deal."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-23,its an amzing game i would recommend even 6 six years later its an amazing westren master piece
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-23,"oh man..... playing this game for the first time in 2025, game is good at the beginning but gets better and better how the progress goes on and on. you smile, you gasp, and you cry and you cry a lot. tnx rockstar for this masterpiece. gta 4 was my favourite story game of all time but this is so close second if not the first. recommend with all of my heart!"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-23,"great game, best story mode out there and great online, no problem with hacks like there used to be, plenty to do online is a bit grindy, lots to do but you have to work to unlock a decent bit of it runs fine on my pc when i have it on lowmedium graphics, mine isnt quite high end but its pretty good, lower end pcs would might struggle definitely wait for sales to get it tho, i got ultimate edition for like 20"
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-23,"really fun, the story line is amazing, the only thing i would say is that its really easy to fuck up and accidentally hit someone."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-23,truly one of the greatest games ever made. so much love to detail in every corner of this game. you will fall in love with the characters andor learn to hate them. this game makes you feel with the characters in ways you cant imagine.
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-23,"life in the late 19th century, in the western united states. interesting story, development in terms of story, character and area is perfect."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-23,"best game of all time. no competition, nothing comes even close."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-23,"a stunning game, but the slow story holds me back there's no denying that red dead redemption 2 is a visual masterpiece. the graphics, attention to detail, and immersive worldbuilding are toptier. i've played through the first chapter 45 times already, but for some reason, i just can't get into the story. the slow pacing makes it hard for me to stay focused and continue playing. that said, i can still appreciate how wellcrafted the game is. the world feels alive, the gameplay mechanics are solid, and there's so much depth in terms of exploration and realism. even though the story hasn't fully grabbed me yet, i'm sure i'll give it another shot in the future. for those who enjoy slowburn narratives and deep immersion, rdr2 is a mustplay. but if you're like me and prefer a fasterpaced experience, it might take some effort to really get into it."
Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-23,"this one is rockstar's masterpiece. its a must play for single player gamers. play this, then go play rdr1. even if you played it on console already.... load up some mods and run it again. you wont regret it"

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-23,"red dead redemption 2 isnt just a gameits an experience. with one of the most immersive open worlds ever created, every town, mountain, and backroad feels alive, filled with dynamic npcs, random encounters, and breathtaking landscapes. the story of arthur morgan is one of the bestwritten narratives in gaming, packed with emotional weight, moral dilemmas, and a slowburning tension that builds to an unforgettable conclusion. every detail, from the way arthurs clothes wear down over time to the realistic way horses react to danger, makes the world feel authentic. its not a game that rushes you. the deliberate pace, from looting animations to the methodical gunplay, might not be for everyone, but it makes every moment feel meaningful. whether youre robbing a train, hunting in the mountains, or simply playing poker in a saloon, its easy to get lost in the sheer depth of what rockstar has built. if you have the patience to embrace its world, rdr2 is easily one of the greatest games ever made."

Action,Red Dead Redemption 2,2025-02-23,"it does lack a bit of detail in the online, they could have made places fun to search with unique clothing and guns. i open so many cupboards in isolated locations hoping to find something rare which does not happen. some annoying bugs including missions restarting at the very end which is super not cool. nice combat pve and pvp. the game has lots of qol details and a great feel it's a shame they didn't add a home feature where you could have your own house in a server. buildings to decorate and upgrade, more cosmetics and higher role levels."
