"Few games make me walk away from them feeling like they've changed me on a personal level but after RD2 I feel like I've literally lived a second life. The beginning is a bit jarring. From the intro in the snow, to the controls themselves, Rockstar wants you to take it slow. Initially I found everything a bit tedious but by the end of it I was as connected to Arthur Morgan as I've been to any video-game protagonist I've played as prior. This world is drop dead gorgeous. The plot and the voice acting performances left me honestly wondering why video-games cannot be considered for oscars. This is a western, a crime thriller, a Shakesperian tragedy, a comedy, and a historical piece all wrapped up in one.

"When I started I wasn't that much into west gang thing and gun shooting but [b] it's the best game [/b] in general and in terms of gameplay for me.
RDR2 is the most detailed game I've ever played and I loved it. The way this world works, animal roaming around, npc's reactions to your looks, the main - the realism it has. Details that make the game looks more real and personal for the player. I wish more RPG games with open world had it.

"This is not just any game but an emotional masterpiece that should be cherished for all to experience.


In this game, you follow the story of Arthur Morgan in 1899 in the dying days of the wild west as he travels from location to location with the Dutch Van Der Linde gang to escape the law after a heist gone wrong. In here you meet new people, explore the open landscape and engage with activities common during that time period. You can do side quest, or be a ruthless outlaw feared by all.



Rockstar really delivered in this game which is why they used most of their departments from all over the world and thousands of dedicated coders, art designers to create this wonderful masterpiece.





The story of this game is also an emotional roller coaster as you play as Arthur changing his morality as time went on and the ending could change depending on your honour scale so if you do more bad things you get a bad ending and vice versa.

Hunting is a great pastime in the game as you can craft items to upgrade your camp or customise your character.


Roger Clark did a phenomenal job portraying Arthur, his performance feels raw and real, the best rockstar has put out with

"★ ★ ★ 

This Review is for RD Online only. I give 3 out of 5 Stars for Red Dead Online

First of all GTA6 will launch in 2025 Fall which is Rockstar's no 1 selling product so there will be no Red Dead Redemption 3 for another 2 to 3 years minimum.  So Read Dead Online is good for a long time to come is a reason enough to play.

RDO is not a MMO, its more tilted towards PVP and offers great number of missions as Free Roam or Role based for Solo players who just want to have some fun playing a Wild West simulator.  The only frustration is that everything is a grind especially the Gold to unlock the Roles of Bounty Hunter after which it becomes easier but still a grind to get other roles. If you can bear this then the game would be a lot of fun on the long run although most will just get winded down by routine and stop playing.

Even if you are ok with grinding routine you have to bear frequent crashes, bugs, griefers and the worst of all idiot Hackers. The game has plenty of hackers whose sole purpose is to disrupt every other players session. Prepare to explode, set on fire or fall through the floor, chased by African Lions which are not even in the game, law officers spawning random with $50 bounty on your head, getting teleport-ed to Cold regions, cage locked, name spoofed or horse getting blown out of nowhere while you try go about your business. 

But if you can bear all this then the game is fun as 99% of the time you spend in the game you will be ok. 

Majority of the players are friendly so don't ever as a low level try shoot at another player. Everyone follows a simple rule. Don't shoot if no one shoots at you. Play will  'Defensive' option on so that you don't get griefed. I have wiped out, hog tied enough newbies who try a shoot at me only for them to parley. Generally keep a distance from other players but if you see anyone coming at you with a lasso shoot them and don't even thin about it. 

Once you get the hang of it (pun intended) the Game is so beautiful, relaxing and rewarding.

Cheers!

"I generally avoid buying games on Steam that require a third-party launcher, exactly to avoid situations like this. I purchased the game on Steam, but according to Rockstar's launcher, I don't actually own it. Sure, Rockstar says they're [i]'working on it,'[/i] but honestly, rather than waiting for them to sort it out, I'd rather wait for my refund to hit my account and buy a game I can actually play.

"Red Dead Redepmtion II:
It took me some time to get into this Game, Last Year i finally got into it and i really learned what everyone has with this Game. 
It is Hands down the absolute GOAT. I can Not believe how detailed and in depth this Game is. The vibrance and Deepness this world brings, is totally unmatched. With now way over 200 Hours and almost 20 on the Steam Deck(to simply enjoy this Game on the Go,btw runs amazing) , i am Still finding new stuff every single day . There is Just so much stuff going on and i Just wanna experience everything. Also the mysterys, the treasures and collectibles in this Game are Not as easy and obvious Hidden , Like in almost every other Game. But enough with That.
The Story around Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde Gang ist absolutely amazing , while rdr1 was amazing too(Love Marston and the ongoing Story)and It was so ahead of Its Time, this Just really feels so complete. I seriously have Trouble playing and enjoying other Games , cause it all feels dull, compared to rdr2. 
I think it was perfect for me Not coming into this absolute masterpiece, before i am almost turning 30 now. I think i needed to grow myself, to really grasp around the greatness of this Game , it's Story and it's world.

TLDR: Absolute Masterpiece, for me truely the Greatest ever . If you are Searching for en experience That will feed you hundreds, If Not thousamds of hours... Get it ! Esp. For 15 bucks or so.

"Red Dead Redemption 2 is the type of game to make you really appreciate the video games as a whole. Rockstar outdid themselves here with the amount detail put into everything such as the animation, side missions, journal entries, artworks, dialogue, the honor system and especially the design of the world and environments which stuck you in.

This game's characters are astronomical. From Arthur, Dutch, John, Charles, Sadie, Micah, Hosea, Abigail, etc. Every Single Character is simply amazing and will make you feel attached unlike no other games. 

You feel their hates.
You feel their joy.
You feel their sadness.
You feel their greed.
You feel their soul.

GOSH the music is an experience of its own. We got D'Angelo finally making music, Daniel Lanios gentle and atmospheric sound, Woody's Jackson high-octane beats. All of which accumulate to you unable to move from your chair to further play and feel.
The many tracks feel as if Arthur Morgan hears them in real time.

There are very few games that are in class with the amount of world building RD2 has, what I've said is only the crumbs to this masterpiece of a game. The only ones I can think are on level with this world building in my head are Disco Elysium, Super Metroid, Hollow Knight and Elden Ring. What I'm trying to say is that Red Dead Redemption 2 is a 1 in a billion game everyone must experience.

"I don't usually play through games twice, especially open world titles but Red Dead Redemption 2 remains one of the best games I've ever experienced. It was incredible back on the PS4 in 2018 and is still remarkable all these years later on PC. 

At 75% off in the recent sale, this was a fantastic purchase. It took me just over 35 hours to finish the main story once more, but in reality there is probably over 100 hours of original content here. The world is amazing, the story is thrilling all the way to the end and Arthur Morgan remains one of the most unforgettable protagonists in gaming history. 

Not a massive fan of the survival aspects like eating, hunting and tonics but those are easy to avoid if you want to skip some of the immersive additions. Money is a bit easy to come by also so things like robberies aren't really required. Fans of role playing may certainly get absorbed with all these extra gameplay features for a more realistic experience. 

The controls are extremely clunky and awkward at times though, especially indoors or trying to perform certain hold-button actions. Even with a gamepad, it can be rather cumbersome with a feel of input lag or general unresponsiveness. I didn't bother with the already-abandoned online portion of the game but that is another option to explore. 

Overall, this is an essential purchase especially for first time players and if you are itching to try it on PC after playing previous on console, it's definitely worth grabbing in the sale as it represents exceptional value for money at a discount.",True,2,0,2025-02-06 18:24:07

"Red Dead Redemption 2 is more than just a game—it's an experience that stays with you long after you've put down the controller. From the very first moment, the game pulls you into its beautifully crafted world, and the level of detail is nothing short of breathtaking.

The vibes are absolutely amazing. Riding through vast open landscapes as the sun sets, watching the light shimmer off a distant river, or camping under a sky full of stars — every moment in RDR2 feels alive and immersive. The world is rich with atmosphere, and Rockstar has outdone themselves in creating an environment that feels authentic and lived-in.

The story is deeply emotional and brilliantly paced, with characters that feel real, each with their own struggles and personalities. Arthur Morgan's journey is one of the best-written narratives I've experienced in gaming, and by the end, I felt genuinely connected to the characters and their world.

Beyond the story, simply existing in the game world is a joy. Hunting, fishing, playing poker in a dusty saloon, trying your luck at the blackjack tables (where you’ll probably lose more money than you make, but hey, that’s authenticity for you), or just wandering through a misty forest—the game rewards you for slowing down and soaking in the ambiance.

If you appreciate games that take their time and build a world that feels tangible, Red Dead Redemption 2 is a masterpiece. The visuals, the sound design, and the incredible attention to detail make this a must-play. It's not just a game; it's a work of art. 10/10.",True,1,0,2025-02-16 20:41:43
"RDR2 might be my favorite video game ever- no, favorite art piece ever. I'm not someone whose really into open world style games such as GTA or even western stuff, but this one has a special place in my heart.

At one of the lowest points in my life, and after many years of putting it off, I beat this game in its entirety twice. And i'm not kidding when I say this: this game genuinely changed my life and the way I view the world. Arthur Morgan is hands down one of the most relatable and most well written characters in fiction ever, and I oftentimes forget that he's not a real person in history.

Almost everything about this game, to its story and visuals, are gorgeous and breathtaking. I'm in love with the characters, the stories they tell, and my only wish is that Rockstar would focus on these characters and let us experience what its like to be them rather than milk their decade-old game's online mode. No other game has captivated me as much as this one, not even RDR1 (and I love that game too!) 

Obviously, the game itself is not without flaws (but like, what game isn't?) I'm admittedly not a fan of how the guns work compared to the first game. It feels like the focus was more on realism and that kinda tanked that aspect for me, especially the gun oil mechanic. And my #1 biggest complaint is still John's character model in the Epilogue (seriously, Rockstar??? WHY?) However, i'm willing to look past most of that simply because of just how beautiful the rest of the game is.

I can't believe I put this game off for so long all because I thought it was just gonna be ""GTA with cowboys and horses."" That cannot be further from the truth. That will forever be the biggest mistake I ever made. While I know RDR2 is popular, this is the only game I think deserves its high status. I don't usually say this, but this game is a genuine masterpiece, and it's the one game I think everyone (yes, everyone) should sit down and play though at least once in their life. It really did change my life for the better, as before I played this, I was not a great person admittedly, but this game taught me that to see good in the world, it all starts with you. I never thought a game about outlaw cowboys would be so emotional and make me cry. Arthur showed me what it truly means to live with ""high honor."" If I could give this game one central theme, it's ""be the change you want to see in the world."" 

I could go on and on, but instead of listening to me ramble about it, you should try it for yourself. It usually goes on sale for about $20, so if you can, please, just give this game a full play-through. It's well worth it, heck its even worth the $59.99 in my opinion.",True,1,0,2025-02-16 20:16:52

"Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5)

Red Dead Redemption II is not just a game it’s an experience, a world so immersive and emotionally powerful that no other game has ever made me feel the way this one did emotionally. Set in 1899, at the tail end of the Wild West, it tells a gripping story of outlaws desperately trying to survive as the world around them changes. With god looking visuals, deep storytelling, and unparalleled attention to detail, this game is a masterpiece that defines what gaming as an art form can achieve in every parallel. I can say with confidence that this journey was worth every moment.

Story Mode
The game follows Arthur Morgan, a senior member of the Van der Linde gang, as he struggles with loyalty, morality, and survival in a world that is leaving outlaws behind. The writing is phenomenal, and Arthur’s development is one of the best character arcs in gaming history. His journey is emotional, tragic, and deeply personal, making you feel every triumph and heartbreak along the way, along with every change he makes. The relationships he forms with the gang, especially with Dutch, Hosea, John, and Sadie, feel incredibly well made, and watching the gang slowly unravel makes you feel desperate and sad. Few games have ever made me feel so connected to a character or so invested in their fate.

Open World
The open world of Red Dead Redemption II is unmatched in detail and beauty. From the snowy peaks of Ambarino and its big mountains to the swamps of Lemoyne and Saint Denis, the east country side of the New Hanover and the deserts of New Austin with now Tumbleweed being a real town and Armadillo rolling on the cholera, along with the magnificent West Elizabeth with Strawberry and Blackwater, every location is stunningly crafted and feels alive. The world reacts to you in ways no other game does, NPCs remember you for actions you did previously by helping or vice versa, animals have lifecycles and they can rot all day if you kill them, and random encounters can turn into meaningful little side stories. Riding through the vast landscapes as the sun sets, watching thunderstorms roll over the horizon, or simply camping under the stars makes every moment feel like a living, breathing Western film.

Music and Soundtrack
The soundtrack is pure magic. It captures the essence of the Wild West, with hauntingly beautiful melodies during quiet moments and intense, adrenaline pumping compositions during action scenes. Moments like ""Unshaken"" playing as Arthur returns to camp, or ""That's the Way It Is"" during one of the game’s most emotional scenes, are unforgettable. The music, combined with the atmospheric sounds of nature, bustling towns, and distant gunfire, makes the world feel truly alive.

Gameplay
The gameplay is methodical, immersive, and deeply rewarding. Gunfights are weighty and satisfying, enhanced by the iconic Dead Eye system. Horseback riding is the best in any game, making travel across the vast frontier a joy in itself. Hunting, fishing, and survival mechanics add to the realism, while side activities like poker, bounty hunting, and treasure hunting ensure there’s always something meaningful to do. The sheer depth of interactions, from greeting strangers to robbing them makes every playthrough feel unique.

Achievements
Completing every single achievement was a long but rewarding journey. From finishing the gripping main story and obtain 70 gold medals, to mastering challenges, collecting rare items, and fully exploring the world, each achievement felt like an accomplishment. The journey to 100% completion pushed me to experience every aspect of the game, and every second was worth it even though I've already played it on console.

Conclusion
Red Dead Redemption II is more than a game it’s an emotional journey that no other title has ever made me feel. It’s a story about loyalty, loss, and the end of an era of people who are getting kicked out, this game brought to life an unmatched level of detail and care. The world is stunning, the soundtrack is unforgettable, and Arthur Morgan’s journey is one of the greatest ever told in gaming, one of the greatest characters in video game history. Having completed every achievement, I can confidently say this is one of the best games ever made, and an experience that will stay with me forever in my life.",True,1,0,2025-02-14 15:27:16

"Still completing the game, its an experience really. You feel like you live in America during 1890s, its amazing how much details and things they have. I mean its Rockstar, the price was the only issue for me cause I cannot afford full price but steam sales are awesome. This game has 100+ of content and I will keep updating my review as I go on.",True,1,0,2025-02-11 13:45:16
"An amazing narrative that puts nearly all its competitors to shame. Arthur is one of the most well written character's of all time, either high or low honour.

Hard to beat this as far as cowboy games (except the first game).

You just cant REALLY be an outlaw sadly, lawmen can spawn behind you in an open field or a wagon/bush/plywood and  have an instant retinal scan down to cellular level even utilizing the game's disguise system (Full mask, New clothes, New hat, Changing out of town/sight). 
Sad, but outside that if you keep your boots clean its great.",True,1,0,2025-02-10 02:09:36

"Red Dead Redemption 2 is an amazing experience all; stunning visuals, a well written story and a soundtrack that was stuck in my head for weeks even after finishing the game, it really has everything. Red Dead Redemption 2 has so many ways to make the world around you feel alive, amazing map design and visuals really come together to create an open world experience that feels higher quality that most games of the genre even in 2025. The immersion is only improved with random encounters, there is such a long list of random events that can happen - that you might not run into the same event twice in a play through. The character design for all of the gang helps the characters to fit in around the story without dragging it down or sticking out. The is a lot of story characters, and all of them are written exceptionally well, something that is hard to believe when looking at the depth and background of all of the gang. Overall, Red Dead Redemption 2 is an experience everyone should try if they're interested, there's truly nothing like it.",True,1,0,2025-02-09 13:37:35
"The gameplay is great, with the best example of Rockstar’s polish and attention to detail to date. You probably already know what you’re getting into on that front, so I will just add that the immersiveness of all the gameplay elements work well in concert with the story and setting. It’s a full world and a joy to explore.

Even if you know how this story ends, the admittedly long trek there is well worth your time. RDR2 left more profound an impact on me than any game I have played. The game uses time and openness to great effect, placing the player firmly in the muddy boots of Arthur Morgan throughout a dynamic narrative. You can play the game like a thrill ride if you want, but it provides space to think if you are willing to take the time.

This contemplative quality was something new to me in a game. It showed that video games have at least one literary advantage over film: participation in the identity of the character.

"It's a masterpiece.

Red Dead Redemption 2 is a perfect example of what dedication, art, innovation and love are capable of doing when creating a game. 

I personally love story games since they give me amazing experiences, and are capable of providing me learnings in life. The story that Red Dead Redemption 2 gives us is definetely one of those to remember forever. 

The immersion this game provides is one of the best I've seen in a long time. Just riding my horse for its vast lands, hearing birds singing, water flowing throught the rivers, and animals running is such a beautiful experience that comes directly to my hearth. The amazing sunsets give me calm and peace, as a unique feeling that not other game has brought to me.

The insane details that this games has always surprise me. I wish many other games put this dedication to small details, which despite seeming unimportant, make the game shine enormously. 

I see Red Dead Redemption 2 not just as a game, but also as a beautiful, immersive, moving and unique experience. I completely recommend it. Play it with peace, give it the time it deserves, and you will not regret spending every single second on this masterpiece!",True,1,0,2025-02-06 23:47:07
"With five years of gaming experience, I’ve finally found the one game I admire the most. Red Dead Redemption 2 is, without a doubt, the best game I’ve ever played. I bought it recently, and every penny spent was worth it. The immersive world, gripping story, and unforgettable characters make it an absolute masterpiece.",True,1,0,2025-02-06 13:40:40
"This game is an achievement that only hundreds of talented people, working years with 100s of millions of dollars worth of budget can produce.

The pacing of the story is all over the place at times. Some times glacial slow and others breakneck fast. There's also one section of the game that, although is a nice change of scenery could be cut out entirely and would only help the story as a whole.

Overall this is not an amazing PC port. There is stuttering, some relativity minor graphics issues, physics issues when playing over 60fps and crashing mid-mission. The crashing can be fixed with swapping the graphics API for Vulkan to DX12 and vice versa and the other issues can be fixed with mods but as these issues have been in the game for so long with no official fix, I don't think it's good enough on the developers part.

It took me several hours to really get into this game but if you're happy with tinkering with settings now and again I would recommend it.",True,1,0,2025-02-05 14:26:11

I just cannot enjoy it, the game is beautiful and immersive and seems like there could be some really fun aspects but it's just super grindy and any online match is just ten minutes of getting one-shot repeatedly by pay-to-win players. Add in a really hard to use UI and it just isn't fun or playable.",False,1,0,2025-02-04 19:17:23

"The game doesen't allow you to do what you like even though it is a singeplayer game and has some rubbish rule around no cheating or you cannot save????

Why is this a rule? Why not just block achievements or something why make saving impossible? I just want to clear a bounty I got because apparently this game has no self defence laws except of course when the NPCs are defending against the player.

Ruins the intractability with the game world which seemed very good until that moment. 

I just cannot recommend a singleplayer game that acts as if it is not your own game.

Edit:

Finished the game. The story is excellent really good but only if you can get over the issues the game also offers.

The gunplay is really bad, its a cover shooter and can be satisfying but the only real way to generate difficulty is for the game to chuck hordes of enemies at you which feels really stupid as the gang essentially goes around depopulating what little civilisation there is.

Looking further into interactions with NPCs, self defence really does not exist, you cannot ever defend yoruself with a firearm for any reason even if they shoot first in a crowded area. Robberies ALWAYS go wrong, you will ALWAYS end up having to shoot people during a robbery there is seemingly no situation where a NPC will look at the gun to their face and decide maybe drawing their carbine is a bad idea. This is of course excepted when you are in a story mission where the game pretends it has better NPC interaction features.

The controls are also awful, at least on PC, they dont all feel well thought out and easy to use quickly. Had to go into settings to change horse control scheme otherwise they go in circles. But also, during story missions the game tries to constantly steer you in the direction it wants you to go against your own input causing you to crash your horse into a tree. I've even had my own character start spinning in circles for presumably the same reason. Additionally, during gun fights, you might just refuse to pull out your gun? Even when selecting it on the weapon select wheel multiple times. The game also has this weird thing where it keeps unequipped your damn guns which is very annoying.

If you can get past all this the story is really, really good. And not just inside the main story but side plotlines as well as random encounters around the world are very well thought out and are fun to play out. Chapter 1 was a really good opening and the rest of them are similarly very good as you watch the plot unfold. The set pieces for the situations the gang get into are very dramatic and feel really good to play through.

The music is also really damn good and knows exactly when to come in or when to swell.

I would recommend the game despite all this just for the story, except for its stupid save rules. Rockstar should consider going to write a book or shoot a TV series instead of making games because I probably would've had a better time with a really good red dead TV series than this.  This game was a really nice ride, but its convinced me not to play any other Rockstar games. Except maybe rdr1.",False,2,0,2025-02-02 10:24:54

- Stunning visuals.
- Funny conversations.
- Real fucking danger if you like the aspect of unaliving yourself by mistake a few times.

Cons:
- I'm sorry, the respawning point is ON A STEEP HILL? 
- All the horses got me confused and I'm too emotionally invested in every one of them.

"I went into this expecting a good western gunslinger game with a decent story, and that's I'd enjoy it and have a good time, then be done with it. But no, this was so much more than that. The story of Arthur Morgan is one that changed me, and I struggle to think of how another game could make me connect to a character like this. As bombastic and insane as the story may get, it feels human in a way very few games do.

[spoiler]Seeing Arthur come face-to-face with his mortality was heartbreaking, and I don't think felt this way about a character's death in media ever. When you watch the character you've grown to love die like this, especially one as human as Arthur, it just does something to you. Most video game deaths leave me sad for a while, but then you get over it because hey, it's part of the story. This game made me mourn for a character as if he was a real guy I personally knew

"Great game with a beautifully written story, although the game can start off very slow. Once you get through the first chapter, it is very well worth it. In terms of visuals, the game is stunning and definitely holds up today however, it is quite resource-intensive, and the AA is very blurry no matter the settings at 1080p. I myself couldn't run the game at a higher resolution, but if you can play at 1440p with TAA medium and FXAA on, which allows for a much clearer image, audio within the game can be a bit quiet, especially when wearing headphones. I couldn't find a fix, so using subtitles is a must. The game offers a lot of content with many side quests and random interactions, which I hope to experience in my second playthrough.

"Steam asks me if I recommend this game: YES I DO. It is almost impossible not to recommend it is a classic everyone should experience. However if the question was how good the game is I would say ""good enough"". 7-8 out of 10 imo.

Unfortunately as amazing as the graphics, the dialogue, the characters, the sounds, the music is it is impossible NOT to constantly be bothered by the shitty gameplay, non-sensical story beats and downright horrible gameplay systems which are just either badly designed or poorly implemented or both. 

Every artist working at R* deserves a standing ovation for their work on this game. Gameplay designers, programmers etc. can all eat dirt for the rest of their lives. This could've been an all-time masterpiece but it is nowhere close to that level.

Every single interactive element in the game is bad while non-interactive parts are all great. The problem is that games are an interactive medium. RDR2 is not a TV show sorry but you cannot give a game with bad gameplay 10 out of 10. I don't care how good everything else is.",True,1,0,2025-02-02 12:11:47

This is one of the best games I’ve ever played. IMO, it’s right up there with The Witcher!

From start to finish, Red Dead Redemption 2 took me on an emotional rollercoaster, just like a truly immersive movie. That’s when you realize just how fucking incredible the writing and the acting is... the motions... it all feels so good and perfectly placed.

Beyond the main story, I had an absolute blast with some of the side stories scattered throughout the map. Even these optional tales take you for a long adventure with cutscenes and all! Honestly they didn't feel like some simple side mission, they felt like mini stories that add more variety and fun to the game.

And then there is so much you can do outside of missions... A true interactive open world.

And don’t even get me started on the graphics. I’m so glad I waited for a better GPU, because the graphics are breathtaking, the attention to detail is on another level.

The story? I don't even wanna say anything because I'm afraid I'll spoil it. Let's just say, everyone I've talked to who played it cried AT LEAST once.

"Red Dead Redemption 2 is often celebrated as a masterpiece of storytelling and visual artistry, yet its ambitious design is not without notable flaws. While the game crafts an immersive and expansive depiction of the American frontier, certain gameplay decisions detract from the outlaw fantasy that many players long for.

Narrative and Gameplay Disparity
One of the most jarring design choices is the forced narrative transition, where players eventually have to adopt the perspective of another character. Early in the game, you are given the reins to embody a freewheeling outlaw—a role that is both empowering and deeply engaging. However, as the story unfolds, this mantle is unexpectedly passed on, stripping away not only your established identity but also tangible in-game assets such as your hard-earned horse. This loss is more than just a setback; it represents a significant break in the immersive experience, forcing players to reckon with the narrative's insistence on inevitability over player agency.

The Enigma of Hidden Cheats
Another point of contention lies in Rockstar's implementation of hidden cheats. Traditionally, cheat codes serve as a playful nod to player ingenuity, offering moments of liberation from the structured storyline. In Red Dead Redemption 2, however, these cheats are tucked away throughout the game world and remain inaccessible until a much later chapter. This delay raises an important question: what is the point of embedding these features if players are denied the opportunity to experience them during the early, more exploratory phases of the game? The inability to unlock these cheats when they might otherwise enhance the sense of freedom only reinforces the game’s overall narrative rigidity.

The Outlaw Versus Follower Dilemma
At its heart, the game aspires to offer an authentic outlaw experience, but its design often forces you into the role of a follower within a larger gang dynamic. For many, the appeal of being a lone renegade—unburdened by the dictates of a collective—forms the essence of the outlaw mythos. Instead, the game’s insistence on a shared journey dilutes this independence, leading to a feeling of frustration. This design choice suggests that the allure of the outlaw lifestyle is, in the end, secondary to the narrative’s demands for order and progression.

Conclusion
While Red Dead Redemption 2 dazzles with its rich world-building, deep character arcs, and intricate attention to detail, its gameplay mechanics betray a tension between artistic storytelling and player freedom. The enforced character transitions, the penalizing loss of key items, and the deliberately delayed access to hidden cheats collectively undermine the very spirit of rebellion and independence that defines the outlaw experience. In striving for a narrative that is as grand as it is cinematic, the game occasionally sacrifices the player's desire to live out a truly unbridled life on the frontier.

In summary, although Red Dead Redemption 2 is a technical and narrative triumph, its gameplay constraints serve as a reminder that even the most beautifully crafted worlds can feel restrictive when they do not fully embrace the player's role as a true lone outlaw.

PVP is not smooth, matches are too short and aren't fun (for me at least).

"A Stunning Game, but the Slow Story Holds Me Back

There's no denying that Red Dead Redemption 2 is a visual masterpiece. The graphics, attention to detail, and immersive world-building are top-tier. I've played through the first chapter 4-5 times already, but for some reason, I just can't get into the story. The slow pacing makes it hard for me to stay focused and continue playing.

That said, I can still appreciate how well-crafted the game is. The world feels alive, the gameplay mechanics are solid, and there's so much depth in terms of exploration and realism. Even though the story hasn't fully grabbed me yet, I'm sure I'll give it another shot in the future.

For those who enjoy slow-burn narratives and deep immersion, RDR2 is a must-play. But if you're like me and prefer a faster-paced experience, it might take some effort to really get into it.

"Red Dead Redemption 2 isn’t just a game—it’s an experience. With one of the most immersive open worlds ever created, every town, mountain, and backroad feels alive, filled with dynamic NPCs, random encounters, and breathtaking landscapes.

Every detail, from the way Arthur’s clothes wear down over time to the realistic way horses react to danger, makes the world feel authentic.

It’s not a game that rushes you. The deliberate pace, from looting animations to the methodical gunplay, might not be for everyone, but it makes every moment feel meaningful.

"Red Dead Redemption 2 is nothing short of a masterpiece that redefines the open-world genre. From the moment you step into the boots of Arthur Morgan, you are thrust into an incredibly rich narrative filled with complex characters, moral dilemmas, and breathtaking landscapes that feel alive.

Visuals and World Design

The graphics are absolutely stunning, showcasing Rockstar's dedication to immersive world building and detail. The world is meticulously crafted, from the bustling towns filled with life to the serene wilderness that invites exploration. Every sunrise and sunset paints the sky in vibrant colors, making each moment visually captivating. The attention to detail extends to the wildlife and ecosystems, creating a believable world where every animal behaves authentically.

Storytelling and Characters

The narrative is a poignant exploration of loyalty, family, and the harsh realities of life as an outlaw. Arthur Morgan's journey is beautifully written, with emotional depth that resonates throughout the game. The interactions with fellow gang members and strangers alike are crafted with care, making you genuinely invested in their fates. The game's pacing allows for quiet moments of reflection amidst intense action, creating a balanced experience that keeps you engaged.

Gameplay Mechanics

Gameplay is immersive and varied, offering everything from intense shootouts to peaceful fishing trips. The controls may feel heavy at times, but they contribute to a sense of realism that enhances immersion. The ability to interact with the environment—whether it's hunting for food or playing poker with locals—adds layers of depth to the experience. While some players may find the controls initially challenging, they become intuitive as you adapt to the game’s rhythm. 

Technical Performance

The game runs smoothly that is if you have a good enough hardware to run a masterful AAA game like this. 
The ability to tweak graphics settings allows you to optimize the experience according to your hardware capabilities. Experiencing the game on Vulkan API is top notch even with mods. While there may still be occasional minor issues, they do not detract significantly from the overall enjoyment.

Final Thoughts

In summary, Red Dead Redemption 2 is an unforgettable journey through a beautifully realized world filled with rich storytelling and engaging gameplay. It stands as a testament to what video games can achieve in terms of narrative depth and world-building.

"READ DEAD REDEMPTION 2 IS ONE OF ITS KIND MASTERPIECE

Red dead redemption 2 is a true experience which I doubt, I will ever experience it again. I have never been a huge fan of Rockstar games because although I knew that they have brought mind blowing mechanics and genres into gaming such as open world and shooters but by that time there were already many successful games in this genre. I personally enjoyed GTA titles but more of the gameplay side than the story, there are exceptions , but rdr2 is something else. It  excels in everything - gameplay ,sound, graphics ,story everything.

It does not play like every other open world games even though it just feels like one. The game has lot to discover and unfold, the details in the game are insane. I have played the game of approximately 80hrs but still I am 100 percent sure I missed a lot of stuff. The open world so well made everything is so interesting and unique. Usually in open world games only tend to interest players only for few hours with its world and environment but then its just nothing and you end up just fast travelling from point A to B to complete the missions. But in rdr2 every journey is unique sometimes there will be nothing and sometimes there will random encounters and most of them are unique and different from each other lot of encounters are also general, as per the npcs routine. 

Everything in this game has been put a lot of work into, the game has so many details , the side activities like hunting, fishing are not just there to engage players but each of them have there own learning curves and can be considered completely different game as a whole.

The graphics look amazing, they a beautiful thanks to various whether changes and lighting and shadows. The graphics are not perfect there are some moments where they look weird but generally it looks amazing and moments where it actually looks as good as real life scenery. 

The story of the game is as close as its gets life, its a slow game in a really positive way, it wont test your patience but gives you some. This is a game where more the time you put ,more you will enjoy it. Don't hesitate to play the game even if you know any major spoilers there is a lot to experience. Yes, there are few problems like a dead online mode and problems with rockstar launcher, but these can be completely ignored.

RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2 IS A MASTERPIECE ,AN AMAZING PIECE OF ART CLOSEST TO LIFE PUT IN THE FORM OF A GAME WHICH MUST BE EXPERIENCED BY EVERY SINGLE PERSON.

I don't want 2 hrs tutorial wrapped in a well written story that eases me into the world and characters like no other game before - I actually want to run around a play the game as I want to. It's an open world, but most of the time you are following missions in which you are following NPCs who tell you what to do. After 10 hrs in, I get it - you are supposed to live the game, don't rush it, take it in. But I wanna be a badass cowboy shooting people, crafting and upgrading stuff.

"I played this game around release and stopped playing because everything was too slow, the gameplay was okay, and I just don't like open world games all that much. But I came back to it after hearing a friend to treat it more like an immersive sim than a game (and that most gripes I had about the game aren't really present if I just do the main story). I started enjoying it much more when I did that. 

I spent most of my time in the game hanging out with the gang, doing the occasional side quest and mainly just focusing on the main story missions. I had fun hunting, playing mini games, hog tying a random NPC then throwing them on the train tracks and finding secrets, but it wasn't really enough to keep my attention. I only really wanted to know what was going to happen next in the story. 

The story is great, however, I started to notice a pattern with all of them. Go to Story mission, horse ride for a few minutes while talking to one of the characters, follow said character around and go to where the game points you where to go, kill a bunch of people, and then run away. That's not all of the story missions, but most of them follow that format. It sucked me out of the experience a few times because it became predictable, but I was enjoying the story for what it was (I will say it's mostly noticable in the final chapters of the game). There are a few moments that even got me to tear up, but not full on cry. I feel like those moments make the game more than worth giving a try.

Gameplay wise, it wasn't my favorite. Once I finished the main story, I went around just doing whatever I wanted to do. While I appreciate the amount of things you can do in this game and the different ways you can play, I didn't find myself doing a lot of it. Again, open world games just aren't my thing (but I so badly want to like them, so I keep on giving them a chance).

Positive Aspects :

Stunning Visuals and Attention to Detail: The game world is incredibly detailed, with a vast, beautiful open world that includes diverse environments such as forests, mountains, and towns. The level of realism is striking, from the realistic weather systems to the way characters move and interact with their surroundings.

Deep Storytelling and Characters: RDR2 has one of the most immersive and emotionally engaging narratives in gaming. The main storyline is compelling, and the characters, particularly Arthur Morgan and Dutch van der Linde, are complex and well-developed. The game explores themes of loyalty, morality, and redemption.

Immersive Open World: The open-world design is meticulously crafted, allowing for both planned activities like missions and random events, such as animal encounters or chance meetings with strangers. It feels alive with dynamic wildlife, NPC interactions, and a variety of side activities, from hunting to poker.

Incredible Soundtrack: The music, composed by Woody Jackson and others, enhances the mood of the game beautifully. Whether it’s the orchestral score or the more subtle ambient sounds of nature, the soundtrack is top-notch.

Choices and Consequences: The moral system in the game allows for player choice in terms of actions and behavior, which can affect how NPCs react to you and can lead to different outcomes in the story, adding replay value.

Rich Side Content: There's a vast array of side missions, treasure hunts, challenges, and mini-games, making the world feel alive and worth exploring outside the main plot.

Negative Aspects:

Slow Pace: The game’s pacing can feel slow at times, especially with long travel times, drawn-out cutscenes, and moments where there’s little action. For some players, the slower pace can be frustrating.",True,0,0,2025-02-19 17:14:43

"Red Dead Redepmtion II:
It took me some time to get into this Game, Last Year i finally got into it and i really learned what everyone has with this Game.
It is Hands down the absolute GOAT. I can Not believe how detailed and in depth this Game is. The vibrance and Deepness this world brings, is totally unmatched. With now way over 200 Hours and almost 20 on the Steam Deck(to simply enjoy this Game on the Go,btw runs amazing) , i am Still finding new stuff every single day . There is Just so much stuff going on and i Just wanna experience everything. Also the mysterys, the treasures and collectibles in this Game are Not as easy and obvious Hidden , Like in almost every other Game. But enough with That.
The Story around Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde Gang ist absolutely amazing , while rdr1 was amazing too(Love Marston and the ongoing Story)and It was so ahead of Its Time, this Just really feels so complete. I seriously have Trouble playing and enjoying other Games , cause it all feels dull, compared to rdr2.
I think it was perfect for me Not coming into this absolute masterpiece, before i am almost turning 30 now. I think i needed to grow myself, to really grasp around the greatness of this Game , it's Story and it's world.

TLDR: Absolute Masterpiece, for me truly the Greatest ever . If you are Searching for en experience That will feed you hundreds, If Not thousands of hours... Get it ! Esp. For 15 bucks or so.

"The level of detail in this game is amazing and should be an example for the gaming industry. The world is well-designed; the nature and wildlife fit perfectly and interact with the characters and each other. For instance, I saw a hawk circle the ground and swoop down to grab a snake, or an owl capture a small creature at night. The game has so much to offer, with a massive world to explore and unique locations that sometimes lead to action or exploration.

The story was very engaging for me, and even on my second play-through, the characters stand out. The voice acting is solid, and the dialogue between characters is intriguing throughout the game. As the story progresses, the characters you started with change or reveal their true nature.

My only complaints about the story mode are that certain parts of the map are restricted until the end of the game, which annoys me in how it's implemented. Lawmen spawn out of nowhere, both in front of you and behind you, while invisible snipers shoot at you. This is unimpressive for a game that’s so detailed. The bounty system also doesn’t make much sense to me. For example, robbing a train without being recognized is impossible. Even with full disguise outfits, the law knows who you are right away. When robbing a train, the guards recognize you immediately, causing the bounty to start. Somehow, the law knows a train is being robbed in the middle of nowhere and arrives right away, leaving you with little to no time to loot the train. The combat is fun and simple to pick up, but the bounty system has flaws that hinder the experience. The game gives you multiple types of masks, but they don’t help much, as the law and guards recognize you instantly. The bounty starts rising quickly, making train robberies more of a net negative.

There’s not much to complain about in the rest of the story mode, but the multiplayer is a complete joke. It should never have been focused solely on making money online. The ridiculous prices in the online mode and locking items behind unreasonable levels are frustrating. The hackers are infesting the game, and they’re terrible trolls. It’s unplayable, and Rockstar developers have abandoned it because corporate greed led to a rushed and poorly thought-out online mode.

There could’ve been multiple paid DLCs that most players would’ve bought. The older game had a zombie mode with a short story—why can’t this one have something similar? It’s a missed opportunity for them to create both good content and a source of revenue at the same time.",True,0,0,2025-02-19 02:31:38

"A Cinematic Masterpiece of the Wild West Red Dead Redemption 2 is a monumental achievement in gaming, offering a deeply immersive and emotionally gripping experience set in the dying days of the Wild West. As Arthur Morgan, a member of the Van der Linde gang, you navigate a world of loyalty, betrayal, and survival.

The open world is breathtaking, with stunning landscapes, dynamic weather, and a living, breathing ecosystem. The attention to detail is unparalleled, from the way Arthur’s beard grows to the interactions with NPCs. The story is rich and emotional, with complex characters and moral choices that impact the outcome.

The gameplay is a mix of shooting, horseback riding, and exploration, with a slow, deliberate pace that encourages you to soak in the world. The multiplayer mode, Red Dead Online, adds even more content, though it’s not without its flaws.

Pros:

Immersive World: A stunningly detailed and dynamic open world.

Emotional Story: A rich narrative with complex characters and moral choices.

Attention to Detail: Unmatched realism and immersion.

Cons:

Slow Pacing: The deliberate pace may not appeal to everyone.

Clunky Controls: Some mechanics can feel cumbersome.

Online Issues: Red Dead Online can feel grindy and lacks depth.

I hadn't played the game since so i thought i just had bad memories and gave it a new try when it was on sale here but damn it still sucks! The shooting is horrible, the npcs have aimbot while its superhard to aim and shoot since the gun keeps ""bouncing"" and you gotta press shoot 2 times to shoot 1 shot. The face mask is horrible as well. I tried to rob a train with mask on and i only did 1 single car because i always got wanted when i did the whole train and when i robbed 1 car i jumped off onto my horse, wasn't seen by any guards but guess what. I still got wanted as Arthur Morgan when i was already off the train with my horse. This game is just fucking retarded and im tired of it.

Edit: Gave it a second chance. I have gotten more used to the bouncy aiming and the game feels better now but there are still bad things like some missions removes a weapon from my inventory or changes it entirely even tho i have my other weapons i dont use in a weapon locker. Or other times my horse just walks in a circle when i press w. It's a decent game with some big flaws.

"Got lost in the frozen tundra of the north. 
Waited arse-deep in a snowbank to find the white arabian horse. Tamed her after being bucked off into the river. Named her Juneau.

"I never cared much for Rockstar Games. Yeah I'd play through their games if I get the chance to, but I wouldn't think much of them.

My only complaint is how awkward movement feels with this game. Sometimes it has this habit of disobeying your controls and it does get annoying, especially during combat.

"This is an imperfect masterpiece. In Rockstar's pursuit to surpass the quality of RDR, they worked so hard on adding detail and quality that it's biggest strength is also its biggest weakness. This game is the virtual embodiment of form over function.

[h2]The good...[/h2]

First of all; this game is gorgeous. Nobody will contest this. There's tons of vistas in this game that compel to take a second and enjoy the sights. RDR2 is overflowing with expensive detail; in fact, no other game, is so insanely chock full of ""extra"" than RDR2; the animated muscles on your steed, the countless unlikely scenarios that could possibly play out, the extreme complexity of an animal getting skinned, fluids correctly pouring from holes in containers and so on... Rockstar certainly went all in with this one. RDR2 is well over 6 years old and it's still one of the most gorgeous games ever created. Not only that but the engine is incredible! No modern AI up-sampling or frame generation needed, this is absolutely brilliant out of the box on 2018 hardware.

The story is good, but it's not as engaging as RDR's. Some of the best content is found in the side quests; my favorite encounter was that of a widow, living by a waterfall, north of Annesburg. She's mourning her husband, who died from wounds sustained during a bear attack. This storyline was very engaging and I honestly wished that this was three times longer and even more detailed. Another great series of side quests were those of the veteran, living by the lake not far from there. 

The hunting is one of the best parts of the game and I'm not usually into hunting games. Finding specific animals is at times frustrating, but this makes the gameplay loop all the satisfying. It's rare that a portion of game simulation seems so well put-together that it feels like scripted content; when I was hunting the legendary panther near Bolger Glade, he stalked and killed me so convincingly and cinematically that I was convinced it was a scripted sequence. Only to replay the encounter later to find that it was just procedural goodness. Hats off! The animal models are all extremely high level. The range of animations for each creature is so extensive, that I wonder how they got every asset to fit within the 120 gigabytes the game comes in. 

[h2]The bad...[/h2]

After extolling all the qualities RDR2 has to offer, it becomes clear where the tradeoff lies; this game isn't meant to be rushed. This is an experience that's meant to be absorbed through soulful rides at sunset, carefully inhaling every moment and not rushing by all of it like the busy city-folk we are. Rockstar wanted you to pause and to enjoy every second. 

That’s why every menu takes about a second to dismiss, every action is painfully detailed; skinning an animal takes quite a while and although it’s impeccably animated, after having seen it over a 100 times, you hope for that rare occasion where the skinning animation gets skipped entirely. A button press isn't good enough for RDR2, Rockstar prefers you to hold that button for a few seconds. I get that controllers only have so many buttons, but the amount of time I lost holding buttons in this game is ridiculous. I get the intention, but there's too much of it. Sure it feels real, but it's too slow, too much form, not enough function. 

During my entire playthrough I felt tremendously clumsy; your weapons getting unequipped every time you spend a few seconds on your horse, the way you right click to interact with a person, but you also right click to aim. So when a hogtied enemy is laying at your feet, it's very frustrating that your aim goes to that hogtied person instead of approaching enemies. It took too much time and a few modifications for me to get used to the controls. Even then they use entirely different standards for parts of the game, for instance in duels or with specific interactions during missions. They have so many separate control schemes for so many different situations, that it just feels clumsy. Again; form over function.

 This problem is most noticeable on horses. These are absolutely stunning, however with this level of detail, there's so much added grey area in which the horse doesn't know how to behave. The horse is constantly pulling against the player's commands. Which makes things feel more realistic, sure, but there's too many incidents inside that grey area; there’s just too many cases to list where your horse does something unexpected resulting in bodily damage. This is particularly infuriating when in a rush... Form over function. 

Another popular criticism about RDR2 is the inflexibility of its missions. And I certainly agree with this. There's one way to finish a mission and any other way will result in failure. I honestly wished the campaign was a lot less long and allowed for more flexibility.

[h2]and the disappointing...[/h2]

During my achievement hunt, I was quite enjoying the entire process. The only achievement I didn't really like was getting a gold rating in 70 missions. Many of the requirements for the gold stars were ambiguous and somewhat buggy, combine that with the long unskippable walking and talking sections and the whole experience can become disappointing.

I quite enjoyed good chunks of the story. I particularly liked Sadie's storyline, although I wished she maintained a little more grace toward the end of her arc. I think Arthur if fine, but I only liked him half as much as I liked John, both in RDR and RDR 2. His story is nicely rounded out, including his relationship with Abigail and his son Jack. My biggest problem with the story of RDR2 though is what you could call it's antagonist; Dutch. I don't like him at all. I know his character evolves during the story, but from the first moments of the game, I couldn't stand his attempt at leadership and wouldn't have followed him at all to be frank. His overzealousness was telegraphed too much and I was expecting quicker and more interesting conflict than what we got. Furthermore I think his appearance at the end of Marston's story in RDR 2 was entirely unnecessary and would have worked a lot better if they hadn't squeezed in this pointless cameo. 

I wasn't really disappointed all that much but I felt the chapters of my review worked well in this format. There's minor disappointments throughout the game, but nothing too intrusive. I had hoped there would have been more debauchery in this game, you can be mauled by a grizzly bear, eaten alive by a cougar, you can shoot a pedestrian in the face with a shotgun; however apart from the gore, everything feels sanitized. The brothels are just for show, and the most action you can get is a wash from a saloon attendant. I wouldn't necessarily expect prostitute visits to be included, but I would've added a bit more maturity in a game where your body count effectively means the pile of innocent bystanders you've accidentally run over with your horse. I felt it missing stuff like a cabaret with uncensored Cancan girls for instance or a random John fornicating with a lady of the night in an ally outside the saloon. There's a tiny bit of this, but I'd have appreciated a bit more of this. To paint the raw picture that is the Wild West rather than for voyeuristic reasons.

Related to this is the gambling mini games. I'd expected more. I wished there was a high rollers Poker table to be available somewhere. At a certain point you can find exactly that, but it's only a robbery activity, not a poker game you can participate in sadly. I would have liked to see a mini-game where you can bet on fights and such.

[h2]In the end[/h2]

This is an excellent game that both surpasses and fails to reach the quality of RDR 1. I spent over 400 hours on this game and I'm very pleased I did, despite the frustrations along the way.

"First of all: It is a great game with lots of options how to play it. I really enjoy playing this game.

What does this game make so good?
- A really large map with regions with desert, mountains, swamp, plains and a lot in between. There is so much detail in the map (wildlife, plants, rivers, canyons etc.), that it is a great experience just to go (or ride) around the map descovering new details even after weeks of playing.

- The towns / cities are filled with life (domestic animals, NPC's, coaches, streetcars etc.) and look really realistic. You also find some dealers (general store, gun smith, doctor, saloon, stable etc.), that will sell you needed stuff as well as buy some raw materials from you (doctor, butcher, trapper). You also can buy horses or carts in the stable. 

- In addition, you find a trapper named Gus in some places within the wilderness (as well as in the largest town of St. Denis). He buy animal fur as well as full carcasses from you. If you bring these in perfect shape he will make clothes for you (you have to pay for it of course). This is a great additional to the ""normal"" clothes you can buy in the towns.

- You have a camp from where you can start exploring, stealing, hunting or else. This camp ist placed on the map when you start. You can relocate it into each region of the map just by using the defined order (relocation costs 2$). And you can improve the camp, depending on your experience level (and gold / money available).

There is so much in this game you can do or just leave it be, that writing all of it would take days (I think :-). 

But what I think is best in this game from my perspective: You have to make money as well as gold (legal or illegal ways are possible), to buy clothing, weapon, provisions etc. The second option to get ""rich"" might call rangers or even the cavalry upon you. But if you have enough gold with you, there are options to become a naturalist, bounty hunter, collector oder trader that offers you additional ways to make money, improve your camp etc.

I did not start the story mode, so I will add this experience to my review later on.
Have fun!

The game's only glaring flaws truly is it's movement can be clunky in the worst of times and the cover system is a bit jank. But it's truly an experience. Like Mafia 2. You play for the story despite what flaws may show.",True,0,0,2025-02-16 03:49:33

"I thought this game was overhyped at first but then when I actually got into it, it is a blast. Only 34.5 hours in and I'm interested in these characters and the story.

Most fun is with the random events and strangers. You can meet a poor lady who fell off her horse, some robbers pretending to be injured people, gang members surprising you out from the forests. 

9/10 game so far and I'm only 3 chapters in.",True,0,0,2025-02-16 02:33:10
"The graphics are incredible for 2018, and the story-line is better than any movie you've seen. You can tell Rockstar put time into this, including the game optimization to help it run smoothly. It's a slow-paced masterpiece that showcases the heart-wrenching story of Arthur Morgan. Highly recommend.",True,0,0,2025-02-16 02:28:20

"This here world? It's somethin’ else. The land’s wide, wild, and mighty beautiful—mountains, rivers, forests that seem to breathe with life. Every trail you take tells its own story, pullin’ you in deeper with every step.

The journey’s all about loyalty, survival, and the tough choices we gotta make. The Van der Linde gang’s fightin’ to survive, but the past don’t ever let go, always catchin’ up. The folks you meet, the decisions you make—they stick with you like the dust on your boots.

The gameplay? It’s as big and deep as the land itself. Whether you’re takin’ a quiet ride or ridin’ hard through a shootout, it keeps you on your toes. And your horse? Ain’t just a ride—it’s a true partner in this rough world.

Red Dead Redemption 2 is a damn masterpiece—a beautiful, brutal ride that’ll stick with you long after the dust settles.",True,0,0,2025-02-16 01:28:48

"This game is immense. The world is beautiful and the characters progress like a blockbuster Hollywood film. One of the best looking open world games I have ever had the honor to play. I could just walk around and venture the whole day instead of questing, or following the main story line. The mini games inside of the game are great too, from playing darts to poker. One of the greatest games that RockStar has ever created, and that is saying a lot coming from the folks who created Grand Theft Auto.",True,0,0,2025-02-16 00:59:08

"Holds up to the test of time. One of the greatest games of its generation, if not of all time. Well worth the replay.",True,0,0,2025-02-15 23:31:41
"Obviously haven't played this game enough (as of reviewing it's been 361 hours, equivalent to about 15 days straight). I loved this game so much I played it during my A-Level mocks, and had too many late-nights when I was meant to wake up for sixth form only a couple hours later.
I don't think words can give this game justice as to just how beautiful and jaw-dropping of well-written game RDR2 is. It's seriously one of my favourite pieces of media, and playing it first hand in my own perspective is honestly so much better than if it had been something watched as a film or TV series. We seriously take this game for granted, and no matter if the game is on sale or full price it's well worth it either way. Deserves game of the decade.

I've also spent many hours on Red Dead Online, and it's a shame that a game with such high credits in its story version doesn't live up to that standard in the online version. Playing as your own character with customisation is pretty good, and one of my favourite parts of the game. First 40 or so levels was decent enough, and grinding to level up was fun, however it did feel like a time waster knowing that Rockstar don't update the game anymore and have sort of abandoned it. If RDO was the same standard as GTA online, I could honestly have seen it being one of the best online player games, ever.

RDR2 is well worth it in every aspect.",True,0,0,2025-02-15 23:30:37

"Despite not typically being a part of the western or action/shooter game audience, I decided to give RDR2 a shot. And oh my, was I pleasantly surprised. This was my first Rockstar title, so it took some getting used to, but after a few hours I had gotten the hang of it. I quickly fell in love with the worldbuilding and characters of this franchise, and the way Rockstar really made the world feel dynamic. The world changes as you play, and every little detail is taken into account. Getting such a rich story mode instantly hooked me. Coming from the RPG scene, (especially the Elder Scrolls fandom, which has spent years waiting for ANYTHING besides a re-re-re release of Skyrim) I was also very appreciative of RDR2's roleplaying options. The game didn't railroad me into playing a certain way, letting me make my own choices and define my character how I wanted to. Your character's honor level will change depending on what you choose to do, and it will influence the ending you get. I quickly began to experiment with different loadouts and outfits, and thats when I felt right at home in RDR2. It has a lot of the features I love in an RPG, but in a cowboy/wild west setting! And It's great for replayability!",True,0,0,2025-02-15 21:48:09
"💙💎Red Dead Redemption 2 isn't just a game, it's an emotional rollercoaster through the heart of the Wild West.💎💙

💙💎The story is a masterpiece full of loyalty, tragedy, betrayal and redemption seamlessly. The characters feel like old friends, each with a unique personality and charm (except for Micah – he's the worst).💎💙

💙💎The world is a work of art. From dusty towns to snowy peaks, every detail is crafted with attention. And the graphics? Jaw-dropping. You'll catch yourself staring at sunsets longer than playing the actual game.💎💙

💙💎In short, Red Dead Redemption 2 is more than just a game, it's an unforgettable journey. If you haven't played it, you're missing out on a wild ride.💎💙

💙💎Dutch may have a plan, but Rockstar had a masterpiece.💎💙",True,0,0,2025-02-15 21:48:05
As realistic as a game can be absolutly loving the game mechanicas especially on how the horses work,True,0,0,2025-02-15 21:40:31
"Currently at the beginning of Chapter 3, and I still can’t put this game down. RDR2 is absolutely breathtaking—every sunrise, misty swamp, and snowy peak feels alive. I’ve spent hours just riding, hunting, and exploring, and it never gets old. The story is just as incredible, with Arthur Morgan easily being one of the best protagonists in gaming.

But having to be online just to play the story? That’s frustrating. I bought this game purely for the single-player experience—I have zero interest in RDR Online—yet I still have to deal with unnecessary online checks. In places where a stable internet connection isn’t always guaranteed, I can’t even play the game I paid for. A masterpiece like this should be playable anytime, anywhere, without Rockstar’s servers getting in the way.

If you love open-world games and great storytelling, RDR2 is an absolute must-play—just be ready to deal with some frustrating DRM.",True,0,0,2025-02-15 21:07:07
"Pros: Greatest story OAT
