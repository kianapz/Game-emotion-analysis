Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-16,"eu queria dar um 8.7, porm vai arredondar pro 9,unico ponto negativo nesse jogo perfeito em minha opinio,  o tamanho da cutscenes, elas so mt grandes, tirando isso seria um 10 facilmente"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-03-11,"i think these days people dont have enough focus time to play this game their brains are fried by social media etc just because you are walking long doesn't mean its a bad game i have seen a lot of reviews about it old games were worse than this and their main objective wasnt even deliviring stuff to a place.also let me talk about the game yes this game is very long and takes a lot of time but i find it relaxing occasionally you are on the verge of death tho i like how the map works that it connects with other peoples map and progress its amazes me it doenst feel like i am alone on a singleplayer game which is super good in my opinion but the map is kinda empty there is only bunkers,nothing to explore and dead environment i dont count cargo thiefs after playing zelda and other open worlds it felt empty compare to those games but i genuinely had fun playing this game everyone should give it a try"

Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-22,"i definitely recommend the game to those who abandoned the game in the first hour, you lost a lot, take another 3 hours at least, and then the game will drag you out, i'm the person who bypassed this game because i thought it was boring, but when i first started playing, these soundtracks and views made me stay so play to your heart's content!"
Action,Death Stranding,2025-01-15,"a postapocalyptic scifi game that is great looking, but also tedious. this game plays out like a futuristic take on ups. the player's job is to deliver packages in a desolate land filled with hills, cliffs and river banks. it sounds boring and it can be. but the story is intriguing and the cinematic cutscenes are astounding. diehard fans of hideo kojima will enjoy it, if not entirely love it. i would rate this with an 8 out of 10."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-12-25,"excellent game. i played it at the tail end of 2024. i'm not sure how the connected world is handled exactly, so i'm not sure that the state of the game world that i saw in my playthrough would be typical of that which launch players would have seen, or what a lone player in 2035 might experience. combat in death stranding is one of the more minor aspects of gameplay focus, which is atypical for a relatively open world action game. having said that, combat is certainly one of the main aspects of the game, if diminished in focus compared to other activities like traversal. i also found myself avoiding combat, either by bypassing enemy areas entirely or using caution when traveling through those areas. the combat in death stranding is very easy on the standard difficulty and this is likely directly related to combat being a side activity, but the combat is fun even if not challenging. most weapons are satisfying particularly the bola, but some weapons like the assault rifle are quite bland, clunky, and generally unsatisfying to use, partially because of the awkwardness of targeting. the game also allows nonlethal eliminations of both human and bt enemies, although sometimes the game's logic is contrived, e.g., the nonlethal assault rifle, which is the same as its brother except in name. overall, the game is instead focused on its narrative and on the traversal and modification of its world, particularly the cooperative nature of the the world. the attention to detail paid to the systems and environments adds significantly to them. while other games have inventory systems and an overburdened mechanic, only death stranding makes the overburdened mechanic fun, and only death stranding has integrated its inventory system so closely with the game's other systems, such as the movement mechanics. keeping the main character on his feet can be challenging at times, and this can be made much more difficult by extra carry weight. besides walking, the main character can leverage several other forms of transportation, such as vehicles. this forms the bulk of the game moving from point a to point b. the cliche isit's not always about the destination it's about the journey, and this game is a journey. it reminds me in some ways of the experience of watching twin peaks late at night. the acting and the writing particularly the dialog and the design of the characters' identities themselves are both top notch. clearly, the game designers used a lot of high quality motion capture. the overall presentation was striking, from the ingame ui to the episode title cards. additionally, the audio of death stranding is excellent. the audiovisual aspects remind me a lot of dead space in some ways. while kojima claimed to have invented a new genre of game, the strand game, he built a casual open world survival horror crafting game in order to deliver a strong story line with high production value. death stranding is above all a game, even if the cut scenes are long and numerous. one of the strongest aspects is how well the story beats are woven into the game. the flow from the game world to a story section is very smooth and natural, just like the systems at play in the game world. this is a game where you'll combo a lot, for instance, lb to bring up vision, while holding lb press dpad down to check on bb, while holding down, press x to unhook bb from your rig, then while continuing to hold lb rock the l analog stick back and forth to soothe bb. then press x again to stop soothing bb. management of your environment, such as bb, your equipment's range andor durability, or craggy peaks, is the main goal in death stranding, and the player is given a wide berth in deciding how to do so. my impression is that death stranding can be played in many ways, depending on the style of the player, and that many varying solutions and paces can lead to success. overall, i would strongly recommend death stranding to players who enjoy various genres, including players of every experience level."

Action,Death Stranding,2024-08-25,"very relaxing and interesting game. chill  perfect. when you understand that mr. kojima immersed the players in his life through allegorical images, thereby creating an autobiographical work, so words fail me. i also understand that the game isnt perfect, therefore kojima must fix game's minor problems in sequel. im kinda shocked how kojima left his loved saga that was allegorically imaged by cliff. a lot of metaphors, allegories, references, and this is kojima."

Action,Death Stranding,2024-04-15,"the best game i ever played in my life. this is one of those games that you either adore or hate, there is no third. story, characters, nature, these things make this game a masterpiece. 100010"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-04-10,"death stranding  2020  pc  played for 74h many dividing opinions surrounding the gameplay of this game, but an overall consensus on the quality of the storytelling and  game has a totally bizarre story arch, but interesting nontheless. a splendid cast of voice and motion capture actors. very pleasing graphical aesthetics and well optimised performance. the music score and sound in general is very rich and relaxing. gameplaywise, it is a proper openworld system, with many interesting alternative tools to achieve your traversal and cargocarrying goals. ragdoll animations are awesome, but vehicles driving physics are properly atrocious. overall death stranding is an outstanding game that has no direct peers for comparison, if you find the gameplay a chore, perhaps just watch a compilation video of all cutscenes, as the story is worth it.i am ready for ds2. story 9,510 gameplay 8,510 graphicsphysics 1010 musicsound 1010 final score 9,3210"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-04-08,"death stranding is a masterpiece. there is no soft way of putting it because that is simply what it is. it is the perfect combination of an interesting and deep story and a unique almost addictive gameplay loop. there was never an uninteresting moment where i looked at my phone for 50 hours! gameplay the gameplay, while unassuming, is unique and different. while there is the occasional 3rd person shooter sequence as you travel through mule camps, the main draw is the package delivery system and its intricacies of container damage and package damage and the like. bt portions also add an extra layer of heightened tension and worry listening to the sounds of bb crying as you try not to alert the various shadow demon things. story as for the story, as i can not go into much, i will just have to leave it to one word, breathtaking. its unique with a plot that may be confusing but once understood is very well enjoyed. onlineaspects the online portion of the game, while some people call it forced, i personally love the concept! the ability to help other players or porters without meeting them is interesting. you can pick up their dropped packages, donate materials to the collective of roads that everyone contributes to, build buildings that both you and other players can make use of, and finally just donate equipment for other people to use. side content the side content, while similar to the main content, is just as interesting as the main gameplay loop. i found myself delivering things to other peepers or cities not because of the rewards and the upgraded gear, but because i loved those characters and the fun they brought with them. the interesting stories presented by the mail and interviews also help this. overall i rate death stranding a perfect 1010. cant wait for death stranding 2!"
Action,Death Stranding,2024-03-21,"lets go for a walk carrying a creepy crying babies and just walk walk walk . nope this was boring. i like the music and the setting is amazingly good looking but as a game it's boring. made me think about those slow slow drama films or series. i usually like slow games but then they have to be interesting and have riddles and such that feels demanding and well, this was just walking walking walking, with an annoying baby screaming."
Action,Death Stranding,2024-03-17,"you collect likes like some silly little tictoc kids kojima took this long boring walk that you sometimes have to do in the game just to do some stupid quest and made almost an entire game about it. the same cutscenes after all the quests and you have to hit the skip button 4 times to skip until you finally see something. when you fall, which is often, you have to wait and press f, then wait and press 2, and then wait and press w, and then wait and press 2.......... and you will fall often.3. i have to use google to load the game, and this is new for me, and really stupid. 5. all delivery points look the same. really creative and innovative mr. kojima if there is no story, it's like this cheap or free game, with such pure repetition to achieve the minimum pc requirements, only to ask for your money if you want to progress faster. just watch the story on youtube, save time and moneydeath stranding"

Action,Death Stranding,2023-11-02,"this game just never ended  it kept going and going and going. like making content from nothing. another issue have with this game are the physics simulations  the simulations of humans and vehicles are super implausible and they actually get annoying and in the way of gameplay. also, the story is a bit 'meh' and weak on the ideas it brings in for instance, it has rather nave views of evolution and extinctions when i compare to some amazing ideas being transmitted like the matrix and how well versed the writersdirectors were in philosophy and concepts, this game is just mediocre. otherwise it is generally a good game i really loved the graphics, the story and the acting mixing cinema with games is super cool  i wish more people would do it, the music, the vibe."

Action,Death Stranding,2023-10-04,spoiler alert this review contains spoilers.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-09-26,"odd, compelling, and ultimately engrossing, death stranding is a genre mashup with more than a few ideas of its own. not quite a work of genius, it's nonetheless something that once again demonstrates the madness and brilliance of hideo kojima. tgg  8.5  10 audio 910 fantastic voice performances from a cast firing on all cylinders and a quavering scifi score lend to death stranding's atmosphere. tracks from artists like 'low roar' are bland but fit the game's quieter scenes nicely. it's like that bit where you reach mexico in red dead redemption, over and over and over again. visuals 910 an utterly gorgeous game with rich, detailed environments and memorable imagery that will live on in your brain long after you've stopped playing. rolling green, craggy terrain gives way to kneedeep snow, black sandy beaches and rainslicked, destroyed cities. the art design in general is superlative. playability 810 what death stranding sets out to do, it does incredibly well. the core gameplay issues are in vehicle handling, somewhat fiddly menus and interfaces, and moments when it looks like you can overcome and obstacle, but you can't. at its core, however, traversal is an enjoyable challenge, making something that could have been dull feel vital and fresh. delivery 810 the 'social strand' element of death stranding is excellent, ensuring that everyone pitches in for a common goal. unlike anything you'll have played before, kojima's open world deliver 'em up can grow quite repetitive, yet there's myriad elements here, combining to make something that's genuinely quite special."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-09-10,"i completely get the divisive views people have of this game. if you go into it with a preconceived idea of what you want the game to be, you might end up disappointed. on the the other hand, if you are open to it, a beautify, atmospheric, melancholic experience awaits. game play wise, the mechanics and combat are all pretty simple. it's a game you can switch off and play without much effort. there were moments in the game where the soundtrack aligns with the landscape and it manages to capture these moments of beauty that shine through the overwhelming feeling of oppressive hopelessness. those are the moments that made the game for me."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-09-07,"the game is very unusual, unlike other games, this is its plus. kojima is a genius. the music is just as wonderful as the gameplay. the plot is super and very complex. after the game, i watched a review of the plot that lasted 3 hours. a masterpiece"
Action,Death Stranding,2023-09-04,probablement un des meilleurs jeux auxquel il m'ai t donn de jouer. une puissance motionnelle poustouflante.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-09-04,this is a very divisive game for sure. that's understandable too. however it was very hideo kojima and i love everything coming from that man. not just because i like the guy but the ambition is always great and i always enjoy the experience. the game really starts to open up about halfway through and trying to get perfect runs for everything with the amazing soundtrack is just so relaxing yet terrifying if you let yourself become immersed in the world.

Action,Death Stranding,2023-08-29,main problem with this game is that it was developed more like a movie than a game. nobody has observed the development from a gamer's point of view. that's why the gameplay is so boring. they wanted to try something different but i hope the sequel will be different because this way it will never be a game that will appeal to everyone.

Action,Death Stranding,2023-07-16,awful. after all the hype around this game i'm very disappointed now that i've finally played it. all you do is walk or drive around and do meaningless missions. there are so many cutscenes it is more like a movie than a  the biggest problem with this game is hideo kojima himself. he's just not very talented when it comes to story telling. you get the feeling he wants to be a film director instead  creator. what you get is a big mess of a story that isn't engaging at all. for a game that relies so much on it's story this is a big problem. another problem is the resolution. i can't even set it to 1600x900 and i'm forced to play at 1280x700. they didn't even bother to fix this in 3 years. tells you how much they care about the playerbase. if you still want to play it wait for a big discount. at full price it is not worth your money.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-07-05,"they should have called this game keep standing because most of the gameplay revolves around not tripping while you hoof it over the country. it's the first time i've ever played a hiking simulator. this is what, at its core, death stranding is. a terrain traversal game. i've never played a game before where i was paranoid about tripping, and falling on my face, as i rushed to balance myself. in that respect, it is creative. but do i really want to be a hiking hero? nah. if they focused on making it a terrain traversal puzzle game. if they made the traversal more challenging and rewarding, instead of the long grind that it is. the action elements of the game are tepid and uninspiring. i just wanted to turn them off while hiking and get back to not tripping over rocks and staying out of the rain. if they cut all the fluff around it, the acting, the song track, the lame actionfight then they would have a game. at the moment the auxiliary parts of the game, like the excellent sound track, are the highlights. but if i wanted a soundtrack i would have bought it. and that's the problem with death stranding. it's core gameplay is too diluted. it could have been a strong terrain traversal puzzle game where obstacles required ingenuity and creativity from the player to overcome. as it stands, the largest obstacle is the grinding hikes around the country, and the second largest is not tripping."

Action,Death Stranding,2023-05-28,"fascinating story and a unique experience, but i really did not find the gameplay enjoyable. i felt like a slave pack mule delivering  for a cause i really did not care about, nor did the game make me feel like i should. i like my games challenging, but even on the hardest difficulty, i could just hold w and complete a delivery with an s rank for the majority of the deliveries. not for me personally."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-05-28,"my personal review for death stranding finished 29.06.2021 on pc the death stranding was gameplaywise first 10hours alright, nothing too special but still something kinda new, after those 10 hours it began to bore me and i had to take a break 20hours in the game. the gameplay in death stranding was 810 times boring and not inovative enough, but the other 210 times it was actually good. the bosses had little to no mechanics and i think those were the places where they could spice things up but they didnt. the graphics in this game were fenomenal, one of the better looking games ever. the world of death stranding is really creative and something really unique, for the story goes the same, very interesting and creative story with alot of turns and nice plot twists, i enjoyed every second of the story parts, even though i would like that the story was told a bit faster,i think that the story was very slowly told but other than that very well made by hideo kojima. music and sound system in the death stranding were fenomenal, really fit the scene. overall i enjoyed my 41 hours of death stranding and i would recommend it to people. the gameplay was a bit bland at times but the story, the world and the music make up to it."

Action,Death Stranding,2023-04-20,"this special concept makes the game very interesting and somehow i can't stop playing. monotonous? yes. gameplay is a bit monotonous but never boring. it's a kind of delivering simulator with some parts of action. these action parts make the game really exiting and challenging and it pushes you to level up for useful items and skills. graphic is great and up2date. setting is realistc and very atmospheric, but a little bit empty. so developers integratetd a multiplayer part to interact with other players but without seeing them in the world. however it works. can also be played in singleplayer without these aspects but activated online mode at any time. however, i'm sure not to play through this game twice. this game is definitely a developer's masterpiece. finally someone who dares to break new ground in tripple a category, even if it's not 100 percent perfect."

Action,Death Stranding,2023-02-21,"death stranding is an absolute masterpiece. its a triumph of one mans unrelenting, uncompromised vision of hope. so powerful was this vision that it gave a deeply cynical individual like me a reason to hope. its a technological achievement on so many levels. but perhaps most of all, its revolutionary story, outstanding characters, and singular theme of human connection is the lingering triumph of death stranding. it is simply one of the greatest games i have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. it is, in every single glorious way, a hideo kojima game."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-02-12,very underwhelming considering it comes from the mind of legendary hideo kojima. in a few words postal service simulator.
Action,Death Stranding,2023-02-08,"the gameplay is good surprisingly captivating, in fact. i'd give it an 8. but death stranding insists on putting its story at centerstage, so the enormous deficiencies of that story will enormously reduce your enjoyment of the game. a good video game doesn't need to have a good story. mario runs across platforms because his motivation is to save the princess... that's it. you're just supposed to have fun stomping on goombas. but mario doesn't ask you to pay attention to its story. it doesn't interrupt the gameplay over and over to tell its story instead. death stranding focuses on its story to the detriment of gameplay almost to its exclusion by the end. it tries to be a movie as much as a game, but the movie part disappoints again and again."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-02-05,"despite the overlyexplanatory last chapters, which just bounds you to shut up and watch the game, the artwork, world design, and acting was something we have never seen before. the game play itself is addictive, making you understand what got into the 'mule's minds. it is shame the story just settled for mundane love not a grandeur, pioneering paradigm, but nevertheless, love always makes best heartwarming endings."

Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-17,"as every delivery man should be. before we begin i will preface this by saying that i played the pc version of death stranding, played it in its entirety but did not get the platinum. this is the original version of the game. this is america death stranding looks like a typical kojima game the player is catapulted within the first few hours of the game into a sequence of cryptic cutscenes aimed at stimulating the player's curiosity, and right from the start one can understand the highly authorial tone of the work. the location is the usa, in a post apocalyptic setting. it is neither coincidental nor strange to understand almost nothing of the plot of this game in the first few hours, but it is precisely where the player does not fully understand the plot that he or she can begin to speculate, later finding themselves with pleasant predictions and surprises as the story progresses. in the first steps within the game, the mechanics that will later be used throughout the playthrough are brilliantly explained, thanks to the accurate level design and the clarity of the main mechanics. delivering packages death stranding's gameplay is one of the most talkedabout gameplays of 2019 between those who are bored and those who are thrilled, it is undeniable that death stranding created something new, which in today's aaa is no small feat. just giving the game an actual genre is complex, being that it created a new one in its own right. there is no denying that this gameplay, based on merely running from point a to point b is nothing epic, and it may bore the casual gamer, but if you take it the right way it becomes a very relaxing game, given also the mainly natural style of the environment. nonetheless, the game has several mechanics that can delight various types of players and different playstyles you can rush through the game skipping everything by bike, always go on foot admiring the scenery, or fight looters who will try to steal your cargo. there is of course no shortage of problems, but i will report on them in the game cons later. looking through unborns eyes graphically the game is really good, on consoles it looks almost always clean and detailed, on pc you don't notice excessive differences from the console version except for the rendering distance and framerate. the facial animations are decent but the models are superb. yet another merit is the world design the use of photogrammetry, the assumption of real environments to give the game a realistic architecture, makes the game incredibly immersive. in addition, the use of lighting and colors is always apt and impeccable. like sound effect on audio level, the game has very few imperfections it boasts of a soundtrack composed of dozens of songs always used at the right time, some truly catchy osts created specifically for the game, an astronomical cast with some of the best voice actors in the video game world, and a perfect choice of sound effects. but why 9? pros death stranding is one of those gems that should be played by those who are fans of exciting and intricate storylines. if what you are looking for is a game purely dedicated to gameplay, it is not the game for you, as that is not what it was created for. the story, world building and characterization of this work is one of the best ever created. all of this is extremely augmented by the fantastic actors used and the great voice actors in the cast. the study of the game's level design is almost always impeccable, and it suppresses the repetitiveness of the base game. cons the cons of the game are several, and they almost all relate to subjective tastes a player might have. let's start, however, with objective problems the motorbike the motorbike is one of those things that are essential to the game, but turn out 80 of the time to be extremely clunky, and you often find yourself stuck, bugged or in impossible situations. another thing is the facial animations, which as opposed to the facial models, turn out, due to technology, to be very expressive, and there are many scenes that would have been much more exciting with better animations. obviously the worst negative point of the game is, if given in the hands of a casual player, the lack of franticness, action, and diversity the presence of numerous cutscenes made many people give up on the game, along with the monotonous gameplay, and this is a shame, but as kojima said, this was calculated, and not everything can please everyone. rating gameplay 7 music8 story 10"

Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-10,"the story is typically kojimaesque, bizarre and interesting in its own way, a category unto itself. so far so good, although it caused quite a few raised eyebrows while i'm playing it through. there's one disappointing detail though. if i want to reload my last save, i have to quit the game into the main menu and hit continue, no easy way to do this directly from the esc menu in game. also, when i get caught by the monsters and end up in the cutscene that leads to respawning, there's also no way to just interrupt the thing and reload the last checkpoint before that. just to get rid of that cutscene and do another try from the last saved position, i have to kill the whole game via altf4 thankfully at least that works and i don't have to do this in the task manager, and start it up again. not at all userfriendly, this kind of crap effectively degrades even the best games to torture imho, even to the point of regretting my purchase. i was glad epic did have it on its free games offer for a time, i don't have to think about asking for a refund. overall, beautiful visuals, interesting story, great soundtrack 810. usability crap degraded to 610."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-08,"game is suprisingly good. i didn't feel bored at all. i thought i would fall asleep when i played it but i played it straight whole day without stopping. the game gives me something different than other games out there, the satisfaction when building stuff online with different people and linking the structure all together is what keeps me in the game for that long. the game mechanics is another thing keeping me in, because there's no other game that you will trip over something when you are being careless. the tripping mechanics also helps me understand how to walk faster and it is so funny to see the character keeps tripping but not falling at all. i also enjoy the combat part because i can't rely on the same weapon to kill the boss because of the ammo capacity and this keeps me focusing more."
Action,Death Stranding,2023-01-07,"um jogo diferente de qualquer outro que me fez me apegar a histria e ao produtor. death stranding no  um jogo para todos, e isso fica claro com as avaliaes e crticas, uma fico jamais vista, nem mesmo podemos comparar, pois no existe nada parecido. kojima sendo kojima... o jogo tambm pode ser difcil de entender, saber o que voc est fazendo naquele mundo vasto simplesmente andando para l e para c pode ser tedioso para muitos, mas, quando se sente a imerso que o jogo quer passar, isso muda completamente, voc se sente ajudando e fazendo a mudana na histria. a trilha sonora tambm nem se fala, tanto as msicas, quanto o som ambiente te faz sentir parte de tudo aquilo, deixo um elogio tambm para o elenco que atuou muito bem. death stranding  com certeza um jogo que todos vo jogar algum dia, gostando ou no."

Action,Death Stranding,2022-10-27,"i heard that death stranding was divisive. heeeh, no it's not. before it was replaced by the director's cut edition, the steam page had over 80k reviews, 92 of which were positive. these are not a number i'm pulling out of my rear end, they're the actual numbers. do you know the difference between steam and metacritic user reviews? you actually have to own the game on steam to be allowed to post a review. i'll let you draw your own conclusions."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-10-18,its an unique gaming experience for sure. the game world and the gameplay were top. but the story and confusing and not always easy to follow.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-10-03,"game with the best plot, i ever play. movies and games go to the same level. thank you, kojima for this game"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-09-18,"kojima is certainly not a genius, and the game is not without annoying flaws and problems, but it definitely deserves its positive ratings and reviews too. especially for some of the details that are omitted in other games, like the situation when sam breaks the camera if the player looks at the crotch for a long time... ... what i liked well, there's nothing to say about the graphics here, even such a deserted game world, nevertheless, makes you periodically to feel visual pleasure. music... not enough, but good. the atmosphere, if you play solo  you have it, if you allow others to enter your world  atmosphere goes on vacation. the characters and actors are definitely a great solution to give it such attention. the plot as a whole  yes, it was interesting, and in many ways well implemented, but it has also a minuses. gameplay... both liked and not. i liked the fact that this game gave a new experience. being a courier in a dying world, you could relax your brain, think about your own while driving, but also think over some routes, and manage to keep your balance in the right situations. i also liked the mechanisms and technology of the game a kind of brutal hightech, if i may say so. all these energy cables, special containers, shelters with hologram terminals. and so on. ... what i didn't like this game is exclusively for multiplayer. yes, you can go through it alone, but it will be so dull and stuffy that it's just bad! the concept of interactions is made in such a way that everything that other players build appears in your, and so you can help each other and put likes to each others, and all this is good, but! ...if you have millions buildings on your map, then what kind of atmosphere of a dying world and what kind of enjoyment of loneliness are we talking about? ...if you play alone, then you need to build a highway that is designed for many participants, because it consists of a million parts, each of which requires a lot of resources to build, and the real world will die before you complete this damn thing. by a certain point, i was very tired of it and i went through part of the game on the energy ropes. game play... this game is about a courier, not about a soldier, but you are forced to fight periodically, and of course, the final battles ... if in most cases the irritation due to an overly unresponsive reaction in battle has time to pass quickly, then in rare important and dangerous cases, when you need to throw one grenade after another, for example, and instead of aiming again, he stupidly does nothing, or when you aim, you stumble and he puts the weapon in your backpack, or when you run away, and he stumbles out of the blue because that in this game there is such a realistic balance that even a small stone is able to give you a kick, apparentlybut you can ride a motorcycle with the leaning tower of pisa from your cargo and control it as if it does not exist. this item wheel was often just infuriating, although it was felt that they tried to make a good tool. flawed fasttravel i understand that the game is about the delivery of goods and cargo, but it would be possible to carry, at least the tools. if fragile is weak for this  come up with another fasttravel. oh, and you can not put a person in a car, only on a motorcycle on your back. only few types of enemies. and only in the last part of the game you will meet two new creatures. stealth it is absolutely useless and primitive against creatures, it is needed just to walk quietly past them, at least two steps away ... against people, it helps in 3 cases out of 10, due to the fact that everyone here has scanners, and because for being quicker and easier to stun everyone than spending 100 hours neatly going through an almost completely open camp of enemies. ... and now i want to write about it's final chapters didn't like it, and infuriated a lot. 1 the idiotic layering of one intrigue on another, and then another intrigue that sits on the previous ones and drives with a whip from another new intrigue. i never liked santa barbara, damn! 2 stupid movie clich not to finish off the most important enemy... but no! ...i was called for help! ...and that's why we get another 20 drama likes and another stage of a stupid battle. it was terrible. then fragile, leaves the enemy alone behind the stones, goes to scratch tongues with sam for 10 minutes, during which the enemy could run away 100 times, and only then finishes him off. it was terrible... and finally a long epilogue with a bunch of pretentious overly abstruse and pathos scenes. i understood what the author wanted to show, but it was veryvery long and boring!. i love anime, but i also understand how far the japanese can go with their fantasies and metaphors. such an epilogue greatly spoiled the overall impression and forced me to finish the game on youtube, because ... i got tired ... i was very tired."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-09-10,it's a walking simulator. kojima is selling you a walking simulator. you play a mailman. one without a vehicle. you walk from a to b and deliver packages. you don't even get to fight. this has got to be the most boring game ever made.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-09-09,"i tried to finish it. i really tried because the story, background of the whole world, etc. feels so interesting. but the gameplay is so annoyingly boring that i just gave up after 8 hours. you really can't just walk all the time."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-09-07,"one of the best games i ever played. i played on pc. amazing graphics and history with an insane depth and meaning. if you love games, you will love this masterpiece, when you think you got the history sorted it swaps in a completely different direction. there's few games maybe 5? that made me want to complete them and this is in my top 1 for sure. i played hundreds of games but this one is just in a higher place i dare even say above them all perhaps it's the heart that pumps blood to all of them!"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-09-05,"such a pitty to call this piece of art game! the design, the plot, the soundtracks are next level!"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-09-05,"i've registered for the first time just to review this game. death stranding is an absolute masterpiece that changed my point of view on some aspects of my life. the visuals are so good that i've fear that any other title will look bad from now on. the story and narrative is out of the box, never seen anything like that. 1010 because this game deserve no less."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-29,"first off, visually i can't fault the game. it looks good. when it comes to gameplay however, the game is nothing more then a walking simulator. now, don't get me wrong, there are plenty of walking sim style games out there that i thoroughly enjoy. this, however, is not one of them. there is neither a good plot nor good gameplay that would carry the game as a whole. it's just empty repetitiveness. initially the game is quite intreaguing due to its atmosphere but rather quickly the plot becomes just a device to make you walk some more and repeat and collect and deliver more things repeatedly again and again.  shame, i wanted to like it, but it just doesn't work for me."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-28,"interesting premise meets mediocre execution. death stranding sadly doesn't do anything particularly well the initially alluring premise is belabored and convoluted, the characters and dialog are unconvincing and hard to get invested in, the cinematography is sophomoric and gameplay is ultimately relegated to a very thin experience that never particularly engages. all this contributes to the ultimate shortcoming of the game not being fun and kojima's selfservice cinematics being a long, dull chore."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-25,the game is pretty bland for the most part. it's all right for a game you semi mindlessly play. it really does feel a bit tedious in the long term. it would be a good logistics game but the moment you zone out oop you slip on absolutely nothing and that itch you started scratching turns into your character falling over. the story is weird and convoluted with elements that leave you scratching your head and questioning the rules of this world and why everything isn't already dead. you can rebuild roads but it takes so much resources and by the time you're done you've pretty much have no reason to use them. my takeaway is that it could have been better but instead of doing something great it tries doing everything and falls short on it all. it's still a fun experience at times and i wanted to actually see it through to the end.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-25,"this one is not for everyone. it has it's own specific vibe, but overall it's nice game. nice gameplay, nice plot, cool characters and good atmosphere. i would recommend everyone at least try this game."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-23,"no le doy un 3 por hater ni nada, simplemente no soporto que el objetivo del juego sea llevar cargas de un lado a otro, tener cuidado de no caerte, calmar al bb y la lluvia... y encima, el 90 del juego es una cinemtica. al que le guste, genial, te doy mi enhorabuena, pero a mi no me ha gustado nada esta experiencia, eso s, le doy un 9.5 a la temtica de la historia."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-08-02,"this is a kogima egotrip served in a beautiful scnenario. only if the game was more  no... a mandatory cutscene on every 30 min, with holograms, fetus, president of the united states, special powers, paranormal entities, govern conspiracy, time travel, ohhh realy? c'mon! only the timefall itself is enough for a entire game... so why mess all this up? kogima egotrip!"

Action,Death Stranding,2022-07-20,"si tienes insomnio esta podra ser la cura. death stranding es un juego que durante la casi media dcada que dur desde su anuncio a su lanzamiento se nos vendi como una total revolucin en el mundo de los videojuegos, nada mas y nada menos que el nacimiento de un genero totalmente nuevo. en palabras simples, death stranding es tomar la misin segundaria mas aburrida existente en los juegos de mundo abierto y dedicar un juego completo a ello, en death stranding eres nada mas y nada menos que un recadero, durante las 50 o 70 horas que te tome acabar el juego te la pasars caminando e punto a a punto b una y otra y otra vez, sin apenas grandes desafos y sin realmente hacer uso de todas las herramientas que ofrece el juego. narrativamente es lo que kojima nos tiene acostumbrados a ver, largas cinemticas con monlogos, si eres fan de kojima ese apartado no te decepcionar, adems de que en el tema grfico es bastante destacable, principalmente por las animaciones faciales. no te voy a mentir, si no tienes el presupuesto para comprarte el juego o las 90 horas libres que se necesitan para explorar bien su mundo mirate un walkthrough, te estaras llevando la mejor parte del juego, que es la parte pelcula y te quitas de encima el somnfero jugable que kojima nos vendi."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-06-29,"some people may find the gameplay repetitive and boring. but i average ets2 enjoyer find it simply not as dynamic as in other actionadventure games. except wellmade plot, the game also contents deep author reflection that has held me for a long time. of course, ds is not an ideal game. there were some annoying things, but i have already forgotten about them. the most disappointing one is the fact that you can't listen to beautiful soundtrack while doing orders. and physics is better than in real life. 910"

Action,Death Stranding,2022-04-22,"i have around 150 hours on the ps4 version and platinumed it, so you could say that i enjoy the game very much. death stranding is unlike any game out there. it's a thought provoking scifi world that brings fresh ideas and themes to the table, with a gameplay loop that's extremely satisfying and relaxing. this is one of those games where the more you put into it, the more satisfaction you'll receive. the story gripped me from start to finish. it's hard to comprehend how any individual could come up with this game's setting and scenarios it puts you through, how the world and it's story unravels around you. while there are some moments that i felt the writing could've been improved that's about the extent of my complaints with the game. the pc port is phenomenal. death stradning is a masterpiece."

Action,Death Stranding,2022-03-03,"just came to balance out the butthurt idiots who are right to be mad at cyberpunk. you gonna go review bomb every game that might have a crossover? this game is fine though, would rate it a 7.5"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-03-01,"as frustrating as it is brilliant, death stranding combines some of the most interesting element of open world sandbox games into an experience that is like nothing that has come before it! while the story is a rocky with it over use of mystique and troupes, death stranding really shines in its moment to moment gameplay. story  oh boy here we go. as anyone who has played a kojimbo game before will already know the story can be a bit all over the place. laced with wild ideas and concepts, death stranding asks the player at first glance to suspend their disbelief and keep an open mind around many of the games core ideas no matter how wild they can get. you are sam porter bridges, a delivery man in the post apocalyptic wastes of united states after an event know as the death stranding. basically the world of the living and the dead have collided leaving the souls of dead people stranded in the living world as creatures known as bt beach things. a bunch of strange paranormal things are going on, rain causes things to age at an increased pace and many of the humdrum things we take for granted now simply don't exist anymore. as a delivery man it is you job to cross america delivering packages and connecting the separated settlements back together. this is about all i'm willing to go into now as any deep would warrant a 30000 word count essay. just know that at its core, although confusing and troupe heavy this game has a wonderfully told high concept story about connecting to people. which at time can be heart warming and other brain wracking. gameplay  the term walking sim gets thrown around a lot in conversations about this game, and while not untrue there is so much more to this then meets the eye. this game is more about the journey then it is the destination and its those moment inbetween the tense actions sequences and cutscenes that really punctuate the game as a whole. camping out quietly with your bb as the rain passes, constructing elaborate structure for no other purpose then that they might help a fellow porter, finally scaling that cliffside you've been dying to look over. its all about the preparation and execution of these journeys. that's what makes the gameplay loop of death stranding so oddly gratifying. its also the quiet contemplations of the mystery and beauty of this world. these are moment where death stranding truly shines, and pushes you onward to continue sam's journey. while death stranding is a bit of an odd bird, not quite living up to grandiosity of games likes msgv it does a fine job carving out its own niche to be something truly unique in the industry! i hope kojima continues to experiment with games as a medium and open up new avenues for developers to try out inspire the undeserved hate this game got. gameplay 8 yes you do deliver packages story 6.5 enjoyment 9"
Action,Death Stranding,2022-03-01,"score 7.9 i think it's an ok designed game, but with massive problems. story too confusing, complex, extended and sometimes boring. i think the premise is ok, but they way it's delivered just doesn't captivate me like other games. gameplay this is the main reason i played the game, the gameplay loop just hooked me idk, i loved walking around delivering  building the roads, getting the 5 stars on everyone, collecting everything, exploring and finding ways to make it easier for the next time i'd pass through somewhere. combat combat vs other people it's very clunky but somewhat ok, i've seen worse. combat vs bts is plain boring for me, knowing that i had to walk around a region full of bts and knowing that it will take like 10mins because of them whilst i could pass normally in 10 seconds just irritated me, i didn't find it fun or challenging. just boring. visuals stunning, a lot of copy paste yes, but beatiful anyway. it's not a game i will repla, i got all achievments on steam, i had my fun now it's just stored in my mind. i don't recomend it for everyone. try and get it for around 10 euros, and give it a 1020 hour shot, see if it hooks you, if it doesn't give up."

Action,Death Stranding,2022-01-09,"deathstranding is a great piece of work, a game graffifically as well as a story of highend top class. the annoyance of the grade of eating some of the graphic bugs and other little bugs, eg buildings walls disappears, the objects are going to be invisible, the character hovers in the air. these things have been corrected before the release of the game would be worth the full ratings. that will have to settle for the average game among though it is many parts  and good game."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-01-03,very unique experience. be prepared for very slow pace of the game. visuals and storytelling are amazing. game only for those who seek beautiful story driven experience and have lot of free time to spare.
Action,Death Stranding,2022-01-02,"hideo kojima has a natural talent for storytelling, just that. death stranding takes place in a postapocalyptic high tech world, with elements... esoteric so to speak, but without being clich. far from it the universe created by the director is extremely intriguing, believable and very well structured. the story is worthy of an extremely highquality series or film i'd love to see one with the actors that make up this beautiful work as well. the beginning of the game is simply breathtaking and leaves you motivated to understand more about that universe. the characters are extremely charismatic, the content of documents found during gameplay, incoming emails and everything else that make up the game's lore are wellformulated, and kojima's likes system and online features work surprisingly well. and what about the soundtrack? simply stupendous!!! the way in which the songs are inserted in key moments of the game, when entering new biomeslandscapes, is exquisite, and emotional. by the way, the story as a whole is very emotional. all the facts mentioned above only intensify with the moment the world ishas been going through, with the pandemic of the new covid19 coronavirus, for example. the way game elements merged with reality iswas an amazing coincidence. the distance from humanity, the broken bonds, many deaths, the role of deliverymen... all of this converges in an unbelievable harmony and makes you reflective. i'm sure players who lost someone, or even struggled in the middle of the pandemic, must have been thrilled, a lot, throughout the long sam bridges odyssey. speaking of journey, the game is long and has a lot of content to explore. zeroing the main story and some side quests, i reached the 55 hour mark. and for those who love achievements or challenges, you can go well beyond that. i'm sure the biggest factor pushing some players away from the game is the cadence with which the story unfolds. it starts off very well, however, for the most part the story evolves rather slowly at the beginning and only regains dynamism towards the middleend of the game. however, i consider this wait necessary, which makes it worthwhile in the end. sam's efforts demonstrate how difficult the time humanity was going through in that universe is and how much effort it takes to unite everyone. the difficulty, the wait, the difficult deliveries, it's not just stuffing up sausage it's a narrative resource, a gameplay tool. finally, the plot twist's are very good and the ending is surprising. the price charged for the game is more than fair, it is a masterpiece, made with care and with a memorable story and characters. the promotional price for this game is a bargain. honorable mentions for the exquisite optimization performed, which makes the game run very well even on a humble rx570 4gb, and the compatibility on 219 monitors that only enhances the experience."
Action,Death Stranding,2022-01-01,"its a shame that some people won't even try this game because they read somewhere is just a walking sim, they don't know what they are missing, kojima somehow made walking an interesting mechanic of the game and walking,managing sneaking  fighting will get you through a beautiful story. after reading a lot of trash about this game i thought why not make an opinion on my own so i played it and i really enjoyed it. i went with my expectations low but to be honest this game is really underrated. the so called fetch quests aren't really like that, you have to plan carefully your load and even where you step so you don't not ruin the cargo meanwhile you see some of the most beautiful landscapes ever in a videogame so i wouldn't say its boring because the deliveries are not, yes they are time consuming and some of them very hard . i highly 2 things recommend 1st skip sidequest in the game, you don't gain much doing these but they wear you off, the game can be completed without them, just set focus on the main ones and the game is far much better. 2nd read a lore guidewith no spoilers of the game before start it takes 5 minutes but makes you understand a lot better from the very beggining. the story is really good, a good mix between sci fi and mystic stuff. oh and it also has some good combat and cool boss fight too and also it keeps giving you new stuff weapons, tools etc., you just have to wait because real action starts later in the game. it has a quality few games can presume and a excellent cast and performances and soundtrack. on the downside going through the menus in game is a disaster, i think this was fixed in the new version that came out recently but in pc not good at all."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-12-29,"the game is clearly meant, for players, who can enjoy a cineastic experience, unfortunately i started playing it on a day i had no time, so i got pretty quick annoyed, by the amount of cutscenes. if you buy, do yourself a favor and start it in the right mindset and with alot of time to start the first part of the game."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-12-27,charmfull in a way that you will notice under your playthrough while also providing an amazing moyivaion to keep going and giving you an movie like story while playing. can't recommend it enough it really got me invested.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-12-13,very unusual game but definitely an interesting one. kojima is obviously either crazy or genius. or maybe both.

Action,Death Stranding,2021-11-01,"game is very disappointing in many ways. first of, the gameplay, really something that does not belong in a game. moving your characters feels clunky, the suppose balance mechanic is very pathetic and only in the way of the game. my best guess is that added that to make it feel difficult when it is just a dumb constant struggle. the only maybe good thing, is that you like decent environment looking ok and some music that forces you to watch the game as a movie and not playing really. there is so much more that the game and not worth wasting my time with it."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-29,"if i were to rate this game after my first hour or two, i would have given it a zero for sure. i thought there were to many and to long cutscenes. and not to mention the stupid names that almost everyone has. diehardman, deadman heartman and so on. but thankfully i decided to play on, and after some time i started to enjoy it, and after some more i time i absolutely loved it! even the stupid names made sense after some time. one of the best game i have played, and believe me, i have played many! you just have to get past the tedious start of the game."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-18,"this game is a masterpiece. as everything kojima does. no surprise there. not that i'm a diehard fan of the man behind all this. but my god. the actors, the landscapes, the gameplay, the music, the graphics, the interface. nothing is bad in this game. i understand this game might not be suited for everyone, and that is all right. chances are, if you rated this game below 7 then you did not get too far into it and abandoned too soon. or maybe it's just not for you. it's fine. it truly gets better as you advance and explore. all the elements are so exquisitely put together in this game. it only make me want to see what kojima will do next. he is the nolan of the videogames. he creates pieces of art, but not liked but absolutely everyone. finally i want to say that the only reason this game does not get an 89 from me it's because of the little replayability. the pseudomultiplayer factor is a great idea, but some multiplayer more akin to dark souls would have been better. death stranding is called to become a cult title if it's not already and if you have a powerful enough machine to run it at 1440pmaxfps you will truly be astonished. one of the best titles i have ever played. give it a chance. and if you don't have this game already, wait for the director's cut. it should be dropping on steam in the coming months."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-10-16,"i played the original game on ps4. easily one of the worst games i've ever played for 8th generation consoles and among the worst i've played in general. the story is absolutely horrible and impossible to follow, a problem shared with metal gear solid 2, another kojima product i don't like. the gameplay is even worse and is easily the worst i've ever played on ps4. this game proves that kojima needs konami more than konami needs kojima. go back to konami please."

Action,Death Stranding,2021-08-20,"initially i thought the game was going to be what all the raving reviews were promising, a hard and weird, strangely meditative game in a forlorn world. after a while, i started to notice that it wasn't just empty in terms of nature having all but reclaimed the earth from humanity, but it was also really empty in terms of story and content. generic, empty base buildings with repetitive npcs, making me feel i was still one of only a handful of people in the world, everything else just being a bad simulation. things got worse when the multiplayer aspect started intruding  a virtual las vegas of poorly placed structures, signs and spoilers popped up out of nowhere. at this point, the game felt like an mmo i had joined after the crowds had already left the game because they realised it would really never be finished and would always remain empty. and in the end, that's my lasting impression of death stranding it feels like an mmo that failed  if you've ever signed up for an mmo with high hopes but quickly became convinced the devs had abandoned it and it would never really become what it could have been, not even what it may have been when people flocked to it, you'll know exactly what you're in for with death stranding. it's sad, because i can see the game it could have been, and it was a game i would have really enjoyed playing. perhaps that's why it got the good reviews the reviewers went in when it was still relatively virgin, with enthusiastic people flocking to it, finding it pristine. arriving to a festival where the budget bands keep playing to a few drunken people left on the field, among tons of garbage is no fun. very basic failings take this game from an 8 or a 9 to a sad, sad 4. i stopped playing."

Action,Death Stranding,2021-07-29,"death stranding is a realistic walking simulator in a postapocalyptic fantasy world based in the territory of america where we play as a cargo porter. it's story driven and has repetitive quests in a semiopen world. story is captivating and mysterious but i feel like there are some strange explanations inside missions and the initial tension and horror features evaporate shortly after experiencing them 10 times over. there are long cutscenes and a lot of unplayable scenes which you will be skipping on purpose after seeing them so many times and this happens when delivering a cargo, going to private room, repairing a bike and even when entering a bt territory, game stops you and goes into slow motion, like if it was not clear that you are going into danger zone from the signs around put by other players and these zones are same. even facing bts who are supposed to kill you, you repatriate and you need to be very bad at game to get to 0 health because after 20 hours in, they still did not manage to kill me, on the hardest difficulty. walking is the most common way of getting around, the transport on bike comes into play after 7 hours but still walking will be required afterwards. we have to balance our body so we won't fall and damage the cargo which in some cases can still be delivered if it's not too damaged. the problem is our character will start losing balance easily when carrying over 120 kg and everything above that makes him move very slowly. when our guy  sam  loses too much stamina, he walks slower, he can rest and sleep outside, refuel stamina by drinking a monster energy drink. the bike is charged at the power station but the territory first has to be connected to the first main city which requires you to deliver certain supplies. besides taking 2 to 3 km walks across rough terrain with heavy load on the back, there are two types of enemies bts and mules. first, they are ghosts presented in the very start, they appear in the rain which happens in certain areas. they react to sounds and drag you to death if you fail to run off. they can even throw you off the bike. second, they are bandits stealing cargos and use scanners to track your cargo whenever you pass by, they are using electrical weapons to stun you. they are afraid of rain. the enemies almost always respawn in the same areas. many players have put up signs of warning areas but still we can not fully avoid the danger zones, we can only maneuver in between them and outrun them when they start chasing us. the bike can also be stopped easily and it's frustrating to beat the same opponents especially because we will be running back and forth a lot. your character is a one man army but without real weapons, he is using his pee and poo grenades and can throw cargo or ram enemies with bike. he can knock them out. i see a big problem with building ladders and such to provide me the ways to cross some rough terrains, when going on the edges of areas, you are not allowed to build these bridges despite not being on the edge of the world map, just trying to avoid make a shortcut with a lot of fabricated ladders, the game easily prevents new players from seeing other players bridges and signs, why did the developers have to prevent a solo player from building in their single player game building anywhere they want when they grinded so long to have spare materials. the game does not respect a lot of my time and fails a mission by losing materials due to aging rain or bts, but even worse when an npc warns me about a nearby body to turn to necro but there is none marked on my map, nor receiving any objective, a couple hours later, a game is over when this supposedly marked body was not near, and was secretly time sensitive main mission as i can progress a couple hours but i can not continue afterwards. it is also dragging through its chapters like no other game. the story starts to stagnate just a few hours in, i reached only the 3rd out of 14 after 20 hours, still not completing all missions, you can see for yourself this game is grindy, frustrating and punishing despite not being very difficult. verdict 510 if i took the story separately, i would probably say it is worth watching if you like a scifi horror movie but the gameplay drags it so low despite being rather innovative at some areas and definitely a good portion of the struggle i was having fun. i can not recommend this game to the general audience, nor to the fans of long story driven rpgs. it is an exhausting and not very rewarding experience. i almost loved it for its visuals but then i get reminded how bad the missions are and how grinding has not helped me at all."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-07-28,"this game has some great graphics and music. but everything else ranges from mediocre to disastrous. the controls feel stiff, sometimes feeling sluggish other times just not responding to your input at all. i think this is by design but it's terrible and feels bad. everything is frustrating. you tilt, you stumble, you fall, you get stuck on rocks, packages fall off you, the enemies knock your packages off, you fall in water, you slide down slopes, vehicles stick slide bonce and defy physics constantly. the ui is a complete mess and an insult to user interface design. you have to press buttons repeatedly to do anything. animations play constantly and you have to repeatedly skip them. some you can't skip and they are forced on you by an overly egotistical game designer. nothing is fast or smooth. it's always slow, bumpy, frustrating, and too much. the combat is boring even on hard. there's no challenge at all. the boss fights are auto win they are so easy. the story is nonsense and it's told in a very repetitive manner, so many times i was just begging for them to get on with it so i could do something, even if the something was playing this boring game. of the thousands of games i've played yes, thousands this is in my bottom 5, and for games i've completed, it's in my bottom 5. and yes, it really is that bad."

Action,Death Stranding,2021-07-24,"death stranding is an 810. the story is a 610. the writing is terrible. the game is saves itself by allowing the player to mostly skip the story. the best parts of the story involve clifford unger. the gameplay is an 810. it is relaxing. it reminds one of driving or biking wherein one can listen to a podcast or music and never feel bored while doing so. with a 2nd monitor, casually watching a video is also possible. one cannot play death stranding while watching something seriously. one cannot watch a movie and expect to follow along."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-07-21,"first kojima game. gameplay definitely will be the biggest point of contention and the biggest turnoff. the gameplay is mainly focused on walking around delivering packages between different locations. the walking is surprisingly engaging though as you need to keep your balance and pay attention to the environment around you when walking to make sure you dont fall and that you can have packages in the best condition. there are also vehicles that can speed up walking, the vehicles are a bit difficult to control especially when maneuvering around rocks which there are a lot of. the strand elements of the game are definitely the most interesting, you are able to build structures to help you maneuver the environment such as zip lines, bridges or ladders. those structures can be built by other people and will appear in your world, essentially there is a connection between you and other players through these structures that can help you along in the game, you can subsequently build other structures to help people as well, you receive likes for doing everything in the game and a whole category of likes is getting them from other online players for using your structures or liking them. the connected nature of the gameplay in this element fits in well with the themes of the story which will be discussed later. this is the first game ive played that has elements like this built into the game, dark souls has this slightly with signs but not on the level that exists here. there are also some minor thirdperson shooter elements though they are a small part of the game and are definitely the most generic, the shooting isnt really that satisfying and was my least enjoyable part of the gameplay. story the story is the best aspect of the game and i will keep it brief as to not spoil it. the story essentially is about going from location to location connecting places to a sort of internet network in order to rebuild america, a huge theme of the story is connection. the story unfolds through a lot of cut scenes and dialogue and overall is fantastically well written and told. there are high emotional moments throughout and fantastic characters that you spend a lot of time with and learn about in full. the story goes very indepth in explaining this incredible world that has been crafted to give an understanding that is unmatched in many other games. while some of the dialogue isnt very good it is a minimal amount and overall the story is incredible. the top talented actors and voice actors make the lengthy cutscenes an enjoyable experience that grips you into the story. the theme of connection is tied right into the gameplay with the strand elements that work better than many other games that try to tie elements to the story. this tied with the mystery will keep you wanting to continue the story. graphics the graphics of the game are stunning as it creates landscapes from iceland in a beautiful fashion. the character models also all look really great. the models of the bts which are the main enemy of the game are unique and creates a great atmosphere. soundtrack the soundtrack features many really good songs that work very well with the game, the songs will make you yearn for more and can often evoke the adventurelike nature of the game. there is one song towards the conclusion of the game that is so beautiful and emotional that i still listen to it even after finishing the game. conclusion death stranding is a very weird game, it has a fantastic story and soundtrack with good gameplay that i enjoyed. the gameplay will not work for everyone and as such the game is not for everyone. if you can find something in the gameplay and love great singleplayer stories then this will be one of the best you can choose from. i loved it and am excited for more from kojima."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-07-20,"first, i have to congratulate hideo kojima and all his team. original story with profound emotional tones, complex story and overall enjoyable experience. this game needs some tweaks when it comes to the control of the character y some important aspects, when fighting especially. at the end the idea of players helping each other is kind of revolutionary, the way death stranding presents it. every cent i think is a valuable inversion for this game. hopefully showing the industry how to make a game not for the money but for the experience, the story, the pure idea idea of a mind i think is a genius on his field. this game will not appeal to everybody. there will be people that enjoy the peace it brings and other will just die from boredom. please before you play, be aware this game has a slow pace that requires patience. if people can enjoy this kind of piece of heaven you are signing for an experience that will put this game on the top games of all times."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-07-13,"it is quite ironic that death stranding has the best story i have ever seen in a video game but at the same time the single worst possible gameplay i could have ever imagined the story  the narrative is amazing and it is carried with solid acting and wellcrafted cutscenes that keeps the plot constantly evolving the whole story is like a puzzle on which every cutscene gives one small piece but at the end of the game all pieces come together and everything makes sense and it kind of rewards the players who have really paid attention to the details from the beginning which is the only element i'd say gives you motivation to continue playing to see what happens next. the gameplay  now you'd wonder, if the story is that good, the gameplay can't possibly be that bad right ? well no, but actually yes. the gameplay is one of the most boring, unsatisfying, frustrating, tilting i have ever seen all throughout my 15 years of gaming it is nowhere near bearable let alone it being enjoyable or fun. it's as if the developers tried their hardest to think about the task that most people hate to accomplish and turned it into a video game. walking from point a to point b couldn't even be that bad if the controls weren't this terrible, especially the vehicles however the game tried to come up with an interesting solution in order to travel faster which is creating structures like roads, bridges, ladders etc. but those are so timeconsuming to make and they cut such a miserable part of the roaming that nobody even bothers with them because it is not fun to spend hours gathering ressources and transporting them to a specific location just for you to save around 200meters of not having to ride through natural ground. the last thing i can complain about is how detached the gameplay is from the story, there is literally no link between both besides, the portion of the gameplay is much much higher than the interesting story parts where it should have been the opposite, you have 2 hours of walking and delivering packages and then 5mins of cutscenes but at that point you completely forgot what happened last time especially if you can't afford yourself to play it at once. long story short, death stranding is in my opinion a 30h game that should have been 15h at most. as a movie i'd give it a 10 but as a game i can't give it more than 5."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-07-09,"some may have made a joke or two in the past about how kojima could make a game about walking . and yet this game is praised so mightily only purely because kojima is associated with it . if you swapped kojima's name with a random person's name ...this game would have failed in selling no doubt . this game however is optimized well for pc and the story is incredibly interesting and original . no doubt it must be acknowledged how creative and original games are necessary for the gaming industry but this gameplay is an insult . and even more so charging the price of a triple a game when most of the game is going from point a to point b . it is similar to ubisoft far cry games where you take checkpoints . but of course because kojima is so hyped up , this game is treated sometimes as a masterpiece ."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-07-02,"this game is weird. the setting is a superserious postapocalyptic america trying to stop the next mass extinction event. none of the characters smile, tell jokes, or seem to have a sense of humor about anything whatsoever. yet the presentation of the game is full of absurd things like your primary source of stamina being monster energy drinks, your experience points are likes taken straight out of facebook, and lots of forthwall breaking stuff like norman reedus advertising for his own realworld tv show. the graphics are great and the performance on my pc was flawless. it took me 47 hours to finish the game and i didn't have a single stutter, crash, or gamebreaking bug the entire time. the gameplay can be a little slow and frustrating at times however, thus the 810 instead of 1010, but not bad enough for me to shelve it, i was always wanting to see what was next in the story!"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-06-30,"mmmm delicious game. with professional cutscenes , good music , characters too"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-06-24,"my exp i spent 130 hours and achieved 250 legend of legend of legend. death stranding is a boring, repetitive, sloppy game. game's story is lame. characters are flat. player just do deliveries back and forth. map is an empty structure, so called 'openworld'. multiplayer experience is poorly designed. i have no idea how this can called as a masterpiece."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-06-21,"i disagree that death stranding is a walking simulator or maybe it's the only legitimate one. for one, there is actual gameplay beyond that. and more importantly, even the moving around part is much more intricate than what i would expect from that label. and i don't just mean the balance mechanics where you have to actively compensate the cargo weight you're carrying on your back or in your hands. no, for me the most fascinating and enjoyable aspect was looking at the terrain ahead, and decide on the best way to move on. i regularly felt like i was on one of my mountain hikes where i have to use my judgement to find the safest passage, especially because the steepness in general, and especially the slope inclination in relation to your direction of movement, determine if you make it across without plummeting. add in the inertia mechanics when changing direction, most notably with a heavy load and at speed, and the result is a very involved and  in this case i think this overused term is appropriate  immersive experience. i had even more fun after disabling all the indicators for the next ladder or rope, because the landscape is crafted in such a detailed and realistic way that you organically find the most accessible way forward on your own, if you keep your eyes open. the visuals are incredible and hauntingly beautiful. and the slowpaced, methodical nature of the game really appeals to me the experience at times felt almost meditative, like real hiking."

Action,Death Stranding,2021-06-17,"people that say it's a boring walking simulator propably expected an ordinary shooter or something. i've never played a game as atmostheric as death stranding. of course you'll be disappointed if you skip all the cutscenes and expect loads of gameplay. like you can't expect a burger you bought to taste good if you only eat the tomato in it. yes it doesn't taste like a burger because you removed every ingredient that makes it a burger duh. the strength of this game is how immersive it is. as soon as i started playing, hundreds of questions started getting in my head and the longer i played the more questions got answered. tl dr don't buy if you are going to skip every cutscene and dialogue or don't care about anything about the story. but if you are going to let the game tell you its story, you are going to have a great time!"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-06-16,"the game's setting is amazing, along with its narrative. your combat may be relatively weaker than other kojima games but i still think it's a sensational game. perfect? no, but it's good. game is well optimized and with several activities across the map ranging from delivery to resource collection. the game may be boring for those who don't like to walk or explore, but if this is a style of game you like, i admit that this game has everything to please you."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-06-07,one of the greatest stories ever. ignore the 'walking simulator' critics and experience the journey this game offers. another masterpiece by hideo kojima
Action,Death Stranding,2021-06-05,"death stranding is just a glorified walking simulator where you play the mail man and promote monster energy drinks. because it's got kojima's name attached to it it's being celebrated as the second coming of christ, if this had been done by a no name independent studio it would get all the 1s of 10s it would deserve. fetch quests are the worst kind of quest in every game  in death stranding it's all you do. add atrocious writing to the mix not even kidding, it's as if a seven year old did all the writing!!"

Action,Death Stranding,2021-05-11,"great graphics even though the landscape looks very bland, awesome animations, very good sound, superb actors. thats it. the story is extremely weird and makes no sense. you dont get much explained either. you are a postman and considered a hero, even though people can just send stuff to each other via a grid. you just have to deliver lost stuff you randomly find spawns out of nowhere all the time or special items that cant be send via that grid. they always say that there are many like you, but you never see any, only the crap they leave behind. what do you get for your deliveries? likes. yes. likes. just like on facebook. the usa, where this game plays, also shrunk while keeping the same shape. its only a few dozen miles wide now and there is no sign of a former civilization, except some futuristic buildings and rarely a road or car wreck.... the dialogues and characters are typical for a japanese game, including their cringy names. just awkward for everyone nonjapanese. the cutscenes are too many and most dont add much to the story, yet they are done very well. the controls are rage inducing. always having to balance your body is just annoying after the first 3 hours. it feels like the devs just tried to make the game slower with that. the bike and other vehicles are no better. at first i thought i am missing a button when i drove the bike, because it was soooo slow much slower than in the intro. and even when i hit the boost its not much faster. it also gets stuck everywhere and the jump sometimes works and sometimes doesnt. its random. delivery missions thats pretty much all you do get extremely repetitive very quickly as well. avoiding bts having to watch the same animation over and over again, when they are detected is also just annoying to no end. also you can pretty much predict where their areas are located every time  they always block your way. always. its no challenge. just annoying, most likely also to make the game slower. and then to top it off you also have to watch for a baby and have to press about 5 different buttons just to soothe it that keeps crying all the time if things get a little tougher. again no challenge, just annoying. your allies just hide in their bunkers. most of the time you only see their holograms. they never even help you with a squad against those pesky postmen gone bad, not even with a proper weapon! i never got real weapons, aside from some clunky grenades that only damage one type of enemy, while youre pretty much effed against other enemies and have to stealth around them and use gadgets to fool them. you always have to carry a pile of extra gear to survive, which massively limits what you can pick up on your way or how fast you can go. it still made me play for about 11 hours, but then i had enough. its just too repetitive and annoying and the story just gets weirder and weirder and so doesnt keep you interested at all  no epic feeling at all, no interesting characters either. oh yeah, and it also features ads and product placement also in a very weird and immersionbreaking manner. no idea at all how this is so popular. tldr very weird and annoying postman walking simulator in a very weird post apocalyptic world, where postmen are the ultimate heroes and face unchallenging, very simple and very annoying delivery missions for likes as a reward. it looks very good, but its gameplay is some of the worst and idiotic console crap ive ever seen."

Action,Death Stranding,2021-05-03,this is a pure hideo kojima game. the story is very long and complex with cutscenes that last over an hour. the stealth and shoot gameplay is very similar to metal gear solid v and introduces new walking and building mechanics. the graphics and the game's world are so beautifully done that make playing with the camera irresistible. this game is not for everyone and i wouldn't recommend it to people that prefer fast paste gameplay. the game takes its time to kick in but when you let it grow into you it really shines.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-05-03,"very hard to even write the review about this game. it is extremely boring and slow. you are told like 1215 times in the beginning that this is a hideo kojima game, during the first 15 minutes of the opening cutscene, as if you could forget that. as a typical modern console game, the actual gameplay is about 5 of the game, all the rest is watching endless and really slow cutscenes. when you actually get a few seconds of gameplay to break your sleep  it's a kind of 'balance the ball' mini game combined with 'uber eats' courier simulator. it all creates a feeling of absolutely braindead game, which hardly requires any wits to play basically point to a direction and press w for a few minutes."

Action,Death Stranding,2021-04-28,"death stranding is beautiful. while its not the best game iv'e ever played, it is the game that has changed me more than any other video game before. before i can explain this, you need context. about a 3 weeks ago from this review, i was diagnosed with covid. i wasn't very sick, but the thing that was killing me was the guilt. having people from my school being quarantined because of me killed my mental state and made me a sad mess. the only thing that was keeping me happy was video games. death stranding was a game that i had been on and off playing since september 2020, and it has been a boulder in my backlog. when i started playing it again during my quarantine, i was on chapter 4. 2 days later, i had completed the game and was almost in tears. sure the game play is a slog sometimes and its extremely frustrating at times, but it made me feel all the more accomplished when i was finished. so many times when i was just going from point to point in the game, mostly on foot, i just found myself feeling so free and happy, whether its the gorgeous visuals or the serenading music. i can not tell you how many times i put my controller down and just stared at the screen in amazement and just marvel at what kojimas team had created. but the best element about this game is the story. it single handedly changed my thought of what stories we can create in a video game. the universe that kojima created while a little confusing at times, you come to connect with it because you are the reason it exists in the first place. you as the player brings everyone together in the story, and it is immensely satisfying to see the outcome. and my god the performances, jesus christ they are fantastic. i wont spoil it for you, but troy bakers character and tommie jenkins character are scene stealing at some points. the ending is basically a hour long movie, and im not gonna lie i cried. this game means so much as it was my main comfort in one of the worst times of my life. thank you for reading this review, and i hope that you get to experience this game in some way shape or form. its truly some of the best the medium has to offer."

Action,Death Stranding,2021-04-22,"i feel stupid for having bought on promotion. fantastic game, fantastic story. i look forward for the dlc or the sequel."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-04-13,"this is a very difficult game to review but i will divide it into sections gameplay this part of the game is definitely the hardest part to talk about. is it a walking simulator? is it very fun? id say no to both. it is not a walking simulator. walking simulators are just mindless walking and you can literally complete the game by just holding your joystick. do that in death stranding and you are screwed. it is also not really fun but it is very satisfying. this is a game where you just sit back and relax and just enjoy the world around you while doing your work. the game is work, you are working so other players will work less. thats what the game was trying to do and for the most part they nailed it. even tho the world is just plain emptiness but when you play the game for at least 20 hours, you will feel connected to each location and memorize every single obstacle youll encounter in that location. not many people have said this but this gameplay loop reminds me a lot of the witcher 3. in the witcher 3, you are fighting monsters but if you play it on a harder difficulty, you really gotta think hard before fighting a monster. you gotta read about the monster, understand its weakness, plan your attacks and prepare some potions or oil. death stranding has a very similar loop, look at the map and check out the best route to pass through whether hiking up the mountain or going around that mountain, you gotta bring things you might need like ladders, guns, ropes, grenades etc and afterwards you just gotta execute it right or else the consequences will be dire. a consequences worse than death in a video game. that is the satisfaction in death strandings gameplay and i have rarely ever played a game like this. this is what you would call a brave game, a game that does something so risky but somehow does it very well. but i have a tiny nitpick for the gameplay tho, the ropes are really  buggy and there are only 1 climbing animations which seems lazy, vehicle driving is really bad, moving norman reedus will take a bit of time to get used to and you can't play music whenever you want which is so damn disappointing. world  visuals this game is beautiful. you have never seen a world like this. most games take place in the wild west, zombie apocalypse, new york, etc but you have never seen a world like this. rain can age everything it touches, rainbows are upside down, there are invisible things, all the stuff that is inside hideo kojimas head is in this game. the world in death stranding is incredible and i have never seen or felt it in my entire life story now this is the part of the game where it really  ass. lets start with characters, the characters in this game are one sided, boring and have nothing interesting about them. the acting is phenomenal but hideo kojimas writing is just terrible and cringey. the entire story of the game is pretty much introducing the world to you and less about the characters. i cant say this enough but the side quest and main quest both have terrible writing and i would recommend you skip some of it when it gets really cringey. 90 of the story is pretty much exposition. but that's about it, i know it's very long but i just can't help it. this game is tough to have fun with and i don't really blame anyone. never in my life i felt a game so new and innovative. no gameplay like this, no story like this and no world like this. this game doesn't take anything from other games and that is where i respect hideo kojima a lot and really excited for his next game"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-04-13,"one of the games which value will be understood after couple of years! one of the games that drive forward the video game industry. as always, kojima showed the heartbreaking story, characters, narrative etc... many people say that the game is overloaded with new therms, new namings and overall the narrative is too hard to understand... maybe it is so, but the new universe is created in the game, so it is obvious that the game should have something new. i'd recomend those people to go and play regular games, just to kill time, and without soul in it. this one has everything that represents the art itself. good luck to the development team in the next project."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-04-10,"this game doesnt know what it wants to be. the core gameplay and story is clearly designed to keep you moving forward, while the actually mission objectives force you to go backwards. its a hiking game that punish you for walking out on your own, if you just go on a walk for to long the game wont let you use the points of interest that werent enabled by story events at that point. the story is way to ambitious for the gameplay, raising the stakes to much for its own good and leading the gameplay in the wrong direction. the core idea of reconnecting a post doomsday continent is really facinating, the execution though leaves much to be desired. the main enemys bts, punish you for playing the game, its like kojima never made games that forced you to rethink how you manovor an area before cough the whole mgs series. instead of thinking of great ways to outplay them you either have to movevery slow or very fast, you couldof cause gas them with litterlal pee granades but that even less fun cause they never move. its like dumbed down target parctise. other ai though is simply one of a kind. even though the story concept of rouge postman trying to steal your loot is so obnoxious it actually worsens their portail, kojima definitly tried to be different here when he decided to not name them raiders the way the roam their areas and look for loot or other deliver guys feels very realistic. its like you are watching a different species in its natural habbitat lol. they transcend the feeling of just playing against pre calculated game ai. i basically never just avoided them, its not like they are very complex infact quite the opposite is the fact but the way they interact with there enviorment somehow exceeds even mgs ai. same is true for friendly postman ai. its like interacting with real humans with simillar objectives to you, just trying to get from point a to b, minding their own buisness yet helping you with tools if you ask them. the whole buliding the world together part is really overhyped. they just artficially raised the difficulty so you wont be able to build streets by your own thats it. the sign other players can place can be helpful and funny at points i wont deny that, but most of he time they are anyoingly placed to farm as much likes as posible. its the equvilant of showing ass on instagram. the most annyoing part is that streets can only be build at predetermined places which takes away even more of player expression. the only truely helpfull part are the pre placed ladders and energy stations. that part is cool but i think it could have been handled better. the core hiking gameplay is not supprisingly the best is ever has been better than any other game before it, its just the repetition that kills the enjoyment. kojima clearly realised that otherwise he wouldnt have build in shortcuts like the streets and vehicles with the worst collision i have ever seen that let you bypass massive chunks of terrain. the way vihicles in general work in this game makes zero sense. while on foot transportaion is physics based, vehicles seem like they are glued to the ground, bassically imposible to flip over. a physics based system like in gta 5 would have made so much more sense here, it could have been way harder yet way more rewarding. so why is it so repetetiv you may ask? thats cause missions require you to rewalk all your routes multiple times just with different kinds of baggage, many of them are even randomly generate to artficialy make the game look bigger than it is. i dont get that part at all. its not like the game would have been short without random generation or like the actuall mission design is good in any way. seriously the core gameplay and story is clearly designed to keep you moving forward, while the actually mission objectives force you to go backwards. the worst part is actually that the game is so rewarding when it lets you move forward and lets you make your way trough this almost abstract world. thats why i continue playing this game. moving forward and outplaying the rouge postman ai. i love how you basically have no way to kill them at first atleast. makes you expriement way more than in mgs where a simple shoot to the head did the job. the presentaion is a solid 910. some places can really be jawdropping and the motion and facial capture is almost class leading. the imagary will stick with me for a long time but some places can be repetetiv or really low res. kojima and the kojima production team clearly still have a lot of talent left. like i said the core gameplay is very good, art direction supereb and and the story definitly unique. its just the mission structure and some questionable design desigions that lets it down masivly. i do believe that the game is very much worth experiencing, just not for 60. the sweetspot would be 30 in my oppinion cause the art direction alone warrants the money spent."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-04-07,"once there was an explosion, a bang which gave birth to time and space. once there was an explosion, a bang which set a planet spinning in that space. once there was an explosion, a bang which gave rise to life as we know it. and then, came the next explosion... an explosion that will be our last. death stranding is a very unique game that offers gorgeous graphics, great cinematic, and a mindbending story with amazing actors however this game might not be for everyone because of the repetitive gameplay which is like a walking simulator."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-04-05,"the writing, storytelling and direction of this game was amazing, one of my favorite games of the past few years, it takes the player out of the standard hero narrative of many other games, but still manages to keep the story telling focused throughout the game. personally i enjoyed the gameplay elements, especially the collaborative multiplayer elements where you feel your connection with other players even though you never meet them. the game is best enjoyed when you know what you're signing up for, this is a collaborative resource management simulation with a beautifully interwoven story some parts are told ingame and others are told in very long cutscenes  just sit back and enjoy because they usually take 30 minutes each can be paused. graphics are beautiful and the experience was surreal and beautiful."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-04-05,"the story is really great and makes sense only if player plays and pays attention. it is weird, but not incomprehensive. it is not a simple story and requires a lot of attention on player's behalf. mails are not that relevant  but they add some flavour. graphics are really good and optimization is fantastic having in mind that i play on my laptop with nvidia 1650 yet it requires more than 8gb of ram or the game will crash often. once i have added more ram i haven't had a single crash. with that said, game has various different mechanics set in place where any other aaa studio should not deliver anything subpar there are various biomes in the game which look beautiful and realistic snowy mountainsplainscanyonsforestoutlandishriversbeaches, driving mechanics, combat mechanics, questing, amazing story telling with ingame engine rendered cutscenes.... however, the ui is horrible and there are many quality of life improvements to be desired. even after 6 days of playing one playthrough, i still can make a mistake when delivering lost cargo due to the horrible ui or it would sometimes deliver it without even asking the option to not deliver some of the cargo items. certain combat scenes with bts should be more oriented towards what sam is holding in his hands i.e. a weapon instead it sometimes after zooming out behaves as if there is nothing in his hands. this is the reason i give it an 8."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-04-05,"story the ending original soundtrack cinematic characters and actors cringe too long, slow, and boring doesn't make sense generally average story. gameplay very clunky very boring watching same long cutscenes for common actions the first maybe 2 hours is an introduction with mostly cutscenes, then, there are 30 hours of moving between locations, transporting something, mostly for meaningless characters. it's like playing side missions. just walking, or driving, refilling stamina, basically all that boring stuff i don't like in games. if you like slowpaced strategic games you may like it. but still, movement isn't smooth. you'll get stuck over small rocks a lot, even on vehicles  suspension is not working. here and there there is some cutscene, stealth, or even shooting. the last maybe 10 hours is ending, also mostly watching cutscenes. art vistas cities soulless the graphics is average, it only looks nice in 60fps prerendered cutscenes. some vistas are nice, but cities are disappointing. you only get to the gate, never inside. so the whole game world and the atmosphere are dead, even for a postapocalyptic world, it doesn't feel like it. conclusion i was very disappointed. the game was just too long and too boring. the story was so cringy with no sense, and gameplay boring. i can only understand if i liked slowpaced strategic games, maybe it would be 710."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-04-01,"truly a masterpiece in so many ways, from the photorealistic visuals and incredible framerate, to the amazing writing and sometimes funny dialogue. an incredible achievement from kojima, a game that gives you back what you put into it with chill vibes interspersed with intense action and suspense. i spare spoilers but at certain points it really feels like metal gear solid evolved. 1010 49 hrs game completed"

Action,Death Stranding,2021-03-21,"creo que muchos se equivocan a la hora de criticar este juego, porque justamente no le interesa ser un juego, ni una pelcula, death stranding quiere situarse en el medio para que eso no te importe. es una experiencia que si, quiere divertirte, pero tambin frustrarte, exigirte mas, sacarte de tu zona de confort y recompensarte a cambio. si bien al principio parece que solo es ir de punto a a punto b, no pasara mucho para que empiecen a aparecer dificultades en el camino, y a medida que avanzas te darn un sin fin de herramientas para poder superarlas, es tanto que el post podra tratarse solo de eso, cerca del final puedes saltar 10 metros, tienes todas las armas del call of duty, corta cordones, exoesqueletos, motos, camiones, etc. si bien no profundiza mucho en cada aspecto, cumple, pero lo mejor de la jugabilidad sin duda es caminar, el simple hecho de moverte con sam es lo mejor del juego, y ah donde mas se nota el verdadero enfoque del mismo. a pesar de que mucha gente dice que el juego esta muy vaco, y por eso cuenta con grficas alucinantes, la verdad es que kojima nos ha dado las herramientas para rellenarlo, carreteras, tirolesas, puentes, generadores, buzones, habitaciones, etc. death stranding tiene una banda sonora increble, de la mejores que he escuchado. once, there was an explosion tiene una un diseo sonoro y composicin alucinantes, secuencias como alone we have no future o the face of our new hope estn increblemente logradas, a final waltz es de mi canciones de jefes favoritos, y bb's theme es una obra maestra, es tan fuerte en todos los aspectos que sea ha convertido en mi cancin favorita de todos los tiempos, no tengo mas que aplausos para ludvig forsell. por diversos motivos nunca haba experimentado ningn juego de kojima, una vez le di una oportunidad a metal gear v, pero era mucha accin, y no entenda nada de lo que ocurra, simplemente lo deje pensando que kojima no era para mi, pero luego de death stranding estar esperando con ansias sus prximos titulos, es un director con un estilo nico, tanto as que en 20 aos jugando nunca haba probado algo igual."

Action,Death Stranding,2021-03-11,"the plot is brilliant, thanks to kojima. the gameplay is as diverse as possible, many features have been invented in order to keep the player in the game. liked. now for the negative aspects. i didnt like that half of the game we go to the last problem, every time they say this is the last thing left, no this is definitely the last, half of the game. well, return through all the locations on foot. this has already bothered in the end."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-03-09,"death stranding was something amazing for me... i know there are many people who didn't enjoy it all, and in a way, i can understand them. death stranding is not the ordinary game you would expect to play. to be honest, if you take it from a gameay perspective, you would find really poor. however, it is the story, the atmosphere, the environment that make it a masterpiece... and the music is just amazing... i remember there were times when during a peaceful moment that a song kicks in and made me want to cry while i was enjoying the scenery. so, even if the gameplay is not something spectacular, it is the intriguing story that makes you want to complete that game!"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-02-28,i installed this game twice because i wanted to give it a second chance however turns out that with one fall i lost the package and i have to go back and find it in order to complete the stupid mission. instant trash!
Action,Death Stranding,2021-02-27,"hideo kojima continuously described death stranding as the first ever stand type game. he considered it so innovative that it would create a whole new genre of video games, and now that we have the game the question that has been on our heads for the last few years can now be answered what is a strand type game? well it's a special type of game where everything about it besides the visuals is a complete piece of trash. death stranding is one of the most disappointing games i have ever played. the gameplay is walking you put some packages on your back and walk them from point a to point b. i think the goal was to try and turn walking into exciting gameplay, similar to how mario did. well you don't do it like this because it . you'll continuously keep falling over and losing your packages for 35 hours straight. the boss fights are an absolute joke. they have no way of defeating you. later the game turns into the worst 3rd person shooter ever. kojima even responded to critics addressing this saying, americans are big fans of fps games and death stranding is not. what does the fact that the game is 3rd person shooter have to do with americans not liking it? most americans back in the day played fortnite. now about the story its just meh. it revolves around the kingdom hearts method of story telling where everything is explained but there is still no context for anything. the characters don't stop talking and every single one of them has some dumb thing to say especially the character fragile. i'd say the only good part about the game is its visuals and voice acting. i can only hope that this is the last strand type game because it is a complete embarrassment."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-02-26,"the game is extremely casual and the story complete drivel that doesn't drive you to keep playing, quite the contrary, every time you reach a cutscene you ask yourself why are you playing this game, if you have more than two brain cells that is. the kojima that made the first metal gear wouldn't even recognize himself anymore."

Action,Death Stranding,2021-02-17,"the good the graphics are impressive on pc, minimum 1080 if you want to see it in hd 7201080. the patches have fixed the stability of the game is now playable sometimes the bad boring story i did see kevin costner's the postman, 1997, warner in the cinema so it is clear where kojima gets the creativity and inspiration from. kojima's great game was in some cgi videos of his hollywood friends cosplaying and the frenetic adventures of him delivering things from point a to point b. boring gameplay. the game has autosave but does not let you record progress if you are in the middle of a delivery mission. fast travel and teleportation points are not used to shorten your path when you have an order to deliver. weapons arrive after at least half the game has passed. the fights against the bosses and minibosses are very simple and disgusting. once the hype was dispelled, the trailers were only hoaxes since it took the best scenes and put them to generate hype, but the result has already been seen that it is not this frantic all the time. the ending is a two hour video, really? during the game they tell you that human beings are isolated in cities you arrive in the cities and you do not see any humans, do they live in the clouds like the jetson or underground like the murlocks? all cities are the same. sam porter in the original version without patches had the same balance of a ragdoll, sam fell on any path that was not minimally level. the meh! the game didn't even come out and it already had a patch that corrects sam porter's bad balance. unlike the console version, here there were no press or influencers playing or generating excessive hype, so many of the structures originally created have disappeared or are about to do so due to deterioration of the rain. the mods make the product placement of monster and other brands can be edited by pepsi, beers, ... while the backpacks and briefcases are replaced by packages from ups, dhl, or food companies, rappi, uber eats, diddi, rappi ... the sky's the limit when it comes to customization. the gag of having the mechanical dinosaurs from horizon zero dawn walking around is there, but it's not understood. don't waste your money on this boring game, on pc there are alternatives like man standing or walking simulator that at least you will laugh while you play"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-02-15,"if youre some dudebro who cant fathom a game without non stop shooting and killing and also have the attention span , then yes. you will not enjoy this. stick to call of duty and doritos. the inventory system isnt hard to understand. the story is unique and compelling. its not perfect and annoying sometimes. the average ratings i see are quite harsh."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-02-08,"i originally passed on this game after seeing a bit of gameplay and some early reviews it just didn't seem like something i would enjoy also not having the time to play such a long game, what a mistake i made i picked it up on pc and have been glued to my seat since, such an amazing game, great music, great gameplay and the cutscenes really drag you into the story, even my wife couldn't stop watching and then desperately waiting for the next one to get the next chunk of the story. this game has easily pushed its way into my top 5 games of all time and that's with over 25 years of gaming history. thank you hideo kojima for this masterpiece you have created i just hope he makes more games of this calibre."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-02-05,"quickly has earned its place among my favourite games of all time. i admit the first area seemed very empty and boring at first, but just as i was reaching my limit the game introduces a new game mechanic, opening up existing areas in new ways. this keeps happening throughout the game, with new tools, items, vehicles, etc. given to you at just the right moment so as to never become old. having said that, if you're looking for call of duty, this isn't it. this game is at times actionpacked and fastpasted, at times, sneaky and stealthy, but mostly it's tranquil and zen. if you don't need violence and action to have fun, and can enjoy simple things such as cargo management, delivery route management, keeping your battery powered up, and carefully traversing terrain so as to deliver your goods in the best shape you can, then i'd recommend this game. i also love how multiplayer is integrated. you never see another player, instead you pickup and deliver the cargo they lose on their own journey, utilize the structures they built, and make use of the vehicles and items they leave behind. last but not least, the story, characters, and writing are all executed masterfully. i've never had a game make me cry as much as death stranding. mostly that release day trailer is what makes the tears roll. truly a joy to play. one of the best games i've played in a long, long time."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-02-02,"in this game you'll complete the same tipe of missions for the majority of time, however this is done in a maner that doesn't get boring. even though i understand why other would not like this, i think that everyone has to admit that this game is gorgeous and super atmospheric. almost every mechanic introduced is original . the game sets out to be something and it achieves it. i loved it"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-01-28,"loved this game. the world that kojima created is really interesting and makes you curious. cutscenes are amazing as well. only thing is gameplay is not meant for everyone.  liked it,  really felt like  am sam porter bridges  felt like a part of that universe. all things considered  think this game is a very unique experience that everyone should try."

Action,Death Stranding,2021-01-25,"i was blown away with the first hour of the game. it was crazy. levelled out a bit after that but i still enjoyed the rest of my time. one of the final fights was a letdown, for some strange reason they focused on a rather terrible mechanic throwing. date completed 20210116 playtime 39h enjoyment 810 recommendation it's weird and pretty fun. at least if you ignore a lot of the deliveries, those can get tiring fast."

Action,Death Stranding,2021-01-22,"pretentious plot that needs the characters to force feed you exposition through lengthy cutscenes so you know why you run with bags on your back across the country, but it stills doesnt make any god damn sence. i've played for 5 hours and it hasnt been fun for a second of it so im not giving it any more of my time. the best way i can explain the traversal in this game is to compare it to spiderman ps4. remember how the web slinging was so fun you never used the fast travel system? this is the complete opposite. sam is a slow and grumpy piece of  that doesnt know how to keep his balance with a backpack on. im not interested in the reasons why you cant fly helicopters in this game, or why bodies explode after death or why you need to burn them at a specific spot. there is no humor to be found in this game, everyone is super  serious all the time and act like the edgy cool anime guy.  me this game is bad."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-01-22,"the gameplay is meditative, the plot is deep but kinda uneven. the whole game has enjoyable feel of taste"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-01-18,"technically, a masterpiece. great actors and characters. amazing plot...very original but, sadly, with a boring gameplay!! for me, it seems that the delivery missions are a toll that we have to pass to learn more about the story"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-01-16,"honestly on my top 3 games of all time. i've played it on ps4 last year and it was the best optimized game experience i had on this console. now that i play it on pc, i can't believe how great this game look, it is stunning. gameplaywise, it's a simple mechanic, but efficient a 100, i've played more than 80 hours, and i want more."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-01-16,"this game is not for everyone and i, myself, did not like it in the beginning. with progression the game felt like a jigsaw puzzle slowly coming together until it made a bigger picture. eventually, i fell in love with the game. pros  innovative gameplay many approaches.  soundtrack.  atmosphere and landscape.  the online gameplay is unique and promotes people to help each other.  overall good performance from every actor. cons  some dialogue felt off at times.  slow start could be big for some people.  story can be hit or miss for people. word of advice  this is not a game you should rush through. if you want to drive a car, you will need to do so in the right conditions for example."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-01-14,this game is very good if you had stressful day. it's so fu... relaxing. i will give 1010 if developer will a portable music player d
Action,Death Stranding,2021-01-14,"i am about 60 hours into death stranding and i think this is one of the best games i played in recent memory. this game is so much more than a walking simulator. i bought the game for pc after months of telling myself that i would not enjoy game like death stranding because what can be cool about delivering stuff. this concept just sounds boring on the surface but after playing the game for hours i must say that there is so much more into this game than just being a fedex driver. first being delivery boy is not boring because there are different set of challenges player must go through to accomplish the goals. deliveries can be done in many different ways and as the game progress new equipment  vehicles are unlocked that make delivering easier and faster. there is the online component of this game. it is huge part of it in my opinion. death stranding without multiplayer would just not be the same. this is the game that combines single player and multiplayer components into one very cool game. because of the online component it does not feel like you are alone in the game. it feels like you are part of huge community with the same goal of reunifying the country. you want to help other players. you want to build structures, leave tips and warnings. it is rewarding to build structures and then later receive likes from other players because you know that you helped someone else. ive been in many situations when other players structures help me to finish my delivery faster and more efficiently. so building structures is big part of the game. myself i have spent hours rebuilding highways so other players and i could use it to faster deliveries. then there is the combat. there is a lot of it through out the game. the further you progress the more combat situations you will encounter. you can choose from arsenal of lethal and nonlethal weapons. the combat is very similar to metal gear solid games. then there is the horror component of the game. the more you play it the creepier it becomes. then there is the story which is interesting and the more you play the game the more you want to explore it more to find out what happened next. it is important to read all messages in the game because they explain the world of death stranding and also provide extra missions like the ones for cyberpunk 2077. finally, the graphics. death stranding cut scenes are probably the closest to photo realism in game i have ever seen. the game is just gorgeous all through out. playing the game on pc on ultrawide monitor adds to the extra level of immersion because everything in the game is done in ultrawide, including the cut scenes. the game is long. there are 12 chapters in the game. i am 60 hours in it and i am on chapter 7 but this is fine because there is no need to rush it whatsoever. you want to take this game slow so you can explore it and learn more about the world of death stranding. death stranding is a must play game for fans of science fiction. it is weird, unusual and yet very addictive game. bottom line is that this game is way more than just a walking simulator."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-01-13,most beautiful game hideo kojima best love this game graphics 1010 stabile fps gtx 1650 high grafic
Action,Death Stranding,2021-01-12,this game is absolutely incredible. it is most definitely not your average instant gratification style game. it has a very slow but deep story that takes time to dig into and boy is it worth every second. a lot of people say it's just ups sim and you could see it that way. but it is so much more than that. there's meaning in every step and every journey is different. the music will grip you and bring about emotions you haven't felt in a game since you were a child and the story will have you wishing it had never ended. this is easily one of my all time favorite games. i will cherish the time i spent in death stranding and i hope kojima decides to continue this story. thank you sir. for giving me a game that gave me so much more than just a fun time.
Action,Death Stranding,2021-01-12,"great game!         !     ,      !"

Action,Death Stranding,2021-01-09,"has the same chiral network and monsters from metal gear survive... fairly boring walking sim, with a cutscene for every action, which is repeated everytime."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-01-07,"terminei a histria em uma semana 34 horas de jogo, no rushei as principais todas, porem a maioria eu fiz de uma vez, amei o jogo, praticamente perfeito em histria e graficamente, gameplay achei boa at, menos com carros e motos e cansativo quando est nas montanhas de neve. mas vale a pena completamente pela experincia de um jogo diferente que sai daquele mesmice total q so a maioria dos jogos. sistema de like e construo  nota 10 imerso com outros jogadoresparte online"
Action,Death Stranding,2021-01-07,"keep in mind this game is not for everyone, and i get why a lot of people hate it, but this is easily one of the best games i've ever played. for some reason, the simplistic gameplay of walking somewhere and delivering something was very enjoyable. at some points it did reach a bit of a slog, but the story just kept bringing me back in. the story is interesting and fantastic, the scenery is gorgeous, and for me the gameplay can actually be really fun."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-01-05,"the ultimate chill game. no rush, no levels to grind, no timed events. just you, going from places to places and getting familiar with the map. a perfect game ot play  if you don't know what to play. one major flaw is that the game world is sadly  very boring and monotonous. its all the same everywhere."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-01-04,"esse jogo  to fantastico, no sei por em palavras o quanto gostei dele, meu nico arrependimento  ter demorado tanto pra comear a jogar."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-01-03,"it simply cannot be called a video game or a game for that matter. it fails at being the very essence of a video game which is to be fun and entertaining. also, the story behind it is convoluted, poorly executed and portrayed in an abysmal way. it would've been much better as a tv show or a movie."
Action,Death Stranding,2021-01-03,"hands down one of my favorite games ever. the feelings this game gave me are not easy to explain and i know many fellow gamers agree with this. it's that kind of game that either you love it or you hate it. and i happened to love it. i love how they reverted the trend from standard actionrpg games. they took what usualy is the easiest walking, world exploration, inventory management and made it the core of the game. this change of gameplay was very refreshing. i think that who says death stranding js a walking simulator, didn't grasp the revolution of this game. the story is immersive i cried at the ending, you get fond of every character. the curiosity pushed me to do some otherwise unthinkable routes and they were always worth the time. the acting was amazing, some scenes really felt like out of a movie. the soundtrack was amazing and its placement was also very clever after a very hard way through a bt area, and just before our destination, asylum for the feelings started playing and i was left in awe. i truly am not able to find a con for this game. i haven't played any kojima game before, but i am definitely a fan now."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-12-31,"gameplay was not very fun but good to me, the story well even kojima and cast didn't understand the storyline well i didn't understand too. kojima such a genius for creating a new genre strand type genre"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-12-31,"the game is basically a long spiritual trip, so if you are looking for a high adrenalinefps game, this ain't for you, despite having some moments where you are realy afraid to die. kojima tries to tell us a story of our selves and our relationships with each other, tries to dig deep into humanity's upsides and downsides, the importance of relationships, and how these drive society. building bridges, roads, helping and cooperating with eachother is what makes us stronger. the game does that by making you feal lonely at times and with other social builtin features which make you feal part of something greater, where people help eachother out because that's the beauty of humanity."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-12-29,"it's a wonderful experience! it's not an action game, but it has its moments. great storytelling  cinematic direction from kojima! you do a lot of walking and climbing. the story progresses a little slow in the beginning until chapter 3, but after that, the pace is satisfying. great scenery  atmosphere of the world. great soundtrack  voice acting. on the downside, some missions are repetitive go  fetch this, maybe the world could have more in it although it's postapocalyptic and the combat is not well optimised could have been better. but you do not play it for the combat! if you focus on the story, characters, world and how about connecting people in a  world with your actions, you 'll have a great experience overall! pc version"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-12-29,"the boredom and repetitiveness of the game's missions and environment is only overshadowed by the despicable ux from overstylized menus that are all over the place to the lockedpreanimated actions in certain areas and the incredibly predictable dialogs in addition to the irritating phonelike notification. also, what the hell is with that shameless monster drink promotion? this game looked exceptional and promising on video and screenshots, but it ends up feeling incredibly empty... maybe that's the ultimate lesson from hideo kojima here?"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-12-28,a beautiful masterpiece... a beautiful game ! it's an amazing world and creation !
Action,Death Stranding,2020-12-28,some good ideas and npcs wasted with the very bad gameplay and boring storytelling. i can't recommend this game but i enjoyed the visuals and music. it's super slow and the story is weird not in the positive way. some scenes are very beautiful and i think this should be a animated miniseries rather than a game. it's 110 as a game and 810 as a miniseries
Action,Death Stranding,2020-12-28,"personal opinion this is my favorite game in a long long long time. i'm achievement hunting after completing the main storyline. and you know, i really do like to just walk around and complete deliveries. people talk about this game as a walking simulator, but the gameplay loop is quite fun and addictive 1. unlock zone 2. optimize route 3. unlock new equipment 4. reoptimize route all while helping others do the same the only jank here are the vehicles, which are quite fun even with some quirks. the game is extremely polished and beautiful to behold! couldn't recommend more."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-12-25,"never espected to love this game... honestly i took it on the internet just to try it out. i thought i would play it for about 1 hour then uninstall it. the trailers were weird and the game seemed boring. i have to admit that mgsv was a great dissapointment for me. but man, i was into death stranding so quickly. beautiful graphics, amazing actors, great story, compelling gameplay. really immersive. this game is just awesome. i did buy it and i encourage you to do so even if the gamplay may not be for everyone though. some say that it's tiring and yes for some it can be. maybe if you find rdr2 boring, death stranding is not for you. i can understand that but you have to try it out to be sure or you might miss a very great game. a big thumb up for the ost as well. you can see that kojima has pour his soul into this game and i have to admit that it gives me faith again for his next project."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-12-21,"i made metacritic login specially to warn people to not buy death stranding on pc. interesting and fresh ideas dream like concept is rather good  but actual gameplay is terrible. everything is spoiled by bad ux  imagine car with climate control buried in 3rd submenu, where desired temperature is set by tapping inside passenger glove box. for example  from time to time u must piss this is ok  but it is complex multistep process here. what tf? while fighting bosses you have grenades in multiple slots  for example 15 grenades in 3 slots. in actual fight there is need to open another slot to use next 5 grenades."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-12-08,the best game i've played. i really hope for the further continuation of the story. kojima is a genius.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-12-08,"refreshing to play something more cathartic and meditative in the industry but i wish they went allin on that, it's hard to enjoy fetchquests and clunky combat, but the environments alone are nice to explore. i'd also lay off the metaphores a bit, naming everything strand just sounds silly after the first few times."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-11-29,"its a very well made and produced game. the soundtrack is very nice. the world looks great but in combination with the sign spam from other players, lacking npcs or real settlements feels not that immersive. the gameplay consists of more than walking, you rebuild infrastructure in various ways helping you and others deliver. you fight throught enemy camps and connect various settlements. the walking and carrying package mechanic is new and refreshing, too, but in the end it's all too repetitive and after i finished the story i did not keep on playing, because the gameplay on it's self was not rewarding enough."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-11-28,"its an incredible experience  , i get why some people find it dull or boring but i think this game presents one of the greatest story in the last 10 years , at least from a sci fi stand point . the gameplay is linear and slow at the beginning but it build up after every main quest and event . as for bugs and crashes i didn't experience any  running on a windows 10 machine , 2080ti and a 8700k processor with 16gb of ram."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-11-13,hate to admit it but it is a masterpiece not for everyone i completely agree but for me the immersion the attention to detail the tediousnous is something i love! story i wasnt sure id like but ended up in love also probably the best soundtrack in video game history!
Action,Death Stranding,2020-11-13,"i was among the ones that said this game was absurd and it would , a fedex simulator. but i gave it a change and thank the videogame gods i did it. amazing story, amazing graphics, great actors. and the walking isn't all that bad, it really isn't and you quicky have upgrades that make live very easy. give it a try."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-11-09,"im not like those kojima fans that says masterpiece to everything he makes, actually i was kinda disappointed when the gameplay trailers dropped too, but when i got to play it on my own, just like i guessed it was a pretty good game with a relaxing gameplay especially to listen music to when you are delivering cargos in a outstanding environment, ofcourse the story was good too with strong cutscenes  almost realistic facial expressions, its one of those moviesgames that take till the very end to have emotional effects on you, but when it does, you cant skip even the end credits and think about what youve just experienced... its in these times that im happy that i was wrong for thinking something is bad but actually great... , unfortunately lots of people dont like the game cuz they dont get the gameplay, but folks like me that likes games like euro truck simulator  microsoft flying simulator  other similar games will like this game because its refreshing to play something that lets you kinda relax while you doing the mission and hell even listen to music while playing too as i mentioned before, sue me but i liked it more than mgsv."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-11-09,typical kojima. an absolute masterpiece. movieready trailer. gripping story. one of the best games i have played in 30 years of gaming experience
Action,Death Stranding,2020-11-09,"how much crap can one kojima game be? all of it! the movement gameplay is horrible, characters are boring, the story is some weird mix of disneyemoscifi and some classical manga elements. and that mix doesnt work for a single second. a basic game mechanic is giving and receiving likes, like on facebook. and there its already annoying, now imagine how annoying this is in a game. also, the main character doesnt clearly give a  about the story, yet hes the only one driving it. all other main characters do absolutely nothing, except for calling you all the time about stuff they thought of you could do for them. additonaly, this game is not much more than a walking simulator with clouds of emo trying to kill you  whilst listening to horrible whineyemo music. and whilst kojima might get a wet panty from working with hollywood actors, they add absolutely nothing to the game. in its best moments its boring, but mostly annoying. and the dialogues are full cringe mode. its need for speed level of cringe. yes, its that bad. have you ever thought about rearranging the stuff you carry while you fought a boss? no? well, why not? oh, because its bullsh, right. and that is what this game is."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-11-07,"if someone paid me an actual salary to deliver cargo around i would probably be too lazy to do it. but since this is a game, i want to do it for free xd in all seriousness, death stranding is a metaphor to life. death stranding has been the most humbling and life changing experience i ever felt. if you are reading this, i hope you give this game an actual try and you won't regret it. side note i don't believe the negative reviews. if you check steam you will see the game actually has positive reviews from people who actually played the game. console games usually get a lot of hate from the pcmasterrace community"

Action,Death Stranding,2020-11-05,"all my high expectations have been surpassed! this is the kojima's game that surpasses metal gear even if they are not comparable genre wise. as a matter of fact, there's no genre that can define death stranding! it's a oneinalifetime experience with contemplative, artistic and philosophical moments alternating with a powerful blend of stealth, survival horror, and adventure! i completely disagree with the walking simulator meme! at no point during this game you're simulating any of your typical walks, unless of course you meet sinister creatures, futuristic soldiers or other obstacles during your everyday walks and you need to avoidfight them whilst managing your inventory tactically! also, you don't even walk. precisely, during your connection quests you jog, drive, ride, skate, etc. instead! no, denuvo antipiracy system is not causing any problem whatsoever, unlike what was assumed by some nonsensical rumors. pros  jawdropping details!  kojima's genius and humour are back!  induces a natural urge to explore its immense beauty!  unique and genredefying gameplay mechanics and metagames.  the asynchronous multiplayer feels organic and brilliant.  decently satisfying combat system.  photo mode is indescribably fun!  you interact with a nonstop flow of video poetry.  mesmerising direction and fantastic acting performances!  touching and mindbending philosophy.  memorable soundtrack.  high replayability value. cons  probably the worst game to twitch. this is to be experienced firsthand.  the interface may feel intimidating at first.  this title more than any other should become crossplay at some point.  combat may be repetitive  we should be able to change the colour of the writing tomorrow is in your hands in photo mode.  the story ends, unfortunately! score 10  10."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-11-05,"the game is not definity for everyone. yes in a way it's a delivery service guy simulator, but in a world where the concept of life and death is being challenged. it tends to have the kojima trademark cheesy dialogues and it has that mgs v kind of thin line between having fun and grinding. but that is where all of cons end. the rest of the game is a bloody masterpiece of storytelling, atmosphere and graphics. this thing in 4k on pc looks absolutely phenomenal, the rendering algorithm they use to display eroded landscape is photorealistic at times i have mistaken the first landscapes scenes of the game for real life cinematography, it was rendered realtime. you would have thought that such imagery would require a nasa computer, nope, a 2060 super can run this in 4k. i don't understand the user reviews, people expected another mgs or what? yes the world is empty since there are rains that kill pretty much everything alive, that dead lifeless world is pretty much the narative to the game. yes its about delivering stuff from a to b mostly, not every time. the game tends to shake these deliveries interesting by varying challenges you need to overcome to succeed. yes there is grind but only if you want to and not necessary to finish the game or anything same as mgs, you get cooler stuff by doing it. and there is this constant drive of mystery that you want to unwind. i was never bored in this game, i have no clue how the hours of this game have passed. in general this is one of the best games i have played period."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-10-31,"first of all i got to say that i rarely review anything ,be it games ,movies ,books or actual physical products as i dont really find the need to do so ,but seeing how much i loved this game ,and how much people loved to trash on it when it came out most of which have never played it i ought to write this review i have never played a kojima game before ,but i got interested in ds death stranding after seeing the trailers which i really loved ,for the visuals ,the music ,but especially for the atmosphere they had going in ....after the game came out and the reviews started popping out ,i got somewhat skeptical especially seeing the hate the game got ,but i still was intersted and wanted to try the game more so knowing that the creator himself said that the game wont please everyone so i played the game and ...........i loved it from the first moments to the last ones where i nearly tear up ,the cinematics were masterfully done ,the character acting superb ,the music godly as itreally adds to the atmosphere and makes things 10 times better i downloaded all three albums from the game after playing it ,and the graphics have been one of the most stunning i have seen in a while ,now for the story  it starts out really confusing and cryptic ,but believe me when i say everything makes sense in the end with a lot of plot twists and big reveals ,the characters all had very well written backstories and the actor's performances were phenomenal especially cliff's and die hard man's actors respectively ,plus the messages the game convey really touched me on a deep level lets talk about the gameplay which most people called boring and not fun while it may have started a little simple ,it gets waay more varied as you progress ,for example you get new ways of transporting the cargo ,new equipment ,new weapons etc these arent just some cosmetic level additions ,as they make the gameplay very diverse and give you more choices ,and even though the open world isn't that rich with npcs ,there's a lot to interact with from the little interactions with your bb ,the different gameplay elements ,the async gameplay mechanics ,building roads and structures ,fighting the mules ,the terrorists and the bts ,trying to optimize your load and take the best route possible ,the different activities you can do in your private room ,the different references and easter eggs kojima threw in ,and i can still go on and on and would only scratch the surface ... im super glad that this game got made ,in a world full of repetitive shooter looters and battle royale games ,ds is a game like no other where you got to experience the gameplay bit by bit ,get to really explore the world as its meant to be ,and most importantly each trip i took felt like a real one i got really happy when i arrived at my destination ,really frustrated when i lost my cargo ,really immersed and peaceful when i walked and some amazing music kicked in ....so yeaah i need to stop now otherwise i would write 10 pages and still wont say everything x ....but believe me this game is a masterpiece ,kojima san in a genius and everyone who really loves to have a unique experience ,and has a real grasp of what art is ,needs to play this game ..."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-10-28,it was a really unnecessary game by hideo kojima. it seems he needed a break after mgss and this is how he did it. by walking to places and enjoying landscapes. so he made this game. the game looks and runs amazingly. and norman is awesome as ever. but the whole experience seems so hollow and unworthy.

Action,Death Stranding,2020-10-23,"terrible. good visuals, good soundmusic. story and narrative is poor. poorly presented, poorly explained. you have no reason to be attached to any characters or have any motivation to do anything in this game. i played the game for 5 hours and out of those 5 hours, 4 hours were cutscenes where you had no agency, and one hour was carrying a bunch of packages across bad terrain. that's the game. it's pretty bad. it does not deserve to be called a video game. it's a tv show where instead of ads, you're told to play uber for 15 minutes between episodes. i can't think of a reason why the protagonist just wouldn't blow his brains out and remain dead the moment he gets the option. there's just absolutely no reason for him to exist or do anything. the world is dull, boring, lifeless and there's not a single character that makes you feel like yeah, i'll try to save the world for the. no. they're all boring, annoying, arrogant  who can't stop abusing you for their stupid goals. for the love of god, don't buy this game for anything more than the price of a sandwich if you really want to see what it's about. anything more and you're giving money to the developer who's be infinitely better off making  one season tvshows than video games."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-10-21,"well, i can't say i haven't been warned. but let me say upfront that i found a way to  kind of  enjoy death stranding skip. skip the cutscenes, skip the dialogue, skip the calls, the mails, skip the animated sequences for every single mundane tasks, skip them all. don't bother with the science or the lore or story, you will come up with a better, more consistent and way more interesting explanation and message on your own. just make up some new words you milked from greek and egyptian mythology, throw in some of the deep philosophy your found in your last fortune cookie, decide that you are going to make some nation of your choice great again, and boom now you are the genius, oneofakind game designer. even though you are not doing drugs with norman reedus, but hey, that's his loss. maybe even skip the rest of this review. really. it's just another rant about some of the worst writing and game design that i have seen in a long time, badly hidden under a very thin veil of beautiful graphics and welldone audio. that audio includes a score that i could have grown fond of, if it hadn't been forced on me repeatedly in the most cinematic way. also understand that this is not a giant open world game, even though everyone says it is. it's not giant, it's not open, and it's not a world. it's a collection of hub worlds full of artificial borders and limitations  including rules and unlocks that don't care about logic or how silly they are, especially if you, against my sage advice, follow the story. those hubs are littered with the same models and assets puzzled into cities that are devoid of life and any interesting features. there are no creatures, and only the tiniest amount of enemy types. even though you supposedly travel across all of america, there is no distinctive level design, not the climate, not the textures, not the flora. there is no day andnight cycle. there is no weather, except for the rain that tells you that enemies are near. most of the map that you can actually explore looks completely random and has no regard for even the most basic rules of geography. and while i'm supposed to believe that everything has been destoyed, melted and thrown into chaos by some major event that i stopped caring about two hours into the game, i think laziness and having to pour all the money into celebrity appearances might be the actual reason. and down in that collection of hubworlds you are basically playing a walking simulator that made the simple act of walking as complicated as possible. you read the expression tankcontrols in a lot in reviews, but a tank has a least some precision. it can change direction without keeling over, and doesn't get stuck in pebbles every five metres. it's instruments don't get stressed out and cry only to stop working for several reasons whenever the plot demands it. later on i accepted that this is all there is, at least as far as gameplay is concerned, and that this is pretty much your only challenge as long as you are not literally throwing shyt at ghosts. you will still need a lot of free time and nothing better to do. but if you follow my advice and skip, and skip, and skip some more, this is where you can almost have fun. lay bare the core gameplay loop of getting things from a to b while improving the infrastructure and technology to do it faster and with less problems. it isn't half bad if you do it like that, even though controls, camera and ui get in your way too often and break the flow whenever you let them. but the fact that i put dozens of hours into this even though i hated a lot about it tells me that, if you skip all the bs, there is a nice, not overly challenging, sometimes weirdly zen experience to be had, where you can set your own little goals and have your own little story. as long as you, i can't stress this out enough, don't listen to the actual one. really. you will start asking questions, like, who came up with all that technology after the world ended and you couldn't leave the house and you had no resources and no clue what was going on? you don't want that. you have a map, you have your mission markers, you take stuff from point a, where it came from nothing, and you put it down at point b, where it disappears into the void again, and some hologram will say the same thing it always says and give you likes, and who does not like likes? unfortunately you can't skip the crashes and glitches. i haven't had too much troubles, but be aware that the game will require some decent hardware. it's horribly ported and optimized and comes with loads of drm and telemetry running in the background on top of that. but if you are not like me and morbidly curious about that game that everyone talked about last year, don't waste your money. don't waste your time. at least wait for a sale, like i did"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-10-19,"very good game. i wasnt really compeled to try after many mixed reviews but this game is really good. music, visuals and athmosphere really comes togerher. best ups courier simulator in recent history d also ignore review bombing from idiots that pirated the game this week. its easy to trash the game u didnt even pay for   u dont really have to waste your money, try first 2 hours on steam and make your decision  game doesnt really change much after this  if u expected this to be next mgs .. just give up and play something else. i dont care if kojima was ever involved in this, i like it so far  15 hours in . its something different. but i get it .. if its not another hi cocaine action packed game, it just cant succeed in this generation of mediocre esrly access"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-10-18,"i think this game is most to mature people and a little excentric. there is a serious purpose to do different, to innovate and put the player in a different perspective than common in other games. the storyline is a excellent sci fi, very intersting and intriging. it is perceived that it is a game made with great care and true affection. for me is a very fun game to. maybe some players learn to give value when bee olders, because it is a classic areready."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-10-12,"recently purchased on steam and spent a month or so on this. invested well over 120 hours in this game. i really enjoyed the atmosphere, sound design, graphics, and story, but didn't love the gameplay. a great deal of effort was put into the story however, and that largely redeems this for me. my recommendation would be not to bother trying to max out every delivery, and max out the stars at the various facilities and just speed run the game. the story is epic, and it has one of the most incredible endings i've seen in a long time. btw  there is a known bug in the pc version of this game. the following are extremely minor spoilers, i would say they aren't even spoilers but just a good thing to know. the end credits are not the end of the game. after the end credits another scene begins. for me, and several other players on pc once that scene begins and earnest the screen goes black, as if to load something else. this black screen can linger, and ultimately stay there. this is not the end of the game. there is well over an hour and 20 minutes of additional story here, mostly told through some pretty awesome cut scenes with incredible motion capture and voice performances. these provide some wonderful exposition and ultimately a very touching and satisfying ending. if you don't like games with epic stories, and are focused on action, this game is not for you. this game is highly unique and different. those who love it... will love it. oh, and a last bit of advice. focus on zip lines through the mountains... i wasted like 5 days building roads. you're gonna move through a lot faster using the zip lines"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-10-11,"one of the best games i've played in my life. those who write that the game is  they are simply too dumb to understand the game. they prefer first person shooters like cod. without thinking, buy a game with a great storyline and not boring gameplay at all"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-10-10,"things i liked  artistically amazing landscapes to look at colours, hues, realistic, immersive, blah blah.  post apocalyptic delapidated structures look very cool  detailed, amazing job environmental artists. things i didn't like  constant in and out of logistics menu nightmare.  getting penilised for 1 small wrong move on a rock after playing very sensibly for a long time then, afterward, mucking about basically jumping off cliffs because i am frustrated at this boring game carrying tons of stuff and hey it's fine, just glitch up and down these rocks no problem we'll forgive you.  trucks and bikes can fly.  the games motivating factor is 'likes' lol.  preachy, boring characters that i never felt for.  waste of time, go and get a delivery job instead it'll be more interesting than this."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-10-08,original fiction. beautiful cut scenes and world. poor action. repetitive game play.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-10-08,"this game is... well, it's not a 0, 1 or any of the low scores people give it. it's also not a 10. it's a very... specific game, and that's putting it nicely. yes, the primary game play loop is about... walking. or, well, travelling from one place to another, with mechanics added in to make this more difficult uneven terrain, crevices and the occasional enemy. that's all there is to it that's the whole gameplay. sprinkled in are very long cutscenes in classic hideo fashion. if you enjoy games like elite dangerous or euro truck simulator then this will probably be ok with you. if you feel bored if you don't get to shoot an enemy in 5 minutes, then this will bore you to death. the problem with this game is that it was never really marketed appropriately, shrouding the game in mystery without ever showing the actual gameplay. so people expected it to be something it's not. but knowing what you're getting into is now a lot easier with gameplay videos and detailed descriptions, so if the concept of making deliveries, on a fundamental level, seems appealing then you're good to go. visually the game is decent enough, with the reallife actors being portrayed really nice inengine. performance is smooth with no issues at all. music and sound are very good as well. the story is... well, it's kojima. i won't spoil it, suffice to say there are some really nice moments... and some really cringy ones too. ultimately i'm having fun making aforementioned deliveries and rebuilding roads and pushing the story forward. but, again, this all ties back to the main loop  if you feel making deliveries is enough to keep you going then have at it. otherwise, skip."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-10-02,"first off, this game is a masterpiece. maybe it's not for everyone, so here's a few thoughts  the game is really about 50 movie, 40 package delivery, and 10 fighting monsters. i was fine with that mix, others may get bored if they're looking for more action.  the story overall is deep, mindbending, and heartwrenching. it starts dramatically, the middle has some lulls where it loses focus, but the last third starts to really pick up steam again and keep getting better until the very end. throughout, it comes together from disjointed, outofsequence snippets, but in the end they're almost all brought together.  visually, an amazing experience. vivid green landscapes, barren wastelands, supernatural vortices, where it's easy to get lost in the experience of kojima's world. and great performances from the cast all around.  the main storyline has some variety, but the side quests are just of a handful of basic deliverfetchrecover types. i was enjoying just going around and delivering packages, just relaxing, and there's an abundance of side quests to go on.  the social aspect is quite unique, and fit well into the setting. i'm not a social gamer, but you can interact with that portion of the game as little or as much as you'd like.  i played with an xbox controller, controls were flaky sometimes, sometimes pushing a button again to enterexit a menu or vehicle. but only slightly annoying."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-09-25,"if your pc has problems don't rate the game low. fix your computer. anyway  this game is something special and different. a lot of people can't see past the things you do in the game deliver materials and other tasks but to enjoy the game you must take it on like an experience, nothing like you have done for a game before. if you do that you get an amazingly deep and creepy story, a lot of connections from people and empathy for the npcs living in this world. if all you want is a call of duty or other type of game that's an action genre game than don't look here. if you want something deep look no where else."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-09-25,"actually underrated game, you really should to play through it to judge it. the beginning is slow and opens up around 34 hours into the game when you reach the second map. story is alright, traversal mechanics are superb, there's some action here and there, but it's mainly fighting the unforgiving terrain. ending is probably the worse part of the game in that it drags on and on, but by then you'll likely have 3040 hours of solid gameplay to reflect upon."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-09-24,"lol, ya no it was my decision to get this game for myself? hype got to me. cos trailers and preview stuff looked so mysterious and pretty. ok so, the soundtrack is good. casting is all kojima's famous mates other than amelie's character which is the only one i liked. that guy norman reedus is supposed to be everyman, but it breaks immersion cos all you can think about is the walking dead, init. but yeah, the game is all about some sort of huge open world which is basically empty. no npc's walking around, no romance, no surprise encounters. but! if your dream's desire is to walk around burning dead bodies and reconnecting the internet and twitter then this is just right up your street! it's bloated like windows 10. nonsensical story telling that doesn't even make any sense."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-09-23,"this game is very good. it has an addictive game play and interesting storyline. in addition the game has excellent optimization i thought the game wouldn't even run on my pc with a tenyearold processor and an amd rx 580 8gb video card. and the game started on ultra settings with 60 fps. i went through the game two times and i can say with confidence that bad user score 3.7 t this writing is undeserved. i would be happy to give the game a maximum score. but, despite this, this game currently has a lot of bugs mainly related to graphics. so for now, i'll be honest and give the game a score of 9 out of 10."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-09-19,i really should have read the reviews. i'm actually quite shocked to come here and see such negative reviews... i honestly believed i'd be alone in my own feelings of frustration. yes this game is terrible pacing and the boring gameplay just stretches out between these cut scenes. i cant say any more than others have said..except the marketing for this game was really good because i had no idea it was this unpopular. i thought it was the magnum opus.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-09-19,"im almost certain these reviews have been taken over by bots or something. this is my first metacritic review as i feel strongly it needs defending. this game is unreal. i can understand why people would be like wtf is this game about if they didnt finish it, but those who persevere to the end game get one of the best pieces of story telling of any game ever, fact. everything that seemed confusing throughout the game gets explained perfectly and in an amazing way. i wont give anything away but take my word for it, if you like a game with a good story, there is nothing better than death stranding. i finished it a week ago now and its still playing on my mind, almost makes you want to replay it in retrospect. f the hatersbots, make your own mind up and give this game a shot!"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-09-14,"i love this game. very good graphics meet an wonderful world, a great soundtrack and a game with a soul. love it."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-09-11,"tanto down, tanto retrasado haciendo review bombing.. si quieren las reseas reales vallan a steam, es un juego que esta gustando y almenos merece entre 8910... pero la mayoria de estos retrazados son consoleros llorones que perdieron una exclusiva mas"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-09-09,"i really enjoyed this game. it is low on action you get to shoot some folks later in the game, but not a lot, but i have to say that i actually enjoyed delivering packages. i liked the optimization puzzle of figuring out how to deliver things efficiently, and if you use the tools provided e.g. the lift lines, you can massively shortcut huge portions of what would be long slow slogs especially through the snow. i think i enjoy fallout games for a similar reason, the adventure of looking over the next hill and seeing what is there. the story is also cool. really wacky, and it gets twisted at the end, but it's good. it has a lot of video segments, so it is a little bit of a cross between a movie and a video game. bring popcorn. especially at the end. when you think the game is over ... just make some popcorn ... it isn't."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-09-09,"i don't know about what these people expected from this game it clearly isn't a new metal gear so if you don't like it don't buy it as simple as that. now for my review the game is 1010 in every single bit of it the graphics are so amazing and beautiful it's easily one of the most visually gorgeous games i ve ever played if not the best looking one the gameplay isn't for everyone yes about half the game is walking but it doesn't stop there there are vehicles you can build roads help people interact with people and that's what the game is about i personally think that's a veery amazing game truly don't listen to these battle royale kids crying because it's not the new fortnite this is a masterpiece and really worth getting and trying i bet you 100 that all the people who rated 0 didn't even finish the first 3 hours of the game the mechanics are awesome the graphics ,the story the gameplay i loved every bit of this game and i can see myself replaying it many more times my issue is the dialogue it's so long and boring"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-09-05,"this game is far from a masterpiece, but as a movie i can say this is one of the best plots you're going to get, regardless of what the negative reviews are saying. the gameplay though might be struggling a bit in the beginning, yeah i admit it, but when you pick it up, and as you progress through the story, it becomes really fun. this game takes time, as it was intended to be. hideo kojima wants you to take in the world, so don't expect this to be an action game. i recommend it to everyone used to slowpaced games. i'd give it a 910, but to even out the review bombers a bit, i'll mark my rating a 1010."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-09-05,"along with the witcher 3, zelda ocarina of time, the first red dead redemption and final fantasy 7 the original this goes directly to my top 5 list. an absolute masterpiece..."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-09-03,"runs fine for me on my pc. as for the game i gave it a try ignoring the negative press and it is strangely compelling. i guess a lot depends on if you like the navigating through desolate, rainy and atmospheric lands with the accomplishment you feel once you make it to a safe spot to unwind before heading out again."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-09-02,"kojima has made fetch quests interesting. death stranding isn't a game i would recommend to everyone, but it had its hooks in me and i found myself wanting to play it whenever i wasn't. i guess you could say i was addicted to the dopamine hits of delivery just like a mule, but the then the story turned out to be a unique masterpiece. if you have the patience, and you've liked the past storytelling to kojima games, don't miss this masterpiece."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-30,"there were lots of hypotheses on what this game is gonna be about but at the end of the day, the premise of the story is really pretty simple we are all connected. now, this sentence is where the complexity begins, as kojima masterfully expanded on the meaning of that sentence through many elements of his game. the characters are linked to one another in all kinds of quirky ways, the player is a bridge connecting not only residents of the united cities of america but also other players playing this game, and as the story progresses, we can become more and more connected to the main character thanks to the great and pure performance of norman reedus. it's an astounding take on what the humanity in our world has become thanks to technology, embracing the most important thing it has granted us the ability to connect with others and stay in touch. kojima has mastered the art of creating quaint circumstances in which the player most probably has never found himself or herself in, and creating unique atmospheres and emotions, unexperiencable anywhere else. for that reason alone, it's a game worth playing. from the very start, the gameplay feels like a weird potpourri of the many amazing ideas the developers had, and it continues to prove itself as such through the next chapters. unfortunately, this mixture of ideas doesn't always play well together, making it an unbalanced experience. i really wanted to give this game a higher score, but for the gameplay to start making sense one has to wait about 10 hours  only after that time did i first feel like i am playing an actual game with its own idea of playabillity. there are many elements that feel out of this planet, but then, they are succeeded by tedious gameplay choices, headed by the absurd boss fights with shooting elements that look like they were designed in a rush and feel out of place. i wish they had put more emphasis on the 'delivery' part of the experience  the game would have only benefited from it as it is the strongest part of the gameplay. the most amazing and weirdest part of it is that i could be very much alone in this opinion. there are many ways to choose and experience in this game and it very much felt like a constant journey in search of the way with which i would feel the most comfortable. what i mean by that is it is really difficult to recommend this game to anyone, as everyone will find different elements of the game compelling. the only way to find out is to try it out. this game isn't a masterpiece yet and kojima hasn't really invented a new genre as the rumors had been suggesting but he is definitely onto 'something'. he has already proven himself as an outstanding director, and if he ever decides to release a sequel, all he needs to do is improve on those parts that feel the most kojimaesque and delete those parts that seem to be only there to please fps and tps players, and we might be in for an absolute masterpiece and one of the greatest games of the new decade."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-30,"death stranding is likely the only game that succeeded in making fetch quests fun, by gameplay loop and mechanics alone warning requires at least slight traces of autism to thoroughly enjoy. as is usual with kojima's games, especially late ones, great worldbuilding and totally unique atmosphere go hand in hand with 3rd grade student tier writing mainly dialogues. if you can suffer through those there's an interesting story to follow, complete with expected kojimastyle plot twists and turns. visually the game is very appealing. thumbs up button for game's uncompromising creative vision alone."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-22,this is a masterpiece. i don't normally go out of my way to review a game but i'll make an exception for this because this game is an emotional whirlwind. i will be honest it starts out slow but once you finish chapter 2 the game just gets better and better! in reading other reviews i noticed that some people say the game is broken but just update your driver's i had the same problem at first but a quick nvidia driver update fixed everything. hard ware i have a ryzen 3800 and rtx 2070 super. the game uses dlss 2.0 but doesn't support ray tracing. with that being said this is a great vulcan port to directx 12. this is a must play game.

Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-20,"first of all, it's not for everyone. if you are only into fast paced shooters and action packed games, it may not be for you. to me, this game is an amazing experience. it's one of the most amazingly immersive games i've played in my 30 years as a gamer. the characters, the plot, the gameplay loop, the social aspect, the attention to details, the environment, the mystery behind the story, everything is incredible! if i had to give it a flaw, it would probably be some of the vehicles physics mostly bikes, but it's not enough to lose a point out of 10. if you're not sure if you want to try it or not, watch the first 2030 minutes of a walkthrough on youtube, the decide for yourself! you'll have a good idea of the world and you'll see a bit of gameplay, though a lot of it gets unwrapped after about 10 hours. it's a game where you need to take your time."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-18,"cut scene, and more cut scenes, and too much cut scenes. that's why it is the movie, not a game."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-18,"death stranding is one of that games that i can give 1010 even if i sincerely believe that nothing can be so ideal. it can be so next to ideal, as i think. 3 weeks passed after i finished death stranding. i can't forget it. when i watch a video about the game tears welling up in my eyes. i really think kojima did his best  his new best  in that game. his way of storytelling is not for everyone. i think majority of people won't like his works because the worlds of kojima stand on something that is not real for us  and if you want to understand a game, you should turn off your brain and forget everything. either you convince, or you think the game is delirium. i am used to kojima's way with the help of mgs series. i passed stages of rage and negation.i entered the stage of acceptance. and i lost it when i finished the game. now my world feels incomplete. once i was even scared to go outside in the rain. the game awakened primal fear. the game broke the fourth wall so well it made me uncomfortable. that's the way. bravo. hideo, i am waiting for other masterpieces. i would also like to express my gratitude to the development team for making a competent port and the game has been working perfectly since release. the closetoreality graphics struck from the first minute, i thought it was a recorded video, but it was a cutscene on a game engine. my only remark about the technical performance is that, i think, anisotropic filtering not working very good in city landscape, a lot of shimmer on the horizon. and also the health bars and shoes got less antialiasing and this is very noticeable when they are next to beautiful, perfectly antialiased equipment icons. looks like the bars were upscaled from 360p to fhd and the icons were native fhd. but this is irrelevant. thank you again, thank you all!"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-17,"a completely solid game. it's not for most, but for people looking for a calming game with a hard gameplay loop, it's a great game."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-17,"facinating and moving storytelling based game with new style of gameplay. with out a doubt, kojima knows how to design and wtrite a stroty suitable for new modle game. i totally understand if people don't get into the the form that the game represents. but it was satisfying and full of emotions for me at least. tnx to those who helped this game to be developed for pc with new features."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-17,great plot. excellent acting. excellent production. i really liked the gameplay. great design of locations and everything in the game. i am very pleased with the work of the composer and sound designer. thanks to the developers for a great game.

Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-14,best game i have played in donkeys years. much more than just a walking simulator it's a fantastic experience and story. a lot of people shun it after playing for a hour when the first few hours are mainly a tutorial. the game keeps growing better and better until you can't put it down. death stranding is a frigging masterpiece on the pc.

Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-11,"the best game of the decade! no joke, kojima is genius. he's been able to troll whole gaming industry and did it in perfect manner,"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-11,the pc port for this game is honestly very good for a game that was made for console. no bugs so far and the fps is fantastic. overall great game with a great story and amazing visuals. a must play. p.s. don't mind the negative reviews. most are from people who haven't even bought the gameplayed it. when you check steam it's sitting at around 90 because only people who boughtplayed can rate on steam.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-11,"i really enjoyed the 129 hours in death stranding and completing all the achievements on pc, unlike what i am doing now with the 10 hours that i go in horizon zero dawn, this game deserves more valuation, it is a rare gem that not many are going to understand and you won't even take the time to do it so, you miss it."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-11,"there's one thing to any people who spent time for something, no matter what  read the book, watch tvseries or cinema, look at theater scene, watch the football match and etc. anything of that can be conclude at the final  is it worth it or not. we can read the detective book, where's all book boring, but final twist makes all sense. we can saw a boring 1way game with 50 till the end, where second team make unreal and win 65 and all another situations. the death stranding are the same. the gameplay in the game might be boring and not for any type of players. its repetitive, its boring, yes. the main thing  to show how lonely was sam before that main mission to connect america. but omg that final episodes episodes 1014, final narrative and final twists. it was extremely touching, emotional, shocking and unbelievable ! its make all sense after finishing this journey. 1010 from me, and one of the best experience of all time for me. excellent characters, their stories, their actors play. insane music cmon guys, who not touched by bb's theme?. perfect graphics. what else you need? c'mon  in driving simulators you driving circle maps for 1000 times and no one say its boring blabla. in counterstrikebfoverwatch you play same maps for 1000 hours. here you need some near 1520 hours for story gameplay and people got crazy as  for some reason"

Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-08,"i think the controversy surrounding this game is a matter of semantics. it is, in fact, not a video game but rather a 30 hour long movie with about 10 hours of game play interspersed. if you like scifi flicks then grab the popcorn and settle in for a marathon of a film which will occasionally very infrequently ask you to move the mouse or controller. during the last 5 hours or so you will not even have to do that. all in all, not a bad movie but could have been condensed down to about 2 hours. how would i review the game? i cant, its not a game."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-07,i like the idea of online content and beautiful world graphics. there are some weird elements story telling.. but it's pretty fun.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-07,"definitely a blockbuster gameand a one of a kind. the false reviewers fail to mention this aspect unfortunately. performance is awesome on the pc with buttery smooth framerates. in addition, it's classy game in the making. fun for most people who enjoy a host of different gameplay mechanics riding motorbikes, driving trucks, ziplining through a mountain or river, exploration, inventory management, and last but not least the masterful blend between gameplay and movielike cinematics. storywise, it's something completely new and extraordinary. give it a try"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-07,"never knew who kojima is, now i do. thought this game was all hype, now it's a goty contender. don't just buy this game, inhale it. 1010"

Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-06,"all these negative reviews here are from people who either haven't played the game or are coming here from their experience from the ps4. if you only want to see reviews from people who actually played the game, check the steam reviews it's currently at 94 positive."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-05,"ignore review bombing. the game has a feeling of loneliness, but at the same time of union. alone and at the same time helping and being helped by others. the plot is excellent, unpredictable, captures the player from beginning to end and features great performances by the actors, along with a spectacular soundtrack. when it comes to gameplay, however boring the premise seems, it is very fun and addictive, with great gameplay. the technical part is a spectacular show, incredible graphics, the dcima engine justifies its potential here. in addition, it has a good optimization, they can buy without fear as long as they meet the requirements. i highly recommend it for those who want something different from the usual, who have the patience to understand the proposal and feel the immersion of the universe of the game. it's not for everyone, some won't like it, but it's worth taking a chance. i loved."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-05,this is a true masterpiece . the direction of the story is to be expected for a kojima game. the visual are breath taking and truly wonderful. a game you must try and play at your own pace take your time and disgust the story as you go along.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-04,"gran juego, con ms luces que sombras. el gnero que maneja claramente es incluso ms nicho que el sigilo de metal gear, pero death stranding nunca pretende ser algo que no s. de hecho las 1ras horas se encarga de mostrar la peor cara del juego en lo casual, y solo luego de esto se abre y muestra todo lo que ofrece. asegurndose as que slo los jugadores interesados puedan experimentarlo a su mximo potencial, si esto es malo o bueno es a criterio de cada quin, pero es un hecho que ds demanda al jugador compromiso e inters, o que se marche. s, es un juego donde se camina mucho, pero ni caminar es una mecnica simple o aburrida aqu, ni es la nico para hacer. death stranding no slo es el mejor walking simulator sino el ms profundo, entretenido y aderezado con mil cosas alrededor, adems de un apartado de gestin de recursos interesante, lamentablemente algo lastrado por menes mal hechos. en lo visual y audio, top de lo top indiscutible. en historia, si bien al inicio parece una fumada sin sentido. luego, se convierte en una fumada espectacular con todo el sentido del mundo, cerrando perfectamente y con un moo. ds invent un gnero? tal vez s, o tal vez no. lo que es seguro, es que ahora mismo es imposible hallar un juego similar. y que habra que juzgarlo por los errores dentro de lo que pretende, y no por cosas externas. recriminarle que es malo solo porque es un juego de hacer deliveries, es un sinsentido tan absurdo como decir que los forza son malos porque slo te permite conducir vehculos. el slo hecho de hacer algo diferente y arriesgar, no necesariamente es algo a destacar y meritorio si se hace mal. death stranding, en general, lo hizo muy bien."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-04,"im here because i cannot stand the metacritic users anymore. especially 12 year olds who are not able to grasp that especially older gamers would like to experience something new. every game must be made for them or its bad. so every game must be a new cod or battle royale. and kojima did exactly that! he built something new, something not like that. this is not a perfect game, people who like to play an audiovisual, movie like experience will give it an 8 or 9 out of 10. people who dont like running around, enjoying the beautiful landscape and soundtrack will not like it, the game even then, is still not bad, so take 2 away in that case. pros  beautiful opimized and visually stunning game with implementation of dlss 2.0 on nvidia cards. even with a cheaper card of that kind the game runs perfect up to 2560x1440. even 4k is possible then, bit not at 60 fps. stunning audiovisuals in general. beautiful well placed soundtrack, that only sometimes disturbes natures music  lots of things to do  movie like experience that can be bad.  you dont see the other players, but you see their doings. a well placed bridge on a big chasm, that someone placed there for everyone to use. its not that easy, you have to run around with a big amount of resources that you have to get first if you want to help others. what you get from this is their likes. like facebook. cons  still some bugs on pc, but not that bad.  the beautiful landscape can get filled by bridges, lamps, signs, and everything other players built there. that is not bad, but its disturbes at times the perfect landscape. if you go to new places, you wont see this stuff at first. i have 900 games on steam, and i played maybe 20 of them. i support the industry because i work in the industry myself. but im bored and dont have the time to play most of the games. so this game was stunning to me, something fascinating that got me through work at home and the boring reality of games like cod and battle royale and games that try to please everyone and so in the end please no one."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-04,"one of the few games that makes you want to go back, again and again. stunning soundtrack, landscape, physics except for transport and setting of cutscenes. the game is great, but not 1210. i can't advise everyone, but it's definitely worth a try!"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-04,"death stranding review positives very original, emotional and unique story well written characters amazing graphics addictive walking amazing soundtrack both the original and the songs cinematic cutscenes great performances negatives the only negative would be the melee attack death stranding is probably one of my favourite video game of all time with one of the most unique and original story i have ever seen, with incredibly well written characters and unique gameplay elements."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-04,"in this game,fight with the rugged is the best fun,if you don't know it,and you just a rookie,please don't keep misleading other players."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-04,"most of these negative reviews you will see down here are completely irrelevant. i would highly suggest you check the review score on steam, since it has been review bombed here. people are claiming its the worst game ever made. though most of them have not played it. the user scores on metacritic are completely irrelevant to the critic score, since people review bomb controversial games, and they only give 0 and 10's to games. it is completely redundant. i do understand that this game is not for everyone. but people are just mad that its a walking simulator the bugs are also greatly exaggerated. personally this game has been my favourite game of this year."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-02,"so, at last after having finished the game, im able to write a proper review. from my initial 20 hours or so, i felt that the game was something i really wanted to keep playing and playing, it had something different and unique compared to other games, even though a lot of the normal gameplay in the game can get repetitive, as in many other games, of course. this game has a profound message to deliver, not like the packages we do deliver in game, its delivered via other sources story, cinematography, performance capture, the great actors that voiced the characters, and the minds of the creative team who made all of the story in this game what it is a lot more than just gameplay, sound and cool graphics. this message really hit me hard the more i played, especially in these rough times we live in, but also left me equally happy, afterwards. theres another game from the past few years that made me feel this way, and that game is nier automata, and those of you whove played that one might understand it. the game is amazing, the combat, the characters, buttheres so much more that cant just be explained by a picture, or a trailer, or a cutscene, is the whole message the game is trying to convey, whats important. with death stranding i think this is the case, anyway, i think the games conclusion sets everything pretty clear, its still open to more of the same in a future installmentyes, it is, could be, or could not, it wouldnt matter, its not like the games story hasnt been tied up, it hasbut it still leaves stuff to the player so they make their own theories, if you will, although i believe with all the lore in game we can readyes, read, theres a lot of lore in emails in game, that some people might ignorebut with all of the lore, well explained and all, i think its hard not to understand whats the idea behind the story. furthermore, the smart way to add an online component to the game gets a very notable mention too i loved it, yes sometimes the signs other players leave can be too much or annoying, we don't have to spam likes if we don't want but...i just did, as many as i could, because it made me feel i was not alone while playing this, and i'm pretty sure that was the whole point, that we're connected, in many ways, even if we don't even know each other, we still were able to help each other, with stuff we built and left behind. there's a lot more to that idea than it meets the eye but, as many things in death stranding, one needs to experience the whole package, so i'll leave it at that, but to me it made the gameplay a lot more interesting because whenever i got to a new area and discovered what the other players had set up there, then i had to plan how to set my own structures up, and that made me scratch my brain a lot, finding the best places to put ziplines, and whatnot...i just both hated and loved that, because really some of you...some of you didn't use the map a lot, did you? xd, but well, it is what it is, and i had a lot of fun, which is what matters. i have some small negatives about certain aspects of the game that felt a tiny bit clunky at times, and i have to say that some of the boss fights werent particularly stellar, mechanically at least now visually, as most of the game, some of those were great, thats true. if, after all of that huge amount of text, youre still here, nice, because its time to talk a bit about the pc port itself in summary, its a very good pc version of the game, it ran great all the way through on my ryzen 5 3600 and gtx 1070, no crashes, no slowdowns, no issues, really good performance too. controls are pretty good, with mouse and keyboard because yes, i did play 130 hours of this game with mouse and keyboard, it felt right, because its well done, they put time and effort into making the controls work well with this, and they do work amazingly so. kudos to the devs for understanding what differentiates a pc from a console on this aspect, great job. overall, this is a very unique game, one that us pc gamers could very well have missed, if it wouldve remained exclusive to one sole platform im happy it did not, because death stranding is a great game, its not a perfect game buti dont think ive played any perfect game, even the ones with millions of awards witcher 3, etc. are not perfect, theyre justgreat games, and thats what matters in the end."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-02,epic graphics. awesome story and world. refreshingly different take on an open world rpg. very quirky. a tad grindy but progressive and worth it. super immersive! 910
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-02,"prefiero trabajar de cartero y que me paguen que jugar a esto y pagar, un poco aburrido, igual mas adelante le doy otra oportunidad pero a da de hoy me ha parecido un truo"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-01,"i understand it is not for everybody, but people that give it a 0 are the people who play battle royal all day and have no interest in a good single player game. this game has some flaws, but the story and overal gameplay is just so good. you have tons of freedom, crazy good motion capture cutscenes, a crazy good story. oh yea, this is probably one of the best pc ports ever. do not believe the people that say it is a bad port. this game runs excellent! 0 bugs, 0 crashed, nothing. specs ryzen 7 3700x and 5700xt. please give this game a shot if you feel like you want a good single player experience. it is worth the money!!!"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-08-01,"this is with no doubt the most original and addictive game ever. in addition, the gameplay, graphics, music and story are really stunning, awesome, wonderful... only a genius could have created this great piece of art. and only the dumbest beings on earth will be incapable of giving it the value that it deserves. don't listen to rat kids and fortnite lovers... this game is made for intelligent and mature people. enjoy it as much as i did."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-31,"repetitive, boring trash bookended by an lsd fever dream story. i'm never buying a kojima game again."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-31,"absolute masterpiece. kojima's best game and one of the best stories told this generation. i hated tlou2 and was dying for a great storyline and death stranding always looked so interesting to me but once i heard it was coming to pc, i had to wait to get it there. my nvme made this game's loading time so short that i was never taken out of the immersion. gameplay is tight and fun. story is completely bonkers but incredibly interesting and thought out. the last quarter of the game had my jaw dropping all over the place. and of course, the environments. wow. completely gorgeous, everywhere you go. and norman reedus as sam? he's incredible, as is the rest of the cast. i loved this game so much and definitely recommend it to those with patience, the ability to appreciate art, and those of you looking for an original, totally engrossing story."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-31,"quite an odd game, it really only floats by on its visuals. it looks great, but after you get 5 minutes into the game prepare for crash after crash. then you finally realize the entire game is being a delivery boy while avoiding pitfalls. i'm really confused how this game is so well regarded. you quickly get tired of the sam... breaking in over your radio, the crashes, and pretty lackluster gameplay. it has famous actors, and ads for monster and amc."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-31,"game has an interesting story and concept, unfortunately it is ruined by the length of the game at 4060 hours. this means you will be walking and delivering parcels for that amount of time, the gameplay isn't great the bt's are more annoying than scary massive disappointment imo."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-31,"your money will be a lot more worthy to spend on some bit ches with stds than playing this shi tty game of the century,"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-30,"according to the plot, the game is not bad, and this is the only plus of this game. gameplay, game world and so on pulls the maximum by one."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-30,"it is so hard to rate this game properly, it is such a unique and different approach to modern gaming that its hard to recommend it. i personally love this game,not because it is perfect spoiler its not, but because it is through and trough a truly unique vision from a very unique figure in gaming. i love this game because its not afraid to be its own thing, which is rarely seen these days. i hope a game like this can show some devs the worth of a unique vision."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-30,.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-29,this is the weirdest game i've ever played. unfortunately not in a good way. it's very boring but that's not the real problem. the real problem is simply how weird it is. it's unrelatable on a level that is hard to describe. if the image of three gerbils riding a bottle of mountain dew up a mountain backwards while jesus cheers in the background and holds up a sign that reads free harambe! could be a game then this is it. in short it's just too damn bizarre to take seriously on any level. it's not even strange in an edgy way. it's like a weird contest where every concept is trying to outweird the rest. not for me... don't even get me started on the plot. who wrote this garbage?
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-29,"amazing story. interesting characters. cool gameplay. yeah, sometimes it's a bit work, but the story is enough reward for that. it's an unique experience. runs smoothly on an mid price pc of 2019. i didn't had seen one noticeable bug on my entire playthrough. i don't know whats wrong with all this people, who had seen bugs. maybe they are playing on a toaster. i even don't understand why they are so mad about the gameplay. everyone knows that you have to deliver packages the most of the time."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-29,"death stranding for me was a game i was suspicious of before i purchased, however, a few friends convinced me and i'm glad they did! it's such a refreshing change of pace in a gaming world so oversaturated in openworld rpg's that all feel the same these days. the soundtrack for me was one of the highlights! struggling and feeling every step while scaling a huge daunting mountain, falling and failing repeatedly only to overcome it and reach the summit and look over the beautiful photorealistic scenery while the beautiful music from low roar plays is an experience you really need to experience. the loop was both addicting and relaxing, the story was both deep and enjoyable and the casting is out of this world. it doesn't put it's best foot forward for the first 2 hours but japanese development focuses more on backend heavy design rather than frontend heavy design like in the west. if you are a little bit patient and can find it in your heart to give something slightly different than a 30hour pew pew shooty game then the pay off is amazing. wholeheartedly recommend it. 1010 for me personally. i want to finish by just saying i'm not a hideo kojima fanboy as i've never played any of his other games so it's not the name that's influencing this, i understand this game isn't for everyone but i'm sick of seeing everyone branding every positive review as a hideo fanboy so i had to say it"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-29,who puts 0 and 10  you idiots. when you have already learned to objectively assess.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-29,"hideo kojima is easily one of the most self absorbed developers out there and that is really saying something, spamming his name in caps on every screenshot or video. however as living up to it,. denuvo riddled filth game that is boring and bland at best. 0"

Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-27,"i really hate it. i'm sure people will think i'm just too impatient to enjoy the game, but to me it feels like the made the graphics, then remembered it had to be a game and threw the rest together in a day. i don't mind games with detailed stories, but i've been playing for 2 hours and all i've seen is a guy running around while invisible monsters make noises."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-27,"dont listen to these idiotic negative reviews about the game. instead, go read the positive steam reviews by people who've played it for 20 hours. it's not everyone's cup of tea, but these toxic haters trying to objectively justify why this game is a 010 has made me lose hope in humanity"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-27,"this game is a very mixed feeling. yes, it is gorgeous, and the world multiplayer is something very new and carries a lot of nice social massage. but it is annoying to play for me. it is very slowpaced and a bit tricky to follow. my recommendation if you don't have a free 100 hours to spend just relaxing and walking in quite an empty open world, save your time, and watch an excellent compilation of story cinematics on youtube. the story worth it, but i can see why hideo should go to film now. and yes   !"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-27,"dont believe the 0's, death stranding is another masterpiece by hideo kojima, i enjoy story based cinematic games and this has one of the best. it is a slow game and not for those that expect full on action 100 of the time, this does have some action packed moments but also alot of walking. the gameplay is still good and well worth a 1010."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-27,"can't believe the trolls are back in full force, trying to downvote this game again after their review bombing of tloup2 has failed. don't believe any of the negative reviews on here, it should be obvious from reading them than none of them has even played the game. this is game is truly something special and a wonder in today's world of generic open world games that all look and play similarly. it's a breath of fresh air with beautiful graphics and a haunting story and amazing soundtrack. it might not be for everyone but don't get fooled by the fake hater reviews on here. mc really needs to do something about this soon!"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-27,"how do you rate a game that has rather terrible gameplay in terms of the only challenge being that it's rather annoying to deliver packages? literally, the only challenge is the endless sea of stones scattered throughout the map. however, the story or rather the mythology is well developed. the delivery though, the ending that explains everything literally takes 3 hours consisting of 2.5 hours of cutscenes. you literally just finished the game and it just won't stop ending... at least all questions are answered, no loose endings ala ah you gotta have to interpret that yourself. the concept of the game isn't so bad  deliver packages, reconnect the people. the people just aren't interesting, so there's no point in doing side quests to get to know them better or anything. so my advise here really is just do the main objectives, you'll do more deliveries than you wanted to anyway. and once you get a vehicle you'll hate the stones even more... the vehicle physics are so bad, you'd think this is some indie dev game. it's laughable. do yourself a favor and, even though it's really hard, don't go near stones in the water  you'll get your vehicle stuck. definitely. and the battery life on vehicles is... just astoundingly bad. the physics when carrying packages though makes absolute sense. how you gotta counter the weight by leaning leftright or stopping from falling is perfect. climbing looks like ass though and is unpredictable. if they made driving in the least interesting, sort of like mud runner, it could have been a good game. this however, is a rich story packaged in a bad game. combat is... absolutely laughable. no challenge here, bossfights are boring as fk. the only time it's challenging is when you gotta deliver a package for your last mission and you get a bossfight... and you fall over with the package and it gets broken  which it will... 2 hitsfalling and it's a goner. i really just can't comprehend how you can put so much work into a game and ruin it with horrible gameplay where the core of it just isn't in any way satisfying. it's such a shame. bottom line  can't recommend it."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-27,"is unplayble  crash every 20 minute. dont buy it for full price! if you want to play it, wait for discounts."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-27,"the game is basically a glorified walking simulator with baked on shooter elements. the story of the game is a sad joke. the fan theories of what the game could be about was far more interesting than the banal drivel offered in this game. why is this character called die hardman? because he...died...hard. you'll get typical hideo kojima try hard lines like, i'm fragile but not that fragile without the bombastic and interesting cutscenes of the metal gear solid games. the entire game is an exercise in futility. the story beats you over the head over and over again with stupid lines like, we need to be connected and other things that might have felt cool in kojima's mind but falls flat in execution. don't be surprised if you end up rolling your eyeballs so far inside your socket at the game's sad excuse for twists and revelations. only a fool would be unable to see where this predictable trash story is going to lead. the gameplay is basically a walking simulator amazon prime delivery simulator set in an open, empty world with nothing to do. you walk from point a to point b. unlike what all the idiotic shills like to say, there is no challenge in traversing the dumb environment. there are falling rocks that phase through you without doing any damage whatsoever. this must be the challenge shills were talking about. the game's online basically has roads and ziplines everywhere so it's easy to travel to and fro without. the combat in this game revolves around throwing poo and pee grenades at dumb bullet sponge enemies. enemy ai is stupid and can be easily tricked into loops where you can annihilate them. the music is basically licensed trash that you can listen to while trudging across america which looks a lot like iceland than america. it is clear that kojima spent the bulk of his money on the so called star studded losers from tv and film. all that money wasted, on characters you won't care for, on a game that seeks to insult your intelligence by repeating plot points and threads ad nauseum. the pc version of the game comes with denuvo drm so to hell with gamers willing to pay money for this trash. it also works only on windows 10 and won't work on gpus and cpus that are technically able to run this unappealing wreck . the game still has numerous crashes and bugs on certain hardware setups check the steam forums to know the full extent of how bad this game is. death stranding is quite possibly the worst game made by hideo kojima that fails in every aspect. it's no wonder that sony did not offer him another deal to work with them. they've also stopped revealing sales numbers after the initial flow of articles that said the game sold 200k copies in japan total tally is 399k in japan. death stranding was at the top of the list but quickly toppled over after a few days. to this day, hideo kojima insists his game is not a flop. if it is not a flop, why won't he reveal the sales numbers? last guardian sold around 1.4 million copies. ghost of tsushima sold 2.4 million copies in 3 days. why is kojima the only one who refuses to state how many copies his game sold? please don't post me fake stats from gamstat that says the game has 3 million players there is something called game sharing on playstation. besides, gamstat states on their website that the numbers are not official. what's the point then? kojima insists his game is a success. i don't believe him. the game flopped big time. the steam numbers for the game is pathetic as well. if you want to spend your time on a quality game, kindly play something else rather than this putrid pile of garbage called death stranding. the game spends more time blowing its ck than in at least trying to engage the player in any meaningful form. a stupid game, made by a narcissistic pseudo intellectual game maker who is riding on the coat tails of past successful games. that's what you'll get with death stranding."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-27,"it can be an interesting game for me, but without a good port, it's close to unplayable or at least destroying my experience. huge problems with xbox gamepads. i can't ride in vehicles for some reason with a gamepad plugged in. i see different combinations on screen than what game actually wants to press and it's not showing playstation layout. it's showing xbox buttons but different than what game wants me to press in that moment and i needed to google what to press. cutscenes stuttering. game is crashing turning down some security wall through command fixed it... wtf?. and there are more bizzare problems. i waited few days and i was pretty sure that they will fix it with some quick update and i was surprised that they don't care about it. it's already two weeks after release and there was only one small update which fixed nothing for me. from update page it looks like they care more about people sharing screenshots than playing the game without problems. i don't know how they can put a year of work into this port and then don't care about it after its release. what should people think about them?"

Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-26,"well where do i even start with this? the game is definitely something unique and it'll take you on quite the journey. it's a pretty lengthy game that takes place in a big rich world filled with all kinds of details and hazards, it does a great job at building an emotional connection to the main character and his companions and sometimes even a few villains but and that's a big but, there are parts of the game that do drag on at times, if you are prone to getting bored easily then this might not be the game for you, if on the other hand you enjoy a well crafted world with an interesting deep twisted complicated story that's gradually taught to the player then i can't recommend this game enough. a word of warning, if you are like me and wanna do the side objectives as in getting all preppers on 5 stars then i can only urge you to think about for a good while, there ain't a massive payoff to it and it damn well nearly drove me insane at times, i recommend only doing so if you are really determined and wanna see every little bit of content in the game."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-26,"best game every. very interesting plot, characters and lor of the game. everyone buy it and enjoy!"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-26,impossible to understand what the player shoud do. just a waste of time and money. no way to understand what is meaning of the game.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-26,"after its first review bombing was a failure, the lynch mob is at it again to attack death stranding's exceptionally optimized pc port. take it from me the steam reviews are what you should be looking at here."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-26,"it's a masterpiece. finally something new. the story is great, the art is awesome, i love everything about it. i did have to deal with some crashes though.. i can agree that this game isn't for everyone, but people rating it 0 probably think fortnite has a rich story."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-25,",     ,     1010,    ."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-25,"death stranding is not a game for everyone. a cynical person could say, that hideo kojima looked at the most tedious fetch quests from various openworld rpgs, at the most boring aspects of ingame inventory management, and built an entire game around that. a cynical person would be right, in a way. but that's not all this game is. death stranding is a game about challenging deliveries of various packages through desolate postapocalyptic landscape. but here's the thing. in death stranding, it's not boring. at least if you're invested and interested in the world. true, to an action game fan that just needs a quick shoot'em fix, this might be boring. but a thinking scifi fan will get  in fast. the worldbuilding and atmosphere is fantastic, and trying to find out more and more about what the hell happened to the world keeps you going. the key thing here is  it's slow. it's deliberately slow. it wants you to pause and think. i hated fetch quests in rpgs like elder scrolls or fallout. but here, it's something entirely different. the landscape itself is your enemy. the weather is too. there are groups of npcs who try to steal your packages, there are everpresent ghostly bts that terrorize areas wasted by timefall. so yeah, you're delivering packages, but it's not just delivering packages. you're constantly struggling with enormous load on your back, with the unforgiving terrain, with timefall and exposure, with enemies. it's a struggle and it feels great to finally deliver a package and get to safety after a challenging run. while you're running around the ruined landscape, you're connecting isolated pockets of people who somehow survived the apocalypse, and now struggle to carry on. the point is, that what would be tedious and annoying in any other game is challenging and interesting here. this game is different, yes, but in a good way. there's so much more to it than meets the eye. it is a mix of several genres stealth, action, horror, but survival is probably the most prominent one. the production is fantastic. it feels like you're watching some kind of postapo movie most of the time. there are vibes from stalker, thing, aliens, or maybe more modern movies like oblivion, annihilation or edge of tomorrow. as always in hideo kojima's games, there are tons of mails and additional information you can read, and i recommend everyone to not skip through these materials. this is a game for a thinking person, you have to take it slow, you cannot just jump in, play for 30min and quit. it doesn't work that way. there are truly revolutionary ideas like the invisible enemies, player character's death turned into a gameplay mechanism, weather constantly eroding playerbuilt structures and the ability to indirectly help each other, there's just too much to unpack, to describe, but this little review window is not a proper place to do it. i wholly recommend this game to people who often think about the life, universe and everything , who think about how this civilization might end, how it somehow feels downright weird that it hasn't happened yet, about the polarization in todays society, and how internet brought us together and isolated us at the same time. i recommend this game to people who like walking simulators, who like survival and crafting games, who like openworld games for the freedom of being able to go anywhere you want, who like scifi and postapocalyptic themes. i don't recommend this game to people who just collect games, who download a game, and finish it in shortest time possible to move to another title. i don't recommend this game to action game fans, or to casual players. i would give it 1010, but there are few things that could be better. mainly, the game has absolutely terrible vehicle physics, and the abundance of multiplayer icons everywhere ruins the beautiful landscape views and therefore the atmosphere. i'd welcome a way to somehow limit the amount of multiplayer icons you see in an area. also, 505 games really screwedup the port, and at a time of writing this, there are pretty bad issues. there's a lot of extreme stuttering when loading new areas, and constant crashes to desktop, but afaik this isn't kojima production's fault, so i'm not counting that towards the final score."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-25,"can't. stop. playing. easily best game of 2020. gorgeous graphics. captivating storyline. addictive gameplay but addictive like water, or food, not crack. superb soundtrack. a semiunique online experience  think dark souls. all in all, highly recommended. do not listen to negative reviews of people, who haven't even played the game. saying its amazon delivery simulator 2020, also, do not watch any videos. don't spoil it for yourself."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-25,"it's been a great journey , it's different ... i've never played anything that encourages me to go out of my way to help other players get through the game . and the more you help people the easier it gets for them , and in return for you! the story is amaxing , i really loved it. this game is definitely gonna stick with me for a while"

Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-23,"i've played for 15 hours on the pc version on hard. i must say i still love this game. it gives me a sense of exploration, og solitude, excitement and even wonder and psychological horror. it's not often a game brings so many emotions and i love the atmosphere and music. i give this a solid 9 out of 10. other fav games the witcher 3, dark souls, ni no kuni, ori, monster hunter, rdr2,"

Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-22,"one of the best experience on a video game ... thanks mr kojima, you bring something different than just boring pvp or politics game. this is metaphysic as hell !"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-22,don't waste your money on this horrible game. the developers should have known that the game will be bad that's why they took famous actors into this game and kojima as the selling point. wait for the price drop. story is horrible and i would rather be walking outside then in this bad game.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-22,"the unusual and mysterious world where was interesting to be. who can think that delivery quests could be interesting? so, i gave 8 because of the novel daring gameplay. i got pleasure. but if i would play a second game like this, i will give max 6. because characters are naive and enemies too dumb, therefore i can't truly immerse in that world."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-22,do you like delivering packages for hours and hours to one sided boring characters??? this is the game for you. do you like painfully long cut scenes that makes this so call game feel more like a movie??? this game is for you!!!!! what a shame kojima new game is this dumpster fire.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-22,"the game is hard to get used to, it's not the best game with the best graphics but it's not terrible. there's many negative things about this game, i was hoping it wouldn't go too far from mgs, the gameplay is frustrating for me to play."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-22,magnificient. it's definitly a great and beautiful game ans exprience i've been through
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-22,truly mind blowing world with thoughtful mechanics amazingly acted and directed story.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-22,"this was my second time playing through the game. the game looks so much better than the ps4 version and runs much better too. there were a few bugs occasionally, including one that caused the game to crash every couple of hours. other than that, the story and gameplay are amazing. i know some people like to say that the movement and gameplay is sluggish, and i would have to disagree. there are so many different tools you can get a hold of that alter the experience and equipment that can make traversing certain landscapes much easier. it sometimes seems as if people just like to  on this game because it is a 'walking simulator' but it is so much more than that. i do find it strange that there are so many people leaving negative reviews saying the story and gameplay are boring when, according to steam, only 3.7 of people have actually completed the game this only accounts for steam, but nobody in their right mind would buy it on epic games launcher anyways . it can be said that this game is definitely not for everyone. if you have a short attention span, or do not like very story intense games, then i would say it is not worth a purchase. it is also worth adding that the first few hours are much slower than later on. so far, i have immensely enjoyed my experience with the game, even with it being a second play through, and am one achievement away from getting them all. one of the best story games in recent times."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-21,"ds is absolutely not as great, as this game should have been. poor plot, boring gameplay and bottomless ocean of fake brilliance. ah, and it was ported, but, tbh, it needs some serious technical improvement."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-21,"i have around 32 hours played on this game between both ps4 and pc. i have not yet finished the game but i have to say i really am enjoying playing through this game when it works. i was going to give the game an 810 but after a few crashes, ai quality and some bugs, the game has dropped majorly for me. editing this after yet another crash, the game at the moment is unplayable for  game looks great, the soundtrack is awesome and the story is fine with me, i'm actually looking forward to seeing what happens if the game will ever let me continue playing it. fix the bugs, glitches and crashes and this review will rise back to an 8. the more crashes that happen, the more i will come back an reedit and keep lowering that score."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-21,"!!!early access game!!! this port is awful, crashes, stutters, game breaking bugs, devs have nothing to say to those who encountered these problems, waste of money."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-21,"pretty much every modern game is all about traversing across worlds in 3d space, but that is barely represented in the gameplay itself. you know how in skyrim you can just click on every item in the game to  it into your inventory and as long as you're not overencumbered you can just glide yourself and all that precious cargo up the side of a mountain? death stranding feels like a direct response to this. it's a game where you traverse across an open world, and the game is actually about playing the experience of traversing across an open world. this game is not for everyone, but if you fall into the target demographic for this type of thing it is absolutely your game and you owe it to yourself to play it, if for no other reason than it successfully gamifies something that in retrospect should have been a more obvious thing to gamify. personally, i have always enjoyed hiking and backpacking and this is by far the game that brings me closest to that type of activity about an hour and a half in i was walking over some rocky patches of ground and noticed the character kind of do some alternating little leaps from foot to foot to cross it and it looked exactly like how i have hiked on rocky trails before. this is a game that understands walking downhill can actually be harder and more dangerous than the steepest uphill trek. the writing? it's kojima, again if you're in this target demographic then it is absolutely for you and if you aren't that's ok. the themes are going to be out there, the metaphors are going to be a bit on the nose, no one will talk like any actual human does, but you're still just going to be so invested the nest time you walk outside and it starts to rain your first thought is going to be about avoiding the timefall. i'm not done with the main story yet 16 hours in at the time of typing this, but i can already tell this is going to be a game that sticks with me for many years."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-21,"it's an amazing game. new, fresh games are always welcomed. it's not your typical gameplay that we saw already a thousand times. it's something truly new. the first 610 hours can be tedious, but after that the game opens up and it becomes a true masterpiece. in other games the action happens at point a or b. in this game, the action is in between. the walking, climbing, building structures to ease the way and so on. that is the gameplay. and it's really good."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-21,are you guys kiddin me. this game is out for about a year and you guys are still surprised its the game it was before? its funny that the overall score of people on steam rate this game overly positive. and you cant rate the game if its not in your library. sth for you to think about metacritic.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-21,"the game even being something very different than the most known work of kojima metal gear has that kojima trademark that any fan will quickly recognise, and love. the story is pretty much intriguing and will keep you hold to the end, sometimes you will have a strong feeling of wtf is happening, but everything will unfold at the end leaving you with a good feeling, however, i find in sam the very same problem that i found in venom snake, the guy barely speaks, and when he does a lot of times what he says is pretty contradictory. the gameplay is unlike anything you have experience, i've seen many people saying the game is boring, because i've seen it in twitch and it looked boring... wrong, the game make you choose your path, which many times challenge you to take dangerous decisions, you need to focus on how to manage your inventory and what you can carry, and where are you going to get carrying that, that is the big difference between seeing it and playing it, so don't trust the gameplays, if you are not sure, rent it, play it, and if it still doesn't convince you just don't buy it, but i strongly advise you against making a judgement only based on what you can see on twitch. pros cons amazing story protagonist is sometimes too silent compelling characters dull combat  impressive voice acting not pretty awesome bosses addictive gameplay"

Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-18,"ok, firstly. i do not have ps4 i sold my pro like 2 years ago. only gaming pc and i mainly play on xonex. i started to game and grow up with 8bits zx spectrum. i was mostly not fan of the exclusive ps games, yes they were ok games, but mostly overhyped and although very cinematics and with very high audio video presentation, to me, most of them were boring. so you have the introduction, so you can see i am not hater of sony, although i do not have their console. now to most honest review regarding ds. i was expecting boring walking simulator as a lot haters says. i buy the game on pc and try to stay with open mind and without any influence. so what you get from ds? it starts slowly with a lot cinematics... but it is just due to slow and carefull introduction in to this strange world. i keep comming back to the game night by night and long cinematics stops and gameplay opens to full potential. it is not walking simulator. definately not. it has addictive gameplay actually. audiovideo is at very high standard, animations are great. story is interesting, world is amazing, as well as atmosphere. i explore everything myself and find this world and creator of this world nearly genius, because nobody ni gaming industry offers you such a detaily described and rich world of unknown with all of its details, which starsts to make sense. as game opens, its freely up to you... u can do side quests, do what you want, upgrade what you want and explore they way you want. you can build and make your life easier, you can fix vehicle early on to open possibilities... i am 15hrs in and game is still throwing new and new things to me! look, i game like over 35 years already, and if this game does not deserve full max score 1010 i really do not know, which other game can deserve this. you have like everything in here and with very high standard executed. i recommend this game to anyone sink their time in to. it is really worth it. regarding performance  i have just a average pc, but game runs on max without problem on 1440p on my sysstem. i did not have single crash to desktop or single bug. game is not stutter on my pc at all. port is very well done 1060 6gb  i54690."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-18,the negative reviews of this game are some prime examples of people love violence in gaming over a decent exploration in a triple a title......... i know some don't have violence but still entertain this is just like it a nonvoilent game with good graphics and vast exploration

Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-18,"for now it's still unplayable. cutscenes are stuttering. game is telling you to press down  lt  b for example, but you need to press right  rb  a and i need to google everytime how it is on console to understand it. also i can't go forward with vehicles, only backward keyboard or gamepad, both with same problem. scanner on bts is also bugged and is not working in stealth parts and that's connected with other problem, i can't even see bts i know i should see them sometimes. i waited for a patch, which should be up in day 1... i waited 3 days for first patch and it fixed nothing for me."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-18,"quite a solid walking simulator, totally ruined with kojima's pretensious, hamfisted kitcsh. you, kojimasan, could not write your way out of a shoebox, if you are ever in doubt, come, i will give you a certificate in writing. please, do something, kendo, kabuki or brew tea, but something else. the stories you create are ridiculous, pretensious, and unpalatable. this one comes with heaps of hardtochew side of let's reconnect america into some sort of nonprofit, facebook like driven, postcommunist utopia everyone works like mad just for facebook likes. and as the story advances, it goes worse and worse. the obligatory bad people made boom with bad nuclear weapons, transdimensional booboo, egyptians, stuff stolen from daniken like pyramids, coming from the dead, immaterial soul, out of body travels, pseudoscience babble a chemical called chiralis handium that makes little hand crystals grow everywhere, in large concentrations makes dead drag you with their hands into a pool of bad, bad crude oil, leaving handprints on your body  i am not kidding. characters like diehardman and deadman, and heartman, and it gets worse and worse. towns named central knot, fort konox, warehouse west of central capital knot, you will never remember where is what. clumsy, convoluted language  deathless freaks, bridges  people connecting americans, the president is called bridget, and it goes on and on. pretentious, nonsensical, trihard kitsch. hideo kojima is ed wood of game design."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-18,"this is one of the best games ive ever played. it is strange, unconventional, and seems like it might not work. but within the first 5 minutes, the weight of its atmosphere, the setting, landscapes and storytelling, the otherworldly images, and supernatural highconcept ideas and theories immerse you utterly. the deliveries become meaningful, symbolic, and you really start to feel the presence of others through their ladders, ropes, and bridges. these little signs that someone else has passed this way take on a real poignancy. its particularly powerful when youre carving a new path across a desolate mountain range and leaving signs and ropes yourself, knowing youre the first. all the gear, tech and gadget are awesome and creative, you find things are genuinely useful, and you really feel their absence if you left one behind .... honestly this is an experience like nothing else..."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-17,"boring interactive movie walking simulator with no real gameplay. stay away or waste your money, the choice is yours."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-17,kojima is a genius. this is an excellent walking simulator. 1010.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-17,"kojima designed this game in stark contrast to the speed demon culture that has emerged in video gaming's modern era. must the mark of intelligence and success be dictated by how fast the player is? this game demands a shift in attention to detail and planning amidst the turbulence of an apparent maelstrom. playing on very hard difficulty. this game is meant to build a sustainable mindset that keeps you alive when so many other games numb you to throw the baby out with the bath water. if you play with the online network, you join all other users in building a neoamerica. so to say this game is a delivery man walking simulator is quite shallow. you must think about the dna structure and how it consists of a primary structure, and then secondary bonds of the single strand, and then tertiary bonds with other strands. the walking and delivery component is merely the primary structure. the goal is gene expression, when you reach tertiary bonding to express a fully realized operational city base linking to other city bases  all from user bases' creation. therefore, maybe its like a sim city  from the ground, building up. or rather, a simneoamerica. if players keep playing, it can only keep evolving throughout the years. the negative reviews must only mean 1 thing. they are trying to prevent the advent of neoamerica."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-17,excellent story telling and interesting world! kojima gave us the whole world of interaction and hope. great acting from the celebrities!
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-17,"personally i thought that in terms of gameplay and story this might've been slightly lacking, the world, however was one of the most beautiful i'd ever played in. i loved playing this after a long day to chillax on whatever the normal difficulty was. i finished it eventually and while it didn't change how i think about the medium or anything i'd play it for the first time again if i could."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-17,"this game really it is so confuse, man why does a baby that  his finger is your best way to defend yourself??"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-17,"one of my favorite games, and it looks even better on pc.  very different from any other game i have played before when it comes to gameplay mechanics and the goals you try to achieve.  strong story, good cinematics, with a moral message that will not appeal to the war drummers and altright!  yes slowpaced at the begging and a little bit of a learning curve, but that's what you expect from a game with rpg elements from kojima.  finally really lovely romantic songs and music that just ties everything together and soften the hard edges of dark reality in the world the game is good at making you believe exists! i could easily say this game was worth every penny i spent on it. i am hoping kojima studios will keep expanding on it and giving us more!"

Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-17,"the game is pretty specific. but that's her charm. the game creates a wonderful connection between gameplay and storyline. there is no gross, plot twists for plot twists. the story immerses you, and the gameplay only enhances this immersion. kojima masterfully shows with this game that games of 2020 don't need to be provocative, dividing people into two camps and a sea of mud."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-16,"a frase no  para todo mundo  batida e tem seus porns. pois sim, ele pode ser para todo mundo, depende muito da poca que ir jogar. pois todos mudamos no decorrer da vida, e o que hoje pode ser apenas um jogo do entregador do ifood, amanh pode ser algo mais. portanto se voc  um desses que acha que o jogo  s um simulador de caminhada e entrega, aconselho a esperar uns anos, ganhe uma barba na cara metaforicamente falando e ai pense em jogar, provavelmente vai pensar diferente. o jogo tem grficos inacreditveis para o final dessa gerao, com um p na nextgen, e aqui no pc voc v o real potencial disso tudo, em ultrawide o jogo fica lindo, e estou rodando lisinho em um r3600 e uma geforce 1660 gtx. otimizao sensacional. o jogo tem uma trilha sonora extremamente boa, som e dublagem br muito acima da mdia. a jogabilidade no  nada fora da realidade como muitos pensam, quem jogou mgsv no vai ter problemas de se adaptar, tem alguns detalhes e coisas que ao jogarmos percebemos ser diferentes, mas nada fora da realidade de qualquer jogo mundo aberto. o mundo do jogo  morto? sim, mas isso tem um motivo, e somos apresentados a quase todas as explicaes do que ocorre nesse mundo na primeira meia hora de jogo, ento s se voc tiver um qi de minhoca, no vai sacar que esse mundo est todo ferrado e tem um motivo. o jogo  s caminhada? no. temos muitos momentos em que vamos querer fugir da ao, pois em vrios momentos seremos abordados por inimigos humanos e sobrenaturais, quando apenas queremos passar de boa para terminar uma longa jornada. e tambm no  caminhada pois temos veculos, ento depois que libera a moto, caminho e etc, tudo fica mais fcil. o grande destaque fica nas expresses faciais dos personagens.  surrel...muito bem feita. a histria do jogo  maluca mas tudo faz sentido e se amarra, mais ou menos como a srie dark que  uma boa comparao. o jogo  repetitivo sim, mas qual jogo no  hoje em dia, a diferena  termos um motivo para essa repetio, um motivo para tudo que est sendo feito, e ao menos isso, death stranding te d, no somos meros entregadores, como muitos pensam. enfim,  um jogo diferente mas nem tanto, sua narrativa  incrvel, e quem gosta de pensar, gosta de enredo com camadas, vai certamente apreciar esse game. obs nunca um game que saiu a quase 1 ano se tornou to atual, em meio a pandemia de corona vrus, entendo um pouco mais o mundo de ds."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-16,"sooo boooring. not engaging story, long walking without any significant purpose, so long clips that you cannot stop or skip. not worth the time nor money."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-16,"it's a fantastic game, no doubt about that. from the time i was able to play of it, it was very engaging and looked beautiful. it was also incredibly well optimized. ... when it wasn't glitching or crashing. the game had a new texture bug every few minutes and crashed for me every five. it's hard to get into the game when there's always a fear that i could fall through the floor or have my progress reset. i'd definitely give the game a higher score if these issues were fixed, or, at least, severely mitigated."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-16,"an amazing kojima game that does not disappoint! the story, atmosphere it brings, connected with intriguing game mechanics truly makes it a masterpiece."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-16,"i had low expectations. never played a hideo kojima game before. sometimes the game got boring, but the story compensates. i wont talk about the game, i dont want to spoil anything for anyone. its the firsf time i left a rating on a game. it was that good for me."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-16,"intriguing play style and experience, the world kojima has created is one of wonder and exploration! complicated story and beautiful graphics. even though i have finished the game i feel myself leaning back to play it so i can discover every little easter egg and interaction i can find! never played any of kojima's games before but i definitely will now."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-16,"it is good to see a game with so many refreshing mechanics and experiences. let take a look to the game graphics what can i say, they are amazing, the 3d engine provided by guerrilla is one of the most advanced one, performing excellently moving big maps. the details are impressive and the face expressions are close to real life. the technology behind is one of its strongest points. sound the environment effects are created nicely and they sound like they must, nothing revolutionary but doing a good job. the voices of characters are nicely recorded and match with the face expressions. the music does ok with good and chill themes around that appear under pressure. nothing to complain. game play well, i liked it a lot, but i can understand that this is not a game for everyone. do not be fooled, this is a walking simulator and it has all the good and the bad of these types of games. you will expend hours trying to reach a point with no interaction with any living form apart form the protagonist. it is a game that you will enjoy if you like to child out and enjoy the journey with some punctual combat moments. the combat, on the other hand, feels simple and out of options. story remember this is a kojima game, so you shall expect a lot of confusion during the game, with a lot of second meanings and unconcluded elements. after finishing the game, you would probably try to find an explanation of the ending in internet. for me the story could be better as it is a complex and slowpaced apocalyptic tale told by npcs through large cinematics. am i the only one that miss simpler stories as mgs the twin snakes or mgs 3 snake eater? online the online system is something similar to dark soul you cannot summon other players but players support each other building elements that other players can use to make the journey easier. performance the game run smoothly in pcs that are 4 years old. the engine is really optimized and it look amazing, but this game has a drm that slows the game close to 20 denuvo. this evil drm affect deeply the performance of the game and i am not really up to install this kind of programs that fill your computer with trash and undeleted element in the pc. good things  technology behind the game is awesome  refreshing game play  first line actors  original online system  music is ok bad things  denuvo for god shake  not a game for everyone  combat system can be better  the story can be confusing, again not for everyone i would give this game an 8.5 points, but the denuvo drm is an evil that must be destroyed in the pc industry. sadly, i must give this game less points. unfortunately, i bought the game before i knew this game has denuvo."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-16,this game was created with good idea but it is really bad. i understand that kojima tried to create something new and fresh but it went horribly wrong. gameplay is horrible and boring but music and graphics are great. but who plays game to just look at the graphics and listen to the soundtrack. there is spotify and artworks for that.
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-16,"fatal error occurred. when yesterday i've played my tenth hour with the game, the application crashed. my computer was resetted, and when i've reopened the game my save data was deleted. i can't understand why this happened, but goddammit i've wasted all my progress with this game! i think that i'm going to ask for a refund, until they resolve this delete save data issue."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-16,"substantially it's a poorly designed game. with really big flaws this deliveryman simulator is basically a glorification of the fetch quests, the worst kind of mission for an open world game today. you go from point a to point b for all the time, and very often with very long and repetitive cutscenes. the writing and the gameplay they are also bad, and i've encountered even some really big bugs during different missions. if i can give you an advice, save your money."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-15,"death stranding se puede definir sin temor a equivocarse con una sola palabra nico. te puede gustar o no, pero esta experiencia porque ms que videojuego es una experiencia es diferente a cualquier otro juego que haya en el mercado. es increble que un ao antes de la pandemia que nos dej aislados y demandando delivery's, kojima haya sacado este juego tratando estos temas tan profundos sobre la conexin y la importancia de crear puentes. no contento con eso, nos narra una historia intimista sobre los lazos generacionales. y en mi caso, que soy padre desde hace poco, no pude ms que sentirme congojado profundamente con los hechos que se suceden en la historia de sam. para mi, es una obra maestra que va ms all de la nota y del entretenimiento. es un videojuego con nombre y apellido que nos habla, nos atraviesa, nos hace pensar y sentir como casi ningn otro."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-15,"not so bad optimized, incredible story, characters and world. graphics is a little better then on ps 4. death stranding is a unique fusion of american and japanese culture. somewhere it fell to 40 fps, but its not critical."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-15,"i enjoyed the fact hideo tried an entry of something completely different. music was fantastic, visuals excellent but unfortunately the actual gameplay fell flat for me. many peoe will enjoy the traversal, but me personally found it boring and to repetitive to invest more of my time. i rated it 510 as a you'll either love it or hate. i played a good 20 hours and payed 50 for it but am reluctant to return to it. i knew it was a gamble i have read the story is amazing but getti g to that point i ran out of steam. weirdest thing is i would recommend it because it's so different and unusual you have to try it just in case it is your masterpiece... that's how goodbad it is.... there's no denying it's unique it's just boring to a gamer whose been spoilt this generation on playstation. maybe next time kojima"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-15,"death stranding on pc is really well optimised, it looks absolutely stunning and it runs perfectly smooth on the highest resolutions with max settings. the game is not a run and gun or spam one button repeatedly to kill everyone and win, but it's a game that requires your passion, time and patience. it's definitely a masterpiece but not for everyone. death stranding is different than all the games out there. walking for long distances gives you the feeling that you're actually walking across the states. it wouldn't feel real and it wouldn't be immersive if you just ride a super fast vehicle and just get there in 30 seconds. i imagine a post apocalyptic world to have less to no vehicles. while the game isn't another metal gear it does in fact have that kojima vibes into it but in its own way. the game has a very special effect on you that starts kicking in the first two hours. and if you do play this don't expect a shoot'em up kill'em all and roll the credits kinda game. the story takes its time to build up and it's absolutely worth it if you're not in a rush."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-15,"just amazing like ps4. a masterpiece. o game mais premiado de 2019 com 80 goty's, death stranding est acima da compreenso de muitos e a frente do nosso tempo, sem dvidas.  difcil colocar em palavras ou definir o tamanho da obra de hideokojima por conta de sua grandeza. os mistrios que rodeavam o jogo antes de seu lanamento se mantm na gameplay, inclusive at o ltimo instante, mas no final tudo  respondido e esclarecedor. a histria  uma das mais envolventes e complexas no s desse ano, ou dessa gerao, mas de todos os tempos sendo muito bem guiada e conectada. a gameplay, dentro de sua proposta,  tima e inovadora, diferente de tudo que j vimos e conhecemos. problemas com jogabilidade so mnimos.  muito interessante o paralelo de estar em um mundo vazio, abandonado, entretanto ter inmeras interaes com outros players online, vendo placas de apoio, aviso, trocando likes e aproveitando construes j feitas. a imerso do jogo  um dos pontos mais fortes, se voc se dispe a entrar de cabea na histria com certeza ao finalizar ficar sem saber o que fazer. os grficos so provavelmente os melhores j feitos at o presente momento, tendo uma variao grande de cenrios tambm. death stranding  uma obra que fica para a histria.  muito mais que um estouro de vendas ou um game que busca prmios, por mais que tenha conseguido. death stranding conseguiu o que hideo kojima queria tocar as pessoas de uma forma maior do que um simples game. no  para todos, de fato, mas para quem aderir a proposta,  uma das melhores experincias que um jogo j ofereceu at hoje."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-15,"i'm loving the story and characters so far, it's really well acted and entertaining. it's something new, different from the typical genres. it really isn't for everyone, it reminds me to games like farming simulator or truck simulator, where i dont get why people play them, but death stranding it's really entertaining for me, so now i get it xd the port is done absolutely fantastic, no lag, always over 60fps, zero crashes or glitches"
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-15,"exceptional experience, great cinematic direction, complicated story, addictive gameplay, one of the greatest game in the gaming history."

Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-15,"i've finished and platinumed this game on ps4, bought it again to support kojumbo and because of the unlocked framerate and bonus goodies. i might be biased since im a huge kojima fan but in all honesty i think this game was brilliant. the psychological horror, the post apo setting, this whole sense of what the fck is going on, that you can only find in a kojima game. the reason why i dont give a perfect review is because despite everything death stranding does great it still suffers from wonky controls, i've found myself stumbling and falling where i shouldn't be, my character sometimes walking forward without me even touching the joystick and so on. it's not perfect but apart from that the whole experience is simply magical. sitting with bb next to a waterfall while listening to the relaxing tracks that plays whenever you are resting, walking on long stretches of land with songs from low roar that was hand picked by kojima... this game really is a spiritual journey in my opinion. if you havent played it on ps4, definitely pick it up on pc, the unlocked framerate makes it beautifully smooth. if, like me, you played and finished ds on ps4, consider waiting for a sale. unless you're a die hard kojima fan or simply want to experience the 60 fps. the game isnt really demanding either so you won't have a hard time running it. see you in the field, porter."
Action,Death Stranding,2020-07-15,"very boring, the game is literally made of fetch quest. may be fun for people looking to dose off while playing, but definitely not for everyone."
