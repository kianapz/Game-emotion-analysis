1i7mvq0,2025-01-22,2025-01-22,That intro tutorial allowing you to play through the intro of Raiders was a ***massive*** kick to my nostalgia
1i7mvq0,2025-01-22,2025-01-22,Agree!
1i7mvq0,2025-01-22,2025-01-22,"I agree. I loved the villain, he was an ass, but with a lot of charisma, narcissism and sociopathic tendencies. you can see why people would follow him but also want to punch him out (besides just, y'know, punching out a Nazi)

I do think later game a lot of the brawling and stealth started to feel clunky (like when you're in the river area, I forget its name), but still it was an enjoyable experience. 

and yes I also felt compelled to do all of the side quests, though I didn't do like the medicine bottles and stuff (I didn't go out of my way, I'd get them if I found them).  

Also it poorly explains itself, like in the final boss fight, it REALLY was bad at telling you how to beat him after you spent a half hour knocking his ass down for him to get back up."
1i7mvq0,2025-01-22,2025-01-22,"GOTY for me.

I felt smack dab in the middle of a Indiana Jones movie from the 80s (which is what the game is, between Raiders and Last Crusade). I literally felt like Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones the whole movie. The voice acting especially was superb; I'm not sure Harrison could tell his own voice apart from this game's.

There are flaws to the game (AI is crap, combat is a bit janky, stealth is hilarious like you can be in stealth mode holding a torch ) .... but my goodness the game is fucking beautifully crafted. Fun puzzles, great characters, the whip is fun to use, the locations were dope, the story is great, a perfect villain, etc....

I even liked the fact that loading into a game goes from the menu screen straight into the game. Neat addition.

Oh, and it's amazing to just play to beat the shit out of Fascists and Nazis.

But the best part was simply ..... you felt like you went through an Indiana Jones movie. Just felt exactly like the original trilogy.

10/10."
1i7mvq0,2025-01-22,2025-01-23,"Without spoiling anything for me - can you please answer this?

Can I return back to areas later to do side-quests? Like once I leave Giza can I go back later?"
1i7mvq0,2025-01-22,2025-01-22,Looking forward to playing this on playstation later this year. It looks class.
1i7mvq0,2025-01-22,2025-01-22,I keep coming back to this game just to beat up Nazis
1i7mvq0,2025-01-22,2025-01-23,Haven't played it yet but it's currently installing because for some reason I have a strong urge to inflict violence upon nazis. I have heard nothing but good things about the game so I'm looking forward to it.
1i7mvq0,2025-01-22,2025-01-23,I think I'm very close to the end now and I'm trying to make it last as long as I possibly can. It's easily in my top 3 games from the last few years.
1i7mvq0,2025-01-22,2025-01-23,"I remember renting the Last Crusade NES game when I was like 12 or 13 and imagining what it would be like if they could make a game as good as the movie. 

That popped into my head in the Egypt section of Great Circle and I got choked up. Like a childhood dream had come true and it made me really happy. 

I have some gripes with the game but I also had more fun with it than any big AAA game I've played in years."
1i7mvq0,2025-01-22,2025-01-23,I absolutely loved this too. It took me way back to playing Indy on the Sega back in the 90s.
1i7mvq0,2025-01-22,2025-01-23,"Good that the game isn't an open world game even if I would prefered more explorations, anyway I agree abouth the story who really similar to the Indiana Jones mivie stories"
1i7mvq0,2025-01-22,2025-01-23,I’m playing the game right now and it’s been great so far
1i7mvq0,2025-01-22,2025-01-23,The side mission where you >!hallucinate!< was an absolute trip
1i7mvq0,2025-01-22,2025-01-23,One of my fav games in a while. I just wish Harrison did the voice. Knowing it was someone else irked me
1i7mvq0,2025-01-22,2025-01-23,"Just finished it too. 

For me it was the true, 4th indiana jones movie. It was perfect in every shape and way. I can't wait for the DLC and I hope to God they do another game cause man. The studio has got the classic indi format down."
1i7mvq0,2025-01-22,2025-01-23,I didn't get into it but I really appreciate how much it felt like they gave a shit when they made it. You can really tell how much they appreciate the source material.
1i7mvq0,2025-01-22,2025-01-24,"Great game.

The callback to the swordsman scene in Raiders was just perfect. Also one of the few places in the game where I think taking that option works.

The closeups of the Nazis' faces when you're beating them down are just fantastic.

(And to anyone who has trouble beating the underground fight clubs, the last guy at every place post Vatican requires a powered-up knockout punch, which I'd forgotten was an option.)"
1i7mvq0,2025-01-22,2025-01-24,"Yeah, it's an instant classic. Really loved everything about it."
1i7mvq0,2025-01-22,2025-01-24,"Started playing last night, loving it, some real LOL moments, the acting is awesome, a solid adventure title we don't get very often these days..."
1i7mvq0,2025-01-22,2025-02-25,"I just bought the Premium Digital version and I installed the game, but I'm not sure about the DLC. If you buy it as a package deal, like I did, does the DLC automatically get installed and become part of the main game? If not, how do I access it? Also, how do you access the other digital goodies that come with the DLC?"
1i7mvq0,2025-01-22,2025-01-24,I've heard good things but hardly anyone has played it.
1i7mvq0,2025-01-22,2025-01-27,"If you are a player who does end up collecting the medicine bottles, I suggest upgrading stamina over health. Stamina gets depleted quickly if you have to fight more than one enemy and its slow to come back especially if you are actively blocking. Upgrading stamina and increasing damage made the fight clubs and Nazi heavy areas way easier. And take pictures of everything! "
1i7mvq0,2025-01-22,2025-01-23,"Yes, at just about any point"
1i7mvq0,2025-01-22,2025-01-23,Yes.
1i7mvq0,2025-01-22,2025-01-22,Is there a release date for PS5 yet. I've only heard spring 2025.
1i7mvq0,2025-01-22,2025-01-22,"Same here, I can't wait! It looks fantastic. Day 1 purchase for me!"
1i7mvq0,2025-01-22,2025-01-23,I got overly excited in Egypt because I thought it was going to be like the newer tomb raider games with side puzzle tombs but still great game...I know they won't but tomb DLC would be fantastic.
1i7mvq0,2025-01-22,2025-01-23,It wouldn't sound like him if he did them...this is the best we could of hoped for
1i7mvq0,2025-01-22,2025-02-25,Don't know. I played it on Game Pass.
1i7mvq0,2025-01-22,2025-01-27,Yeah I did both hp and stamina and yeah I took pics Everytime the game suggested
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-20,"It’s very fun but whoever the UI designer was did one of the worst jobs i have ever experienced. The inventory controls are awful, the map/journal is awful, the note system you have to reference often is awful"
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-10,"Im not that far but so far, the puzzles, stealth, and combat are all so stupid easy that I'm not sure it will hold my attention despite the incredible production values. 

This one may be one to watch the cut scenes on YouTube, unfortunately"
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-25,"I'm glad this game was on Game Pass, because I can't imagine sinking any amount of money into it. It's a tedious bore. Uninstalled after a couple of hours (all of which I spent HOPING it would turn a corner... It didn't) because it just felt like such an absolute waste of time. I cannot understand how this game is getting such high praise."
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-20,"Played one hour, uninstalled and asked for a refund. I'd rather watch the first three movies, play old Indiana pc games or stare at my Indy action figure for an hour than play this game. Boring gameplay. Shame, could have been something."
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-09,"I love this game so far. The puzzles are a bit easy and the combat could be better but the atmospheric, graphics, voice acting are all S tier"
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-29,the game is boring AF
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-29,"I unfortunately find it to be a very boring game, and I do think it is very overhyped. An Indiana Jones game should have much more action than this in my opinion. The whole game is essentially walking around, exploring, and picking up collectibles with some light combat mixed in. 

People love to give The Last of Us games shit these days, but those games are exactly how companies should approach a narrative driven action game. Either that or the Uncharted games which also do things flawlessly. It’s really important to have the narrative and exploration element, but you need to have at least half of a game be action packed in order to hold the players attention. Overall, it’s a decent game, but I think it could be so much better."
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-19,"My two cents:

graphically, the game looks good. I don't get why all the ray-tracing requirement, but other than that it's mostly fine.  
Animations could be better. Indiana feels sluggish and slow when climbing around, but I don't mind that much as he's just a normal dude. But NPCs are mostly moving like robots, and it everything animation-wise feels a bit dated.

  
Enemy AI is atrocious, really. Just terrible. I thought Cyberpunk was bad, and it is really bad, but I think this game takes the cake in that regard. Enemies have no peripheral vision. You could be standing few feet away from them, and they just stare at you like idiots. They don't register noise, gun shots, and they can't react to you swinging around in plain sight. Not to mention soldiers finding their unconscious buddies lying around, and just ignoring them completely. I don't get that design at this day and age. I guess developers mostly focus on the graphical side of thing, and just ignore most other stuff.

  
Speaking of which, gameplay is not satisfying at all. Stealth is that same basic stealth from 30 years ago, Gunplay isn't even worth mentioning. Fistfights and whip all sound right, but they have no oomph to them. Platforming sections are way too easy, and from a gameplay standpoint I can't really find anything worth the hype I've been hearing about the game.  
Puzzles are also way too easy, but that's neither here nor there. Different strokes for different folks. Someone may find them refreshingly relaxing compared to some tougher games.

  
The story so far is alright, I guess. Side missions aren't very deep. Voice acting is pretty good, though Indiana Jones don't really sound right to me. I've been going through the films recently, and this guy's just off. Doesn't sound like Indy at all.

  
All in all, I guess the game is a decent play if you like Indiana Jones, and possibly don't have anything better to do regarding your your backlog. It's not a terrible play, but it's nothing special, at least so far. Maybe it'll pick up the pace later on, though I don't see how can they support a 20 hour long game with a gameplay this weak."
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-27,"I made it close to the end, but got bored.  Mainly for all the reasons people stated here.  The game is pretty fun at first, but it gets repetitive after a while.  There is an INCREDIBLE section of the game in Shanghai, so it'd suggest people play to at least that point but I had a hard time continuing on for there.  With so many games on my playlist, I can't put time into games that I'm bored with.  I will probably watch the final cutscenes online."
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-28,[deleted]
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-09,"2 hours in and I'm finding it pretty boring, I am hoping it improves. Combat is terrible, cut scenes go on too long, too many controls just to open a door and overall so far it feels like a poor rendition of Tomb Raider or Uncharted."
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-10,I just got it and I have to say I'm impressed. With the only problem being occasionally crashes everything runs smoothly. Great story too!
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-09,So did the grinch came to xbox and stole all the singleplayer games or what?
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-10,Tbh my favorite Indiana Jones game was Indiana Jones and the fate of Atlantis
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-09,"This seems a game that will be your personal GotY if you're a fan of the franchise and a decent 8/10 if you're not... As a casual Indy enjoyer but not a superfan I've yet to see something to really sell me the game. I will be honest but I'd rather play an uncharted game than this one, still I would not say it's a bad game by any means. An OK one, which is more than I can say of many recent games... "
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-30,"Big Indiana Jones fan. Was expecting Rise of the Tomb Raider with Indiana Jones skin. I wish it had been that. Idk what it is about this game but I found it so irritating, too much button pressing on cue (interactive movie). The crosshair and UI sounds annoyed me with no option to disable. Graphics are fine but not as good as people claim. Ultimately I got bored. "
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2025-01-01,I think I played only 2-3 hours and even when it looks very polished and no bugs I found it boring and uninstalled the game. Maybe it is the 1st person for me. I dunno. But I liked Lara Croft more
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2025-01-15,After playing this for 5 mins I just want to play the Infernal Machine. Even with its simple graphics a far superior game. They just don't know how to make video games any more.
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2025-02-17,Alguien sabe para que sirve el escudo de cruzado que está en las catacumbas cerca de la excavadora hundida ? 
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-09,"The narrative has been decent so far (I am not super far in yet) but I have been a bit disappointed in the puzzles... hoping for more in the future though, still early times.

ETA: when I booted in on PC it told me I needed a controller. I went out to my older gen X-Box and snagged one, dug around in a drawer for a cable that and work and put new batteries in. Not sure that I like playing with a controller... just in general I suck with them. That might end up as a deal breaker for me. There is a reason I game on the PC. We'll see how it goes."
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-09,"It’s pretty good so far. The opening mission being a retelling of the first movie is pretty cool, it’s good fan service and the game is a fair challenge not too hard and not too easy."
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-09,"I've only played the first little bit and I like it so far.   My only complaint is needing to do two button actions to do things (x and up to open a door) seems clunky.

Looking forward to enjoying the rest of this game over the holidays."
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-09,"Game looks good, my only reservation is that its 1st person only"
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-21,"Agreed. The fact that you have to push a button and the left-stick to open a locked door is awful. I don't know why. Seems like they just want to be different when there are ways that works well in previous game. Or I have to hold whatever item I picked up in my hands all the time. 

But so far (and I have progressed much more into the campaign), the story, the cutscenes, and set pieces are awesome .. and even some of the dialogue sounds very indie like."
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-26,"When you see their face and hair colors or social medias, you’ll understand. "
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-20,"I got super into it for the first section (Vatican) and spent 10 hours there doing everything, but once I got to the next section I got a bit bored, because you're essentially doing the same thing all over again just in a different area. Stealth, puzzles, and exploration all get old.

I love Indiana Jones and I love the vibes of this game, but unfortunately there's just no challenge (even after turning up the difficulty, since that doesn't change the core structure or mechanics). I might have gone too ham on the first zone so maybe I just need to let it sit for a little while then jump back in. If anything it's really not about the challenge, it's more of an exploration sim."
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-22,"Feels like I’m playing a movie, it’s great, I just wish there was more combat lol. Can be a bit boring with cutscene after cutscene before it even gets going for me at least"
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-10,Then change the difficulty???
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2025-01-23,I just started playing on game pass on geforce now as I have ps5 and I was excited I got to play it. Good 5 hours first level not even finished the first level and I wondered hang on this is actually boring lol. So yeah 100% agree what's with the 9/10 ratings everywhere. Very odd.
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-20,"Eh, I'm not sure this game had the potential you're speaking about. You know what this is? It's a 50 year old car with a fresh coat of paint on it. 

Today I went back to play the boxing side quest, and there were a bunch of guys that were just standing there and cheering when the event was already done. No one was fighting, but they remained in the cheering mode.   
Other times, enemies literally walked over their friends' unconscious bodies, and didn't even notice. There is no attention to detail that's expected from a game that came out in late 2024. It's actually quite embarrassing to be honest, and severely immersion breaking.

Yeah, Indy himself graphically looks awesome in game, but he's now uncharacteristically toothless and soft for some reason. He wasn't like that in the films at all. Just the contrary. He was irresistible to women, but he could also be a sexist, misogynistic jerk, and it was a part of his charm. Now he lets people talk over him, belittle him, and save him on every step. He doesn't feel like a main protagonist in his own game.   
This Gina character is superior to him in every way except archeology, but we have Gina's sister as a superstar in that field. I'm not even sure what I'm playing anymore. The characterization here kind of sucks swollen donkey balls. 

I mentioned in my other comment that AI is terrible in this game, and it is. It completely killed any sort of immersion for me, but what they did to my boy Indy is the equivalent of unnecessarily firing a couple of more rounds into a dead man's head to make sure he's indeed super mega dead. 

  
I gave this game a fair shake, but it's just not interesting enough to care. It's like MachineGames took their 2014. Wolfenstein game, and reskinned it to look like Indiana Jones. It feels sometimes game design is heading backwards with titles like this."
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-31,"I've literally fallen asleep twice playing it.  Perhaps being sunk into the Barcalounger in a carb stupor both times contributed, but playing this game is like watching paint dry."
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-30,"I've been playing it too because all the hype. My wife was watching me and about Half way through, she got up and says ""ugh, I'm going to smoke, this movie is putting me to sleep!"" 😳😂 She legit thought we were watching a movie. But I agree with her, it is kind of boring. I usually play FPS games and the campaign that comes with them and hero shooters so I'm under to fast paced, high action, in your face games. This just seems like it was made for beginner gamers who are new to gaming all together. I don't think my heart beat was even tempted to beat slightly faster during the whole first playthrough."
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-26,"Yeah you can tell it’s a game made with the modern audience in mind just like the pink hair dude who directed it said, so it’s not meant to be fun to play it’s more social conditioning that’s also why these games always have way too many cutscenes and by people who clearly aren’t vision inspired artists or have any original ideas.  

This is like your moms idea of what an Indiana Jones game would be, and the one thing she did right was copy the look and sounds but can’t get the soul because she doesn’t actually resonate with action Adventure or this character. "
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-30,"That level is just dumb period. That's where I turned it off doing my first playthrough. I still have no clue what I'm supposed to be taking pictures of 😂. I get to the location marked on the map, look around for clues or anything at all, take a trillion picture of nuns, words and cats but only the pictures of the cats gives me any type of indication. The game is very boring."
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-10,I agree that it’s pretty boring. Played for about 4 hours and I’m done. Feels like Dishonoured without the fun powers. And why the hell do I have to press X then wait a second for another thumb stick prompt to open a door. As a huge Indiana Jones fan this was a big letdown for me.
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2025-01-28,were you just as impressed nearing the end game too? This is a game that started off fantastic but got real boring real soon to be
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-10,I’m a huge Indy fan but I would give it a 6/10. Played for about 4 hours and was honestly bored. The new Tomb Raiders and the Uncharteds gave me much more Indy vibes than this game.
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-10,"As a huge fan of the franchise that’s still in the middle of the first “open zone” section, I feel like a 7 is generous. 

Solid game pass game and I’ll get my months worse but yeah does not hold a candle (so far) to uncharted imo."
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-20,tell me you're a bot without telling me you're a bot
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-10,Eh? I didn’t get that message but have been doing just fine on keyboard and mouse.
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2025-01-03,Idk what any adult would find challenging about this game. It's definitely too easy.
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-09,"I think it works to its benefit. I can remember playing one of the Indiana Jones games on Xbox and it was third person, it felt clunky and annoying at times. This one plays pretty well and I like it, it’s also pretty cool it goes into third person when he swings or climbs his whip which is good enough for me."
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-09,"Supririsngly it has worked for me so far (even though I tend to not like first person as much). It pops in and out to third person when you are climbing or into cut scenes, etc. It does seem to work. 

I will admit that playing it just really, really makes me want a good VR port for this... would be amazing."
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-09,"While most of the game is in 1st, there are places (like climbing a wall) that it jumps to 3rd person, and there are many cutscenes.

So you do get to see Indy quite a bit. So far, I am happy with the compromise between 1st & 3rd person."
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-09,Yeah thats rough.
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-30,Wtf does that have to do with UI design? 
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-20,"Yeah i quit. 

I hate to say it, but it's just....boring. 

It's not really a ""game"" as much as an interactive adventure - which is totally fine, but just not something I personally enjoy. 

I think mainlining the main missions is the way to go."
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-29,"That's how I felt about it too. I loved playing the Vatican level, but after finishing that I got extremely bored in the next one"
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-10,It's  already all maxed????????????????????????.?.????????
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-10,It helps a little on damage and what not but the AI is still very poor.
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-22,"Dude, the Wolfenstein thing is spot-on. I was intrigued by this game because I played Wolfenstein for the first time earlier in the year and enjoyed it. I assumed MachineGames would improve on that game in every way since they had a major opportunity to work on this IP, but I started playing today and felt a slow-burning feeling of disappointment as I realized it just felt like Wolfenstein again. 


I wanted a fun adventure, not a fucking stealth game where you eat food to regain stamina. I don't recall Indy constantly crouching to avoid enemies and eating biscotti in the movies. Those who say this is accurate to the films are being disengenious or just plain incorrect.


It's like they wanted to avoid the Uncharted comparison so badly that they ended pivoting in the completely wrong direction and made the poor decision to make it a first person stealth game."
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-26,"Yeah, there is a good reason that Uncharted and Tomb Raider games are as entertaining as they are. Third person is the perfect camera angle for adventuring. 
They went with immersive sim game here, and it just doesn't do it for me, on top of everything else that's wrong. "
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-30,"Great point! It feels like it was made for beginner gamers. Someone who's never picked up a controller or someone who hasn't picked one up since they played ColecoVision in their mom's basement in the 80's. Almost as if they were going for more of an interactive movie puzzle game for children or the elderly. It definitely doesn't feel like it was made for the day paced whipper snappers that you find playing Fortnite, COD or other games meant to increase your heart rate."
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-20,Dishonoured that’s it!!! Thank you. I’ve played 2 hrs and called it a day. I feel less bad stopping with this comparison.
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-26,"Come on with such classic lines as “there’s nothing easier to manipulate than an insecure man”, how could you not love this game?"
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-10,People comparing this to uncharted are out of their mind. Uncharted is an action game with puzzles. This is not an action game.
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-20,Are you trolling my dude? And to think that I tried to write long enough not to sound AI generated... Lmao. 
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-10,Really? I will have to try it
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-10,"Ever since getting a PSVR2 in the recent sale, First-person POV games just don't hit the same and I can't help but wish more of these games would get VR versions.   
I've tasted that sweet, sweet immersion and there's no going back for me..."
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2025-02-02,"That’s a shame. At the very start of the game I set the difficulty to the higher setting and I’m so glad I did. The story is interesting enough for me but as someone who has a hard time sticking with games, i know that if I played on default difficulty it would have been too easy. This has forced me to be more intentional and methodical (especially since the stealth system isn’t very strong) before doing things that can aggro more than 2 combatants. It’s a valid criticism but I’m still super happy with this game, it totally surprised me"
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-23,"Even stealth is all wrong because if the lackluster AI. 
I can't take it seriously because enemies are all but blind and deaf, not to mention stupid. "
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-10,"So far the puzzles have been equally trivial, there’s just more of them. 

Overall the reason I say I prefer Uncharted is I really wish this was more linear, maybe I just need to drop all the side stuff but I’ve spent some time doing extremely  basic stealth/melee, but most of the time running/platforming to “insert objective here”, and movement in this game isn’t all that enjoyable."
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-10,"I get that it would take a lot to change up the whole control scheme... buy yeah, it would be cool."
1ham5vu,2024-12-09,2024-12-20,"Exactly, Uncharted felt more like Indiana Jones than great circle. The constant backtracking with subpar payoff in the great circle is so mind numbingly boring. It is a beautiful game and you can tell most of the team made this a labor of love but it just isn’t the complete success I was hoping for.  🤝"

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Good. I want more too. As long as it's more of the same quality and not more with a load of corners cut to get it out faster.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"So do I. Troy Baker's Indy is probably the most Harrison Ford accurate take I've ever heard. The only time I really knew it wasn't him was when he spoke a foreign language. To be fair if he had pulled off Harrison Ford speaking another language while still maintaining the voice I'd give him an Oscar. That stuff isn't easy. 

Game was fantastic too."

Get too greedy and the next Indiana Jones game might be rushed or turn out worse than the first game"
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"This is vastly preferable over sticking an 80-something Harrison Ford in yet another Indy film. Don't get me wrong, we absolutely LOVE Harrison. His legacy as Han Solo and Indiana Jones is untouchable. In fact, Disney's attempt to recast Han Solo was a tremendous failure. Harrison is iconic. 

However, our love of Indiana Jones stems from the 80's trilogy. He had energy, youth and charisma. When he punched Nazi's, or was dragged from the back of a truck, it impacted us because that was actually him. Or, if it was a stuntman, there was enough suspension of belief to make us think that Indiana Jones could actually be doing this! An elderly man having to be propped up by CGI and younger sidekicks just does not have the same impact on audiences. It's why James Bond gets recast every few years with a younger actor. 

Video games give us that legendary character we love, with the image of Harrison Ford, for all-new adventures. This is how Indy should continue."

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I was super skeptical about this game after having seen the trailers. On paper, an FPS Uncharted-like adventure game seems like it wouldn’t work. But once I fired it up, I was absolutely hooked and amazed how fun it was. I couldn’t put it down for a week. The movies (raiders, temple of doom, last crusade) meant so much to me as a kid. This game really did them justice. Should be the new blueprint for how studios should handle franchise licenses. 9/10"

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I absolutely loved Troy's Indiana, about as authentic as possible.

I also loved Voss as a villain, the voice actor was having tons of fun and it showed."

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Honestly, doesn't even *have* to be Indiana Jones for me, even if I do love him.


I just want more well-written adventure games with this type of setting, a good mix of action and puzzle solving, and a healthy dose of cheesiness.


I feel like most of the few adventure games we get are either walking simulators with zero action, or you're mowing down so many enemies you might as well be playing an FPS... and they often take things way too seriously.


Just imagine what amazing things we could get if Universal found a good dev and had them start making Universal Monster games; The Mummy, Dracula, Frankenstein, Jekyll and Hyde, Creature from the Black Lagoon, etc... games which mix action, horror, stealth, and puzzle solving with awe-inspiring locales, cheesy dialogue, and a heaping of humor."

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Oh fuck off Disney. Just let the people who actually made this continue to make it. We don’t need your thoughts into it just because the people behind it actually gave the consumers what they wanted. Fuck Disney
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"I am a huge Indiana Jones fan and I absolutely loved this game, but what made it great were the geniuses and hardworking people at MachineGames and not the Indiana Jones IP.  
  
Write this down, Disney gonna start developing dozens of Indiana Jones games and wonder why they're not as successful as the Great Circle (or any sequels developed by MachineGames)."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,I'm down for a new trilogy. It was miles better than the last two movies.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"""Wait. You mean a game that's not an online only service caked with microtransactions and shitty season passes can make money if it's actually good and not dogshit? Wow! Maybe we should try that more!""

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,I paid 119 AUD and not waiting for sale. No regrets so that’s as good as it gets for them.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"The writing was as sharp and fun as in the movie trilogy. Very respectul to the original material, a true Indiana Jones to the core. It made everyone happy. We need more quality games like that to move on from the culture war bullshit."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,And thus the milking began and we never had a good Indiana jones game ever again after that. The end.

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,the game looks really good

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"Indiana Jones makes a great video game protagonist, he has a pre-established character and does plenty of punching and shooting but he also collects relics and journal pages and takes photos, all of which is perfect for a history-based open-world video game with plenty of combat. Like the Assassin's Creed games, but better, because it's Indiana Jones.

None of this will make for a good modern movie as long as the fossils are in charge. *They* belong in a museum."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,It's amazing what a good story made by writers that love the IP and are left alone can do.

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,I'd probably agree with them if the game wasn't so terribly optimized that I can't even play it with a 3070
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,All this game needs is the ability to lean without having to aim down sites first. I dunno why it bothers me so much lol. Still 10/10
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"Ok then give us a Han Solo game using the same style

Would actually be AMAZING!"
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,The game is good and I'll be happy to play a sequel. I'd say it's a win-win if they stick to Machine Head Studios.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,Fuck Disney. Their dreadful corporate blandness ruins everything.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,Good. Great fucking game.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,For a second the image looked like a pizza slice lol
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,Just don't fucking pump them out too fast with shit scripts and let the devs do their thing for as long as they need. Tired of large companies wanting more cash in less time with less man power and then they shrug when it fails and drop the devs.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"Just like the golden age of licensed Disney games... Shit don't change. Well, except that I guess most things are Disney now even if they aren't.... Is Reddit Disney yet?"

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,They are gonna rush it

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,I got no problem with this so long as the quality is as good going forward. My real fear is that Disney's need for profit will force the dev team to push out sequels before they're ready.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,OK that's nice a good but can we first get another decent Wolfenstein game from MachineGames?
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,is it a fun game?
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"I genuinely don’t understand how.

I’m not saying the game is bad, I just heard NOTHING ABOUT IT until I got it for free because I upgraded my GPU."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"Am I the only one who liked this game, but couldn't stand Gina?

Worst sidekick I've found in a while. It's all the unnecessary dialogue from her. You want to explore the area peacefully, don't think so, Gina's going to be over here repeating the same thing like a broken record."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,Remake Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis.  That game was fucking amazing.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,So Disney are finally realizing that there's actually money to be made in the games industry as long as you don't make a soulless cash grab live service scam? Who would have thought?
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,~~Imagine Disney greenlighting Lego Indy 3~~
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"Does it get better? I just got to the Vatican part and its been boring so far, and the controls feel a bit convoluted. 

Indy moves kinda janky too. Luckily I got it on Gamepass. Sucks for you if you paid $70."

Innovate, succeed, publisher demands repetition, publisher expects increased returns…"
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"But thats not how creative process works. If because of money you force them to do a sequel, it might be just worse. They poured all their ideas and creativity in this one project, a lot of devs then move on. For those that remain, if they still got good ideas they couldn't fit then thats fine go for a sequel, but please don't force people into a creative burden to live up to a previous success just for money. Some good things are left untouched and should be moved on after release."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I'm reminded of the running gag throughout Deadpool and Wolverine.  ""Disney owns you.  You'll be playing this role until you're 100 years old."""

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,It was good will it lasted
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"It's a strange game and I think reviews have been far kinder than the sum total warrants. Is it good looking? Yes - but so are Dishonored 2 and Uncharted 4 from a few years ago and those games are sticking in my head a lot more.

This is a game for opposite kinds of players. People who want to stealth and collect and people who want to run without fear on Light mode until the next automatic save point. Neither makes a satisfying outcome.

It's a game that shoehorns in so many safes to crack and puzzles. Now I understand why Naughty Dog tended to keep puzzles to a minimum in most Uncharted games. Puzzles are awful for replayability and they feel like excuses for breaking up action. The game just doesn't allow you to enjoy action. It's like if Dishonored had less interesting level design and removed all of the benefits of sneaking around up high.

The boss battles in this game are tedious cases of slugging around doing the same thing.

This is a game that knows what Indiana Jones is but doesn't care about brevity or about allowing you to actually stand a chance against any enemies unless you cower around like, ironically, a snake.

The comradeship of UC4 is missing because often Gina leaves you completely on your own.

The pacing and level design doesn't add up to a coherent whole. It's just a patchwork. Touchstones of some parts of the first 3 movies.

More than anything, it reminds me of Rage. The unforgiving arenas of corridors in which you are always the slave, never the master. You are not left with any sense of progression and lightness. It's just a bruising slog. Particularly in the Himalayas or the needlessly long and Remedy-ish return to a previous environment.. This should not feel like a survival horror game but it does. It also has a needlessly dark storyline, even by the series' standards.

It leaves a dark and bitter taste in my mouth. I don't see where they can go from here unless they make the sequel more like Dishonored."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Now do Han solo

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Honestly I am not surprised. I heard the new Indiana Jones movie didn't do much for Disney. But it seems people are interested in Indiana Jones games so it's a good way for the brand to stay alive and keep going. Which is fine by me.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Yeah I didn't understand, normally the only way a major AAA game makes it to Gamepass on day one is if it's crappy or unfinished.  This is like an $80 game.  That's actually good."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Gimme a series of Young Indy games like the ones we had in the 90's. I really loved them.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Brave of them
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,One day I will have a graphics card that lets me play this.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Han Solo Adventures?
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,So it took indiana jones to make immersive sims financially viable?
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Next one confirmed to be shit
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,I hope we get more licensed games if that quality. I watched Moana 2 recently and I think that movie begs to be turned into a game
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Always kinda wondered where Indy would end up post-Harrison Ford, with the obvious answer being recasted&rebooted. While I’m sure that will still happen, it’d be pretty cool if he went on to become more of a video game character for a while, especially if the games continue to be quality.

Funnily enough, almost a reverse of stuff like Tomb Raider and Uncharted, whereas both of those franchises are trying to make movies after having been games, Indy starts making games after having had movies"
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Wishful thinking but I hope the lesson that they take away from this is towards more adaptations made with passion and respect for the source material.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Next game....terrible!
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Great news but personally I’d like these devs to tackle their own IP. I believe it was machine games who mainly developed Indiana. They did great with wolfenstien but I wanna see what they can do with a brand new IP.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,I am out of the loop. If I love the uncharted games does this game resemble those to where I’d like it?
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Loved it, hope to see more but preferably related to other Disney IPs like Star Wars as I want to see Obsidian take another shot at the IP."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Okay, just don't demand an equivalent product delivered under-budget on an accelerated timeline. And we should have another hit in 3-5 years."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Happy for Machine Games but RIP Wolfenstein
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Keep making them really good just like that and I'm sold
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"it was on game pass, i wonder how much that affected player numbers. i definitely wouldn't have paid for it, but i gave it a whirl because it was 'free'"
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I'm playing it right now. It's actually pretty good. Gorgeous environments, kinda janky animations at times but still really fun. Would recommend."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Yesss!  I haven’t gotten far but I’m happily taking my sweet ass time with this one
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Good.

Indiana Jones was my game of the year. The devs and cast did excellent work"
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"As long as they let the devs do what they did with the first game. I don’t want to see none of this over monetizing shit. 

What I love about the game is that it’s an all inclusive single player experience in one nice package. If they start adding extra bullshit DLC or tiers im out, 100%. This is what publishing corporate execs don’t understand"
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,enough indiana jones spam
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"The game is a lot of fun and very well made. 

I do not crave a sequel."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I have always believed that immersive sims are the best games, and the only reason they're not dominating AAA is that no immersive sim has ever gotten enough mass market appeal for everyone to realise how amazing they are. 

If it takes Indiana Jones to make people wake up to it, then I'm all for that."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,I want to play it. If all it is is a Tomb Raider reskin I'm game. I'm just not paying $70 for for more than one or two games a year if any.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Hopefully more from Machine Games. They did a great job and I’d love to see more. The original story was great although I wouldn’t mind a gameified remake of the first trilogy with some expanded sections.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Crazy, it seems that when you respect the source material and focus on making the game fun and interesting to play, people buy it. Go figure."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Well ya, that’s usually how things work."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Indy is the best. Full stop.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"While I haven't played it myself, I've only heard good things. It's great that the franchise lives on decades after."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"As a player, I want more as well."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,They won’t let Harrison die
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,I wouldn’t mind a Fate of Atlantis remaster since we’re on the topic.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Not normally a good sign
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Id rather the franchise just continue this way. The great circle is amazing
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Make good games = More profit!
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Ive only seen streamers play but it was really fun to watch. The antagonist is an amazing character, its quirky but that makes it so good"
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"You can play through that game for 10 minutes and need a whole new trilogy. Shit was pretty mind blowing with how well it presented all the OG material.

Just that first scene makes you feel like you're in a goddamn Spielberg movie."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,Money…
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"Awesome. I want more too, been loving it!"
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"This game will be eligible for 2025 game of the year, right?"
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,DLC incoming in 3...  2...
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,PS5 Port Pls
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"""picked up the phone and wants more money"""
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,I’ve been really enjoying this game-it’s so fun—like playing through a movie!
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,The money beast awakens.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,I'm not even done yet and I want more. It feels more like a movie than the last 2 movies did
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,I found it boring with a small nostalgic twinge of tedium. I'd rather watch a movie I wasn't obligated to pause when I walked away for something. It was not meant for me.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"Wouldn't know, I don't have an XBox and my GPU doesn't have the technology needed to run it"
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"Hopefully this leads to not only more (quality) games, but books and comics as well!"
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,So long as Disney are not involved. Their revolving door of incompetence is why we don’t already have a catalogue of modern LucasArts games as it is.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,Now give me Jedi knight 4...
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,Recommend a game similar to the series Twilight of the Gods by Zack Snyder.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,Put it out on PS5. That seems a good place as any to start.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,Next thing they’ll be wanting to make movies out of Indiana Jones.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"“Lucasfilm Games”? What the fuck happened to LucasArts, does Disney not own that?"
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,I just hope it's better the next time around. The game is interesting but the entire combat/evasion system is like an afterthought. Im playing on the hardest difficulty and I can just spam left click punch everyone to death.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,Get ready for Charlie Brown and the Great Pumpkin
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,I really hope we get to see Indy's wartime activities.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"If they can deliver another story that feels authentic then they should. 

If Disney was smart they’d do an animated series in addition to greenlighting a sequel, much less expensive and a faster turnaround."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"I haven’t played it, but if the format is successful why not make more? Also The Mummy franchise could use a video game adaptation."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"Disney: OK hear me out....Aliens.....eh?  


\-\_-"
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,Pls no microtransactions
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,Gotta make some profit off the IP since the movies just make losses
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,Good game but maybe next time they should try optimizing it better
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,I would absolutely love to hear my favs in game.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"Well gents, this game was pretty okay. Let's now get ready for shitty rushed sequels..."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,Hell yea.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,I picture an old timey Hollywood exec with a cigar and bourbon just calling saying “more Indiana jones games”
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"Honestly, i just wish it was all either 3rd person or 1st person and the gun wielding mechanics were a little more polished. The going back and forth of camera vantage points depending on character action was kinda annoying. Otherwise, i thought the story was fun and would have made a good indy movie or series."

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"Movie tickets average around $10.78 USD, lowest cost of entry to this game is $11.99 USD if you have the right t play it $20 if you don't. And you don't have to pay Harrison Ford bucks. You'll get millions in sales at a $70-30 USD price range on other consoles and emerging markets without gamepass. Microsoft will pay for the licensing increase. Its a no brainer."

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,Can't wait for them to ruin another great series.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,I want a Star Wars game in this style.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,Woop!
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"You could also say that Disney had rung their "" Dial of Destiny "" ?



I will see myself out now."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,This is kind of terrifying as well.  Kathleen Kennedy could get involved and she will absolutely ruin it.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"I'm pretty excited to play this. I've seen clips of Troy Baker's voice lines and it's just insane how much he sounds like young Indy.

It's not even like he's doing an impersonation of the movie lines, it sounds like a second take that didn't make it to film."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,It’s 2024. Send an email.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,I’m talking the success and popularity the uncharted series was as a whole( adventure game searching for missing treasures while outsmarting and dispatching enemies is kinda like Indy) so Disney would be fools to not want to make more of the Indy.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"My point exactly. It’s all adventure games finding treasure ,fighting bad guys ,getting the glory etc.that was a hugely successful, popular game made $. So Disney would be stupid to not want to make more of the Indy games to tap into an already established fan base that likes those type of games."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,YES PLEASE.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"The game was fun as hell, some of the controls were pretty bad but once you got use to them it was okay. I found myself rarely using a gun and tried to stick to using stealth. I'd be totally okay with a sequel of the same quality"
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"This game was so successful, given the failures of the series in the 21st century Indiana Jones might just ditch the screen for the... screen set to HDMI 1."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,My only complaint was the sneaking was pretty unrealistic but it would be impossible otherwise
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,As good as the game is I am sad that we probably aren’t getting Wolfenstein 3 any time soon.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,It's such a good game!!!! I'm hooked!
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,Disney hasn’t tasted success in years so it makes sense that they’re super excited over this
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,Ah fuck! Disney.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"What I loved about this game is it felt like a video game from the mid 2000's just prettier, no micro transactions no multiplayer, just a well flushed out game without an unnecessarily huge map"
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"It’s fucking great. Like honestly, it felt like a sleeper hit, but it’s fucking Indiana jones. This is going to blow up into a huge trilogy at least."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"Wow, if only activision picked up on stuff like this and actually produced quality content nowadays… (looking at cod specifically)"
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,Quality work gives you money. *takes notes
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"Quick, someone call EA, there's still plenty of time to fuck it up!"
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"This is the first great Indiana Jones experience perhaps since Fate of Atlantis. So, they basically revitalized the IP."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,I don’t think he did
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"Guys I need help!! I can buy a rmaed zotac zbox with rtx 3060 12 gb + i5 10400 barebore ( no ram,storage or os) with 2+ years of warranty left for 398 dollors should I go for it?

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"As much as i would want another game with the same quality i'm more prone to say ""FRAKK OFF, DISNEY!""

At this point in time i wouldn't trust the House of the Mouse even if they were just producing toilet paper.   
As a consumer Disney, much like Lego, is burned for me."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"I've not played the game, but I've heard it described as half game, half movie.

Is that something people want more of, or are just enjoying the novelty of this one game with great IP?"
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"I'm happy that MachineGames tried something new after all the Wolfenstein games, and it worked out perfectly. I hope for more Indiana Jones games from them, but I would also be happy to see them try something new in the future, like a new IP."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"""I've got a bad feeling about this."""
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"Maybe what the actually said was, “can we have more patches to fix the Frame Gen and HDR” performance issues on PC?”…"

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"Oh dear. I hope machine games dosnt get locked into Indiana Jones. 

If anyone else does it they have a high standard to match. I still wouldn't mind seeing one in 3rd person with abit of tighter adventure."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,I have yet to play it but I’ve heard nothing but good things. I appreciate that the game wasn’t super hyped coming out but has won people over through gameplay and story.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,Hopefully with better gameplay and enemy AI…
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,👌
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"Hey Ubisoft, look. If you made an above average game the fans actually like then Disney will give you more money!"
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"I love everything about this game. They genuinely nailed the feel of the original trilogy in every way, from the story to the action, and most importantly the loveable side characters (which Crystal Skull and Dial of Destiny did not). Even the villains are cool and quirky yet unhinged, old school in the best way. I haven’t finished the game yet (on the final chapter now) and admittedly the game play gets a little bit old towards the end (yet another area to sneak through and henchmen to take down) but the story and beautiful environments make up for it. And some of the cut scenes are just amazing, in an unhinged-suspend-your-disbelief kind of way which feel incredibly cinematic, like few movies these days do."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,tell them to make another riddick game
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"Just wait, I'm getting that shit the moment it comes out on PS5."

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,Disney must be thrilled to finally make money from a release after so many net negative projects lately.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,I played  a little  of it. Really  didn't  play  enough  of it to form an opinion.  Might go back  to  it later. Right now  I'm  playing  Pathfinder:Wrath of the Righteous.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"That's good, besides the optimization it is an amazing, amazing game."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,I've been enjoying this a lot!
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,And that is what I am worried about. They saw the cash cow and what will happen now? Plenty of bad to mid games shat out just to milk an IP? It IS Disney after all.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,Still waiting for PS5 version.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,This is how a decent game becomes a mediocre series.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,The order is  for Indiana Jones and The Amazing Penagon all the way though Indiana Jones and The Fantastical Dodecahedron.

they’ll surely hang up again."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"Hopefully disney learned their lesson after what happened with the movies so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt, but they better not blow this.

They'll get my money eventually. 🤷‍♂️"

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-30,"Even more than another Indy game, I would love so much to get a Han Solo game"
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-30,I wldve bought this day one if it wasnt $120!!
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-30,"Surprise surprise, look what happens when you basically make a decent Indiana Jones movie set in the 1930s and he isn't 60+ years old."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-30,Are the enemies in the game still dumber than bricks?
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-30,Disney out to ruin more established franchises 🏃🏻‍♀️

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-30,It was fine. Got really old of the combat about half way through the game. The game was at its best when it was goofy and campy
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-30,Where’s the John Drake Tracker when we really need it? Send that man a Diet Coke.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-30,I’m all for it as long as they keep up the quality. It is an excellent game.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-31,"I legit don’t understand the unanimous critical and public praise. I had to force myself to finish it in the hopes that I’d finally understand. It’s got very high highs but too many lows. Outside of brilliant cutscenes, the open zone gameplay was so inconsistent. The stealth genre is one of my favorites, so my biggest complaint is how heavily it relies on a stealth system that, between daft AI and terrible combat encounters simply doesn’t work. If it were primarily linear sequences followed by treasure hunts, it’d worked better for me. It’s also being praised for its visuals, but on XSX the lighting issues and pop-in frequently break immersion.

Help me understand!"
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2025-01-01,Well if you make a good game this is what happens.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2025-01-21,"I am perfectly fine with that. I’d like to see a story set during the war. We know Indy was OSS and saw a bit of the action in the prologue to Dial of Destiny, but I want a full story set during WW2, preferably with the Japanese as the main villains."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Was it really successful enough though? The reviews are great but it doesn't have many players on Steam. I know it's on gamepass. 

It looks quality and was many years in development. Besides that they had to pay for the license. Which means the game surely cost a lot of money. Feel like this article is a PR piece to get more attention to the game."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I'm glad it's successful, super glad it is. Let's pump the brakes though before they try to squeeze absolutely every dollar then can out of fans.

It's successful because it's the kind of games we want. Single player, unique, and tightly made.

So let's not try to turn this into some yearly release, micro transaction, battle pass, gacha experience. So I hope they give this one time to breath and really look into why its successful, and not push for it to be something it's not to capture some of the other lucrative gaming niches."

Due to budget cuts half the original team was scrapped and  the new hires have never programmed before  (cheaper that way)

The other half was the worst preforming half, they were fine with the paycuts so no need to fire them.

The collectors edition comes with: the soundtrack, a golden whip, 5000 Mayan coins (They couldn't be fucked to google the actual  name) to spend in the mtx shop. If you spend 20 more dollars you'll have enough Mayan coins to unlock ng+ mode and the hardest difficulty."

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"Did the game sell though? Seems like a big chunk of their money from Xbox Game Pass? Without numbers I'm skeptical. Like at the end of the day; in the Xbox model is, Xbox who should pick up the phone. 

In their first week they went second on sales. Which would mean it's an atrocious sales for a game, that at least to me, looks expensive.

Obviously Xbox going to hype up the game they spend millions on; but right now it's just all seem meaningless.

Very fun game though."

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"The trouble is, Todd Howard has a full plate for the next decade. He said that he’d had this idea for Indiana jones for a long time, and that the Microsoft buyout basically allowed this game to be made, but he still has ES6 in full production. After ES6, there is fallout 5 (and likely the tv series getting seasons 2-4 in the meantime), and likely a Starfield 2. 

Even IF they can staff up and get ALL of that working full steam with no delays, can Todd Howard juggle all those projects AND still lead an Indiana jones sequel? Maybe he can trust the existing studio leadership and basically consult? Regardless, I’d imagine Microsoft/xbox executives want to prioritize the flagship IP over one that they have to split royalties with Disney. 

Of course Disney wants more games to be made, they are going to profit hundreds of millions with basically zero cost. But, that’s likely not the best use of resources for Xbox."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Have they not heard of the Uncharted series?

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,This time i think they may say it has to be released on all platforms
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,Wasn't the bar fairly low for them though
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,I want to buy but not until the price drops..a lot.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,How successful? How does this now get judged with Gamepass?
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,can someone plz give me comment karma so i can post ;\_\_;
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"It should, because it’s fucking great. The environmental work is excellent. The focus on cut scenes gives all the characters, main and side, room to breathe. But it also gives room for that trademark Indy humour that’s an absolute hallmark of the series.

The shitty AI is actually a huge positive, because nobody WANTS the facists to be smart. The voice acting and chemistry between Indy and Gina is great, and Troy Baker really has done an incredibly good job. 

MachineGames deserves a sequel and double the staff, straight out of Disney’s pocket. The devs have done a better job and made their dollars go further than Disney’s ideas. If there’s any life left in the IP, it starts here, and Disney has MachineGames to thank for that."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"Hmmm, instead of live-service BS that would die in a year, a well-crafted single player game that built hype in the appropriate way and then delivered on said hype with innovation is successful?

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,If it had released earlier Troy Baker would've likely been nominated for Best Performance at the Game Awards. Which is funny considering the joke Todd Howard made that he's never won it. Could still happen next year though I guess

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"It really should be so easy to find studios and artists that have good track records, hand them an ip in a style that they can work with, and boom “we’ve now made tons of money off of an Indian jones/pirates/national treasure/marvel/Star Wars/Alien/20,000 leagues under the sea/predator/simsons video game” why is it so hard???"
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,I'd imagine part of the draw is that assets have already been made and can be re-used for a sequel.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Agreed. This game filled the hole that spear of destiny left
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I mean, yes Solo underperformed a bit, but I didn’t think the recasting was that bad. I think the “failure” of Solo was more to do with the disdain created by The Last Jedi."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Ironic because Disney's attempt to recast Lando only made Lando BETTER. 

It's not recasting we don't like, it's when they recast and miss the flavor of the O.G.

Folks seem to write off the fact that Indiana Jones, at it's height, had 2 actors. Young Indy, and Old Indy. If we can survive two actors then, we can survive a recast.

I think, out of respect to H.F., that the recast should be after he passes."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Not gonna lie this feel like it was written by chat gpt
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I’d love them to get Ford into the next game somehow, even it’s some sort of bookend sequence

If Ford wants to play Indy til he’s 105 I will say yes please, can I have some more"
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"It's interesting to see him referred to as having youth when Ford was 39 at the time of *Raiders*. He wasn't *old*, but he was also hitting the age where people tend to really start feeling like they're not as young as they used to be.

But yeah, you really noticed it in *Dial*. Lots of car chases, so we got action sequences where all Ford had to do was sit there. It made it very clear that they were working around what he was capable of."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,They should remake Solo in a game of this style except with Harrison Ford’s likeness.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"> This is vastly preferable over sticking an 80-something Harrison Ford in yet another Indy film.

Disney: ""We'll do both!""

Also Solo wasn't bad because of the recast.  Solo was bad because no one asked for a Prequel, and no one needed to show the backstory of Han/Lando.  

If you had just named it ""Random person not related to the Skywalker family"" The story would work absolutely the same."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,I really wish more franchises would go with the James Bond model; it's more jarring to see *one* character replaced in a sequel. Why not use an entirely new cast every time? Imagine if we had 7-8 different Harry Potters

MachineGames did such an excellent job realizing the Indy films, with the combat and exploration."

Just, lots weirder."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Die Hard as an immersive sim sounds perfect. Holy shit.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,I wouldn’t mind a modern game of Die Hard
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"Holy fucking shit why didn't I ever think about a Die-Hard game.  Fight your way up or downwards. 

Or Dredd. 

Make the Rocksteady team of Arkham City do it."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I wasn't playing a game most times, I feel like I was playing an Indy movie that just happens to have a game around it.

But can we all agree the >!jungle section!< was balls"
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"They nailed it in every way. The unhinged cinematic cut scenes, the beautiful environments and the loveable side characters (even the villains were just the right type of evil-fun-crazy). Felt like being in the best kind of mystery-adventure-action movie that Hollywood hasn’t been able to make for the last 15 years."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Hell yeah

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,Probably helped that the story wasn't written by Lucasfilm sadly.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"Asshole writers that have to insert current ideals onto archetypal characters.

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I obviously knew Troy was an excellent voice actor, but the way he nailed Indiana Jones was just uncanny. I’d say more than half the dialogue was basically indistinguishable from Ford himself."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Yes yes yes what a game that was. While watching previews for Great Circle (I haven't played it yet) I kept imagining what Fate of Atlantis would look like with modern-day graphics and controls.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,Replaying it right now. It would make for a fantastic remake (or movie)
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"Only way I see that happening is if it's no longer a point and click adventure game (And then what's the point).  If Tumbleweed Park and Monkey's Island can't be successful Ron Gilbert behind it, I don't see any studio making a point and click adventure any time soon. 

Heck I don't even think Ron Gilbert's inability to write a third act/finale is what held that game back, it's just a dead genre for anything other than an absolute tiny indie (like Wadjet Games)"
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"Why though? It's perfectly playable today. Either you remake it *not* as a point and click, which would kinda ruin its identity, or you *do* remake it as such but with new art - which would remove the low-rez charm of the original artstyle. 

Not to mention, point and click games just don't sell as well as they used to. I just don't see how a remake of Fate of Atlantis could appeal to both fans of the original *and* newcomers alike."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"The PC requirements are odd - it needs a Ray-Tracing compatible GPU because that's the only lighting model they use, but assuming you have that, it runs much better than many UE5 or Unity games of equivalent graphical fidelity."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Licensed games back then were basically advertisements for a movie and developers usually didn't have a big window to make a good game.

Nowadays studios don't market movies with a video game adaptation (when's the last time you seriously saw one?) so if a film IP gets licensed developers have more time to come up with an idea."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"*Gollum* was utter dogshit by all accounts, on the other hand. Caused its publisher's entire development division to be shut down."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"It’s because development costs and standards are at a level where studios can’t shovel out crap into the market like they used to. Hell the entire industry almost crashed in the 80-90s because of how much low quality shit was being put out there 

It’s why you should always assume people who say these are the worst times for gaming are either 12 or full of crap. Nowadays most studios will put out 6/10s at worst when before you’d be lucky to find 6/10s in the sea of garbage."

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Oh man I was watching the mummy 1 recently and I was just thinking Brendon Fraser is literally Nathan drake and I would kill for a mummy game from naughty dog and now from machine games.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I hear you. Ultimately agree. But also - sometimes it DOES help. The development world is... stingy as hell with cash for games, even though good games make more profit then good movies, on average. 

Having the cash up front, after a successful release does not guarantee anything, but it's a hell of a good start compared to how game development normally happens. 

Now to see if corporate tries to interfere, if they are wise they should not anticipate that more money = faster turn around time, and if anything, add 6 months (for creative design reasons) to their timeline as a precursor... but that makes corporate nervous so they are likely to rush the next one (even if it doesn't feel rushed to us)."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,every source i've seen has been praising it up and down
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,People are also saying that Naughty Dogs first new IP since The Last Of Us is going to bomb.  People are stupid.

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"They 100% nailed the tone of the original trilogy in every way. Which is remarkable because even Spielberg couldn’t achieve that in Crystal Skull. Or in the Dial of Destiny, which both felt like bad and even worse copies."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,Good games sell.  Its that simple. The best kind of marketing you can do is make a good game and let the merits of that game travel through word of mouth in the gaming community.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Lightning rarely strikes twice with story driven games, especially when a studio is basically forced to make a sequel."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,You get Vatican as a giant Thief level after that.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"I've played a few hours of it and I wouldn't say it's ""half movie"" at all. It feels very authentic to the movies in terms of atmosphere, but the game itself is essentially an immersion sim, which is very un-movie-like as it's all emergent gameplay."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"Silent Hill 2 didn't massively outdo it in player count, and wasn't on game pass.

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,If Disney picked up the phone it was. Games are hard to judge on profitability because huge money pits that sell several millions can lose money while more humble or even just ones with better money management can profit greatly off of a million sales.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"> Besides that they had to pay for the license.

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"The combat can be clunky at times, but it’s not meant to be a combat oriented game. The puzzle solving is satisfying and less handholdy in a lot of cases than most puzzles in modern games."

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"That's the neat part, they don't have to risk their capital, they just rent the IP and take part of the profits if any. But I think what they value more is that Indiana Jones is being exposed to younger audiences, keeping it alive for future projects."

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"The Final Shape was their best-reviewed expansion, but the previous expansion had done too much damage, so it only sold something like 60% what that one did. Player numbers also fell off only a few weeks after it came out.

Management said the decision to do layoffs was going to happen regardless of how well TFS did. And it's clear a lot of players were simply hanging on to the game long enough for that payoff and were now satisfied and moved on.

Sadly, I can't see Marathon saving them either. Expect to see them shutting down within the next 2 years. Extraction games simply don't have enough mainstream appeal to make the revenue they're going to expect."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"The destiny expansion is such a shame, it gained acclaim and was liked by fans but still sold less than the previous. Bungie has said that this has been the case for every expansion. They missed their profits by I think over 40% for the year? That would kill most companies. If they hadn't been bought by Sony they probably would have had to lay off even more people or potentially have closed down."

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,Troy Baker is one of the most prolific VAs in gaming. I would be extremely surprised if you haven't played several titles with him in them. Guy has crazy range.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,And having the voice and mannerisms of 80’s Harrison Ford adds so much to the atmosphere. In my head I know Troy Baker is doing an impersonation and I’m seeing polygons. But in my heart it’s like a lost performance of Indy himself.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,apparently the casting director was listening to what he thought were harrison ford's lines from the actual movie. when he found out it was actually just troy baker he pretty much hired him on the spot

Sounds like you don't know much about him ? He's probably been a VA in a lot of games you have played. He did the Mocap and voice for Joel in The Last of Us. His range is really great."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,It's a Microsoft studio and they're pretty lax with how they manage their teams. They usually encourage their studios to branch out and work on multiple projects. Here's hoping MachineGames have multiple groups working on different projects.

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Yeah was gonna say, any possible issues the movies had were nothing at all to do with the casting of Solo or Lando. Both were great."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,IMO one of the biggest factors was just the release schedule. They released Solo far too close to TLJ.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Fr I love Solo despite its flaws. But to be fair, most things I love in life I love despite their flaws, because that’s love. 

So anyways I loved Solo. It was an excellent adventure with great characters and the lead did a great job even if he wasn’t the best at replicating the old Harrison behaviors"
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,I think the actor who was recast did as good a job as he could have. But I think the movie just was something that was done more by corporate decree rather than something that had a real audience for it.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,I agree.  I had a lot of fun watching Solo and would've liked the adventure to continue.  The Last Jedi definitely killed the momentum.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,I hear ya. The role of Lando Calrissian is not nearly as physical a role as Indiana Jones. Putting a guy who is in his 80s into that role I think was just irresponsible. Harrison Ford could have permanently injured himself on set.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,New Han's actor didn't even do poorly. The movie was in part a mess as it came out 3 months after THe Last Jedi. I loved that movie and even i was like do we really need another movie this soon? especially when next year was blank for SW>

Also, There is one thing the plot does that really makes me doubt the intelligence of Indy/Gina. We have been told quite clearly that Voss needs all 17 stones for his plan to work... and what do they do? they take stones directly to him, even when traveling half the world between meeting each other.

It literally makes 0 sense to buy a Single Player contained short campaign on Steam for 70 dollars when Game Pass is 12.

Xbox pays a lot of money for game pass games. So it's logical Disney is happy, since they got paid and the game was excellent quality. Let's see how they feel once Microsoft tells them if they would buy a second game or not."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I wasn’t trying to imply the studio was worthless without him, but it’s pretty well documented that this game was his baby and entirely his doing conceptually. That isn’t to take away from their talent as a studio at all, but I’d bet if they’d been approached with this idea without his leadership/guidance/input, the game would have likely been wholly different or never even made to begin with. 

Having said that, could they sort of take the ball and run from here? Probably. But, I’d wager Disney would likely insist on his involvement, and it’s likely he’d already have an idea for a sequel, if only a single page premise. Even if he was just sort of consulting, that’s still a considerable amount of time and energy for someone already working on ES6 that was announced 6(ish) years ago, as well as Fallout 5 that he confirmed to have been working on conceptually, and being pretty deeply involved with the fallout series that they are CRANKING on full blast because of the success of S1. And, we still don’t really know much for the profitability of this game. I’d bet, even 12 months down the line having taken in PS5 sales, an ES6 or fallout 5 would outsell an Indiana Jones 2 many times over. AND! They don’t have to share profits with Disney on those. So, I’d say a sequel would likely be far down the list of importance."

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,It also got a much smaller marketing campaign compared to any other Star Wars movie. The first trailer was released 3 months before the movie's release. All other SW movies (including Rogue One) had a 6-month window between the first trailer and release.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"It really isn't a bad film at all.  I enjoyed it, it was a fun romp and certainly better than the shitshow that was Episode 9."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,I liked Solo a lot more than I expected to as well. Some of the set pieces like the maglev train heist felt so well done and really captured the giddy childhood excitement feeling you associate with Star Wars.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Maybe, but i don’t like criticizing something for “feeling corporate.” Because at the end of the day, everything is corporate, and you could apply your logic to any scenario. Also, things don’t have to have an “audience” to be good or successful. Andor was a show that was even more niche than Solo, and it turned out to be a critically acclaimed masterpiece. (yes Ik Andor didn’t pull crazy numbers or anything, but at least this time we can say for an absolute fact that it wasn’t because of the quality of the show)"
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,I feel like we hear about Harrison Ford injuring himself on set every 5 years anyway.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"> As much as we love the originals, we need to recast those roles

Or... let's try to make new movies about new characters that aren't named ""Skywalker"". 

I love the original 3 movies... I don't need to know about another Skywalker, Solo, or really most rebels.    We have a massive universe with the force and every magical and sci fi thing in the world.  Let's talk about something new?  

Honestly there's ""skywalker"" fatigue as much as Marvel Fatigue, but when they try to do something new and unique (Mandalorean, even Andor) people are interested."

DH4 makes up for all this, so I count it with the original trilogy. Great action, solid pairing for John with Justin Long’s character. Great set pieces."

Let the player fast travel to each signpost from the map instead of using the signpost to do it and a ton of friction is resolved when backtracking and cleaning up. That would fix probably my biggest issue with the game besides not being able to put everything on the map at once, or to at least filter it for a couple at a time."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"The vatican and gizeh location was full of stuff, it was fun running around even with nothing to do

sukhothai was none of that. Travel was atrocious, the jungle felt dead which is ironic, and it's basically just multiple tiny locations separated by this again, awful boat ride.

4-6 Luke: Absolutely unwilling to give up on Darth fucking Vader and refuses to believe there isn't good in him. Goes from immature farm boy to true jedi.

TLJ Luke: Gave up on everything because he failed once to ressurrect the Jedi Order. Decides to live as a hermit and waits to die.

4-6 Han: Goes from a self-centered rogue to a General of the Rebellion. Finds a woman he loves and becomes a better person.

TLJ Han: Has gone straight back to being a smuggler, abandons his relationship. 

Like, come on lmao. Just whack how studios keep doing this."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"I don't think Leia is a great example of this, but Luke, Han and Indy absolutely are. 

Leia seems like things were going fine for her, she continued her arc from 4-6 and tried to rebuild the republic. Han and Luke completely regressed from 4-6 and totally undid the heart of their character progression in those movies though.

Han going back to being a loner smuggler and Luke giving up and living as a hermit, just ridiculous lmao. Luke refused to give up on Darth fkin Vader, but one failure to re-establish the Jedi Order and he decides to die alone on an island in the middle of nowhere. Awesome."

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"You can feel a lot of Machine Games' DNA in The Great Circle. It feels a lot like Escape From Butcher Bay.


I'm convinced that they'd make a great Indiana Jones game, even without any help from Howard.

And a role as Executive producer can mean a lot of things. Elder Scrolls needs him, I don't think Indiana Jones does."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"The game's design outline is basically Butcher Bay, released in 2004 (effectively MachineGames' first game) and not in a vague way where you can only see little bits and pieces of influence in it. The flow, structure, even many of it's core mechanics (stealth, melee combat, even it's health system) are pulled straight from Butcher Bay. Indy iterated on many aspects of it, it emphasizes different gameplay elements, introduces puzzles, has a much higher budget and it's hub areas are more elaborate. Butcher Bay hopped between linear setpieces, to cutscenes, to adventure hubs too! They're so close they almost exist within their own subgenre.

Todd Howard seemed to have had a big hand in the story and he probably chose MachineGames because their design ethos isn't that far off from BGS (though both studios are themselves in debt to Ultima Underworld and Looking Glass Studios). Still, it's clear who actually made the game, it was MachineGames."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Pretty sure they just copied Tomb Raider note for note, but okay keep telling yourself that haha"
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,Because they have literally zero reason to greenlight something that does not make a profit.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Crystal Skull was a genuine box office success which I have to imagine is all the studios really care about. Dial of Destiny was a massive flop though (despite being a better movie imo).
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,Those last two movies were just awful.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,Can we still do an authentic Indy type movie? He had swagger and might kiss a lady without consent. I just don’t know if this type of movie plays to modern audiences. I hope I’m wrong. I’d like to see a new actor take over the role though rather than have an old man do it. Give me some 80’s action.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"I'm sure I'm gonna get downvoted for this, but I'm so curious I have to ask. I've never actually watched any of the Indiana Jones movies. From what I hear and read online, though, I know people hate the crystal skull because they had aliens and that apparently jumps the shark for people. Like ""aliens"" is always mentioned when people talk about why it sucks. 

My question, though, why are aliens such a line for people? I've seen the opening of the ark scene, and obviously seen it parodied in a million and one other series, and that has like souls coming out and melting their faces. From that, I understood Indiana Jones to not be a particularly grounded series of movies. So why were aliens the bridge too far for everyone?"
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,They need to reboot at this point 
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"i'm all for senior citizens living their best life, but seeing these entertainment companies like disney or wwe keep trying to squeeze their older actors or in-ring talent to perform like they used to for the nostalgia dollar is getting sad.  don't want them replaced by ai, but licensing their likenesses (and paying them royalties) for video games is more than acceptable.  and in video games, voice-alikes can let us relive them at their peak."

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"Ubisoft share price is extremely low, their revenue is in tatters and there's been rumours of a buyout.

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I agree about the sneaking but I find the fighting incredibly satisfying. Sure, it's not an intricate system but it never had to be. I enjoy the simplicity of it. After all, it's an adventure / puzzle game, first and foremost. 

I absolutely agree with the hand holding. I haven't even looked at the puzzle yet and the NPCs are already giving hints? Disabling those entirely should have been the ""Hard"" setting under puzzle difficulty. Instead it only goes up to ""Moderate"". A stupid oversight in an otherwise incredible game. Let me turn that shit off already."

I love Die Hard with a Vengeance, but I struggled with the first two for a while, and it's because they're different movies.

It's like someone enjoying Terminator 2, or Aliens.  They're almost different genres than the originals as well. 
 
Hell Die Hard 2 was originally a book called ""58 minutes""..   Vengence was originally a Lethal Weapon movie, and even then it was originally a different script for Brandon Lee to star in.  4 was originally a movie called WW3.com (by the guy who wrote Enemy of the State) 

5 was the only one that was ACTUALLY written to be a Die Hard Movie... Maybe there's only 2 Diehard movies, and one of them sucks."

everyone that i know picked it up or wanted to pick it up on gamepass 

i still believe that the playerbase on gamepass is way higher for this game - even me with over 700 games on steam was tempted to get gamepass for a month because of Stalker 2 (60€), MSFT 2024 (80€), Indiana Jones (70€)"
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Indeed, there are other platforms, other means of playing games.


What I'm uncertain about is how they get the info to begin with. You can play Steam games entirely offline, obviously that will hide you, but you can also hide your profile or make yourselves invisible in general on Steam -> players who do this might be hidden from Steam charts, but I found no trustworthy information on this.


But clearly, for purely single player games that are multi-platforms and on game pass, the number will never be accurate or all that useful. Steam charts is better used to notice trends than raw number of active players."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,I rarely leave Steam reviews but just wrote one in praise of the game this morning.
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Steam CCU numbers are the only kind of objective metric we have in the gaming industry. All the rest are incomplete data given whenever (like UK boxed sales or relative sales in a month in one country) or given by publishers (which only give good news to boast about it or turn their news in a way that's positive)
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Not the rating but player count
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"Maybe Disney doesn't want their brand to look weak, which Indiana Jones does when looking at the steam playercount. If the playercount was amazing on GamePass then they should share it, otherwise there is no reason for this article to exist for us non-shareholders. This article looks like damage control to me."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"When you say “genuine box office success” what you should be saying “a lot of people went to see it hoping for a good movie, and it turned out to be shit, so no one wanted to risk seeing the next one”

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Crystal Skull happened in 2008 before the Disney acquisition in 2012 and is considered by many to be bad. It just had the advantage of being the first Indy movie since 1989, nearly 20 years earlier."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,Crystal Skull was awful (and I added to the box office tally) and Dial of Destiny was genuinely enjoyable for me - a return to form - so bummer that it disappointed.

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"When I heard the movies plot involved time travel, I didn't expect it to finally happen in the last 30 minutes of the movie.

  
To add, if they were going to go the route the movie did with the time travel it would have been cool to have him lose his hat in the past and then have it turn up in a museum exhibit in, well more than likely The British Museum."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,This is not how these kinds of things work. Yes the ultimate goal is to make money but films that diminish the*perception* of an IP are not as successful even if they were in the black

Star Wars is such a vast setting with infinite potential for world building and expansion, but it feels small when most of the stuff we’re getting is about the same few people.  

Like, there’s an entire galaxy to explore but we’re making more content about Obi Wan and Boba Fett? Characters who have had their stories completed for years?"

 Best deal ever IMO for 24 euros lol. Just Indy is 70 euro game as you say that is easily finished in a month - month and a half even if someone doesn't have much spare time."

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"So lets see

You think that Disney is going to green light developing a very expensive video game as a followup to a game that was a financial failure. That they are going to do this because they want the Indiana Jones brand to look strong. 

Not only that, but that they also paid off Games Radar to write 5 or so paragraphs, primarily quoting people, to convince people of this?

You also think that this game was a financial failure, despite not being far off of Silent Hill 2 on steam, which wasn't on gamepass at all.

You are jumping through so many hoops to justify your idea that this game that received almost universally positive reviews was a financial failure."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Part of it was Disney being so eager to make aggressive 'pass the torch' movies instead of genuine homages to the core of the franchise.  Crystal Skull was all about sundowning Harrison Ford for future Shia LeBoef adventures.  Star Wars was immediately kicking aside all the old characters for the new cast in every scene.  Marvel also fell apart after they switched out everyone with very little transition.

Actors can't hold onto a single role forever, but stories where the popular hero with years of buildup and lore gets shown up and replaced by a new upstart that hasn't earned it in all of 10 minutes aren't fun to watch."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"Also Harrison Ford was too old for this shit in 2008, trying to make another one in the 20's was a choice."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I mean that's not always true. The Jurassic Park movies have gotten increasingly bad and people keep showing up, the Star Wars prequels were viewed fairly similarly to Crystal Skull and it didn't stop them from doing well (or the sequel trilogy from doing well). If Spielberg had pumped out another Indiana Jones movie a few years after Crystal Skull I think it would've done fine, but a 15 year gap, change of directors, and the weakest critics reviews in the franchise didn't help Dial."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"But plenty of people did turn up to see Dial of Destiny. Its worldwide/domestic box office is on par with every film in the original trilogy, Crystal Skull is the anomaly that was way more successful than any other film in the franchise.

The problem with DoD is not that people didn't go to see it, because plenty of people did. The problem is that it had a budget of ***300 million dollars*** which is twice as much as Crystal Skull, 6 times more than Last Crusade and 15 times more than Raiders."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"That's something you often see in other areas as well. If a band broke out big with a hit album, their next album typically also sells really well. Even if it gets poor reviews and sees them fade back into relative obscurity. A surprising number of one-hit or one-album wonders have a follow-up that does pretty well.

People generally remember the last big thing you did and use that to guide their future decisions. It's not an absolute but there's often a lot of residual interest that's sufficient to keep things going."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"Yup. As far as I’m concerned, there are only three real Indy movies."

Personally I thought the time travel was fine, the movies always get supernatural near the end (aside from Temple of Doom where it kicks in earlier) and the only time I’ve disliked it is the alien in Crystal Skull."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"There is 1/3 of, not a “decent” movie, but a genuinely good movie buried in Crystal Skull, in my opinion. It starts when Shia Labeouf shows up and it ends when Ray Winstone returns. Shia is not the problem in the movie, it’s all the CGI and the goofy Russians and all that jazz. 

As for Temple of Doom, while Kate Capshaw I find very hard to watch and the Hindu aspect is terribly butchered, it can still be a fun movie. I had the fortune to see it in theaters a few years ago and it is much more fun to see on a big screen than at home."
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"And while Dial of Destiny is an overall more entertaining film than Crystal Skull, it doesn’t feel too much like an Indiana Jones film to me. Very little of the music is purpose-written for the film, it’s a lot of recycled stuff because John Williams is like 90, and the constant CGI and the fact that every scene in the movie either takes place at dawn or sunset and there’s not a regular blue sky makes it feel very modern. These are nitpicks, I do think it’s a reasonably entertaining film, and I felt sad that it seemed like Indiana Jones just wasn’t important in pop culture anymore when it came out. I am glad the game is getting new people into the franchise, Indiana Jones has always been one of my favorite series of films."

My feel is they try to hard to harvest memba berries, or needlessly try to adhere to VH1s I Love the xties that didn't exist until Crystal Skull.

The 80s movies were great, but they were products of an 80s Hollywood. 2020s Hollywood isn't making Indiana Jones as we knew it, so they ought to just take it a new direction if they're going to make it at all.

My personal wish was that if they wanted to use an elderly Harrison Ford, bump us up to the 80s or 90s and give us a matching elderly Indiana Jones."

Indy's amazingness doesn't depend on which woman is with him.  That's like ranking Bond films by the Bond girl - I mean, you can do it, but the best Bond films don't really correlate to the best Bond girls.

Kate Capshaw's character was annoying but she was *supposed* to be annoying and she acted the hell out of it.  And much of the great classic Indy situational humor in ToD comes from the contrast between her and Indy."

It's not like the comics, where there is no aging. Instead we get stunt double versions with the same names. Not saying Sam Wilson will be a bad Cap, but it's not quite the same as a Steve Rogers. (That fake-out in DP & Wolverine was brilliant btw.) I think it's mainly why the Marvel movies slumped so badly after Endgame. They had no idea how to replace everyone, and gave us a bunch of second stringer heroes that no one had really heard of."

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-28,"I saw Temple of Doom in the theater and it’s the first movie I can clearly remember seeing. Short Round was aspirational. I wanted to be him and go on adventures with Indy. All these years later I love that Temple of Doom tries not to be formulaic and just copy Raiders. The Bond-esque opening in Shanghai has some of the coolest lines in the series. Every actor did their job, and I get why general audiences didn’t respond well to Lucas and Spielberg trying to gross people out with shocking food, bug laden corridors, and children in peril, but it’s a fantastic adventure nonetheless."

Edit:  Last Crusade and Raiders those sidekick characters are actually important. You could have done ToD without the sidekicks and it’d be a better film. Prove me wrong.  Also I don’t know if the fat dude from Turkey is even in ToD and he’s like the best side character of the other two films.

1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,">Which I think there would have been some cool ways to do that, but it would have involved the Russians as bad guys again.

1) They coulda done it more interestingly than Crystal Skull, there's still a ton you can do. And

2) Nothing says it would *have* to be Russians. There's a lot going around the world in the 80s if that's the direction they did go. Vague Russian presence... as Doctor Jones works alongside the tribes and mujaheddin in the mountains of Afghanistan to preserve some hitherto unknown relic from any of the faiths that passed through. Much like Temple of Doom, the threat can be more local with the Russian element being background, a kind of tertiary pressure, or merely a red... herring.

Or maybe a little more West, with Doctor Jones's archaeological adventures backed by American interests in conflicts or buildup in the Middle East.

Or maybe Doctor Jones finds himself in Iran for a purely academic or diplomatic affair, but gets caught up in some intrigue that inevitably ties in to the rich and endless religious or historical heritage of the country.

Heck, you can plop him in Palau to unravel some ancient mystery in a country preparing itself for independence from the US. The world is massive and there isn't a corner of the globe that doesn't have something interesting for setting or plot.

Although given his age and how he seems quite at home by the time of Young Indiana Jones, it'd be perfectly fine to fit him into something more domestic. Either an archaeological mystery upon the American continent, or a plot that unsettles the twilight years of his academic career.

The only confusing thing would be why, with such rich possibilities, one would decide to go rote!"
1hodjp2,2024-12-28,2024-12-29,"1. Having the same ""sidekicks"" in every film doesn't necessarily make a better universe.  It also makes it smaller.  More ""sidekicks"" is a richer universe, and richer characters.
2. Indy has a great ""sidekick"" at the start of ToD that basically dies in his arms, adding emotional depth and personal loss.
3. From almost the very start of the movie, both ""sidekicks"" are integral to Indy's journey:  
    * Willie secures the antidote for the poison Indy drank.  Without it, Indy would have died.  All of that is preceded by an absolutely chaotic, hilarious, and fantastic action set piece in Club Obi-wan.  
    * Shortround is driving the getaway car when Indy escapes Club Obi-wan, without which he - again - likely would have been captured and died.  
    * Willie rescues Indy and Shortround when they are caught in a spiked trap, which is another *amazing* action scene combining incredible tension, and humor, that *only works because of Willie's inexperience and stereotypical girlishness.*  
    * After Indy is ""turned"" by drinking the blood of Kali-ma, Shortround is pivotal in ""rescuing"" Indy and bringing him back to his senses.  
    * In basically the same extended scene, Willie's peril provides the necessary tension regarding Indy's turn to evil, as Indy lowers her to a fiery death.  
    * Shortround again rescues Indy when he is fighting the ""big bad guy"", by preventing the young prince from using his Indy ""voodoo doll"".  
4. Those are just the instances where the plot depends on the ""sidekicks"" presence.  There are many other places where their presence add to the scene tension or the situational humor, thanks to their inexperience or their childishness:   
    * The entire intro from Club Obi-Wan to Lao Che Airways.  
    * The entire scene of the three of them camping in the jungle, while Indy plays cards with Shortround and Willie ""discovers"" the creatures of the night.  
    * The entire iconic dinner scene at the palace.  
    * The entire scene where Indy and Willie attempt to seduce each other, followed by the attack of a palace assassin, and leading to the aforementioned spiked trap.  
    * The entire extended action scenes from the mine car chase to the unforgettable rope bridge ending.  
    In almost all of these scenes, the fact that Willie is *not* a tough and hardened adventurer, and that Shortround is just a kid (that punches above his weight) enrich the scenes rather than detract from them."

1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Potentially the sleeper hit of the year? Right before the festive period too.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Never doubt machinegames and their ability to make good first person nazi killing games again
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Indybros are we back???
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,MachineGames was the PERFECT studio for this. Unsurprising outcome.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I’m playing it now and just wanna say this is the most authentic and unique Indiana Jones game. It’s definitely a love letter to fans. There was a vision here and they nailed it, and it has a unique feel to it."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I feel like this game might suffer from the community already deciding they didn't like it before it even came out, so then not trusting any positive reviews because people want to feel like they were right."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Perfect Score from Eurogamer and 9/10 from Both Gamespot and IGN, this looks good."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I’m liking how weighty the parkour stuff feels. It feels similar to the films in that Indy often begrudgingly jumps across caverns, and is always a little out of breadth. The stamina bar is such a nice differentiator from Uncharted where you’re basically a mountain climber and scale anything with speed and ease. In Great Circle you actually feel how it’s a big fucking chore pulling yourself up the side of a building. 

Lara Croft and Nathan Drake have always played like super hero’s. Gun down 100s of baddies while scaling temples with no regard. Indy in this game plays like a professor archeologist whose unquenchable thirst for knowledge leads him on adventures. He’s very solid at adventuring but he’s also kind of just a dude."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Hell yeah, glad it's looking good. Can't wait to jump in. I'll never forget watching Indiana Jones with my dad as a little kid, it means a lot to me. Glad I'll be able to enjoy another adventure in that world."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Get in and enjoy before the ACKUALLY motherfuckers roll up to the scene and defecate
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Troy Baker sounds scarily identical to young Harrison Ford. Amazing voice actor.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"The games runs pretty well on PC. On a RTX 3080 TI at 1080P ultrawide a DLSS on Auto and Ultra settings and I'm getting 120 FPS. It would be more, but I capped it at 120."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I can’t wait to get one month of Game Pass to play this game. I think I can get all the enjoyment I can out of a single player game in a month’s time, then, in a couple years when I feel like a second playthrough, I’ll get it dirt cheap during a sale"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I'm excited! ""Free"" with Gamepass so it's just downloading data."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Wow.

Up there with GoldenEye apparently.

Can't wait to play."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"“Can’t trust reviews!!!!”


Meanwhile if this were just a PS exclusive: “yet another banger 10/10!”


Y’all are wack"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I'm about 2 hours in, not rushing, and it's great so far. Especially if you need a break from the frenetic pace of playing CoD online. 

Fistfights felt a little clunky at first, but KOs are really satisfying. Good story, good graphics, and a solid nod to the movie franchise."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I played a couple hours yesterday and it is a really good game so far. Very high quality everything.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,God gamers are so insufferable now. The game is good. It’s not the best game ever and it’s not a pile of shit. There are allowed to be good games made
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,First Indy thing that doesn’t suck since the 90s?
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Replaying Fate of Atlantis in preparation ✨️ 👌
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Frustrated this isn't coming to PS5 for Christmas! I'm sure the wait will be worth it
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Damnit! I only have PS5 and have to wait until next year. My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined. Indy!!!!!!
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"The optimisation is phenomenal. Native 1080p on an ancient i7-4790 (not even the K version) combined with a 3060Ti + 32gb RAM i get a constant 90+ FPS performance on mid-high settings, only texture memory is set to low (default as the game adjusted itself). Game looks gorgeous even with these settings. 


EDIT: Ok now i came into the Vatican and the average is around 50 which is quite the drop but still very good considering my rig. "
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Hmm, the specs required to play the game on steam is insane so I’m gonna hold off"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"The fact i can play Indiana Jones, Avowed, Doom the Dark Ages, and Fable if it releases in 2025 for $12 on gamepass is fucking nuts."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"This is really surprising, I was convinced this game was gonna suck ass."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I think this belongs in a museum!
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Everyone doubting machine games can go kick rocks.

They never miss."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,You have chosen wisely.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Great performance so far. 3080, 3440 x 1440p Ultrawide. 144fps"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I’m pumped for this one. Can’t decide if I want to wait for it to come out on PS5 or play it on the PC.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"As per usual I skimmed through the lowest-scoring reviews to see what reviewers *don't* like, since it's obvious what's there to like. Seems like it's mainly down to the combat and the shifting perspective. I suppose it's not a big deal with the game's focus on adventure and puzzle solving, but it might still annoy people depending on how often they force you into fights. At least it's a great way of differentiating itself from the recent TR/Uncharted games."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Xbox tax applied here. That being said, can you blame people for being skeptical when a ton of Xbox's marquee releases have been buggy and broken despite showing a lot of promise.

What can't be taken away from Xbox is that the games they are choosing to fund are far more interesting from a mechanical perspective than anything Sony has been bringing out recently. This looks like a winner to me personally. Towerborne has been getting solid reviews on Steam in the lead up to its 1.0, and Avowed looks solid too so far. It's very unfortunate that Xbox is ""giving up"" this exclusive to PlayStation in the end, but if it means that we can get Xbox to publish shit like this I do not care. Xbox Games are finally putting out good shit and I'm so here for it."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Starfield has a score of 83 with many 10/10 reviews and was quite a disappointment for me. 

So I guess we'll have to see."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,It would have been a day one purchase if it was 3rd person.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Gonna wait for this to come out on Ps5
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,And it’s a union made game!
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I just wish it was third person, man..."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,That’s actually really great and better than what I was expecting.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Machine games need this win after the disappointment that was the last Wolfenstein
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,That's certainly encouraging.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I’ll still wait for reviewers who share my tastes and I rely on, but man I am so game for a story licensed game that doesn’t shit the bed. Especially a beloved older one.

Please don’t let this be the case of reviewers overhyping a game."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Got it for free with my 4070 purchase
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Super happy about this, can’t wait till it comes to PS5."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,It’s great for Xbox that they have actually got a good exclusive honestly..for a few months anyway
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,This game might just be the reason I get a series X
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Now now let's not get ahead of ourselves here
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Antinwoke crowd and fake outrage crowd can suck it

Both are uselss trolls"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I don’t trust this reviews since Cyberpunk 2077 launch. Waiting players reviews so I know what we are getting is actually good
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I'm excited for this. Can't wait for it to hit PS5 next year I definitely want it. Loved the Wolfenstein games
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I’m very excited. 

I thought the most recent movie was pretty damn good (not as good as the original 3, but WAY better than Crystal Skull), so another quality adventure with Indy? I’m all in!"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Played for an hour now. Damn, it's so boring. Already need to force myself playing it. I probably had too high expectations. The AI is especially horrendous."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Another 9/10! 

https://gametyrant.com/news/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-fortune-and-glory"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"These are the same outlets that gave crazy high scores to Veilguard.... color me skeptical at a minimum. How it's great but I'm going to wait until a good, wide pool of outlets and youtubers have a chance to put their thoughts out there"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Good to hear.  This game was included with a video card I recently bought
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,First great Indiana Jones game since Indiana Jones and the Fate of the Atlantis in the early 90s?
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Another fine example of why the game awards should be early the following year. Once again a late release will be screwed out of a GOTY nom. This year it stood a chance. Next year? Not so much.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Wou
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,It seems we have chosen wisely. Looking forward to playing it.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Waiting to see how it actually runs on PC. The requirements were revealed but that doesn’t tell the story of actual gameplay. Things like frame drops, stutters etc. want to see how it is before I decide to download it."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Okay everyone is praising the game itself. But no one is talking about Performance. Does it run well? Okay-ish optimized? ( i dont expect good optimization at this point) but i feel like this is a very important part of how any1s expierience is going to be.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Shame my old rig can't handle it; mandatory ray tracing is pushing my 1070 out.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"This news excites me greatly, simply to see it's not getting immediately awful reviews"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Y'all remember him in the N64nal Machine? Better patch that raft homie!
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Would make a great vr game
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I am so happy that Indy is not going to fizzle out without at least one more bang. The last couple movies were meh.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,How long is it?
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Just bought a 4070 super for $467 and some change(new), I cannot wait to play this! Upgrading from a 3060 ti"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Not working on Steam Deck. That's ruined my afternoon plans.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Damn, poe2 starting today and I'm hyped and torn at the same time, being an adult sucks"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I guess I'll grab it when it goes on sale. Don't love Indiana Jones, but I love first person games that aren't CODlike. It looks interesting at least"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"My question is is it better than the Lego Indiana jones game. The first one, not the sequel."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Recommended specs: unlimited quantum processing power.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Hell yeah, the best Indy game since the Infernal Machine"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Will wait for a sale this is way to expensive. The new pricing of videogames is nuts. MachineGames does amazing games, glad to see this one has good reviews because it's quite different to the Wolfenstein gameplay they are used to making."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Anyone who has the game on PC on the lower end of the game’s spec sheet, how is it running? The fact that my GPU was right below recommended shook me a bit"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I recently bought a laptop and got a free copy of this game along with AC: Shadows. Now I know which I'll be trying out first
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Find it hard to believe, guess I’ll need to play it for myself to see"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I still have a Sega Master System 2 with Indiana Jones. Stupid game, jumping over giraffes heads on the top of a train 😂"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Cool!
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Heard it is pretty optimised as well. Runs 60+fps on 3060 at ultra settings.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06," Please let this be true.
 Dragon age was such a letdown I have no hopes for mass effect. 

I just want to play a good game. Is that so much to ask?"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,But it’s on game pass?
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Anyone remember Aztec on the Apple ][? The original Indy game before Indy games existed? Played it as a kid and never won.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,The real question is why are those system requirements so damn high?
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Nice to see it’s good. I got it for free lol.

Never heard of it beforehand though."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Can't bloody wait for this
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Oh man, is this one of those things where it tanks? It’s on gamepass tho so I’ll take a run at it"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Seems like this game just doesn't match the person reviewing it here. And that's OK, this is an opinion from a human being after all and that's their personal taste for a game and gameplay. If you only digest your news from the Verge then you'll probably think this is a crap game not worth your time. But other reviews, and a majority of them, are giving it high scores and enjoying it, nonetheless. Go have fun with the game. Punch some Nazi's. Touch some grass."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I’m excited! When the last movie came out I was talking with my brother about how I wish there were Indiana Jones games that told stories similar to the Bond games of the early 2000’s where they felt like real movies (I love Uncharted, I just wanted some Indy).


Next day he sent me a video of the game announcement and I’ve been pumped ever since."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"That's pretty great score, so the game must be good then."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Can't wait to play it on Monday when it releases on game pass. I'm not paying the extra $40 to play it 3 days early.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Damn that's actually unexpected
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I just saw this on Steam yesterday. It looks great and sounds great. The voice actor sounds a lot like Ford to me too (though it is clearly not him). The only thing I kinda don't like are the fight scenes, the way everyone throws their punches looks weird to me. The angles and movements seem off. But that is very minor."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Didn't expect such a good optimization, everything maxed out , 1440p ultrawide  100++ fps without framegen and dlss on my 4070super ti"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I remember absolutely stressing the shit out of my PC in order to play Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine. What a sick game that was at the time.

I also remember going to a friends house as a kid with the disk trying to install it at his place so we could play but his PC couldn't even start the game :( it took like an hour to install lol 

Thanks Gamepass I'll give this one a try."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Its silly but it made me think of dishonored.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,can anyone tell me if you can play this game offline? Would love to play it but internet access is limited.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,So this is supposed to be out..is it not? It’s not letting me play it.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,Congratulations MachineGames
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,"To note: that’s not the metascore. That’s Open Critic, not Metacritic. Different aggregate score."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,"That first opening where you get to play famous Idol scene from raiders, is just top notch at setting the mood. I’m sold."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-08,Has anyone figured out that gas lantern puzzle in the Vatican crypt?? I’m too dumb.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-08,"Hi people. It's constant CTD for me with this game after a few minutes of gameplay despite the PC I have (RTX4090, I9-14900, 32go Ram, all drivers up to date, Nvidia, bios, Windows) and running it as administator + validated by antivirus. Any advice?

 I've created a Bethesda support ticket too. I can run any recent game in ultra settings without the PC waking up so it's definitely something with this game. Maybe Machine Games let BGS touch their code... \^\^

  
Thanks."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-08,"I've been so excited to play another Indy game for a minute. Knowing that the same guys who made Chronicles of Riddick Escape from Butcher Bay made it was enough for me. That game was one of the best stealth games ever and even better than the movie itself. It's clear there's a lot of love involved in this, can't wait to play it on PS5 when it drops."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-08,"But does it have a dedicated ""punch"" button available in every dialogue?"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-08,"I'm going to buy it and I see the high praise but my only concern is that it might end up being anything like that game Deadfall Adventures, which was a fine game, but needed higher production values. Also halfway through the game one of the puzzles glitched - the texture for the right thing to press during a puzzle wouldn't load so I literally couldn't progress."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-10,28 hours in. A 9.5 game for me. Sp perfectly Indy Jones and every bit as good as a Tomb Raider or Uncharted.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-11,"Does this game have a difficulty setting?

My dad grew up watching the movies, but doesn't know if he'll be able to play, if it's too difficult."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-11,Very fun game tbh. Does anyone else get frame issues during Egypt chapter? Playing on Xbox series X
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-11,"I'm loving this game, in PC the visuals are great and the performance with full ray tracing is amazing."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-12,Im jonesing to play it
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-12,"**Para aqueles que estão com o problema do Indy para de andar após abrir o save, é só apertar ""j"" pra abrir o diário e andar, depois é só continuar a jogatina**

1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-19,"hi all, Is there a way of resetting a mission please? I tried living zone coming back and closing it completely down. As I can not 100% Garza  now as I mess up the  Seat of Eternity quest / mission. I don't know why it allowed me to do this but I put oranges on two of the pedestals and it wont allow me to take them off."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-26,"I was hesitant to play it but since it's available in game pass, I gave it a try. Few technical bugs but overall I am impressed. It really feels like watching one of indiana jones movie. The tone, story, cinematics and gameplay are immersive.
Kudos to MachineGames for such enjoyable game."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-28,"Looking for Tech Help. 

I’m getting “your graphics card is not supported”

It is. 

I’m running a Gigabyte 4080 super on an MPG x870e motherboard and a ryzen 9800 cpu. 

This is a brand new build. But absolutely should meet requirements. 

Anyone have any clue what might be causing this?"

It’s got very high highs but too many lows. Outside of brilliant cutscenes, the open zone gameplay was so inconsistent. The stealth genre is one of my favorites, so my biggest complaint is how heavily it relies on a stealth system that, between daft AI and terrible combat encounters simply doesn’t work. If it were primarily linear sequences followed by treasure hunts, it’d worked better for me. It’s also being praised for its visuals, but on XSX the lighting issues and pop-in frequently break immersion.

Help me understand!"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"For the first time since Knights of the Old Republic, I’m jealous of XBox owners."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,And it’s doing straight onto game pass. Finally starting to be worth the $’s they charge.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I do fear that a lot of the reviews are basically just praising that this is the Indiana Jones movie we’ve been waiting for 35 years and kinda gloss over the gameplay. I kinda fear what I will calls MGS4 disease(ironically MGS5 went in the complete opposite direction

1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I don’t trust critic reviews anymore after dragon age failguard
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Damn I have to wait until it comes out on PS5 looks great though
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,When does this come to PS5? That was confirmed right?
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Comes to game-pass on 12/8. Can’t wait
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"That’s crazy, I totally expected a flop considering the odd decision to make it first person and not a 3rd person adventure game like uncharted or tomb raider. Glad it found its mark."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Why couldn't they have released this on a Thursday or Friday so that I can play it over the weekend? Some of us have jobs to go to through the week.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"If your game gets compared to Batman: Arkham, then it absolutely deserves all the money and recognition it can get.

But of course, when your studio is renowned for making acclaimed shooters about fighting the Nazi regime, this is definitely not a surprise.

Playstation players will have to wait till March but they'll get the full ray-tracing (and potentially bug-free) experience that PC and Xbox players haven't gotten with the early access from the Advanced Edition."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"$120 dollarydoos with $170 dollarydoos for the full fucking thing.

Yeah that is a distant steam sale at best."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I’m glad Xbox finally released a great game. I’m also glad it’s on PC.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,That poor dev lead being fearmongered to death is owed a apology
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Critic scores aren't really enough to go on these days
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Is anyone else disappointed it’s not third person? I don’t know about you, but I don’t feel like Indiana jones from a first person camera. Seeing the third person view really immerses me more. Very disappointing."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,gamers are gonna be pissed 
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"The first person perspective unfortunately makes this an automatic no for me, but the game does look interesting."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Don't give in to hype to pre-purchase it. Wait for it. Watch some gameplay, try 2h and then decide."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"No pronouns, a straight white male protagonist, 87 metascore in 2024?  Gaming is healing"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I wouldn’t put a lot of stock in modern review scores.  If this year has shown us anything, it’s that metacritic scores are hardly an indicator of anything meaningful.

I hope it’s good, but I’ll wait for someone I trust to review it."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,So a 4/10 then?
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"After dragon age : the veilguard when i see a game with so high scores i start to suspect that will be shit XD   
Need to get more info about it  ."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I’m looking forward to the pc mods that put maga hats on the nazis.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I have a hard time believing it’s that good particularly because it didn’t look that great from the previews.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,X to doubt
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Well done xbox. 
Can't wait for the game to come to ps5 now."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Coolio!
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Saw some trusted reviews yesterday, and color me surprised, it is actually not what I expected. It's still probably not a game for me, but it's definitely a bit different and will find its audience. I doubt it'll be a commercial hit, though. It's very niche, and depending on the budget, this might bomb hard. It will most certainly not be a focus during investor calls ...  
  
Think more like Sinking City or Sherlock Holmes type of games, but with licensing costs and a ""AAA"" budget? Could be bad for them, despite having made a decent game. I'm just happy Machine Games did something with their lives after the debacle that was Youngblood ..."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Damn now the question is, what do I play first this or Path of Exile 2?!

Dragon Age Veilguard can get in the trash, I've no desire to keep playing that lame duck of a game."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Critic scores say nothing to me, and that this has happened is really sad. I'll believe when I see the people response."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I want to like this, but I just can't get over the weird viewpoint....I'm not fond of first person games"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"The marketing for this seems pretty light, are they waiting for the PS5 version to get the word out?"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-08,Metascore is meaningless. Always has been.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-09,Should of just created lego Indiana jones 3.

1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Soooooo not to be a weirdo but why are everyone excited about the reviews for this but the reviews for everything else are fake and paid for?
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Only 87? sorry but according to redditors that means it's a failure and dead on arrival
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I hope they did well for their fans. I am personally not going to support Bethesda after what they've done with launching one of the worst games I've ever played, starfield, and their shitty monetization of what should be free dlc content, mods, or included in the base game purchase."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"It's off how the games media reviews are so glowingly positive yet many of the youtuber reviews and smaller channels i follow seem to be far more critical of it.

the kinda funny review for example raises several critisisms which i feel are things that i'm not going to like and others on youtube, twitch and stuff have raised very similar critisisms.

i think this will be a game i wait for actual gamers to play before i decide if i'm going to play it myself or not."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,You also need an 87100 graphics card to run it...
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"But but Xbox fans said that the media hates Xbox and they get money from Sony to give Xbox games bad reviews.


It wasn’t true after all? What a shock."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I’m actually shocked. I thought it looked awful
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"93% on steam, but currently, only 73 people reviewed it.
I'll be avoiding it just because it doesn't pique my interest."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Everyone's praising this game and while it's good, the amount of crashes I've had during the E.A. period have been too damn high for me to give it anything above an 80."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Crap like D4, Starfield, Spiderman 1+2 and even DA4 got good pre-release Reviews too.

NEVER EVER trust Pre-Release Reviews."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Not a single word about technical issues or the lack of those. These are not reviews that give you the whole picture. The game can be really good, but, if it's a bugfest, it's still a failure."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,When does it actually come out seeing as how it’s apparently secretly early access or some shit?
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Thank goodness that this is(likely) going to be a much better free game with a graphics card than Starfield was.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,So its mediocre
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"While I maintain my philosophy of completely writing off anything that paid critics have to say, my gut feeling is that they're correct this time around and the user reviews are going to broadly be in agreement.  Seen enough footage to reach this conclusion without spoiling the hell out of everything.

That said, it's been a long time since I paid a full AAA price for any game that could be done and dusted in under 20 hours.  That part of it is a bit of a hard sell."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Released on Xbox isn't a release. If it's not on PlayStation, it's not out at all."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Get out!!
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,They'll present it at the Indy 500
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,It belongs in a museum!
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,delicious

1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Does anyone remember Fate of Atlantis? Game was great. Wish they’d just done a movie of it instead of what we’ve been getting recently.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,That giant crocodile was so fucked.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,All I remember was a castle( I think ?) With nazis ? Crazy officer on a comically large drill machine trying to run you over .

1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,What console was it on? I rented a 3D Indiana Jones game from Blockbuster a few times that was on N64 and it seemed awesome but we could never get past the first sandy desert ruins/cave level 🤔
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Fuck, I think you just unlocked a memory for me. I remember watching my cousin play it and I had nightmares for weeks of me trying to swing over a giant pit of water while that big mf kept trying to snap at me. 

Damn."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I rented that game from a video game rental store. Throwwww baaaaack

1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Combat in that one was so much fun. Loved grabbing guys and tossing them over railings.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Machine Games was founded by former employees of the company that made Chronicles of Riddick, Starbreeze Studios. Starbreeze still exists, but they didn't develop this games. They're known for Payday now."

1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Escape from butcher bay was a classic
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I didn't know that. Now I know I'm buying the game.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"That game came out almost 20 years ago, I'd be surprised if there's anyone from that era left."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,">Also just learning that it's the same studio that made the old Chronicles of Riddick game.

Welp, I'm sold. That game fucking RULED."

1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Dude, I loved Riddick and the game that dropped for it. Good times"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I was playing it most of last night. It is actually very enjoyable and emersive. I'm not even an Indiana Jones fan.

I literally spent hours just exploring around and solving puzzles. They hit the mark with this one"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-10,28 hours in. A 9.5 game for me. Sp perfectly Indy Jones and every bit as good as a Tomb Raider or Uncharted.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I’m already thrilled about the choice to be first person, which was my biggest worry. It plays nothing like Tomb Raider or Uncharted - is its own thing entirely and I’m loving it."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I'm excited. I got it for free with my new rig, would never have considered buying it otherwise because of the reasons you mentioned but I wouldn't say no to a free game. The fact it sounds good is just even better."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I just found out about this game, is the game play more of Indian Jones: The Fate of Atlantis or Uncharted?"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,The Fate of Atlantis would like to have a word with you...
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,The fact that you can light a damn torch is so damn immersive. It brings me back to Arx Fatalis where you could cook a pie by an open fire
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I'm stoked I love Indiana Jones. I'm waiting til I can snag an 8800xt to play to get the best experience possible
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I guess when there's no tie-in film/show there's more chance of a games creation just having someone wanting to do something special. Best case scenario it seems
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I liked the infernal machine and was hopping for a modern version of this. How is it different ?
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Have you ever played the old Indiana Jones adventure games by Lucasarts? Some of my all time favourite games.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Yesssss. This is great to hear. I always wanted another movie while Ford was relatively young. Happy that this could be a very close stand in
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,If this is good it will also be the first time I’m happy in my life
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Can't wait for the ps5 release but it's going to be another couple months
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Oh wow that's a pleasant shock I gotta try out the game when I get more space on my console
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"What’s the gameplay like? Would you describe it as a Ghost Train Ride like Uncharted where it’s divided into chapters each with a specific mission, or more like an open world?"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-08,"I have to try this game. I feel like the general vibe is that everyone expected it to be super mid, but have all been surprised."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Just played the opening…and it’s fucking incredible.  Everything about it is just…it’s both it’s own cool thing, and an extremely loving recreation of everything Indiana Jones."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Only played for like two hours…but holy shit, does it live up and exceed them imo.  It’s so, so well made and so fun."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Starfield had blazingly good reviews before launch as well, we saw how that went

But man I really want one of Bethesda's studios to get a win again, plus I loved Lego Indiana Jones as a kid and I hope it has that feeling of adventure"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,What kind of take is this? There have been amazing single player games throughout the years.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,">it’s been a while since a single player story focused game has really grabbed me.

Alan Wake II was just last year.  Not at all the same type of story as Indiana Jones lol, but an incredible story nonetheless."

1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Is it a sleeper though? It's a pretty high profile game
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"The interesting thing is that it wasn't *100%* a sleeper to me. They've been advertising quite a lot on Reddit, so I knew there was a game coming out. But this is the first actual post I've seen of people discussing it. And honestly the ads weren't very good, so I was expecting it to be a mediocre cash grab. I can't quite place why the ads made it look terrible."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Didn't even think about the fact it's another nazi killing game... We need more! Elder Scrolls VII: Machines vs Nazis
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,We so back
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,People have been clowning on it making assumptions that are demonstrably false from preview footage. Online gamers have to disparage and neg everything because they think it makes them cool
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Seen quite a few not liking it immediately cause it’s first person
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"It didn't look very interesting to me pre-release, but they don't really seem to be marketing it as much as other games. But it's on Gamepass so I'll give it a try."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,So even high scores aren't to be trusted anymore? Lol.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Hard to blame them after the 10s and 9s to a mid game like Veilguard.

Players will need to play the game themselves before trusting major reviews which have proven to have little credibility."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I’m in the cautious optimism camp. I’m expecting it to be about mid-tier, maybe $10 more expensive than I’d like, but if it’s quality then it is.

Not to mention the trailers actually nailing the feel of the trilogy."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Very likely- but the gaming media gave rave reviews to the likes of Ultima IX (a game so bad it destroyed the oldest, and at the time best, RPG franchise) and Master of Orion 3 (a game so bad it killed its entire *GENRE*, which still hasn't recovered more than twenty years later).  Any dubiousness is VERY well-earned.

The logical thing to do is find a few reviewers whose ideas and desires match your own, and wait for their comments.  But some people just like to beat up on the big devs with the big budgets."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I just don’t get why it’s first person. Such an iconic character and he’s hidden for 90% of the game
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,The same Eurogamer that gave 10 to Veilguard?
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,And I got it for free for buying a new RTX
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,All those outlets are straight bullshit reviews now. Gotta wait for actual player reviews. Veilguard got great reviews and it was a steaming pile.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Lol. Whenever IGN gives something a high score, it almost seems like it's destined to actually be a bad game."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-16,My Indiana Jones also has an unquenchable thirst for tanning Nazi's upside the head with any nearby shovel. I've twatted dozens of the fuckers and it never gets old.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-09,idk you bro. but I hope you have a blast! dad time is the best
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,good to hear. Was worried when I saw the recommended specs page
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,[deleted]
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I mean it runs on the iDtech engine, so I assume it's fairly well optimized if Doom Eternal is anything to judge by."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-08,What cpu?
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Thank you for putting free in quotes.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I'd it free with gamepass ""console"" too? (The one without Xbox live included)

If not I'm dumping gamepass"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I don’t think it’s even a Sony vs Xbox console war at this point, lots of internet nazis who have been radicalized by YouTube brainrot and steam forums and top level reddit subs will randomly categorize upcoming games releases as Bad based on characteristics such as how much tiddy the female characters show and how many black characters there are on screen and if the game is mean or not at nazis. 

Indiana Jones and Wolfenstein is not typically kind towards nazis."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Because ps has a great line up of exclusives while xbox has not been able to come up with anything decent for years? 
Starfield getting early 10/10s doesn't help either because of how shit that game turned out to be. 

But I do hope this is good, will be playing this on PC during holidays. Loved the Indy movies."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,"Is there an option to disable the shift from first-person to third-person when climbing, etc? "
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I will not stand for this Lego Indiana Jones erasure.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,i don’t think dial of destiny sucks per say. it’s just…aggressively mediocre
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Man you did not just shit on Emperor's Tomb and Staff of Kings like that
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,Vatican is also heavy on NPCs so far which I think is the major culprit
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,They largely overestimated. I runs really well.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"It gets a solid 60 on series s at 1080p, I'm sure you'll be fine"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I did a little bit of trolling and got a year of Gamepass ultimate using the conversion trick, bought from Eneba, and split the bill & gameshared with 2 other friends, and now I paid 20$ for 13 months. Never had this good of a price to value ratio."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,How’d you pay $12 dollars for a year of Gamepass?
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I mean, I want to love Youngblood as much as the next guy, but…. “never miss?”"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Not doubting but remember when Arkane was claimed to never miss? Then Redfall came and set a new standard for bad game until Concord fell flat so badly that it is causing ripples into other studios.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-16,"You can, if you have some patience, stealth almost everything and avoid fighting.  But when knocking nazi's out is this much fun it seems like madness not to indulge as often as possible."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Xbox taking a more diverse approach to games and taking risks with niche games has been hit and miss but overall I'm so very grateful they have done it. You really cannot confuse two Xbox games for being the same.


I don't want to play this game as don't like the franchise but I am very interested in how it performs as this is important for the health of the industry for this to do well."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,"Great post, its a big win for everyone."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Score aggregates aren't a good way to go about... Anything. Really, you should completely ignore the rating, the content of reviews (and who writes them) is much more important."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"#BGS didn’t develop this genius 

Machine Games did."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Veilguard sitting at a 82
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"most of the reviews are based around the first few hours of gameplay, or a rushed playthrough. both of these are usually the parts where these studios focus on the most in terms of content and enjoyability. anything else is often filler to drag out gameplay hours (which is not automatically a bad thing).

it's always best to see for yourself, as I've played plenty of 5/10 games that I thought are worth at least 8/10. same with the reverse."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,lol ok
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Cyberpunk was fantastic right off the bat on PC. I played day 1 on PC and thought it deserved the high ratings.

Consoles it was dog shit though with all of the bugs and bad performance."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I skimmed through the displayed snippets, and though I haven’t read all of them or any of the reviews in full I get the impression this will be the most accurate sentiment especially given the average score:  
  
>It’s a fun story with some decent gameplay variety that’s authentically Indy. You won’t miss much by strictly sticking to the main quest, and in fact, your experience will be better for it. It’s a shame the rest of it falls so flat."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-08,"Dafuq you on about? The AI is better than in 90% of games these days. It's boring to you because you expected something like uncharted or COD. It's a slow exploration game and thank god it is. I'm around 8 hours into the game and the puzzles and exploration are phenomenal, didn't fire a single bullet yet. It's been a very long time since a game made me put my brain to effort. Quite the refreshment that we got something that makes you think after approx 14 years of mindless hand-holding crap."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,You paid for early access?
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,GManLives seems to be liking it. Not necessarily something that will move your mind but if you enjoy his content and generally agree with his views then it might be worth playing after all.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I mean, Veilguard is actually a good game though. Sure I can see how it pisses off hard-core DA fans with the lore but it's a damn fun action RPG."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"It's using the Id Engine... I don't know about you but Doom Eternal runs at like 6,293 FPS on my machine at full settings. 

Like or hate Id games, their engines never fail."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,No one is probably talking about performance because there isn't an issue with performance.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,People only talk about performance if theres an issue.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Im aying on supreme setting with a 4070 ti it runs smooth af
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,16h or so.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-08,Yes
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-08,Id tech is awesome
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-08,"Out for early access pre orders

Out for everyone 9th"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-11,"Yes, there's a relaxed mode with lighter combat if you want to focus more on the adventure."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Why? It's coming to ps5 and PC also. Play it anywhere
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Good call!
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,wasn't MGS4 heavily criticised at the time? I thought that was the whole reason they went with tapes over cutscenes for most of the dialogue. There's a cutscene that's like 140 minutes in MGS4 right?
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Its coming out for PS5 around March i think

1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,To charge for early access of course. You can play it now if you cough up the dough.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Gamepass
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Yeah Indiana Jones isn’t exactly known for gunning everything down in sight. Just seems like making it an FPS is a fundamental misunderstanding of what that franchise is about.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Nope not at all, first person is MachineGames bread and butter, if the game is good then it’s good. A camera angle doesn’t affect that for me."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,100% this.  Just like wasting customized character in Cyberpunk for it to just disappear 1st. Stupid.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,They’re already mad that Nazis are the bad guys in this game
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,New game bad !
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,There's an never ending supply of fascists to beat the crap out of. That never gets boring.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Are yall gonna say sorry to that gay director who got dehumanized to kingdom comm for the game ?
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Yup. Companies pay for reviews and for bots and shills to make posts like these and make sales. It works in the same way as having high review score . They go after the parts of the internet people use to make judgements, like Reddit. 


And when the games out, that budget dies and nobody talks about it anymore. Like it happened with so many games and tv shows(looking at you, Disney, EA, Ubisoft, Microsoft, Sony, etc). Almost like that discussion and buzz was fabricated 


People should know better than to trust critics. Wait for user reviews, and read what they write. "
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,It's allowed to get good reviews now that it's coming to PS
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I'm still a bit skeptical, I want to at least know how optimized it is on PC. The system requirements are quite high because of forced elements of raytracing.

Still, even if a game has problems it doesn't mean it's bad. I've loved plenty of games that had some problems."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"The overestimated the specs, runs really good"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,That’s got to be your PC I’ve had no issues at all
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Facts. We have to go to the bottom of the thread and click on the hidden comments to see the truth as bot swarms are trying to control the narrative via upvotes and downvotes. 


So many comments got thrown down here. Probably the only ones from real people "
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,It's Id Tech engine (Doom's engine) which runs really smoothly
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Go to bed.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,And don’t forget your hat!
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Can confirm

1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Had it on the PS2. Played it maybe twice. Granted I was like 12, but I was pretty good at games and this one was toooo hard"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I thought he meant old old, like The Infernal Machine. Now that’s a banger. Total tank controls. Still fun on PC"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I never got past that stupid jellyfish level
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"YES THAT'S THE ONE! AHA AND IT'S ON STEAM! Thank you, I can finally revisit this ancient nostalgia."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"You left out how much of a difference whether or not you gave them the real grail diary had. You could give them the wrong book if you had another old book and it would skip the bit where you retrieve the diary and briefly meet Hitler.  But you could get Hitler to autograph the travel pass which would let you breeze through the roadblocks, which meant that taking the biplane and just crashing whenever was quicker and easier than bothering with the blimp at all."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"There were a lot of good older Indiana Jones games, even the ones that were the more point and click adventure types."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I remember playing Temple of Doom on the NES in the 80's. If you smacked the console ""just so"", you could glitch to the last level."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-23,"Okay so, like it seems that everyone is loving this game. Would it possible to get a show of hands for support for recreating all those old games in this engine with the same voice actor. They could pump our literally 5 games minimum as DLCs and i'd pay a pretty penny for each and every one of them."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Fate of Atlantis was a major game from my childhood. I played it so many times.

Still feel bad about whipping that capybara to get it eaten by a huge snake :’("
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,You can play it still. It’s on steam.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,My 10 year old eyes memorized all 9 pixels of Sophia's body
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I remember, it would be an awesome movie!"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"When in doubt, try to use the oricalcum"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Oh lord I loved that game even though I always got stuck at one part 
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I played that AND the last crusade point and click game for hours and hours as a little kid with my older brother.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I loved that one for sure.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,With its three branching (but converging) storylines it was actually kind of ahead of its time. I would unironically love a remake - faithful to the story but with modern graphics and voice acting.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Aww, I liked Dial of Destiny. But yeah, a Fate of Atlantis movie would have been great."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,I don't think that will work
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Hearing Indy say ""The Idol of Kouru Watu"" is tattooed into my brain after dying to that damn crocodile so many times."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"screw that, it was the fuckin’ sharks that did it for me"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"*Ah, Indiana Jones!*


*If I had known what troubles you were capable of causing, I would have killed you in Prague! This time I'll finish the job myself!*

*Yes! Run! Mwhaha-haha-hahahahaha!*"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Yes that's the one, and later you end up in ancient China or something. I remember those guys in Turkey making like... probably very offensive mumbling noises when you aggro them lol"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I think so, and at the end you're in ancient China or something."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I think that was Infernal Machine. Decent game. Hasn't aged well.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I think it was on PC, and it did later have a level where you're in Constantinople or somewhere deserty but you start out in like a Tomb Raider-esque jungle area."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Yep, I played that game a ton as a kid but can never remember what it was called. You end up going to like Constantinople later and ancient China or something too."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Good God that game was so hard. I spent so many quarters on it when I was a kid.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Whoooaa!
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,lmao I'm not quite that old myself xD
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Yeah the early hand to hand combat was great.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Oh so thank god the Riddick studio isn't making this and that the Riddick *people* are.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Don't forget The Darkness. That first game was something else.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Oh Machine Games? Dude they did the new Wolfensteins which are fantastic (despite what everyone else says I enjoyed the one with the twin sisters).
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"The Starbreeze that made Riddick doesn't even really seem to exist anymore. Not even in the sense of like ""Yeah, it's been 20 years, there will be a lot of turnover"" but just the studio doesn't seem to exist or take lead on projects anymore. The last thing developed by the original Starbreeze was Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons in 2013. They bought/merged with Overkill in 2012 to get Payday and the head of Overkill was made CEO of Starbreeze as a whole a year later. 

Everything ""Starbreeze"" has made since then has been Overkill's projects, with them just renaming Overkill to ""Starbreeze Studios"" for Payday 3. I'm not sure the internal Starbreeze studio that did Riddick and Brothers has actually survived."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Follow the devs, not the studios."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,That's why we should follow talent and not studio/publisher names. For movies I get exited when there's a new Nolan movie. Couldn't even tell what studio is behind Tenet if my life depends on it
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I’ve had this in my library for a bit. Bought it on a steam sale and just haven’t gotten around to playing it. Your comment reminded me. I think I’ll boot it up tonight!
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,You really feel like Indiana
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"The author probably listed their favorites, not all."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I like Spider-Man PS4 but it's not amazing. The story is pretty nothingy until the final act when it just shoots its load out of nowhere. The combat is basically the Arkham Rhythm. And the stealth is absolute pants. Plus it's very short.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I was worried too but within 30 minutes it was obvious why the Uncharted route wouldn't have worked
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Same here. I figured it was probably pretty bad between being an Indiana Jones game and being given for free with my graphics card, but now I'm kinda excited to give it a try. Should be good fun the way things are sounding."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I got Alan Wake II free with my rig and that's and amazing game.   So, pack-in game doesn't always mean ""bad""."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Fate of Atlantis in that it's more story and detail driven. Nothing like Uncharted. Indy wouldn't work as an acrobatic fast paced third person shooter, so I'm glad they did their own thing with this"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Looking at reviews, it kinda seems like a mix of an immersive sim (like Dishonored or Deus Ex) and Hitman: World Of Assassination, but with more focus on puzzles and exploration rather than combat. Sounds like a weird mix but the reviews are very encouraging"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"It's less arcadey, if that makes any sense. It's a more cerebral game than those old games. You get rewarded more for trying to solve problems in ways other than running and gunning."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"More like a bunch of non linear sections, structured like an IJ movie where he travels around following the plot. But each location is pretty open to how you want to approach it"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I think people forget this game is made by the guys who did the newest wolfenstein series, the darkness, and chronicles of Riddick. These people have a good track record lol. Don't mistake Bethesda gamestudio for their publishing arm"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I recall Starfield opening to basically 7-8/10 reviews?
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Eh I think the Starfield hate is overblown. I enjoyed the main story and all the faction quests. Outside of that yeah it was pretty dull, but I got a solid 40-50 hours of enjoyment out of it"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Starfield has an average playtime of ~60 hours. Even people who say they don't like it are willing to spend a significant chunk of time in it.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,All the people calling Starfield trash have barely played it lol. It's not masterpiece but it's a 7-8/10 game
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Im 300h into starfield, for me is 8/10, very good, mods nail It"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Xbox needs a win so ps5 owners can anticipate an other banger in the spring.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"they are doing hella good. Hellblade, Stalker, Indiana and im sure i missed some others."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,literally coming to ps5 in the spring lol
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Sure because CoD wasn't enough.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"God, Stalker 2 could have been that winner if they didn’t rush them to drop."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,High profile but expectations for it being good were pretty low.

1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,It’s because it’s an Xbox game. That’s why they want it to be bad. Xbox isn’t supposed to have good games other systems don’t have (yes I know PS5 will get it later).
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Too often have people been dissapointed by putting expectations too high, only to be crushed by the inevitable fall.

People havr resorted to pessimism out of neccesity, but it just means with lower expectations, this game has more room to exceed them!"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Reviews are just opinions. IGN also gave Statfield a 7/10 and people using it to say Starfield is a bad game. Yet they clown IGN when they gave Veilguard 9/10.

People say reviewers should not involved political in review, but people will use reviews to prove their political opinion.  Its hypocritical"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Only one website anyone has ever heard of rated Veilguard a 9 or 10.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Why are you lying? Both [Ultima IX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_IX:_Ascension#Reception) and [Master of Orion 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Orion_III#Reception) got mediocre to poor reviews.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Even if it were 3rd person you still wouldn't be seeing his face for 90% of the game. I've never understood this point.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Ign gave Veilguard 9/10 too. Gameranx was the review i was waiting for and they said its a solid game. This will be my Christmas break addiction.

1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Sooo... Baldur's Gate 3, Elden Ring, God of War 2018, Dredge and Sea of Stars were bad games then?"

1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Ign gave Eldin Ring a 10/10 btw, not saying that they're credible, but a broken clock is right twice a day at the very least"

Not a chance. You were just one of the lucky ones. I had a top-of-the-line PC and I still experienced a number of bugs, not to mention bad mechanics and a general vibe of unfinishedness and a lack of polish.

Performance was far from the one problem the game had at launch."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Was still buggy for enough people on PC. My friend dropped it at release and hasn't gone back to it because of problems. Also they promised and lied about a lot of stuff.

I'm not saying it's a bad game but the reviews definitely felt fake, especially.because the reviewers couldn't use their own footage (which is a giant red flag.)"

Doom can be the most optimised game in recent history, but that doesn't mean Indie will run as smooth as Doom. Plus, this game has pretty harsh system requirements."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"No joke, one of like the first skills you can get in the game allows you to come back from getting knocked out by crawling over and picking up your fedora.

1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I played it on PC as a kid many times but yea. It was very hard for uncoordinated kid's hands. I played it as an adult  3 times since then and even without nostalgia glasses, it's still pretty good."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-10,They were released less than 4 years apart. At this point they're about as old.

1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Fate of Atlantis was my favorite. Would've made a killer movie too
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Those scenes where they zoomed into her necklace made my 12yo self go crazy lmao
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,There’s a suspicious number of parallels between Fate of Atlantis and Dial of Destiny…
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Yes! It took me so long to figure that one out that I almost gave up the game
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"That game scared the shit out of me as a kid. The crocodile was scary for sure knowing as soon as you jumped into the water it was barreling towards you. But I agree with you, the sharks were on another level. I was so scared to go in the water on those levels. The claustrophobic feel of the levels didn’t help either"

1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,YES! What game is that though!?! I can never remember the name.

1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Yeah these are the devs for the latest Wolfenstein games.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I wonder if eventually someone will make a script that checks the list of names behind the studio VS the games they made

So like, instead of hearing ""Blizzard / Bioware did this game so it must be good"" you will see ""No one from that era of Bioware you like is even still around, but these people made this and that"" instead"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Chronicles or Riddick until the Darkness was definitely the sweet spot for Starbreeze. But that was like 20 years ago, which is why I said they're known for Payday now."

Out of nowhere, my friend just sprints through him and turns him into most. 

I think I might just love co-op games."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I disagree, the second one was a mess that didnt know what it wanted to be. 




You could run super fast, but your low health meant you'd die if you didnt play it like a cover shooter.




They made a big deal of being able to dual wielding all your guns, but you burn through your ammo so fast and are so inaccurate that it was pointless.




And because of these two flaws you'd spend half the game searching for ammo and health. 




Its like it was developed by two different teams, one that wanted a fast paced shooter, and another who wanted a slow, cover based shooter. 




Plus the story was pretty messy as well. Whole game spent chasing after a woman that I thought we had already dealt with in TNO, all while talking about triggering a revolution, and then when the revolution finally begins the game ends. 




Huge disappointment for me after how good TNO was, seems like they just had no idea what to do after the first game."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Arkane Lyons helped with the last 2 games.

Machine Games said they were lead devs, but I think Lyons did most of the work on both."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I uninstalled just because of the sister banter. The gameplay wasnt bad from what I remember. Maybe I'll see if theres a mod to shut them up and I'll give it another go. Love this franchise.

1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Fair enough on your thoughts that it’s a bit derivative, but I wouldn’t say it’s very short. It’s longer than Asylum and City and probably a similar length to Knight. 15-20 hours for the main story on superhero title is pretty generous, imo."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I haven't really paid much attention to this game, but I'm curious, why wouldn't it work? Uncharted is like an Indiana Jones rip-off."

1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Todd Howard is the executive producer of this game. It's his brainchild, which he pitched to Lucasfilm, and he was heavily involved in production. This reflects a lot more on Bethesda than most other Zenimax stuff because Bethesda is synonymous with Todd on some level."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Yeah the biggest issue with Starfield is that they should have had 4 or 5 dense plants and like a dozen generated ones for outpost
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I got about 30 hours. And I’d say about 15 were “enjoyed,” while the other half were hoping it would get into a groove. I don’t hate it. But it’s certainly not as gripping as ES or fallout games."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"That’s the problem though. Most Bethesda games are meant for 100+ hour play sessions. I’m STILL playing Skyrim and even Fallout 4 modded to this day because there’s shit I haven’t found and the loop tends to be enjoyable. 

I didn’t get that at all in Starfield. I did some side quests and completed the main story in about 50 hours and eventually uninstalled it. I desperately wanted to like the game but it was just so dull. Absolutely no desire to go back to it. That isn’t typically considered normal for a Bethesda game."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I also think StarField is pretty good for the duration of the game a reviewer would have their hands on it before a review goes out. It's pretty cool at the start. The cracks start to show when you try to play it past that. Having good reviews, then sentiment diminishing as people start to see the flaws the game after more investment isn't some conspiracy."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I don't know about that. I have this thing, and I can't be the only one, where if I pick up a game, book, movie, whatever, I must see it through. I've played entire games that weren't my thing from start to finish because of that psychological bend.

It's getting a little better with age as I simply don't have as much time, but it mostly translates as 'I buy games that I don't play even once'. Once I start one, though, I kind of have to finish it, even if it's bad."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,"Because the game tricks you into thinking there must be something better right around the corner, some additional game mechanic to really open things up. Then it never happens and you feel like you wasted your time."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I'm one of those 60ish hours, was waiting for it to get good, as they said it takes a while, and even didn't really get going until 100hrs in... wish I could get that time and money back, lesson learned. "
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I put in 40 hours. 6.5 to 7 is where I would put it. Better than Veilguard though fwiw.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"They’ve barely played it because to a lot of people it’s the most boring game Bethesda has ever released. It’s a space errand fast travel simulator, written at a third-grade level.

I’m glad you had fun, but you don’t speak for everyone. To me, Starfield was a massive letdown in every sense of the word."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Taken on it's own merits, it's a solid 6. But thats all it is. When compared to skyrim or anything else bethesda has done in the past it's a 4. They broke the central loop of their games with their fast travel crap. 

It was such a disappointment."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I haven’t revisited the game since beating it the first time before mods were available, do you have any favorites you’d recommend?"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Black Ops, Avowed in Feb"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Stalker is not their game it's a 3 month moneyhat.

Hellblade had decent critical success but sold horribly. It also kinda just came and went in the gaming sphere. That's probably what they mean about needing a win."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"The fact that an Xbox studio has a banger is what they needed. It’s cool that it’s coming to PlayStation as well, but as an Xbox fan it’s nice to finally get some faith in these studios again.

Just because another group or fan base gets to enjoy it, that doesn’t take away its impact to the studio. If you stop looking at things in a them vs us lens, the truth of the matter is a good game we all get to play is an even bigger win than a good exclusive."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,It's going to be wild if they announce a PSVR2 version next year.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,That's because Xbox need cash too and fast. The executives at Microsoft are asking where their money is after those acquisitions.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Yup I'm waiting for that version.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,for $70
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"So? I never got the point of exclusives. It benefits the system owner not the consumer.  The more the merrier.
Gamepass, and freedom where to play is the point of Xbox, and this game hammers it in."

1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Game released in a not good state but I wouldn’t call it “rushed to drop” game delayed like 2 years.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,The game was delayed multiple times...
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Was it? The expectations that I saw were quietly optimistic. Different circles I guess.

1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,">People say reviewers should not involved political in review, but people will use reviews to prove their political opinion. Its hypocritical

Game journalists should keep themselves to higher standard than randos on the internet.

Those sites were followed for years by gamers, but their biases made some people search reviews online, and we live in an era when you choose a camp (love or hate something). Very rarely, anyone can be truly critical with their reviews.

You can't deny that some reviews were just overblown with high praise (like Veilguard) when the game was just mid at best. It didn't deserve 9/10 at all.

IGN is famous for their 7/10 for a reason."

It is fine that some liked the Veilguard and I am happy for them but the game is definitely not a 10/10."

Edit: make it 20 or 100 times they got it right and its still an atrocious percentage. Heres a list of best games reviewed in 2024 to get an idea of what gets a 7-9 nowadays. They are the joke that everyone says they are...https://www.ign.com/playlist/igneditorial/lists/best-reviewed-games-2024"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Well, no, you should.


The correct way to use reviews is to find a few reviewers with whom you share a similar taste in games. 99% of reviews are going to be useless to you. 


A review is just an opinion, and you should know who the opinion belongs to before you base any decisions on them."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,What a meaningless thing to say

1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,"There have been multiple good games, one or two great, and maybe half mid or worse. But it is a far better variety than Sony which means you never feel like you're playing the same game."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Yeah the bugs kinda hide the underbaked features as people are too focus on the bugs and glitches.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I didn’t pay any mind to anything pre launch so I wasn’t let down by the hype train. 

If you were expecting something more based off of pre release trailers etc, then were delivered less, then I understand being disappointed. 

Fortunately I played it in a bubble and it was fantastic lol"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,And they are still gone and people love it since none of the patches added anything important. Top voted post on thier reddit is a list listing why this game terrible and bugs are least of its problem. EVERYTHING from that is still in the game.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I had a couple bugs too- t posing and such. Didn’t get anything game breaking. Like you, I played on a high end PC. 

Still enjoyed the shit out of it lol Was easily a 9/10 for me

I didn’t follow any hype for it beforehand so I wasn’t let down by CDPR promises and stuff.

Still play on the same save to this day"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Not lying, was my second favorite game that year. Put about 70 hours into it in the first month. Currently have about 400 hours in on that original save.

The game was really good- what I think killed it for a lot of people was the hype train. I went into it with zero hype, I didn’t follow the pre release cycle at all. I just wanted something to play and it looked cool lol

I also didn’t have any game breaking bugs, though I understand some maybe did. All of the bugs I experienced were visual like t posing and texture pop in."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I put in 10 hours, wouldnt call it good or bad, just mega boring."

1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"From everything I’ve heard, this seems like a really good 2 beers and 2-hours a night kinda game.

So the 87 is kind of interesting, as those games usually land around 75, but maybe the nostalgia of a good adventure game skin slapped on top of Skyrim & name recognition gets those extra points."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Those nazi flamethrower troops scared the shit out of me as a kid
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I played it a lot as a kid.  It and Sierra games and an obscure dungeon crawler called Don't Go Alone were the PC games I had.

Some other things: It's totally possible to miss the two places in the game where you get a hint about the grail, leaving you with no clue which grail is the real one, and since you can't save in the grail cave...  Oh, and one of those serves as copy protection - the hint in the catacombs says that one of two descriptions from the print grail diary that came with the game is correct.  It will always pick one that glows and one that doesn't, the second hint is in the castle, a painting indicating whether or not the grail glows to narrow it down.  Hope you took notes and have the booklet!

You don't ever have to do a real fistfight, at all.  You only ever technically need to even know the fist fighting controls in one place.

Every single guard in the castle can be bypassed nonviolently by some combination of using the right dialog and wearing the right disguise.  I guess that's not quite true - you do have to punch the big guy, but you can get him super drunk and he'll go down in one punch without fighting back so I'm not sure that counts.  I don't remember all the ""right"" dialog for them offhand, but back then I took notes.

When you get captured, you can hand over either the real grail diary or another optional old book you may have picked up.  If you hand over the grail diary, then you have to go steal it back, during which you can encounter Hitler and can have him sign something for you - either Mein Kampf or the travel pass.  If you hand over the fake, you skip that section entirely and go straight to the airfield.

The blimp is probably harder than the plane, presuming you can do the plane launching sequence fast enough.

There are a set number of roadblocks and they happen in a set order.  There's a way to talk your way out of each, and each is different.  Or you can fight your way through.  Or you can present the travel pass if you got it signed to be allowed through because you have your papers signed by the Fuhrer himself.

How long you stay in the air in the plane determines which roadblock you start at in the order, and there are some minor tells to help you figure out which one it is.  I don't know if you can fly past all of them - I was terrible at the minigame and pretty much always had to do all of them or all but the first.  Once I skipped the first two, but that was my best flight.

All my time playing Sierra games made me weirdly anal about mapping out every detail to everything, just in case.  Just don't ask me how many times I managed to be a dead man walking in Sierra games, often for bullshit reasons.  Which is the answer to how I remember all that from way back then.

I also had a NES and eventually an SNES but didn't get a newer PC until the late 90s - literally from an Epson with a 32MB hard disk and 3.5"" double density floppy drive to a Packard Bell with a CD drive and a Pentium chip.  Had the best game rental store nearby though that had all kinds of weird, obscure NES games.  They did 4 games at a time for a night instead of one game for a bunch of nights like Blockbuster as their base rate, and didn't take returns on Sundays.  So we'd go and I'd get two games I knew I'd like, one that sounded like something I might like, and whatever the weirdest game I could find that I hadn't played yet was.  That's how I got to try Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom, for example - which is actually a decent point and click in the same general vein as the NES ports of the Macventure games."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Except for all the good bits.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"same with the kraken fight, too"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Indiana Jones and the Emperor’s Tomb. The mission you’re thinking of is Von Beck’s Revenge
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Complete with supernatural terracotta soldiers
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Never knew they were the same guys behind the old Riddick game. No wonder the new Wolfenstein games are good
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Of course, they are good at making videogames staring a badass character known for beating up nazis"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Haha I get what you're meaning, I just always plug The Darkness whenever I can, fantastic game. 

Also, didn't the 'good' crowd leave after Syndicate? I remember enjoying that one."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"It’s been a few years but I can’t disagree more on Wolfenstein 2, at least regarding the gameplay. The dual wielding was super fun and I absolutely never had to play it as a cover shooter. I loved how much more aggressive you could play it compared to the first one.

also the soundtrack slapped"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Agree. Loved New Order and Old Blood. New Colossus just didn't grab me. Repeating levels, lots of downtime, the annoying submarine base where you had to catch a stupid pig and get lost all the time. Performance was ass compared to the previous games, and gameplay was weird. Even the story felt rather flat, despite its shock value. It's certainly not a terrible game, but I dunno. Then Youngblood came around and I've still not played that. They still want 5 bucks for this piece of garbage when it's on sale, and nothing I've seen makes me want to play it. If anything, they should pay ME to play it."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Arkane Lyons only helped with some level design for Wolfenstein Youngblood and Cyberpilot. They were too busy working on Deathloop to do ""most of the work"".

Machine Games have been the big lead devs of Wolfenstein since New Blood, I'm not surprised their latest game is also about punching Nazis."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Perfection 👌
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Those numbers aren't right though. I got the platinum for Spider-Man in 20ish hours. That was me doing everything as it came up before the next story mission. I don't think it'd take more than 10 hours to do the story alone and it'd only take that long if you struggled with some of the gameplay elements.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Uncharted has a fast paced acrobatic run and gun style that really isn't Indiana Jones' vibe. They could've done it and probably would've been easier, but wouldnt feel as authentic to the franchise"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Uncharted is a cover shooter with Prince of Persia style climbing and a STORY that could also happen in the Indiana Jones universe, just a bit more out there. The classic Indy movies are all about treasures that belong in museums, mostly grounded in reality. With Nazis, death cults, and dad, etc. ;)  
  
Let's not talk about the Crystal Skull and Dial of Destiny.  
  
Tomb Raider and Uncharted copied these themes to an extent, but in Indiana Jones it was never about shooting hundreds of people and saving the world from a terrible supernatural evil. Indy isn't a ""rock climber"", either.  
  
Instead they pretty much nailed what his character is about: fisty-cuffs, whip, some light parcours, lots of puzzle solving by taking notes, talking with other people, etc., and his hat. And probably a lady or two.  
  
If there was an Indiana Jones game like Tomb Raider or Uncharted ... it wouldn't really work."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Todd has been an avid Indiana Jones fan for decades now.

In the ""making of"" video for Fallout 3, you can see a golden idol replica on his desk next to a photo of his family. Those are the only two things on the desk."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,He was not heavily involved in production lmao this came out a year after Starfield which was where 99% of his attention was since it was his dream game. Anything to knock down Bethesda and Microsoft devs man…
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I agree, the scale was way too wide. Like you said, a handful of handmade planets would be much better than a thousand procedurally generated ones."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Yeah I agree that would've made more sense.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,And it's incredible to me they didn't realize this at any point in development
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"If you played a game you didn’t enjoy for 100 hours, that’s on you man"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"People here apparently really don't understand how much time someone is willing to put in a game if they really want that game to be good. Especially when you expect to put 100s of hours into it. I played Skyrim for over 1000 hours and F4 for 700 and still play skyrim from time to time. Meanwhile I put 70 hours into starfield and just couldn't get myself to start it again. There are simply too many gamedesign choices that feel like a slap in your face, both quest- and gameplaywise, that I really don't understand how people can defend this game. Maybe if you just play the main quest and the main side quests, it's fine, but if you try to do literally anything else it's just shit."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Idk i have like 300 mods changing a lot of things i didnt like or need improvements, there is some free mission mods very good too"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I have a permanent 3/4 chub for Avowed. Obsidian won't let me down.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Hellblade 2 definitely fell short of the first one. But it's an 8 to 10 hour narrative game on Game pass. I don't think it was ever gonna sell well.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Honestly as a PlayStation user I’d prefer a competitive market to keep Sony from getting complacent
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,"I'm playing it now; it would be a perfect VR game, honestly."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Yes, the game is releasing on PS to fund you continuing to get games for your subscription lol"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"But imagine if they realized all the promises they had! Functional A-Life, more mutants, mutant part seller, and more. I understand why they couldn’t due to the war, but I am disappointed nonetheless. Great game still."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Different Great Circles*
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Yeah, I’ve seen nothing but praise for this game over the past 3 months... I don’t know where people were seeing these “low expectations”"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I mean, I didn't *hate* it, but as a longtime fan I also recognize that it was seriously mediocre compared to how much potential it had. An 8/10 is being generous."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Did you buy Veilguard?
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Do you honestly think the comment i replied to is representive of objective reality? Or is it just a tired circlejerk? Yeah IGN is not amazing. Their scoring system kinda sucks. But to say whenever they give a high score the game is almost destined to suck, is just really fucking stupid. It's like they never read a single review, only saw a few screenshots of silly scores and decided right, that seems like a good sample size to judge a site that's reviewed thousands and thousands of games."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"For real, never in my life saw people defending IGN, let alone give any fuck about reviews from those kinds of websites, since they literally all suck or get paid and suck."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I mean their video game review so far has been fair though.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,You seriously think I'm going spend my time listing all their game score?
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Taste in video games is different from taste in political ideologies. I have no issue looking at someone's review history and determining if they like the same style of games as I do and then applying that knowledge in my interpretation of a review. 


What I don't want to have to do is determine if they're giving it praise or crapping on it because the developers did or didn't put enough minorities in a game."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06, Not an argument. 
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,we don't have to pay artistic tax
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,Still more than I can say for Xbox since everything they have released this year has been incredible forgettable lmao
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Didn’t sony totally fuck up helldivers lol
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Spiderman and stellar blade are pretty bad games but the rest are really good that you mentioned
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Yeah i watched it all and was disappointed. Got banned from the cyberpunk sub because of my disappointment haha. I enjoyed the game. Wish I just didn't play it til the DLC came out with all the combined patches.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I'm sitting on 600 from my original save. If you didn't follow the pre-release, then you skipped a lot of the bs that was fed to consumers. There's entire video essays on that stuff all over the internet with sources, and they've been there for years."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Awesome!  Thank you!  Have an upvote!
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Oh! I'm on Xbox, it's out on the 9th"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-10,28 hours in. A 9.5 game for me. Sp perfectly Indy Jones and every bit as good as a Tomb Raider or Uncharted.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I had repressed the kraken fight. Thank you
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,And that weird Homunculus Mutant thing from the Prague
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Pretty sure these guys made The Darkness as well which was a really rad game back in the day.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"They also did the underrated Syndicate reboot, though it should have gone with a different name."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Was just about to say. 

I'm noticing a Nazi punching theme here..."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Idk, I haven't played any of their output after The Darkness. But Brothers: a Tale of 2 Sons was pretty well regarded as I recall. But it looks like Starbreeze was founded right after Dark Athena, so I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of the staff jumped ship at that time or shortly thereafter."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"It’s not always bang-on, but HowLongToBeat has main story at 17 and completionist at 35 hours. [Have a look](https://howlongtobeat.com/game/44852)."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Thanks for the response, I appreciate it."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,">but in Indiana Jones it was never about shooting hundreds of people and saving the world from a terrible supernatural evil.

I'm not sure you have watched the original trilogy. I'll give you Dr. Jones doesn't just rack up a body count ala Rambo but he kills people in every film. But more importantly every move has supernatural/occult at the core. 

In Raiders they open the ark of the covenant and we see a mystical army of spirits kill Nazis.

In Temple of Doom the center piece is a death cult sacrificing humans to Kali and searching for mystical Hindu stones.

In Last Crusade we get the Holy Grail, which actually grants everlasting life and immortal crusader."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Well isn't it obvious? Clearly Todd stole the golden idol and has pissed off some long lost tribe, who in return kidnapped his family. They sent him a picture of his family.

He now spends most of his time hovering over his desk, arms out, fingers ready to grab either, but hopefully both the picture and the idol at the same time, in an attempt to thwart the tribal king.

I thought it was obvious."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Todd Howard came up with the game in the first place and pitched it. Machine Games themselves have said Todd was very involved and was an invaluable asset to the development 

I think I'll take Machine Games' word over yours"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Skyrim had the same issues. Scale wise it was huge but it really lacked depth in a lot of areas
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I'm sure they did but at a certain point you can't go back once so much work has been done.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Bro eats all but one bite of the burger and then complains to the staff about it
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,That’s the right attitude. An effective monopoly doesn’t help anyone
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,i ain’t complaining lol
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,The stealth system is also completely busted and I think it holds it back so much. I'm just waiting for more patches to come out but goddamn is the core obviously incredible.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"So funnily enough my girlfriend is the dragon age fan and she hated DAV and stopped after the first major “decision”. I ended up playing it as a warrior. I did like how the combat felt like Arkham Batman meets a less fluid Devil May Cry. Some nice story moments. Scratched my Mass Effect itch. I had fun and did every quest. 

I had issues with some aspects of the plot, pacing (I think that just restructuring the existing story beats would solve most problems), the fact that it feels more like Dragon Age 5 than 4, and the disconnect between the art style and story. Weirdly enough, I really felt like the story had a lot of missed potential, especially as my girlfriend filled me in on some lore. 

I honestly don’t know what I would rate it. I was and still am really harsh on the train wreck that was ME Andromeda so DAV is a positive step. Outside of some minor clipping, I didn’t have any bugs. I think the story suffered from a long development cycle and the game reminded me of Kingdom Hearts more than anything."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Some people care and some people don't. And it's easy enough to know who is who. That's just the reality we live in. And it is good that reviews that address these things exist for people who care.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Everyone know Sony is great when it comes to exclusives. Y'all just embarrassing yourself
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Lol no. Arrowhead revealed that Helldivers 2 reached 15 million players as of a week ago
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Yes a game with 10m sales is a disaster.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Delusional to think 11+ million sales and a 90 on metacritic is bad lol
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I played it for the first time last year and hadn't heard much about it before I started.

Was blown away, one of the top 3 games I've ever played."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I don’t know why they do that. It’s hella confusing.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I remember that game it was sick!!!
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I've wanted a remake of The Darkness for years, those games were awesome! The ""weird FPS"" genre has been dormant for too long."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Man, I remember just staring at the TV in awe that I was watching an actual, full TV show inside of the game I was playing. What a stupid, completely unnecessary thing to add to a video game that was also insanely cool. I feel like back then we really saw devs go out on a limb and add things to games much more often that made the games so much more fun to interact with. Mowing down bushes with a machine gun in far cry 2, booting someone in slow motion in f.e.a.r., running a tank into a building and laugh as a sniper that was annoying you gets tossed in the rubble in bad company 2, seeing how far you could tunnel in red faction, the first time we could actually swing from buildings in Spiderman (and it still felt more rewarding than even the newest Spiderman games. Sorry, but I barely feel in control when I'm swinging, and I love the new ones).

Rarely do we see that type of innovation anymore in big budget games. Indies, sure, but it's one of the reasons why games like red dead 2 and botw did so insanely well. When you play those games, you find moments where you just feel the fun that developer was having when they made it. Like you're there at the water cooler with them, going ""dude, I put in this guy, in the big city, that just walks around asking people if they've seen Gavin."" ""Who tf is Gavin?"" ""NO ONE WILL KNOW!""

When bungie was just a small group, they had a bunch of X boxes in a room and would do LAN parties multiple times a week and drink. Then they go and launch a game that's held up with the greatest shooters of all time. I miss that shit."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Wait there was a syndicate reboot? How did I miss that! Was it in any way close to the original or did they go in a completely new direction?
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"This is possibly the first and only time I've seen syndicate mentioned. Brink, bulletstorm, and syndicate were the bees knees back then."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Brothers was a Fares game, he started his own studio under EA after that. Making A way out, It takes two etc"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"But I think his point is that typically the Indiana Jones world is one where magic doesn't exist until it does, which is usually via the end-game mythical object they seek.  We don't really consider the Indy world as a magical world, it's essentially our world, except Indiana Jones uncovers the long hidden ancient magic that we don't know about.  

It's like how every X-Files episode starts with Mulder telling Scully about some fictional thing it COULD BE and she's like, ""That's crazy, that isn't real"" and then by the end of the episode it's almost certainly real.  

Unlike something like Lord of the Rings, where it's obvious that magic and shit exists right from the jump because a Wizard shows up to the Hobbit BBQ."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,The tribe will free them as soon as ES6 is out. So they're fucked.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,"Yeah, I only have one friend I know who is into Dragon Age, and she was really looking forward to Veilgard all year, but was ultimately disappointed by it.

Main points:

Graphics were pretty. Gameplay was fun. Story was disappointing and unfaithful to the source material."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"You should go back and try Andromeda again if you haven't yet. It's actually a pretty good game, now that it's patched and so far removed from the anti-hype."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"By not knowing all that much about the history of DA, you put yourself in a position to enjoy what you got a lot more.  Dragon Age is a much darker, grittier franchise that what DAV is.  It's supposed to have far more player choice, more along the lines of BG3.  If you judge Veilguard in a vacuum and ignore the previous games, yeah it's fine... But you can't just do that.  Those games set expectations.

Imagine if Gears of War got a new sequel and they took out the chainsaw and bayonet lancer because it's too gory.  Imagine they decided to remove instagib shotgun effects.  The gore gotta go, we're trying to appeal to a wider audience!  Well great, but that's a critical part of what makes it a Gears game so... We drop the score.  Then they change it so it's no longer a linear third person action shooter, now it's an open world third person adventure!  Again, what the fuck, this isn't Gears, nobody asked for this.  Drop the score.  It doesn't matter if the game is good when judged by itself, it doesn't matter if the story is solid, it's not Gears and it's insulting to put the Gears name on it. 

This is what happened to DA.  It doesn't matter if the game is good, it's taken a giant shit all over what Dragon Age is."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Imagine if the large majority of reviewers docked marks if there wasn't enough overt christian themes and detracted marks for the lack of them, and associated religious elements. You can of course look carefully and pick out a handful of people that don't do this, but by and large most reviews will have this morality dictating at least a few points of score and shape the overall tone of the review. 


This is what it feels like right now and has felt like for a while. If it was just a handful it wouldn't even be worth mentioning. "
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I mean the whole psn account thing was a total disaster, straight up terrible decision making there to shit on the players"
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,It's absolutely a banger of a game! I think I'm up to an absurd 3000+ pics. I've basically have my whole journey photographed lol
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,It's janky but it holds up imo
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Yep I say the same thing.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Me and some friends left the game running staring at that little tv in the subway playing metal music videos for ages as background weed smoking entertainment.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,[Completely new direction](https://youtu.be/H4qzWFyjtJg) and the OG creators of the franchise disowned it.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I absolutely love this explanation and it also largely explains what's wrong with Crystal Skull and Dial of Destiny. People are doing unbelievable things or have unbelievable skills long before the climax.
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I did just play a modded version on PC actually! It was better than when I played it on console when it came out. I do think that the idea of a new galaxy was the best way forward after the trilogy. But the writing and some the characters are most of my gripes. It’s about a 7/10 for me. There are parts I like a lot. Some good changes to combat. Some changes I did not care for. I’d still say it’s worth playing for fans of the trilogy. 

I’d give DAV a solid 8/10. I liked all the characters, I LOVED Neve and Emmrich, some story beats were excellent while some needed some work, and I found the art style distracting."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,">Imagine if the large majority of reviewers docked marks if there wasn't enough overt christian themes and detracted marks for the lack of them, and associated religious elements

Nothing would change for me, buddy. Why would I care about what they have to say?


And why are you even LOOKING at the scores? It's like school has traumatized you into thinking grade matters. It's all about the actual content, baby."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"That's awesome my Choomie

I'm looking forward to another playthrough.  My PC is pretty mid and didn't run the game too well, so I want to either upgrade my PC or get a SteamDeck and give it another run."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Aw, that's too bad. I've been waiting for a game to scratch that itch."
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"> Nothing would change for me, buddy. Why would I care about what they have to say


Uh huh.


The scores are usually a reflection of the content. They often go hand in hand. "
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,the old devs released a game called Satellite Reign around the same time and it has a lot of the same feel :)
1h7oc17,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"No, scores are completely useless. It's just an opinion, scores don't tell you anything about the actual game that you should give any value to. 


Ratings are only there because people are lazy and don't care enough to actually have an opinion of their own. You don't need to be one of those people. Don't look at the rating."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"I was pleasantly surprised by the lack of loading screens. 

The Vatican just kept getting bigger, and bigger, and more intricate, but even the fast travel points only have like a 200ms fade to black and you're off again.

This is what Starfield should have felt like."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"And they are right. It's hard to explain, but there is so much intricate attention to detail in this game that makes it such a unique enjoyable experience.  It really feels like you can explore and be Indiana Jones in a way I've never experienced in a similar game like Tomb Raider or Uncharted. I also love how much of the game's interface is diegetic like pulling out a physical map which makes it feel really immersive. And it helps that there is so much polish in this game with how buggy most AAA games are at launch these days.

One of my favorite details of the game is when you boot up your game your start screen will show Indiana Jones hanging out and when you hit start game it will immediately zoom in on where Indiana is without a loading screen and get you right into the action."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,How rare is a late release like winning?
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"100% with IGN on this, which is a rare thing. But yeah if you want to play as Indiana Jones, solve some puzzles and punch fascist while having a blast then give this game a go. You'd be surprised."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"I’m almost 100% done, and it’s been great. There’s so much to do, but it’s not exceedingly tedious like most games with a bunch of collectibles. They hit a perfect middle ground. Probably at the bottom of the my Top 5 gaming experiences this year."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"It really felt like I was playing the movies! Amazing graphics and set pieces, and the sound design is out of this world. The music is also very on point. I really didn't expect an Indiana Jones game to be one of the best this year, but here we are."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,When I was 10 years old I saved up all the money I had to have my parents take me to go buy the Trilogy on VHS. I treasured those movies till DVDs came out. I will cherish this game for a long time. Brings back so many memories.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Not many to choose from
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"This was one of those games that I had low expectations for. Even if they nailed the story, characters, vibe, etc., would it be fun to actually play? Would the gameplay be good? As much as I loved Wolfenstein the New Order and New Colossus, Youngblood was bad enough that I was concerned for developer Machinegames' future work. I can safely say I was wrong to doubt them."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"id Tech graphic engine + Path Tracing + HDR on PC = holy shit. I'm loving the game.

The current Call of Duty engine IW 9.0 originally came from id Tech and now both engines are Owned* by Microsoft."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"I don't normally like puzzle games but this one I can't stop playing, great open worlds, a great storyline, great voice acting"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Deservedly so. Just an enjoyable Indy adventure that is respectful of the source material in every possible way.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Man, I wish I didn't get nauseated playing this. made it out of the college and just had to put the game down. Was really enjoying it until that point. Don't get old, kids."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,Huge Fan of Indiana Jones Movies 1-3 And the Game really surprised me how faithful is to the Original the cutscenes could be 1 to 1 from a Movie.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,Well deserved. Hopefully Machine Games will make trilogy of these Indy games with similar or better quality going forward.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Damn that’s a lot of Indy related posts.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Snarky comments aside, it actually is a really great game. I'm currently in the ""I'm going to a 100% this thing"" phase. Just gotta find all the secrets now."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Really happy they didn’t just go the uncharted\tomb raider clone path which would have been way more obvious. Puzzles, writing and performances are so damn good."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,I like it.  The puzzles are fun.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,I’d strongly argue it is the game of the year.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"I'm enjoying it quite a bit. 

It's wonderful counter-programming to everything else that's out there. It's bold and confident enough to do its own thing and it's just a completely refreshing gameplay experience."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Do you know how rare it is for a game based on a movie to be successful? Last time I can think of that happened was Alien: Isolation.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Fabulous game!  First game in a long time I got 100% on. Did it in one play through as well. I would buy another if they made one. The voice acting was perfect and the movie references and jokes were perfect.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,"It’s one of my favorite games of the year. I went in looking for a classic Indiana Jones adventure and, after 35 hours, left getting exactly that. It’s got some technical issues, the puzzles are super simple and the AI is dumb as bricks, but charm can go a long way to mitigate some of those issues, especially when you’re beating a Nazi to death with a plunger."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,"So far, I've only heard positives about it."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,Not a bad choice
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-21,"When you say a true adventure game, this is a true adventure game. It was so fun knocking out nazis and throwing mundane stuff at them and clearing out an entire camp with just the fists because you stole a bottle of medicine. The VA, the humor, Gina and the amazing Voss. Absolute GOTY."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Such a fantastic game, one of the best movie tied in games I’ve ever played. So detailed and fun I am still impressed by it."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Deserved. Just got to the fighting scene in Gizeh and laughed my ass off. Peak Indiana Jones here. Takes me back to the time where the Indiana movies were still great. :)
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,What was the competition?
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,PS5 guy here looking forward to playing it in a few months
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Not like it had much competition.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,I appreciated the graphics and overall polish but the gameplay was pretty dull. It felt too cookie cutter. But I’m glad other people are enjoying it.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,It looks damn fun and I'm absolutely interested in it.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,I mean it’s not like the competition was all that great for best Xbox game this year lmao
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Wait this game is actually good? What the hell??
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Great, because it is just fantastic, although I am not yet done with the game. It is in my top 5 gaming experiences ever for sure (Maybe with Baldur's Gate 3, Alan Wake 2, RDR2, CoD1)."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,I'm still only a few hours in. This month is a tough one to find time to game. I'm loving it so far though.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,i would  get this but recommended specs rtx 3080ti?!?!
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"With the state of IGN reviews lately, I can't say they mean much to many people anymore."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Better than Helldivers 2?
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Will this be out for ps5?
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,I’m afraid to ask…is this ever coming to PS5?  I need to play this game but I don’t really want to buy another console at the moment.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,And if it was exclusive for xbox/pc it would get IGN 7/10 for sure.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,I’d just love it if I could play for more than 10 minutes without the game crashing out to desktop.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Tekken 8, Granblue Fantasy Versus Rising and Indy are my favorite games of the year. 

It was a great year for fighting games, but Indy is my non-fighter GOTY."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"I’m waiting for this on PS5. Really wanted to play it on break, but I think it’s March?"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Having seen the films as a child I have really enjoyed the game. From the moment the game begins, it’s clear that the devs aimed to honor the legacy of the iconic character while introducing new dynamics that make this game feel relevant."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Tbh not surprised but glad they got a good game out too bad it missed the cut off date for games awards. Looking forward to when this comes to PlayStation
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Probably of the last 5 years
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,They also pre release gave redfall a glowing review. If you trust anything from ign you're as dumb as the reviewers they employ.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,What do we think the odds are they let this game come to PS5 after a year or two?
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,"It's $70+, so I will sail"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,"I really tried to like it, but man, the first-person perspective just does not work for me, and despite what everyone else is saying, I don't think it is a good looking game.

I think first-person in games feels generally unfun and restrictive, but it feels especially bad in this one. (I know I'm basically alone on this). 

I couldn't find anything to like about the experience and I'm feeling pretty sour about it.

I'm glad I got it on game pass and didn't pay for it. Happy other people seem to be enjoying it."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,"Who cares, IGN is rotten at it's core"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,The rare Xbox Game Studios win and they release it just in time to completely miss the game awards.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,Yeah it's fun and surprisingly funny. I don't think a game has intentionally made me chuckle or laugh in... Forever?
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,"Yes I think this game would’ve been game of the year. I wasn’t looking forward to it at all and wouldn’t have played it if it wasn’t on Gamepass and if the reviews hadn’t been good. But in a year when I haven’t been interested in many of the games that have come out, this was a breath of fresh air. Fantastic game"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,"This game is phenomenal.

It feels like an old school adventure/exploration game, with modern graphics and audio.  The game is large and immersive without becoming tedious."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,Does this game get harder and more complex later on? It's been a total joke so far where you just knock out or kill any enemies with all the grabbable objects that are lying around. AIs are stupid as fck so there's zero challenge in wiping out the map.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,"Huh, been sitting on my HD since launch and haven't touched it.  Gonna have to try it out tonight"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-21,I’m playing on PC and honestly it might be my game of the year. It’s such a breath of fresh air.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-21,I’m having a blast with this game. I just wish it hadn’t suddenly taken me out of the Vatican because I had a bunch of stuff left to find. Now I need to make sure I complete Gizeh
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-21,I haven’t played or heard much about it but the idea of a game that just came out a few days ago it feels winning an award like that is pretty interesting. Very unfortunate release timing for a game to win awards
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-22,Haven’t played it yet but may have to check it out now
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-29,So you’re saying I should install this game tonight and dive in?
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-31,"I legit don’t understand the unanimous critical and public praise. I had to force myself to finish it in the hopes that I’d finally understand. It’s got very high highs but too many lows. Outside of brilliant cutscenes, the open zone gameplay was so inconsistent. The stealth genre is one of my favorites, so my biggest complaint is how heavily it relies on a stealth system that, between daft AI and terrible combat encounters simply doesn’t work. If it were primarily linear sequences followed by treasure hunts, it’d worked better for me. It’s also being praised for its visuals, but on XSX the lighting issues and pop-in frequently break immersion.

Help me understand!"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Looks really fun and seems to harken back to a golden period around the 360 age of simple, fun games. Don’t have an Xbox but really looking forward to when it eventually drops on ps5 later on"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,What other Xbox games released this year? Lol
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,They're right but like...that's an insanely low bar. They had virtually no real competition lol.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"..... Really? It's a good game, but not what I'd call the best of the whole year."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,That’s not saying much
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Wish it worked on mine :( screen is all purple. Only game it happens to as well, strangest damned thing"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Tried playing it again after the update to see if it fixed shutting my X down every 10 minutes…it fixed it because now it shuts it off every 15 minutes.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"I feel like this game has been way over praised. It's still a good game, i finished it and did a lot of side stuff but it's not without it's issues that seem to be overlooked.

Everyone keeps praising it for being an authentic indiana jones experience but there's a whole section that I felt was not very indiana jones and rather just generic action game, as well as a boss/section that just felt very generic adventure game and more like a tomb raider thing. It doesn't ruin the whole game but for these 2 parts really took me out of the experience.

The big action set pieces don't flow well either and suffer from being first person as it isn't always clear where to go.

On the topic of first person, the zoom out to 3rd person was jarring especially when you were doing several things in a row that would trigger it. As someone who initially was against the game being first person, I ended up really enjoying it and seeing the benefit and wish they had just committed to first person rather than cutting to third.

The stealth is basic and too easy because the AI is dumb as bricks. It fulfils the need but just barely.

It starts great in the Vatican and every section after that just gets weaker and weaker as the game progresses with the finale being the low point especially the last part of the boss fight."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Hellblade 2 was disappointing, Dungeon of Hindenburg is more of a hidden gem, Black Ops 6 is a nice return to form but still just another CoD in a long list of them, Stalker 2 was buggy as hell, Flight Sim is niche and had a bad launch, and so Indiana Jones was the clear frontrunner."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,not dissing on the Indiana Jones game cause I think it was brilliant but were there no other good Xbox Games released this year?
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"I remember seeing the first gameplay trailerfor this shown last year (probably around the time of The Game Awards itself) and my God, you could tell back then even when the game was in Alpha it still looked and felt amazing. Can't believe we had to wait a full year before getting to play it but it finally feels worth the wait (but not the AUD$175 Ultimate Edition price point)."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,How is this the best? The combat and AI is some of the worst ive seen.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Can’t wait to try this XBox game of the year on my Playstation this spring.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Wow that's sad. Not a good year for Xbox.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"The game didn't even work for me, attempting to rebind controls made the game freeze, and the first QTE never executed correctly, so I literally couldnt play past the first 2 mins or so, it just froze every time"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"I'm glad the game is good but I'm sooooooo done with hearing about this game. It's everywhere. Ads, posts, articles, I can't"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,"great game and well deserved . Xbox released so many banger exclusives this year , the competition must have been very tough"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Wait, they didn't give it to Dragon Age The Veilguard??? /s"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,best xbox game out of... all... 2 of them? when did senua come out
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Hmm...IGN kinda lost it's validity during the Wukong fuckery...I don't think it can ever recover from that...and the 7's and mismatching scores with rest of the industry...
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Im sorry i dont have an xbox
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,IGN awards are as popular as church.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,Do we care?  Have we moved on from the fact that game reviews are bought and paid for and their magazines are filled with ads right next to the review of the products?
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,It’ll be game of the year next year when it’s released on ps5
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Albeit a timed exclusive, Xbox really needed a win. It’s good to see."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,lol a game that came out with 22 days left in the year.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Didn't this just come out? I call bs on this one.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Lol, of course it is. One of the most useles publications on the internet."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Isn't it the only Xbox game to release this year? I really can't remember their lineup
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"A few days ago I was complaining about not having good enough ray tracing games in all these years. In the best cases it's just an eye candy good enough for paying the performance toll, but this Indy game is the very first in which ray tracing makes the game funnier to play."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"How is your feeling of combat? For me it’s awful. No silent assassination, you can sneak up on somebody, throw a powerful swing in back of a head with a hammer do not much harm, guy has no helmet and can easily take 4 powerful hits with a hammer to the head. Same with headshots. They can survive 3 shots straight in the head already after helmet is knocked off."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,Not many competitors always helps.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,Just wish it was 3rd person
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,I absolutely loved every minute of this game (granted some puzzles were a bit of a head scratcher and i had to come back to them the next day) but all in all I think I can safely say this deserves to be up there with the all time greats
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-21,Playing with a 2060 and r5 3600 and haven’t been able to get consistent 60 fps on low settings….kinda surprising.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Did they even release any other games this year?
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Interesting how the games that win this tend to be games released in the last 2 months of the year
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,[deleted]
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Rough year for Xbox?
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,Not like there was much competition to be fair
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,I really wish I could block anything across the internet that discusses IGN in any capacity.  IGN is a meme at best. Fucking trash site- always has been.

1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Not much choice, really"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Not like they have much choices, Xbox sucks"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Like winning gold at the special Olympics
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,"I've disabled the intro videos on PC with a Steam launch command, and OH MY GOD the game just launches into main menu after clicking play with such speed. And the main menu is basically just your currently saved location on the world so the game is already loaded.

Even travelling between different maps that take place in different parts of the world is instantaneous.

That aside, the game just flows so well, it's almost a masterpiece. Definitely deserves to be called game of the year. The Metacritic score for it should be way higher. I think maybe some people expected more action from it and feel underwhelmed. but for me it's almost 10/10 and I only have minor complains"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,"
>This is what Starfield should have felt like.


You'll never get a similar experience like you'd describe from the Creation Engine."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,As someone who never watched the movies I feel like this game is doing a great job at telling me why people love the movies and the character. Being in first person is pulling me way more in than I thought it would
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,I think the best game Machine has made to date. The stroke of genius to have the side quests all tie in meaningfully to the main story was just such a fresh approach to playing a game.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"It also absolutely nails the comedic nature and style of the movies. And the music is so good, the little flairs and stuff it does based on the context of what's going on."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,">One of my favorite details of the game is when you boot up your game your start screen will show Indiana Jones hanging out and when you hit start game it will immediately zoom in on where Indiana is without a loading screen and get you right into the action.

Just Cause 3 did this, with everything still happening in the background at the menu.  One of the more humorous scenarios has Rico leaning on a car, [but someone gets into the car and drives away with it](https://youtu.be/QwSh3klMSPc?si=4GoiL0Pb80J-bw_D), but Rico is still leaning on nothing as if the car was still there."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"I love how the cut scenes feel like Im watching an actual movie.

No spoilers, but it was so much fun just being able to sit back and enjoy the ending of a video game without having to constantly button mash.

Tony Todd was such a masterful performer, and I loved him in this. A monumental loss."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"My late grandpa loved Indiana Jones and he loved watching me play video games, kinda sad that I can't play this one with him sitting next to me and egging me on to punch nazis."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"They really got it right.  Indy is truly Indy and they stick to the lore and the character perfectly…he’s human through and through with all his faults, weaknesses, and even pull in Harrison Ford’s little quirks so that you really feel you are watching him back in the timeline.

I love how it still mixes some thoroughly good dry wit as well as the magic of Indy’s love of history….and how it both is great *and* bad for him.  Bad being his love of adventure plays havoc in his personal and professional life.

You can tell the devs are big fans…I have been playing it out in long form and enjoying  doing side quests and reading the notes thoroughly.

Plus there is just something about getting to beat the shit outta nazis with a patented Indiana Jones’s punch sound…"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"The combat is so satisfying. Never seen first person melee done so well.

 Breaking improvised weapons on nazi heads as indy quips something funny over their limp bodies. 

Whip pulling a nazis legs from under them and then bashing a pot on their face as they get up just never gets old."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,I got a game breaking bug when I picked up some quest item off a corspe in the Vatican and I literally could not move no matter if I restarted the game or loaded an earlier save. Had to restart 😪
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Couldn't agree more. Have never felt ""I'm playing a movie!"" to this degree before. Unfortunately this game will have 0 replayability - but for what it is it's a fucking great game."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,I've never seen an Indiana Jones film but this game is pretty neat.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"The no loading screens is bonkers. Most of my other games that look this good take a 15-30 seconds to reload the map. Indy's back up and kicking in a millisecond, with no texture issues or anything. This game is beautifully optimized"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Goddamnit, I got a ps5 slim just for cyberpunk and of course my favorite franchise comes out with a game only on xbox"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"I love this game - lifelong Indy fan, it's largely combat free exploration and puzzle and it's delightful - I love not having to shoot hundreds of people like in Uncharted and I really enjoy the slower pace. 

That said, whoever put all those battles with giants in there can get fucked. 

The melee system and movement don't work consistently enough to have good fist fights. I was literally fighting a giant for 25 minutes - without dying - and it was so boring and frustrating I almost rage quit and abandoned the whole thing.

This game is so great, has the potential to have a series of absolutely excellent sequels. They've laid the groundwork to continue Indiana jones outside of the films, in a none shitty way - but they need to iron out the combat and some of the movement mechanics.

Edit: come on, the movement and combat is a little clunky, can't we agree on that?"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,That's because everything else is ass.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Given how TGA once delayed the cut off date to let Death Stranding be eligible for nominations, I'd say ""a few times before""."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"I'd say fairly rare. 

Forza 5 and Dragon Age which also won IGN awards were both November release dates. Most other ones released in the Spring time."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"I smashed a nazi in the face with a sledge hammer as he came around a corner I was hiding in as my wife walked by. Her reaction ""Jesus  christ! What the hell??"" I was like okay... this is a good game."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,You can also beat those Nazi's to death with a toilet plunger.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,It's an Antifa members wet dream
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,what are your top four?
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,How many hours would you estimate it's taken to get you to this point?
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"I'm about 3/4 through, I think. I've loved every minute of it until Siam. Not really enjoying that area. Lots of swimming and puzzles, not much combat, and a giant fucking snake."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Same thought here, really cinematic and the music is critical. Love the Sound design in general, it's small cues when detected and other stuff really immerse you while playing as Indy on an adventure"

1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"I think it wins by default, like a mayor winning an election because he ran unopposed."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"In stronger years, yeah, this wouldn't have won, but don't forget that the game is still very, very good."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Yeah, the graphics are insane. I’m playing it on ultrawide with HDR on and Very Ultra and it kicks ass so bad - I’ve only visited the Vatican and Gizeh so far, but the tombs and all te details in the world are amazing. 

I was skeptical about the first person view at first when I saw the trailers, but it’s just so much more immersive this way."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,"The lighting is really good, not just because of the tech but because it's really well designed. The dungeons are really pretty, and games they're not afraid to make them dark enough that you often need to light the way with a flame."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"I wish it would be more stable. I have constant crashes and glitches. Often Indy's hair is blonde which is kinda funny. But so far I wasn't able to play longer than 30 minutes before it crashes. Even going back to FullHD, turning of HDR and Path Tracing didn't fix it. Hopefully they will fix it."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Owned*
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-26,Hey there’s a camera stabilization setting in accessibility options that helps a lot with this!
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,OP is the Indiana Jones marketing department
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"It's been a trend for the last year and a half to two years, it's been noted by many. It really began to take off when Starfield got so many 10/10 and bots posting all over"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,[deleted]
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,"I agree. Although lots of people complained about it when they revealed the game, it really benefits from being first person. You can look up close at all the details in the environment and puzzles, and you really feel like you're inside Indy's head trying to smart your way out of a sticky situation."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Yep, its a great game!"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,It's not even top 5
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,It's a great game
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Is the award only for Xbox exclusive games or all games available on the console?
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"When I saw the trailer I thought it was the next cash grab for the franchise. But then I installed it via Gamepass and am absolutely hooked. The atmosphere and love to detail is so spot on, puzzles are fun and make you feel smarter without hand holding (hints can be turned on in the options though). The game feels like the best of the original Indiana Jones trilogy and no cheap nostalgia bating. I love it."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,I was ready to be disappointed and I'm very happily surprised
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,"I was really skeptical from the trailers but it's pretty fucking amazing. It nails everything that makes the original movies fun: an immersive, slow burn mystery with supernatural elements, great characters, fun dialog. It doesn't take itself too seriously and leans into the cheesy moments that make Indiana Jones fun, but also has some emotionally impactful moments along the way. The combat is ridiculous and fun, the villain is one of the best in the franchise, and the voice acting is incredible.

If you liked the original trilogy, you'll love the game."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,You and I played a different Indiana Jones game I think
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"That seems really high. Im playing it on Series S on a tv and it runs at a super smooth 60 and looks fine. And Series S is what, like a rough 1070 equivalent? If I play on my monitor sitting up close it starts to look a bit muddy, but tuning the sharpening and film grain settings helped."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"For me, a 100x better but I don't really care for multiplayer games. :)"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,In Q1Q2/2025
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"In Spring, yeah"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Okay there are some people meatriding sony in these comments but you are literally just saying you'd play it on ps5 which there's nothing wrong with i dont get fanboys as an xbox user myself
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Literally 95% of the same games that released on PS.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,"STALKER 2 looked very promising. In the end, IGN is worthless, a complete hellhole"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,Tell me what’s better?
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,Best for xbox. IGN gave Astro Bot their GOTY
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,"That's so strange, do you have a picture?"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"I disagree with everything except the AI being dumb. However, I find it to be a good balance. I don’t think the game would be more fun if the AI was smarter, in fact I think it would suffer.

To me, this game is not getting enough praise. Easy 10 out of 10 for me 🤷‍♂️"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,The combat and AI is so unbelievably bad. The whole game just feels like a skyrim mod.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"They down voted him because he spoke the truth, take a up vote to counteract the hive mind. 


The game is cool if you're into Indy and like movie experiences but as a game it is so bland and boring. It really blew my mind that the same people that made this game also made the action packed Nazi slaying thrill ride of the new Wolfensteins"

1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"None as universally enjoyable as great circle, hellblade 2 is a good game but god damn can those games really wear on the psyche"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,"Have you played the game? The combat doesn't look like much from videos and I was ready to be disappointed but it's really fun.

The AI isn't fantastic but I feel like it doesn't really have to be for this type of game."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,Enjoying paying for it. Supplements my Gamepass.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Why is that sad? The game is incredible I would even go as far as to say it could’ve won GOTY 2024 overall if it released earlier enough to be nominated. MachineGames did a fantastic job
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,You sound like you follow those right wing grifters on Twitter like grummz
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Why are people getting downvoted for genuine complaints?
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Yeah people are definitely overlooking some bugs. 

The UI almost constantly gets borked if you try and switch between items too quickly, the UI in general is kinda messy, the game stutters on *most* camera cuts, especially in the first jungle area, and there is some odd specular flickering in characters eyes and around Indy's hat in almost every cutscene. I was also having issues with frame gen not working with HDR enabled but that's actually been fixed in the most recent update. 

I'm liking the game so far, but it does feel just a *little bit* rougher around the edges than I was expecting given all the buzz."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,I've only had one freeze so far when you enter the boxing ring cutscene

1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,I’ve found the ‘shovel between the legs then bang ‘em over the head’ technique to be very effective
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,It’s still an Xbox game regardless of what platform it’s on.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"...or wait for it, the game is actually pretty good? 🤦‍♂️"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,"Daft question, but what's the command? The launch videos being unskippable is driving me nuts."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-26,"Yeah. I can see people falling off of this because of the “lack of action,” but this game plays exactly like an Indiana Jones adventure. Most of the game focuses on actual exploration, which is what the movies are about."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Please. Watch the movies. They are cinema classics.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"I understand that there are so many movies out there, it's silly to expect someone who doesn't spend a huge amount of their free time watching movies to have all the cultural classics/touchstones.


That being said, if you can clear 3 1/2 hours of time in the next few months, you will be well-served watching Raiders of the Lost Ark and Last Crusade. They are nearly perfect adventure movies, you will realize so much of what you've seen beforehand were inspired by or direct references to them. And they are simply joys to watch.

Temple of Doom is good, I'm not a hater. But is a lower tier of required viewing."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Do you not want to see a Nazi's face melt off?
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is one of my all time favorite movies, you should give it a watch, it's a great 'feeling good' movie."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"The fact that you’ve never seen it and yet see the appeal and that it’s also a hit with fans shows it fulfills both sides of the coin, proving they absolutely nailed it."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"This is why I love first person games so much, when they get it right it's just such a different experience from the usual 3rd person action."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Dude go watch the original series. It’s Lucas and Spielberg. The other great trilogy. I would put it ahead of the original Star Wars trilogy 100%
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,"Wtf, go watch all 3 movies right now."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,I was surprised when I realized that the quests I was doing in the Vatican were side quests. They felt like the main story!
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"It seems so simple, but this honestly blew me away. In almost every game, it's very easy to distinguish what is ""main plot"" vs. ""side story"" content - the voice acting is lesser or not included, or there are no cutscenes, or maybe only generic voice lines are offered instead of specific-to-sequence work.

Totally not the case here. You get cutscenes, you get interaction with primary story characters, there's no obvious line to distinguish it as lesser or unimportant content. It's completely fantastic."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,I hope other companies copy their approach to side missions because it’s awesome
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-29,I’m heartbroken! I loved Tony Todd. You just broke the news to me. Damn.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"I was having trouble baiting out punches to parry from an Italian facist because he kept himself in a blocking position.

I tried to see if I could punch his stomach and see if that would drop his guard. I ended up punching him in the balls because my aim was a bit lower than expected and he dropped fast. This game is pure genius."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,I love that all the sound effects were taken right from the movies. Even the punches are the real thing.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,"Indy randomly screaming ""DUCK SOUP!"" after I K.O. a Nazi/Fascist will live in my head rent free for the rest of my life."

1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Are we playing the same game? That combat is terrible. Indiana Jones can climb vertically up a fucking whip, but can’t throw more than three punches without being exhausted? Enemies still standing after being smashed in the face with the butt of a rifle three times? How about when you shoot someone in the face, at point blank range, and they are completely unfazed by it? The combat is the one feature that continually keeps me from really being able to really enjoy the game. It feels like a complete afterthought."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,You know the game has a 'rollback' function for saves? It's pretty cool ...
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"As someone who plays mostly narrative based single player games, I usually just play them once and move on - I could imagine revisiting maps and 100% this one though"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Do yourself a favor and watch the first 3.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"I agree, but disagree. Indiana Jones is great anyway."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"No it’s not, Indy is a genuinely great game, no matter the quality of the competition…"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Stalker 2 and Hellblade 2 are definitely not ass.

Although I can see why Hellblade 2 is not a great candidate, it's not a long game and is more of a watching experience.

But Indiana is great regardless, and I'd say it's one of the greatest games released this year on its own merit."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,This has been a great year for games. The fuck are you on about?
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Current Stalker 2 is definitely not ass. Some of the most impressive post-apocalyptic survival that feels like old-school Stalker, but much more refined."

1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Helldivers 2 should have been Goty tbh
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,"It’s an incredible bit that every time Rockstar climbs off of its horde of gold to bless us with a game, a PlayStation game wins Game of the Year over it. 

TLOU beat GTA V, GoW 2018 beat RDR2, and may as well pencil in Geoff Keighley’s bff Kojima’s game Death Stranding 2 winning over GTA6 lmao."

1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"My brother 100% the game at 48ish hours, and he said he soaked it in. I would say 35-40 hours to 100% it."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,I just finished every achievement. Took me just over 33 hours.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"I’m at about 30 hours right now. When it’s all said and done, I’ll probably be around 35-40 hours."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,I enjoy the puzzles personally but needing to use the boat and swimming a lot did get old.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,The music is so great
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,what was i expecting?
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,xbox hasnt had a strong year in about a decade
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Pretty sure I gave my PC a stroke while trying to bump up the graphics a little farther. My CPU is out of date (Ryzen 5 3600 paired with a 4070 ti lmao) so it was struggling but by the next time I tried to boot it up my PC just straight up said no and forced me to launch the game in safe mode at a lower graphics setting.

So yeah, I'd say the game is really pretty to say the least."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,Just missing the OLED
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,I've only had a single crash and it was when alt tabbed out. Outside of that one instance it's been completely stable. Currently sitting at 27hrs of play time. Might want to check GPU and chipset drivers. That's the usual cause for crashes.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,I had none of that in my playthrough so it may be your machine (unless you're on Xbox).
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,I had 3 crashes too in the opening 2-3. I've played another 5 or 6 since then and haven't had any more. Hopefully it stays that way.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,zero problems on my end.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Good thing I’m not a bot 
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,It’s free on game pass what do you mean not selling?
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,Omg I didn’t realize it was on gamepass guess I’ll download it. I wasn’t trying to be snarky was just honestly surprised this isn’t a cash grab
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Awesome!  I can wait that long.  Thanks for the info!
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,"i posted it elsewhere, managed to fix it by disabling dolby vision for games. turns out it was breaking all the 1st party games for some reason (but vampire survivors and metal slug tactics worked perfect)"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,"The combat isn't ""great"" but it's so fun. I didn't like it based off the previews but it's so ridiculous it ended up being one of my favorite parts of the game."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Oh don't get me wrong I love the films, well the first 3 anyway lol

But even as an experience it let's itself down in some ways by doing things that just aren't what you would expect in an Indiana Jones film."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Yeah it doesn't make sense to me, it's a good game and it's a good entry for indiana jones. It just isn't an amazing game and seeing all these high scores and people going nuts for it isn't making sense to me."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,"Yeah, I’m an adult with a good job and do enjoy paying for things, thanks."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,It's not even top 5 lol
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"The game has shit A.I, bad combat gameplay and the puzzles are braindead."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,None of those will play indy either 🥲

paste this into you launch options for the game's properties on Steam. If it's not the Steam version, pasting it after the file path in the shortcut icon properties should probably do the same thing"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Well, the original 3 are"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,I definitely am going to after! The writing and humor of the game has been hitting perfectly for me so should be interesting to see the original source

1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-29,"The game is so good, like during the plane fight, i intentionally shot through my own tail, just to see if there was a referece to Henry Jones Sr. line in the movie, and yep there was a reference! Also the minor things like Indy's trying to pitch to Dame Nawal the expedition for the fertility idol, referencing Belloq.... wow..."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Is there a place that are streaming for free
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,By now the majority of them are pretty bad :(
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Just jumping onto this to say I love Temple of Doom simply for Mola Ram being as mustache-twirling as you can get, and for Indy and Shorty's chemistry"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,They're all 10/10 IMO - I wouldn't have any other movie be the sequel to raiders.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Temple of Doom is the Return of the Jedi of Indians Jones
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Probably going to finish the game during the holidays so it'll be a perfect time of year to watch them when I finish!
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,"Temple of doom is the worst film of the 3, but it is the most fun to watch of the 3. There are a ton of fun set pieces and spectacle.


The biggest flaws are Willie Scott being too annoying and a lack of archeology."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Having rewatched Raiders of the Lost Ark recently, the entire premise hasn't really aged well.

He was such a powerful actor."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Apparently they didn't use any sound from the movies. They recreated the punches from scratch using the same technique as they did back then!
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"There's upgrades for everything you just mentioned. Stamina, damage with weapons, and bullet damage. By the end of the game you're basically one shotting with charged weapon attacks and have loads of stamina. 

You clearly don't know what you're talking about."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Sounds like a skill issue to me.

Weirdos who've never seen any Indiana Jones movies should only be exhorted to watch Raiders of the Lost Ark. If they like that, they'll keep going without having to be told."

1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"I agree, I feel like this is why such a hoohaa is being made about Indy. I really can't get into it, which is strange, as it should be right up my street, it's the exact type of game I usually enjoy (I also loved all the Indy movies), it's weird.


Clearly a lot of people enjoy it, but it's been a very, very long time and a huge amount of money to get here"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,All other games run fine so I assume it is an engine problem.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Yeah, bot would say that. Sus."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,You're just making tons and tons of indiana jones topics cus you're a normal human? 
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-22,"I played up to Egypt. I can understand it can be fun for people because it’s sort of whimsical I guess. I have a hard time believing people don’t have a problem with the AI though. Stealth is very easy, even on high difficulty, and beating people up is even easier. You can’t take out a bunch at once, but it’s really not hard to with the amount of items lying around. I remember there were enemies throwing rocks when I when up in a guard tower. The rocks would float"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,1 of those things is true.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,Disagree heavily on all takes except AI
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Oh so you are just hating it because it’s a Bethesda game!? Yikes…
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2025-01-06,Is this do-able for most games? I have spiderman on pc and it's basically my first game on it. I'm loving it but the 30-60 second long into video is a bit annoying on every startup.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"The other two are okay enough to watch, but Last Crusade was such a perfect film that nothing could ever emerge from its shadow."

1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"The only 3, there is no more movies after those. :)"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,"Crystal skull is also great, defending that film is my hill to die on."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,"Those are the only three, right?"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Do so before beating the game, it'll really make the game feel more alive having seen the movies."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Please do, also the movies are still good to this day, I watched them as a kid, and watched them with my wife a couple years ago and all 3 are still great.

They aged very well."

1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"I believe Disney+ and Paramount+ have all five movies and the TV series, pretty much worldwide."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"The original three movies, are better than any fggt Zoomer garbage out now"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,I found Temple of Doom to be the most fun of the three personally.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Indy+Shorty were great! Temple used to be my favorite for a while purely for the opening sequence, the mine cart chase, and the sex banter scene (best name I could come up with atm)."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,"It also gets a fair bit of criticism for how it depicted Indian food as barbaric and super disgusting, and made the colonial British Indian army the saviours at the end."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"I see you prefer Nazi’s travelling overseas to steal “artifacts”, bold take…"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"This is such a lame, tired take lol.


An American archeologist goes to rescue a Jewish relic from nazi looters to put it in a museum and ends up keeping a metaphysical WMD from Hitler's grasp."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-29,He was. Absolutely loved his role in the 1994 night of the living dead remake and of course Candyman to name a few. He had a great minor role in the Rock too. Such a great villain!
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,"I fucking love foley art. So often unappreciated, but I'm glad to heart it in such a big title."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,that's very interesting. I just watched Last Crusade and they absolutely nailed it.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"I don't really play RPGs and it hadn't occurred to me to check about upgrading my stats. 

I'm beginning to see why I may have struggled with some sections."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"No, he's 100% correct. The combat is bad, even with the upgrades."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Easiest combat in video game history

""Skill issue"" yeah keep coping that someone said a negative about your fav game fanboy"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,No you didn't.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-22,"The total runtime for the 3 movies is 6 hours.

The game we are talking about is 12-30 hours long.

1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,Oh that’s fair
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Patch 1.1 just got released, with A-life fixes! However, I haven't seen any feedback from players yet.."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,That still only counts as one!
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2025-01-25,Is this a lord of the rings reference? Lol
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Well I’m a pretty big fan of the franchise, and this game is a huge win for us in a long time, so naturally, I'm going to share that often. It’s not hard to see that I post more than just Indy content if you take a second to actually scroll down my posts and comments."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,Are you one of those meatheads who cares about console wars?
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2025-01-06,I think this is specific to ID engine. You can always google for any specific game and/or look at nexus mods to see what's the workaround
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,I had last crusade on vhs as a kid and man I pretty much wore that tape out
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"My friend and I both agree that Raiders is the best of the films, but last crusade is our favorite."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,I think i like Crusade the best because i did as a kid but i rewatched them recently and Raiders is almost a perfect movie. Its just so well made.

1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"AotC is a classic, ToD is fun times with Short Round, and LC is one of the best movies made period."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,They should have recast Indy after the first 3 and kept the movies coming. Ala Bond films.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,The best joke in the final season of Chuck.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"First 20 minutes of Kingdom actually not bad and fits Indyverse imo. Good cinematography, action and editing like the other films. 

But **stop** the movie right when it gets to Nuketown. It's all shit from there."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,100%.  You will enjoy the game so much more if you know who Indy is.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"It's so good, it's a 2 hour movie that feels like an hour, and just the right amount of ridiculous that it gets away with it"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,A man of culture
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Sounds like a skill issue. The counter, whip pull, grapple pummel, and melee weapons are all very enjoyable, and praised by everyone who enjoyed the game. It's more fun to beat a nazi with a gun than to shoot them with it. Captures the indy experience perfectly. 

Sorry you didn't have fun :("
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,"Fuck yeah! This is what I've been waiting for.. Yet PoE2 has sort of grabbed me. Gotta say, I hated PoE1 but 2 is something else. So good."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Uh huh. You've made like 30 Indiana jones topics in like a few days. Totally normal and just cus you're a fan!
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,You obviously do.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2025-01-06,"Thanks bro, im gonna look this up!"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,"For me it was The Temple of Doom on VHS.  Watched it sooo much, along with Mission:Impossible and Back To The Future.  

That was the VHS trifecta for my childhood."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Last Crusade is just so entertaining.  Like Raiders is a stone-cold classic but if you want something that's ""fun"" then it's Last Crusade."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,Yep. Raiders is extremely well made but last crusade is just fun as shit.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,Apt. Apt analysis bsquared89
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"I actually think he’s referring to Crystal Skull and Dial of Destiny as “the other two are okay enough to watch” and the commenting on how great Crusade is since it’s part of the original 3.

Anyway, Raiders is great but it def has story issues."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,in your imagination is the only place this was said.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Can you read? He said the other 2 were ok and the original 3 are classics.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"> AotC 

Indiana Jones and the Attack of the Clones?"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,"Or just let it end, things can end and studios must accept that.

But yes, bringing back Harrison in his 80s and just make him dirty in this last movie wasn't a great ideia."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Eh the campus chase scene when they introduce Mutt was pretty great too. 

There's a lot of classic Spielberg moments in that flick that Dial was missing imo. There's also a lot of absolute shit like the monkey swinging scene."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,I actually really like Crystal Skull until Marion is introduced. I really like Indy and Mutt traveling around together and exploring.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Gee it’s almost like the game just RECENTLY released and it makes sense to share the glowing reviews as a fan who wants to see more of this content since the last 2 movies failed to reach such critical success. Funny how that works right? And it’s even more amusing how you ignore the fact that I’ve posted plenty of other non related Indy comments and posts in the past month—guess it doesn’t fit your weak conspiracy theory 
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-20,"Nope.  Don’t give a fuck.  I’m just happy I get to play this game eventually.  If I really wanted to play it sooner, I’d just buy an XBox.  Don’t give a fuck."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"I've never heard anyone called the movie ""Indiana Jones Ark of the Covenant"". That's not what the movie is called."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"Yeah the campus scene pretty good too, and it's amusing to see Tom Hanks' son Chet Hanks in that sequence (before he turned gangsta rapper). 

Agreed, Kingdom piece by piece (and major flaws and all) is still waay better than snoozefest Dial"
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,Yep. Totally normal. Everybody makes dozens of topics about a game in the span of a week 
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,I figured that might have been its name in certain foreign markets or something like that.
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-19,"If they're as obsessed with Indy as I am, then yes. But go ahead and keep pushing the conspiracy theory while conveniently ignoring all the other times I've commented or posted about things that aren't Indy-related."
1hhkelb,2024-12-19,2024-12-21,"I don't think it is, at least not in any english markets like with the latest Pirate of the Caribbean movie. It wasn't even titled Indiana Jones originally, just Raiders of the Lost Ark, since it was the first in the franchise"
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,"holy shit, someone posted a screenshot with the name of the fucking game in the title? i don't have to guess at what the fuck i'm looking at? my mind is fucking blown."
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,I have so many games to finish. Trying to stay disciplined before I tackle this one.
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,because it uses ray tracing and ID7 engine is amazing

1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,Wait until Monday when full path tracing gets released for this game.
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,The graphics seem really well done
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,id tech 7 > Unreal engine 5
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,"I'm all for excitement, but this doesn't seem like the right screenshot for the title."

1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,"Yep, ray tracing is the end game for visuals. Accurate lighting is the most important thing fuckin’ up our minds blurring the line between reality and digital."
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,I believe you as I haven’t played it but this shot is ass lol
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,I’m sure the game looks amazing but surely this isn’t the best screenshot to show it haha
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,Is it?
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,"Out of all the games that have diffuse GI I think this is one of the less impressive ones purely from a visual standpoint (though I was only really awake watching DFs console coverage). But on the other hand it performs relatively well so that's nice.

Looking forward to see what the mode they're releasing later on looks like though."
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,ID tech its gold
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,I will argue all day long that raytracing does so much more for lighting than it does in going for those moneyshots of fullscreen reflections.
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,"I hope it looks good for a game that recommends a damn 3080ti, a 12700k, and for some reason, 32 gigs of ram lmao"
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,I'm having way more of a good time in the game than I thought I would. Even the side quests are good.
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,I mean it does use ray tracing by default.
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,"Don't care about the lightning but the game itself, Does xbox FINALLY have a rare 'console' exclusive W?"
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,Looks like I’m finally going to have to shell out for the Xbox X/S….
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,"That’s why with a 1080 you can’t play this game, you need a ray trace abled graphics card. Kinda shitty it’s not out for ps5 for awhile so I won’t be able to play. Womp womp"
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,Nice rocks?
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,"Is it? Looks good for a video game, but doesn't look realistic, which I thought was the point of the tech they're using."
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-09,Cant wait for my 4070ti to play
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,"If you're talking about this screenshot alone, it's actually unimpressive as I've seen much better."
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,Looking forward to this but waiting on the poor non-early access gamepass edition.
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,"some still look good but in some way all footage I've seen of this game feels so 'stiff' . The world is lit and shaded correctly but feels rigid. 

Plants jiggle a tiny amount, animations have clear start and end points, the world is static scenery . 

Yes it's nice in stills but there's a flow lacking in motion."
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,rdr2 from 2018 has entered the chat
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,I mean that's just normal lighting? I see that in Monster Hunter World and that was release nearly 10 years ago.
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,"Raytraced global illumination 

Just proof against those that say raytracing doesn't add anything."
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,What’s your specs OP?
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,[Yes](https://i.imgur.com/VUCCC3F.jpeg).
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,This is the kind of raytracing we should celebrate. This game does such a good job utilizing it in the right ways!
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,Gawd dang
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,Wait this is on games pass now?
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,MachineGames does a good job with lighting.  The Wolfenstein games also looked great.
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,Im guessing only Bethseda is a publisher but if not there might be a chance for ES6
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,Looks so good
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,that is amazing
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,"It better damn well be with ray tracing being a requirement, not an option."
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,"I mean, Ray Tracing is required apparently, so yeah... I hope it looks good."
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,"Oh, hey, isn't that the demo cave we all saw back when Unreal Engine \[5\] got announced with a tech demo? Huh.

Ah... it's a bit different."
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be impressed by? Looks like a cave in a video game.
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,...this is quite common nowadays
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,Machinegames rely on Ray Traced Global Illumination to create lightning and shadows like that. I feel like it has a much better impact on the game than Ray Traced Reflections. Screen Space Reflections do a fine enough job.
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,"Seems they did a good job with this one, at least with how it looks.."
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,"And a big reason for that is the required RT support. MachineGames decided to go with Raytraced Global Illumination and ditch any old methods for it.

From what I understand when the game fully releases it will either have or get a patch shortly after to add support for full RT (pathtracing). Though according to the dev console the game checks to see if you have at least 11GB of VRAM and if you don't you won't be able to enable pathtracing.

[https://i.imgur.com/QqZBsWV.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/QqZBsWV.jpeg)

Not that I planned on trying to play with pathtracing on my 3080 but just thought it was interesting.

So nice to play a game that looks fantastic, runs at a super solid FPS, and most of all DOSE NOT STUTTER. That's so refreshing after the AAA games on UE 5 lately. SH 2 Remake with its traversal stutter (but thankfully not super bad in my experience), and then STALKER 2 which I've just decided to wait to play after a couple more patches, but I don't expect performance/stuttering to get much better just because it's UE 5.

Funny how other games that are not UE5 look fantastic, run great and don't have any stuttering problems. Like Alan Wake 2 which I re-installed not long ago to play the lakehouse DLC. Game looks amazing and runs smooth as silk. Same with RE-Engine games"
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,nice
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-09,It's RT right?
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-09,Should I at least try it with i7-8086k? It's close to i7-8700 by performance.
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,"Not really groundbreaking though.

I thought this was Remnant 2 before I read the title."
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,I'll believe it in 15 years when my new PC will be ready to play it.
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,"Can't believe some people aren't playing this one because of ""Wokeness"". It's a really incredible game."
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,"Am I crazy or does the lighting in this screenshot NOT look that absurdly good?

I'll take your word for it, OP, but this screenshot doesn't really do it justice."
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,"If you want a game with great lightning, look no further than Enshrouded. Holy shit does it look good."
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,"Wishlisted! Will buy when it is 50% or more off, will play 2+ years after that."
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,Read that as lightning and was trying for way too long to find it

Maybe some new-Zeeland shenanigans can help me to play later today."
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,"The suspense for this game is killing me!! For those who've played the Advanced Edition, just tell me if the story is on par with the original movie trilogy - I can deal with slow stealth mechanics as I've played Wolfenstein TNO and Dishonored."
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,"Like every other game these days, how does it play though?"

1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,Makes me excited to see Death Stranding 2 with the Decima Engine and ray tracing. I think it's gonna top ID7

1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,This game looks like any Gen8 games which is a really good thing as Gen9 is just a blurry mess.
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,"Because:

A) it's actually easily noticeable in this game, unlike some others where you need a side by side to even notice and go ""oh yeah this light look slightly better"" 

B) the performance and optimization is actually good and isn't being gate keeped like Alan Wake 2 or Wukong where upscaling is a MUST on basically any setting. You can get about 60fps on 1080p NATIVE on ultra settings, on an RTX 3060. I know it's not path tracing but it's still a realistic use case on what most users have (for reference CP2077 in ultra + RT lighting in medium and RT shadows at 1080p native runs at like 30-35fps)"
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,"From looking at this pic, ray tracing doesn't add anything."

1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-09,"IIRC it uses the IdTech 7 engine, which is probably the same engine used for DOOM Eternal, that explains why it isn't a laggy and stuttery mess like most of the recent titles since they used Unreal Engine 5."

1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,"Game's broken up into basically small but dense open worlds. You find bigger and smaller ""side quests"" as you move through (ranging from just two people talking about wanting some bread and you can give it to them, to full investigations connected to the main story that seem like they were main quests), there are collectibles that are usually associated with a puzzle or quest or unlock new skills, you collect a few types of currency (each area has its own money you can use to buy sometimes story related equipment, but mostly guides which give you markers on your map for remaining collectibles), and lots to explore to find everything. There's even fast travel within the areas, there's a few points with signposts that allow you to travel between them.

There's plenty of combat unless you're great at stealth, and of course you have to solve the puzzles yourself. There's an opt-in hint system if you're stuck, but the puzzles are not super hard anyway."
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,"Its very linear and the loop is puzzle-movie sequence - puzzle... still a lot of fun tho

And NGL I don't like puzzle games but this freaking game got me hooked

 why? 

It's funny and enjoyable just like old Indiana Jones movies

all the fight sequences are very well choreographed and you don't feel like you are just pushing buttons as you go through them

Dialogues are really well written, you do care for the side character who travels with you as you get to know about her too.

Cut scenes are definitely not as long as Sony games (just personal experience) they are infact placed so well you don't feel annoyed but understand why they did it. (You will get it once you play it 😂)

Story is very non linear and semi open World (expect 3rd Himalayas map) many side questions and secret puzzle quests 

I loved the 2nd Egypt map, dude you can do so many stuff there and find artifacts, puzzle are also really well done you don't feel bored but actually want to get involved 

The Devs team did a really good job in creating these maps and they are very detailed.


I'm having the time of my life so far playing it"

1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,"I had no idea what to expect from this game. Have pretty good confidence in MachineGame but you never know. Was glad to know it wouldn't be another UE 5 stutter filled mess at least. Game looks fantastic and not only runs at a rock-solid FPS but has no stuttering issues (also load times are crazy, basically non-existent).

But this game has really really surprised me. I've got like 5 hours and I'm still in the first ""level""/""zone"". And haven't even progressed the main quest. All this time I've spent exploring, doing side quests I discover, puzzles etc. This 1st zone (The Vatican) is so much fun to just explore. It's not open world, but the levels are surprisingly large, very well designed, and just a blast to explore with lots of stuff to do and stumble upon.

Also, kudos to Troy Baker. He does an amazing job as Indy."

1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,I turned on DLSS and Frame Generation for this game because it looked like any other unoptimized Unreal Engine 5 game just to play it on ultra 60 fps. I was surprised when I saw the metrics saying 180 FPS. Turned them both off and still runs buttery smooth.
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,"I looked up only this game and doom uses id tech 7

1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,"Machine games always did that. Their version is based on I'd tech, but has some of their own additions. Considering that both studios belong to Bethesda - no wonder.

Also Arakane's studio Void engine is a customized IDTech."
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,Any 1st party microsoft game that wants to use id tech can. They just don't license it out to outside devs.
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,I think only like 3 other devs have ever used an Id tech engine besides Id themselves before. Always a good engine
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,"That's because it's using RTGI, so all the lighting coming from the sky is being calculated in real time very accurately. 

Other games in the past on consoles only chose to use RT for reflections or shadows, in this game, at least on consoles they're using screen spaced reflections, so the only RT is the GI, but I think that's where you get the most bang for your buck."

1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,Not without intense modding. From my understanding there are no non-rtx files in the game so it literally does not know what to do without raytracing
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-09,There is no raster lighting system so your card has to be able to handle ray tracing to play the game.

1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-09,">it's actually easily noticeable in this game, unlike some others where you need a side by side to even notice and go ""oh yeah this light look slightly better"".

As someone who mostly played on an old PC from 2011 for over a decade and PS4, it felt strange that there were people who could ""feel"" ray tracing even if it isn't easily visible, but in this game, it's easier to see, now that I have a computer that's capable of running most of the latest titles at 1080p without struggling at low settings, I might go for it, especially if it goes on sale."
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,DF has some good [examples](https://youtu.be/b8I4SsQTqaY?t=573) of why this one pic looks great with RT.

I don't think it will handle this game just yet but with a bit of optimisation it should get there. Heck, it runs on the Xbox Series S which isn't much better than the deck IMHO especially running at 800p as the deck does. I can always stream games from my desktop PC too if they're a bit too much for the deck but the actual performance on offer is surprisingly good."

It's really well don't gameplay and story wise, also it's not linear as one would expect especially in Egypt and Southeast Asia maps

People are gonna love it"
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,That is a fucking shame.
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,"ID Tech 7 is used by this game and Doom Eternal. But the Id Tech Engine has evolved and generally been known for powering games with a performance and/or fidelity edge in a number of categories all the way since the original doom and quake. 

The Decima Engine that powers Death Stranding and the Horizon games is another good example of a very performant engine. 

They are performant because the engine is tailored to the game. Just like UE5 is tailored to fortnite. No surprise that the UE5 features only work well in one game. 

But the issue is unreal engine is being sold as a generic engine when its feature set only really works well in a single game and its incredibly hard to modify for outside devs because of how poorly the source code is documented.

I think a team like CD Projekt Red companies do decent because they have a full team of engine programmers still to customize UE to their needs, but most companies use UE so their engine programmer hires are kept to a minimum vs in house engines, so the future isn't looking good."
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,Does this mean the Indiana Jones game uses Vulkan?
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,"MachineGames tweaking id Tech makes sense, especially under Bethesda. It's already solid as a next-gen engine"
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,"It's published by Bethesda, which are not ""DOOM Eternal people"". Bethesda simply bought iD Software - the *actual* DOOM people - which is a part of them... Or more specifically, part of Microsoft now, since Bethesda has been acquired by MS.

Bethesda has its own studio, Bethesda Game Studios, with its own Creation Engine. Important to note because I won't stand for Bethesda getting credit for an amazing piece of tech they did not work on, while cultivating their own that doesn't even compare."
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-09,Why they didn't licence it out to outside devs? Wouldn't it bring them more money like Epic did?
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,Not really true. ID Tech developed the Quake engine which was used as a base for a ton of other engines (probably the majority of all 3D engines that existed in the late 90:s) most notably Goldsource which was used for Half-Life which in turn was the base for the Source engine.
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,"Over the years, many developers have built their games on id Tech engines. Half-Life by Valve being one of them, even their Source engine still has some id Tech code in it."
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,"And to think, full RT (path tracing) isn't even enabled on the PC yet."
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,"I don't think people realize how specifically talored Bethesda's engine is for their games, and vice versa.

They simply wouldn't be a Bethesda game anymore because it would likely have to change so much to properly work."
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,"We've yet to see IDtech 7 handle a massive open world.

We've yet to see ID tech 7 handle thousand of invidual objects with physics and permanence in the world.

Perhaps most importantly, how is the mod support for Id tech 7?

1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,The game uses ray traced global illumination (and no other version of GI). That's the part that requires RT support.
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,">the face textures/rigs and cloth physics seem to have gotten a step forward in quality as well

I meant in general not just Indiana Jones. As for Faces we've been stuck in the uncanny valley for years with slight incremental improvements every year."
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-09,"This totally depends on your gaming experience. If you compare this with say Uncharted 4 mo-cap, you'll notice that that game's PC release showed way better facial animations than Indiana Jones.

This is the key. UE is an amazing engine IF YOU TUNE IT PROPERLY. So many companies do the minimum / don't optimize their game within it... or rather don't take the time to.

My teams use it for work for extremely realistic simulations. (I do AI/ML in big tech). Tuning your ""game"" for it is critical."

Howard is the one that bought the rights and came up with the story and gameplay ideas and then got Machine games to make it for him. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Great_Circle#Development

> On January 12, 2021, Lucasfilm Games and Bethesda Softworks announced plans to eventually release a video game based on the Indiana Jones franchise. It would be developed by MachineGames, with Todd Howard serving as executive producer through Bethesda. Both companies are owned by ZeniMax Media.[13][14] Howard considered MachineGames an ideal company to develop the project because of its work on the Wolfenstein series, which involves a battle against Nazis, like the Indiana Jones franchise.[15] Howard conceived the game's story.

> Howard, an Indiana Jones fan, had previously pitched such a game to George Lucas around 2009,[17][18] although the project did not move forward at that time, partly because Bethesda did not have the resources to develop it.[15] In addition, Lucasfilm wanted to publish the game, a role that Bethesda sought to fill, and the two could not come to an agreement.

Its basically a Tod Howard game just like Fallout 4 and Starfield."
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,Published not developed. Yes they are the publishers of Doom Eternal.
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,"Not to argue with your first part, but creation engine is amazing tech on it's own. Including visuals. Fir a ray tracing free Starfield looks beautiful, suffering only on some minor details like trees and grass. Which can be easily fixed by mods. Which are also easily injected. Because engine is built with that in mind.


Go figure..."
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,It seems like after id Tech 5 they stopped licensing it out to a lot of studios.

1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,"Exactly. Just throwing a bethesda game on a random engine that works well enough for other completely different games is a recipe for disappointment.

Bethesda is the one that has to make the new engine for their future games because they know exactly what needs to be done for their games to run on it."
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,"Don't trust that, they have had problems with their own engines since forever.

1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,Try using Nvidias version of UE5. Better than the regular for photorealistic stuff.
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-09,"It is checkbox culture.

UE5 is full of new features that are very simple to add to your project, but computationally demanding while only offering a reasonable advantage over more performant solutions in very select scenarios that the worst offenders usually don't even have.

Lumen for example. RT based Lumen like other RT based GI is gonna be higher fidelity than traditional lightmaps, but software based is what is usually used on consoles or by default. Software based Lumen doesn't have the quality advantage and is much more hungry than a regular light map. Its only advantage is that it supports dynamic and volitile light sources. 
So why is any game other than Fortnite and Satisfactory offering software lumen as an option? Because it is easier to setup than lightmaps."

1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,"Their input would have largely been with the story. The game's design and tech is heavily MachineGames, carrying on concepts and ethos from way back when the same core team was under the Starbreeze banner; Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is far more The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay than it is an Elder Scrolls/nuFallout."

1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-12,Same! I've got a 4080 Super FE and had to bump down the pool size and use DLSS auto.
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,"My understanding is this is exactly why they went to UE. Easier to get devs that already know how to work with the engine. Add to that, Epic’s great support and having Nvidia on side. I’m sure they will be fine."
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,"Crysis uses, comparatively, primitive lighting. It introduced ambient occlusion effects to gaming, but it uses none of the technology that newer games like Indiana Jones or Cyberpunk does of raytracing or path tracing.

What makes this new lighting impressive is that it is simulating how real light works instead of artists trying to use a bunch of lights and other visual effects to fake it. Raytracing is replicating what actual photons do by bouncing thousands of them throughout an environment and lighting the scene that way."
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,"Those screenshots don’t show the same thing at all. Plus, Crysis made use of baked lighting ina lot of places, if I recall. If the Indiana Jones game is fully dynamic lighting, this truly is impressive.  If you truly know and understand the current state of lighting in games, it’s pretty clear to see."
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,It is the same case where RE engine isn’t built for large open world games with more advanced AI. RE engine might also hurt Monster Hunter Wilds since it is more open than previous monster hunter games with lots of free roaming AI walking about.

1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,It is fully dynamic which it makes it impressive.
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-07,Yeah. 3 is pretty much just using the exact same visuals as 2 (which also looks great).
1h90anf,2024-12-07,2024-12-08,"The game's general design principles and even much of its core gameplay is almost identical to Butcher Bay, which is 20 years old.

There's a good chance that Todd Howard played Butcher Bay and was influenced to make this game because of it. Like, I'm not overstating how similar it is."

It's not like this is a huge spoiler anyway, nor is this the type of game that really needs you to be completely 100% blind.

There is surprisingly even one positive aspect for this early access bs, which is that it alleviates a different issue with the industry: pre-order bonuses. Normally you have to take the bet that the game will be good with the small amount of information available and actually pre-order to get them, but this ""early"" access means that there are proper reviews from both from reviewers and regular players available so you know how the game is, but you can still ""pre-order"" the game, even though it's available."

If devs focused on pushing the limit vs watering shit down so someones 12 yr old gpu can still run it poorly instead of pushing the high emd hardware.  On console, its the crossgen shit.  Ps5 came out in 2020 but ps5 exclusives were rare for years vs all the half ass crossgen games only focused on selling as many copies as possible to both gen.  My 4090 has the easiest life as theres almost no games that can truly push it to its limits.  And ill stare at an Elden Ring over a wind waker ANY day of the week."

1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"Ikr, I'm going to boycott this one until they fix this crime. Such a travesty - the audacity of it, I mean seriously wtf were they thinking!??? /s"
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,You just made me never play this game.
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"I tried to do it IRL.  Didn't go well.  Got to the second step, much waving of Kalashnikovs and screaming in Arabic.  Probably pretty stupid but I was 17.  Stupid was my default."
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"Disgraceful. Next, you're gonna tell me there are cats and/or dogs that you can walk up to but not pet, hm? I hooe not."
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,I wonder if you could use Cheat Engine and teleport yourself over to it.
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,There's also a portion of the game within Vatican City and you can't go inside St. Peter's Basilica.... Honestly was quite disappointing
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,sad life
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,Very accurate. Not allowed to climb it in real life either.
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,You need to switch to Naoe to climb up that pagoda.
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"Yeah, that sucks!"
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"It's called the Great Circle, not the Great Climb. You are only allowed to circle around it."
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"not a glitch. you're not allowed to climb the originals either, and i guess the devs didn't want to encourage some idjits trying to climb the real thing after climbing it in game."
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,THAT BELONGS IN A MUSEUM!
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,[deleted]
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,Was super bummed when I beat the game and wasn't able to explore that...'thing' at the end 😞
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,"Some stuff like this irks me about playing video games. Not that I can't climb it, but I can 'feel the coding' of the game. This is why I will always love ttrpgs."
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,Assassins Creed also gave me wrong ideas about how people react when you climb and jump onto their rooftops…
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,"Last time he did his guide ran of with the camels, so he and his tutor was stranded until T.E. Lawrence came along on his bicycle."
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,It belongs in a museum!
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,the movement and combat reminds me of far cry 2
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,Whip it. Whip it good.
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,It's a faaaake
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-26,You can in Assassin's Creed though!
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-26,Gotta play Assassin's Creed Origins for that pleasure. And you can climb them all.
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-27,You can in assassins creed origins
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,You can’t really climb it in real life either. The locals get a bit angry about it.
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,Huge oversight
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,[removed]
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,You can’t (legally) climb it IRL so it’s not **that** oversighted
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,Then you launch AC Origins... climb to your hearts desire
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"You can't climb it in real life, so at least it's realistic."
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"Yeah, out of all the things I enjoyed about the game this was the worst thing to happen. I will have to retroactively reduce the rating I gave it from an 8 to a 1. It's a 1 because you can punch Nazis."
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"Lame, you can even climb is a bit in real life."
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,"Gamer: Not every game should be open world,
Also gamer:"
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,You can climb it and all the others in Assassin’s Creed: Origins. I don’t need the same fun in every game I play.
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,Oh... Can you climb it in real life?
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,I think Japan recently cut down on tourists die to dmg at certain sites. Really unfortunate some have to be that way damages and stuff.
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"Wow, I sure do love Indiana Jones and the Great Circle! Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is such a great game and a return to form! If anyone is interested in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, check out your local game store or an online retailer now! Don't miss out on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle!"
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"Yeah this game is way over-hyped.


Also, I hate that I can't own a disc copy of this game either. One day it will just disappear and until then I can't sell my copy."
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"*""See this mountain? You can buy it, in a DLC for the price of real mountain""*"
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"Well, there's a good reason for that.   

A tourist named john the asshole once climbed the pyramid and wrote on one the top ""John the asshole was here"" which is considered a graffiti on monument.   

If you wanted to preserve the monument, you'll make the same rules.


tl;dr assholes draw graffiti ruining the monument."
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"Yeah, I was gonna say. If anyone is going to respect not climbing on the monuments just because, it's gotta be Mr. ""It belongs in a museum"" himself XD"
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,It's funny cause he does say that in the game and next minute I'm sledgehammering walls in crypts to escape
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"It’s pretty funny cause in a quest he’s says “no archeologist worth their snuff would be using explosives” as he regularly smashed down walls with sledgehammers and collapses monuments when they open. 

To be fair he does himself say in the game during a quest that “you life takes priority” or something along those lines, so he’s not being a hypocrite. He does normally get shoved into weird spots."
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"Yeah, I think that’s the funniest response, a 1930s archaeologist won’t climb the pyramid if they get a chance? I really doubt that."
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,What he did to sir Richard’s tomb hurts my soul.
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-27,Well... He probably doesn't because he's already climbed it before in 1908.
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,One of the best viewpoints in the entire franchise honestly
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"You know what, I think it's time for a replay."
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"You just sold another copy, gonna get it"
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,Absolutely!
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,Weird because I just redownloaded this this morning for the first time since it came out and I was climbing pyramids.
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,I think I rode up a pyramid on a giant alien chicken in that game but I could also be hallucinating that.
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,I love it too! It’s such an underrated game...
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"That’s true, but pyramids aren’t triangles, they are pyramids. And it is the great pyramid…"
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,For some reason I read this in the voice of Nandor the relentless from WWDITS and it was hilarious.
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,Now your talking
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,Shit’s expensive. 
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,Completely unplayable
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,The petting mechanic in Hogwarts Legacy is what saved it from complete financial ruin
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,The engine has no pet petting mechanics. 
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"Well, *outer* pyramid exploration at least"
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,I saw it off in the distance and was like man I can’t wait to go climb that puppy. And when I made it there I was very let down. Then I thought maybe the story will have me do something! Nope.
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,Very accurate. I’m pretty sure it is illegal
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,I don’t think that Indy ever cared for trespassing laws when it comes to ancient structures
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,Can confirm it is illegal to climb it
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"Yeah, but this is a video game lol"
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"Not anymore.

In the past I hear it was quite different"
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"True, but I suppose they could give permission to record with a drone at least"
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"What? I played the game on my radeon 7900xtx. No rtx and it runs the game just fine. Just not with raytracing, but it does look awesome anyways."
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,"Works pretty well streaming on xcloud. Not quite as pretty and a few studders and frame drops, but definitely still worthwhile. "
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,"Lol that’s hilarious, yeah be cautious if you live in Siwa😂"
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,"When you put it like that yeah, that’s a 0/10"
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,"It was a joke, not a 0/10, but I was very disappointed."
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,(Pay no attention as Indy smashes through another wall inside a temple.)
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"I mean most of Indiana Jones is set in the 1930s, they weren’t quite as careful of artifacts and sites as we are now lol"
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"You’re welcome, it’s a 0/10 until this glitch gets fixed. Hopefully this post will lead the developers to addressing this bug."
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,👀
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"In the 1930s? 

“You sure about that?” - Tim Robinson"
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"Not even that man, I wish!"
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,Not everyone plays on Pc lol
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,Like do they not have QA testers?
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,its just a joke
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,Your mind is gonna be blown when I show you what video games can do.
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,In the 1930s?
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"Damn you’re right about that, it deserves a 1 for that. 

You hear that developers? This is a way to get yourself a guaranteed 1/10, even if you make a massive error, like not allowing people to climb a pyramid."
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,Let me explain to you about a little something called video games…
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,It just works!
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"""How much does a mountain cost? 

If you have to ask, it's not for you."""
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,Or they could put checkpoints like they have at national parks where you can buy access to it each time you enter
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,"Congratulations, you just reminded me of Better Off Dead!

""Wait a minute... this is pure snow! Do you have any idea what the street value of this mountain is?!"""
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"This is a video game, you know that right?"
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,you joke but the reason the pyramid is missing the top is because tour guides had the rocks thrown off so they could set up tables and chairs for tourists.
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"To the real archeologists, they belong to where they are staying underground. Not to be shipped back to the home world like a trophy. Stuffs are only dug up if they got exposed or are at risks of being damaged/displaced/flooded etc."
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"If not, the best!"
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"Makes sense. It was the world's tallest building until a few centuries ago, in fact"
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"Please tell me you swan dive off the peak, forgetting it's a 45 degree angle, land on your face, and go tumbling down to the ground."
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"I never did finish it, kept getting into fights I couldn't win.  I need to get back on it."
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,Just wait till you find out that most of them have entrances to go inside them as well 🥵
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-26,Pyramids have 8 sides. Does that make it an octagon
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"They have so many other great details and animations though! 

If they make more of these games, hopefully they'll add it as a feature"
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,People always forget this!
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"I love when games include it!

That said, I'd fly to the UK and punch JK Rowling in the mouth before I gave her a single dollar. So no Hogwarts Legacy for me."
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"I understand, but it should! (I'm mostly joking. I was genuinely disappointed, but I'm having a fantastic time with the game otherwise)"
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,Neopets however has Pet-Pet mechanics.
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,[deleted]
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,"Climbing it totally is today but you can go to the entrance which is in the first ""levels"" so you have to climb it a little.

Also Indy doesn't really bother with the rules in general and they weren't in application at the time."
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,Def not lol
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,Figured probably would be. Understandable few remaining original wonders left
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,Lol I know. Noticed it is on game pass going to try it this evening. Getting pretty good reviews.
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,"They might have been asked not to let people do it. If they worked with institutions that work on the pyramids, there may have been a request not to let people climb it."
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,I would assume they don't want people stealing parts of pyramid and safety obviously.  Yet there are tons of loose rock just laying around how would any one know? Lol
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,Agreed
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,I don’t own a card with raytracing. The game won’t let me start playing it because it “requires a card capable of raytracing”.
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"The 7900xtx can do ray tracing. Not as good as Nvidia cards, but it has far better ray tracing ability than even the previous gen 6000 series AMD cards. I have a 6800XT and 7700x cpu and can play the game at like 30 FPS."
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,7900xtx is capable of raytracing.
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,Lol multiple walls inside multiple temples
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"For now, if you want to see the top, check out History for Granite on YouTube."
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,Would the Nazis allow it?
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-26,"Hahaha! I just meant that maybe if you can't climb it in real life, then maybe they included that detail, for some reason, in the game."
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,It just works!
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,"“It’s a mountain, Michael, how much could it cost? $10?”"
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"Yes, I'm talking about the actual rule when visiting the actual pyramid."
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,They wouldn't have jobs if everything was left in the ground lmao what
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,Clearly you never heard about a small tiny place called the British Empire
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-27,"“Building” is a stretch… nobody lived or worked in them. Perhaps tallest man-made structure for thousands of years.

By the time of *AC: Origins*, I think the lighthouse at Alexandria was taller than the pyramids."
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"You actually just slide down most of it iirc, still pretty fun"
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,I was just in all of em IRL a couple months back!
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,I think it's about return on investment. Is spending $100k of your budget worth it? When 100k could get you a whole (simpler) cutscene instead? I mean even something small like cat's hair visibly clipping through his hand could take weeks to iron out for a complex animation like this.
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"In 1937, you could probably pay a guy to give you a piggyback ride to the top"
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"Also damage. Most monuments in Chichen Itza are no longer walkable, largely because the sheer influx of tourists was doing damage to structures. Now you have to look with your eyes, not with your feet XD"
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,You can probably do it on linux. People are saying that linux emulates the RTX.
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,You are absolutely right. Totally forgot about that.
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,I think they pretty much let anyone on their side do whatever they want as far as I’ve even been able to tell.
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"Little lies, stunning shows"
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-26,Sixteen times the details!
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,Just checking. Sometimes video games let you do stuff you're not allowed to in real life is all.
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"Archeological digs are not invasive that’s what I am saying. They are mostly protection or salvation, not going out hunt based on clues and dig for stuffs to put in museums."
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,"Yeah that’s why I was saying real archeologists, not a British colonel which Indianan jones is inspired off. Those guys’ whole mission was to take things back to home country’s museum."
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"Oh man, you'll love them game if you like Egypt. I 100% completed the game as the sights and surroundings were so damn good."
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"I think if it takes you $100,000 to animate petting a cat you should stop making video games. You’re not budgeting incorrectly or you’re doing something incredibly wrong."
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"I could, but let's be honest. I'm not going to, because I don't feel like dual installing Linux and don't have an extra system that could run it. Nor do I have a USB stick laying around anymore these days. I do appreciate the comment though!"
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,Touche 😄
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"People buy, money flows, it just works!"
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,"I'll let you know, I stop at all lights in Cyberpunk."
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,Lies!
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-24,And the fact that you're not allowed to IRL is probably why the game doesn't allow it so that they don't indirectly make some other moron think it's OK to climb a World Monument
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,What do you think they do with the things they find in the ground? Do you think they just put them back afterwards?
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,"They do those digs for *information.* The artifacts are priceless because they're surviving relics from a poorly-documented time that provide evidence of culture and activity. That evidence has to be stored and preserved, and ""the dirt under a future parking lot"" is NOT the ideal location for that. Those things DO in fact belong in a museum, in their country of origin."
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,"I've played all AC games up until syndicate since my laptop can handle the other games very well, but I can see myself 100% completing Origins like i did in Black Flag"

1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,"You are missing the point. I am saying archeological digs are mostly reactionary. They don’t typically look for them, only when the sites got exposed or damaged. Most of the time if there are indications of an area being archeological significance they won’t touch those, and those areas would be protected and off limit. So no they don’t belong in a museum, unless they have to, priority is protection not collection. Obviously they don’t put them back, but the point is they don’t touch them at the first place unless they have to.

That’s the real archeologies at least. The British colonels on the other hands, they would rip a mural off a perfectly fine historical site just to take them home"

1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,"Oh, we get your point. It is just an incredibly stupid point that is objectively false. People look for archaeological dig sites all the time (a decent chunk of the job is deciding where to search next), and they don't just place the artefacts back where they found them. They take them, and send them somewhere where they are preserved (which, in many cases, is a museum, making Indy's statement right). If it was like you were suggesting, it would be impossible to make a living from archaeology."
1i8znvv,2025-01-24,2025-01-25,"I never said they put it back, or they don’t dig. They don’t go around the world to hunt them with the goal of taking them to a museum that’s what I was saying. It’s all about protection and only dig when necessary, those process are planned, their job is not to unearth to hunt for treasure to put in the museum. Most known archeological sites are not touched, digging risk of damaging. 

My whole comment was real archeologists don’t do things because they belong in a museum. Don’t put words in my mouth I have been very clear of what I was saying this whole time. 

Anyway it’s a waste of time"

Looking at the official launch trailer, I see almost nothing that justifies those system requirements.

Assuming that the trailer is running at ultra settings with full RT (I mean, they want to show their game at its best, right?), I find the bits at [0:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQOJCrQq6hs&t=42s), [1:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQOJCrQq6hs&t=97s) and especially at [1:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQOJCrQq6hs&t=118s), particularly jarring. There is no contact shadows/occlusion whatsoever. Especially in the last bit, no occlusion between Indiana's body and the rock he's climbing on, it looks atrocious. 

Those are the examples that are easily linkable as the video has a lot of fast cuts, but there are so many more examples of what I linked above, it's honestly depressing. What is this, I'm so tired man."

-Intel i7 6700k or Ryzen 7 1800X
-8GB RAM
-GTX 1060(6GB)/970(4GB) or RX 480(8GB)

Compared to the recommended for this game, the difference is baffling. We know from experience that the iDtech 7 engine can produce wonders for what little power it requires.

1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,How is this going to work on ROG Ally X? Just picked one up and hoping to play this on it
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I feel this game seems badly unoptimized. I’m just not interested in buying a game that is going to chug.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Too demanding for a game that looks like from the late PS4 generation... but wth, that is scheduled obsolescence in a nutshell"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Well, I guess my setup is about to drop into the minimum recommended category. It’s been a good run. Good thing I was planning an upgrade in the spring anyways."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Hope my 3090 can handle it
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,So How this game gonna run on xbox series s ?
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I just started playing Dying Light 2 and I was expecting it to be unplayable all maxed out with all RT. Turns out it's very comfortably playable on aging RTX 3080. I use DLSS Quality for all games anyway so I take that as default anyway. I expect this one to run just fine despite these crazy specs. It's better to be positively surprised by overspecced requirements than having them set lower and then turn out to be more demanding.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Jeez and here I was thinking I’d play this on pc lol
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,What's with games lately having extreme high CPU requirements?
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"My laptop could play it on minimum until I got to the bottom where it talked about raytracing.

/Laptop was a gaming MSI from 2020."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I don't know anything about PCs.  So, out of curiosity, how much would the computer all the way at the right cost?  The Ultra Ray Tracing one?"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,This sounds very poorly optimized. Hopefully the Xbox can run it.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Guess the Steam Deck is out of the question 😂
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"It's beefier than Stalker 2 which is crazy. 

But also, the recommended spec is for High setting 1440p, but 32gbs? DAMN..."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Anyone actually excited for this game?
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"RTX 3080TI and 7700XT ? weird like always, I hope its just because of the vram, the 7800xt is equivalent to a non ti 3080, uh"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,First game I have seen where the recommended specs outweighs my rig in a long time. Will be fun to play
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,those minimum specs are insane.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I mean honestly this looks like 1440p’s gonna be cookin pretty damn good.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Bloody hell I’ve only just moved from a 1660 to 3070ti the past couple of weeks, enjoyed running things on ultra and having ray tracing for this to shove me back to the bottom! I know I didn’t upgrade to top tier but this, surely this alienates more pc players than gains?!"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Kinda weird for a non open world game to be so demanding.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Hot damn, better call NASA..."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Looks quite heavy, but at least that's specs for native resolution. Should obviously be a whole lot better with DLSS, even before FG."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Completely forgot this one is coming out soon. Hope it won't be shit
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,My i5 8600k is crying
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I think I need to upgrade my rx480
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Tfw you pc is minimum specs again. 😪
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Also known as, if you want to run this at max, you need a $1500 graphics card. Great. My PC has all but that."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,The last month or so is the first time I’ve ever felt like my 3080 isn’t good enough. Which is insane. I was fine with a 979 for so many years. The main issue I have been having is VRAM.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Is ray tracing even that popular? I keep seeing content creators and developers praise it. But any time I've played with it it's been so fucking minor while requiring an extreme amount of extra power.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,My pc: “guess I’ll die”
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Glad I just upgraded to a 4070 Super Ti...
Which hilariously enough came with a Steam key for The game so win-win.

Cool."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Good luck with that
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Sure the specs are large…

But 120 GB?! Jesus, game sizes have inflated so much recently."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I feel bad for having purchased a 12gb 4070 super recently. Not even out of the box and i regret 💀
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I'll just play it on my Xbox then 😃
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I wonder if it will even run on my system. I7 9700K, 32 gb ram, rtx 3080. I know my cpu is slowly getting old, but dang. First time I don't reach minimum on a game from what I have seen."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,The great circle pc sounds like something you get At ibuypower
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Well my pc is gonna smash the balls off the storage part of the spec!
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,CPU requirements are absurd.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I’ve been dreading the day I have to actually replace my PC parts cuz I’m a computer illiterate who bought a prebuilt pc. It seems that the time for me to learn about that stuff is coming lmao
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,120gb storage. No thanks
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Holy those are some big speccs. Looks like when a new game comes out in the next year that I actually want to play, I'll have to push money for a new PC."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I got a 4080super that came with the code for this game. Don’t really care for it. If someone has a extra code for wukong ,I’d trade it"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"R5 3600 + 2060 gets you 60 fps on LOW. Rip

Currently play through stalker and with performance enhancing mods I’m getting 50-60 fps in areas with high NPCs, and 80-110 elsewhere. 

I feel like my parts arnt even that old, but we’re mid tier when I bought them."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Will be better on PS5 Pro
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,My i7 9700k has no fucking chance... I really wanted to play this game and my big payout isn't coming till February which is when I was planning to upgrade :(
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"All you need is a 4080 for recommended, what's the big deal? 

Doesn't everybody have one?"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Yeah this is a lot, I was thinking about buying a pc but with my budget it would be obsolete in two years oh well console it is"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Cries in 2080 super - sad to see my gpu be reflected more towards the minimum specs. It’s been a good 6 years, but almost due for an update."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Just bake the lighting FFS, it looks 90% as good as the lumen shite."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I'm a massive Indiana Jones fan and I was really hoping to play the Great Circle, but I just won't be able to.
I'm basically THE target audience for this game so I'm seriously worried about this game's success.
I still have a GTX980 (which was enough to run Doom Eternal to be fair) but that's just not good enough anymore and I can't afford an upgrade.
I'm hoping it's actually a great game so I'm trying to prevent spoilers as much as possible now and maybe get a PS5 come March."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Jesus, you can fund the next Indiana Jones film for the cost to run the damn game at Ultra with Ray Tracing"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,where my 1080ti boys at? still relevant!!
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Is having 8 gb of vram a bad thing. Do I need to upgrade?
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,I guess I'm waiting for the PS5 Pro version! My PC barely meets the minimum.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,welp guess i need to upgrade from my 1080
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,For those specs it better look fucking spectacular.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,They call him Belloch.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"After playing the story, what replay value is there after?"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,\*weeps in 1660 super\*
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I just scrapped on 3060 this year. I'm so much hate pc gaming.. literally can't play old games i like anymore cuz they doesn't compatible with current hardware, can't play new games.."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Good thing I upgraded my 3060 to a 4070 last year
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,That's is wow...
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,I have just bought a 4070 laptop and seems the 8 gb of memory will start to be a problem =/
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Does this look better than Arkham Knight (2015)?
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"There’s a reason it’s a gift with purchase for 40 series graphics cards, this game is basically a tech demo for Nvidia."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Well, now my 2080 and ryzen 3800x feel old"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,I only got a 5900x/4080 Super hope I'll be able to hit 4k with RT as long as i use dlss and FG :\\
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Well, this went from a must buy to a I'll check the reviews for performance.  Those are some really high requirements."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Wtf
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Let me guess the engine being used is UE5?🙄
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Can’t wait for the “Indiana jones locked 40FPS on steam deck! “ videos
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Look, it's a really big circle"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Games get more “photo-realistic” yet more bland and more demanding every year.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Regardless of the specs, who doesn't think this game with flop beyond belief?"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"RIP 1060 6gb. You served us well.

Also, I think this is the first game where the lowest settings are still aiming for 60fps? Usually it's a 1060 or something aiming for 30fps so there may still be life in the old girl."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,My sigh of relief that I don't need to replace my gaming laptop just yet
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,I imagine it probably won’t take longer for PC modders to find a way to disable RT entirely.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"That's going to be a problem, how is it supposed to run on a bloody console?"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Seems to be because of raytracing, which only rtx cards can use.

And the target is 60 fps, the specs look better than the recent unreal 5 games we had.

Game is made with id tech aswell so no annoying stutter."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Damn I’ll take this as a hint that this is not going to be very well optimized
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Jesus christ is it THAT good? That's extremely hard to believe.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"If they put so much energy on making it look good and need a super computer to play then they put the same energy in making it fun right, right ?"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Wow. I only meet recommended.. can usually run ultra
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Hot damn. Is the new meme going to be “But can it run Indiana Jones and the Great Circle?!”
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,I can bet that this game is optimize badly.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I mean honestly, we came to the point where things are starting to be a little bit ridiculous. I know there is customer push for realistic graphic and all - but every triple A game released lately is 120+ GB. This is pretty insane.

And I think its also no wonder these companies are in big trouble now. These games have such high production values and are required to have 100 hours of fully voiced/cutscened content that it takes them years and hundreds of developers to make them, ballooning the budgets to hundreds of millions. 

Not defending them or nothing - just saying that things are bit out wack , both for players with this ridiculous system requirements , and for companies that overspend on this gigantic games."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,This is what I get for having 64GB of RAM and 6GB of VRAM.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I wonder if 8700k still ok paired with 3080ti here. Yea think I'm good. Hope there's a DLSS option available. Knowing game pass, it's usually added way later though. "
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Yep, that's gonna run like shit. 

But we arrive at a generation where optimizing a game is a waste of time with upscaling/ frame generation 

*add surprised pikachu face*"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Looks like Steam Deck is a nope then if they need RT.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,That honestly looks like machine games didn't bother to optimise the game at all (or maybe bethesda didn't give them the time to do so)
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Maaaaaan but what about High 1080p NO RT?
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,I wonder if people will complain about these spec requirements as much as with STALKER 2 (which were lower than this).
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,So I sit somewhere between recommended and ultra.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,bro this is gona run like shit onr serie s
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"120Gb for a single game

This has to stop"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Wow, that's high. Time to start saving for a PC upgrade if this becomes the norm soon."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Good lord what is happening to gaming
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,I'm so fucking tired.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"what on earth?! You have to even activate DLSS with 4090, they are nuts."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Looks like heavy textures, based on the GPU recs, as those seem to be based purely on available VRAM. Because 3080ti/7700xt and 4080/7900xt aren't even really near each other in terms of performance, otherwise.

  
Altho methinks they're somewhat overestimating the pull of the franchise in this day and age, if they think it's gonna be a hardware seller to that degree."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Its time to buy a new gpu, gtx 1080 ti, my beloved, your time has come"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,With system requirements like this game streaming makes more sense 😌
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Wow... my not yet 1 year old 7800x3d and 4070 system is barely at the recommended specs.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"These reqs are out of hand. Where is the limit? Yesterday, I played an hour of the Witcher 3, and then an hour of Dragon Age: The Veilgaurd. And I'll be honest with you, the graphics in DAV are really good, and of course they are better than the Witcher 3. But the Witcher 3's graphics are still decent, and the game is 9 years old and to get the improvement in graphics we have now I think the requirements are too high. I feel we have hit the point of diminishing returns. Like does every new AAA mean your comp needs all this high end stuff. Like how much better are the graphics going to get, and what will they require?"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,besides exceeding everything other spec is my 4070 Ti super on ultra wide going to struggle?
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,And people are saying there's no point of owning a console
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,When you tought your RX7800xt would last like 3 years when you bought in 1 year ago but now already contemplating getting a new GPU..
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Looks like I’m about to watch some no commentary play throughs on YouTube
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,pizza tower meme moment when see the medium rt
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Yee yee ahh Star Citizen specs
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Bullshit cartel between devs and he manufacturers again
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Holy mother of... Ok I'm playing it on Xbox or PS5 then. What happened to ""nobody needs more than 16GB of memory"" lol"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Welp. Guess I'm getting this game on Xbox, then."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"That's funny because my rig is literally the recommended spec.
But I'll still try the ultra RT setting to see how it runs lol"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"its not the requirements that get me, it is all the DLC that gets me."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I'm starting to get the feeling a lot of people, like myself, hit 2080 level of graphics cards and then haven't upgraded in ages. Most games for the longest of times looked really good still even on their lower settings but it seems time is catching up with us and we are being forced to upgrade. My PC doesn't feel old in my head but when I checked the other day it was about 5 years old now making it one of the oldest completely unchanged rigs I've ever owned."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,I'm excited to wait 5 years after launch for it to be on sale for 10 bucks so I can run it completely patched at more than 30fps on decent hardware.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"my tired 1080 seems like its on its last legs :( 

its done well to last this long. Shame I can't justify spending 5k+ to upgrade to something new. Oh well"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Any spec(ha)ulation on what the Great Circle is?
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"""minimum "" RT =>RTX 4070 .

Is this a fucking joke ?"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,So the game won't run at all in 1660 ti ?
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Why does the game not look anywhere near as good as those specs would suggest?
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Ten digits above the minumum GPU for an Indiana Jones game...oooph
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"You can always play without ray tracing, at 1080p, or at 45fps, but I will always say that I prefer visually less impressive games and more stability in performance and that more players can play with their pc configuration."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Lemmie guess, UE5…"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Ok, it looks like the push for new specs are in full force now. Can’t get by with Ryzen 3600X, Radeon 5700 and 16Gb RAM anymore.

But I’m still pushing 60 FPS on Cyberpunk on high settings with UHD resolutions, so I’ll stick to that."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"""SSD required""  
Yeah, about that... i only trust my sturdy but slower HDDs. 

Does that mean i won't be able to play the game?"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,This is why i prefer console. It forces shitty devs to actually try and optimize their buggy ass game instead of just slapping 4090 as a gpu requirement
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Weird the specs of so high considering every trailer for it has made the game look like nothing demanding.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"if the target is always 60fps,then why is there such a big change in recommended CPU ?"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Man my setup is meeting the minimum requirements...lol
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Is it just the norm now to not optimise your video game? 

These specs are absolutely ridiculous…"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,My RX580 can probably still run this.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Did we officially enter the age of 16gb ram being the minimum norm?
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,What the hell is going on with those CPU requirements??
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"It's only me or game requirements have skyrocketed this last year? It is like suddenly, if you don't have a 4080, it's impossible to play these new games."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"The graphics don't even look that good in the preview ?  I have a 5600x, 16gb ram, and a 3060 ti... Minimum?!!!!!"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Developers don't even try anymore.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Anyone who has watched the reveals or trailers will notice there isn’t a lot of actual gameplay among all those graphics. And to be fair, why would there be? Gamers have proven (through financial support and speaking with their wallets) for decades now the only thing they care about is awesome graphics and preorder bonuses. So shocker, that’s what we get a ton of nowadays, and people just eat it up while bitching online about it. 🤷🏻‍♂️"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"This is bullshit, too

1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Well. I can handle the minimum required RAM.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Probably is going to look worse than indiana jones and the infernal machine.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Nah, not gonna buy that, i rather download Spelunky  classic and put the Indiana Jones Theme on repeat"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Currently upgrading my cpu/ram/mb, sorta wish I'd gone 64gb now. Its not just games, everything seems to be hogging more memory lately."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I know the engines are different, the methods of developing, it's final output, and the hardware limitations is part of this, too, but it always astonishes me that Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom are like 16gb and 32gb total in size each. They are so well optimized compared to a lot of the AAA studios nowadays."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,well duh its a next gen game lolll

1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,I just bought a new 4TB nvme SSD the other day and it's already half full of games so I think I'm good for now lmao.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,Requiring raytracing is absolute BS and I'm sure it's going to bite them in the ass when it comes to sales.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,Eventually a game will come along and stop supporting systems over five years old. This doesn't feel too unfair.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,"So with ""full RT"" whatever that means (PT?) your 4070 becomes a 1080p/30 fps card. Don't you just love the future. Thanks NVIDIA!"

1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,"I've seen the graphics of that game. They do no warrant these specs. 

This smells of poor optimization."

1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-06,"With the quality of the visual, this PC requirements are straight up unbelievable. I wonder HOW Dead Island 2 could look damn beautiful, with such a low requirement.

1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-16,"I’m disappointed that the devs didn’t create alternatives to the RT lighting so I could run it acceptably on my rtx 3060 mobile card.
Hopefully they either patch in a fix or I’ll have to wait until the ps5 release."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-16,It’s because the forced rt for some reason tho my 4080 can usually handle a lot if I try to turn this game to anything above 1080p it crashes and I can’t open it with 1440 or 4k going same if I change the textures above medium anyone got a fix?
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-17,I was able to run mine off an HDD drive with a slightly below specs processor and a barely minimum RAM and graphics card and it still worked smoothly and even at low setting graphics looked great to me.

That's a 6 year old system designed for 1080p still holding up to a current gen AAA title in 1080p. You need a 4080 for 4k that's also realistic. Did you expect to see 4k 120 on a 3070 and an 8th gen i5? Given the headline I was expecting much higher requirements. Last gen 80 series for 1440p sounds right too. I got a radeon 6950xt specifically to go along with my jump from 1080 to 1440, and that card is on par with a 3090ti. These requirements look good for a modern AAA game."

1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,A 2060 at 1080p 60 seems very reasonable to me it's a 6 year old low tier card and it still seems to run the game fine.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Are the specs a problem if nobody plays it? 🤔
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"To be fair, these are for 60 fps, native resolutions for non RT and minimum specs targeting 1080p

We've seen more modest specs with additional note that these are for enabled dlss or even FG, 30 fps and 720p for minimum 

At least these are honest, and I believe we could play 1080p60 mid-high or 1440p with dlss on a more common gpus"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,A 2060 or for 1080p 60fps in low settings. Wtf.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,How is my graphics card already hitting recommended
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Isn't a 2060 for minimum to 3080ti for recommended a wild jump?

1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,It’s not that hefty right? An RTX 4080 can run it at 4K NATIVE without DLSS. Only the full ray tracing / path tracing modes seem very hard to run. But that’s understandable.

At least they're not using upscaling and frame generation for the requirements (outside of the full ray tracing requirements), like some other games lately."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"It's id tech 7, Doom Eternal's engine but modified of course. Eternal ran 100fps+ at 5160x2160 on a 3080 Ti with max RT. This should not be that much different to be honest."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Seems like a low intellect decision.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Then I'll force myself not to play this game.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"There’s a huge misunderstanding amongst consumers regarding the purpose behind the existence of ray tracing, I’d say largely thanks to nvidia’s extremely successful RTX marketing campaign that they’ve used to sell overpriced hardware that is well below spec across the board if you ignore ray tracing capability. Ray tracing exists to make lighting computer generated graphics easier, that’s the only reason it exists. Those RTX comparison videos that make ray tracing look like a shiny luxury for rich gamers are a complete misrepresentation of both current popular lighting technology and ray tracing technology. There is a reason some of the games used in initial RTX advertising later launched without ray tracing at all.

Honestly, anybody that genuinely believes ray tracing looks remarkably better than standard lighting techniques has been chug jugging the kool-aid. It looks fine, but that’s fine if you understand the actual purpose of its existence, which is not necessarily to look better than other technology.

Edit: re-reading this I don’t think my actual point was very clear. It is extremely likely that many major releases will “force” ray tracing in the near future. It’s not common now because it greatly reduces the size of the market publishers are able to sell to, but eventually the time and money saved by using ray tracing will surpass the sales loss experienced as a result of a ray tracing capability requirement. This is certainly what happened in this case, so all the people that think they’re sticking it to the man by proudly saying they won’t buy this game because it won’t run on their PC are having no impact. As more games require ray tracing more people will upgrade to ray tracing capable hardware and eventually what is perceived as anti-consumer in this instance will be completely ignored. This is the way technological advancement has always worked in the industry."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,what’s rt
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Damn. I had a feeling this was the case.

1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,So this is the first game my 1660ti should never touch. Gotcha
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I fucking hate RT.  The best RT in the world isn't worth a single frame drop.  That shit is such a gimmick.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I couldn't care less about rt.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I upgraded to that awhile ago cause of custom assets in City Skylines.  But being standard now is crazy
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Yeah, I feel ""need"" is a strong word, here"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I've found that these games like Stalker and Flight Sim don't need 32 GB of RAM, but they need more than 16gb. They seem to go up to about 18-19 GB at any one time.

In saying that, if you were streaming at the same time, it might get up near 32 GB."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,At least RAM is cheap. These GPU requirements combined with GPU prices are ludicrous
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,\*lazy dev era
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,64 ddr5 ram costs about 200-300$
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,16gb crowd is starting to look really worried. In a few years time devs will force us to require 64gb.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Yeah, my next build that I’m planning next year will have 64gb ram. I have 16 now."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,I've been running 64gb for years and years now
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Dude it was only 2 year ago people said it was the 16bit era wtf is happening
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"it's been 32 for quite a while now, even ordinary apps these days start taking more ram."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Couldn't believe my brand new gaming pc Couldn't run beam ng due to ram. 

Never had a problem from ram before with any other game."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,It doesn't need at all.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"And the niche 64GB of RAM is actually used by a couple of games too.  
32GB has been the new standard for the past 2 or 3 years"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Wonder how consoles are going to fare with their 12-13gb or so of memory reserved for games. Xbox only has 10gb reserved as high speed memory.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-06,Haven’t we always been here? 32gb been the recommended amount on pcs for aslong as I can remember
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-08,this is not a good thing

1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"> Stalker 2

Another unoptimized mess.  Microsoft needs to give these devs more time to optimize."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,DDDR5 modules have a max of 512GB each. With 4 slots you can have over 1TB of RAM
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I'm with you on that, I'm still on a 1070, and I've been out for awhile. I'm most surprised my i7-9700K doesn't even meet minimum specs, I guess at some point soon my PC is due for a full facelift (aside from only just recently switching from an HDD to SDD lmao). I at least take solace in knowing my Series X can do the heavy lifting at this point in the generation for most newer games."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Which is ridiculous. I'm worried about how long my 3080 is gonna last.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Sitting on a 2080 also, waiting for the 50 series to show up.

More and more games lately where turning settings down a bit doesn't cut it anymore"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Jokes on ya. I'm still going strong with my 1080ti
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I’m rocking my i7-9700k oc with the 2080ti. And still I won’t cut the mustard.

1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Shittiest card i have ever bought. Never in my life have i bought a high end gpu that felt outdated that quickly.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Or they just didn't optimize their game....
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,My 5700xt used to be the minimum and now it's gone :(
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Pfft, my RX580 just had a heart attack reading those requirements"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Bro I have a 3080 and that seems like it's heading towards obsolescence when the recommended needs a 3080Ti. The fuck.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Me too, I have a 2080S, I would like to upgrade, but my other parts will need to go, so it’s a hefty purchase to justify currently."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Yeah my 2080 super seems obsolete when looking at this game and MH Wilds
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I finally upgraded from my 2070 Super to a 4070 Super last week since I anticipate GPUs to become much more expensive due to tariffs, China just announced a ban on rare minerals to the US as well so it seems like it was a good idea."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,I just upgraded from a 1660ti to a 4080S and I got this game for free with purchase at microcenter. Given these spec requirements it doesn't look like I chose correctly lmao
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I'm in the same boat with a 2080S. My CPU is a 3800x. I already have 32gb of ram at least. My thinking right now for upgrades is to either:

1. Upgrade my CPU to the 5700x3D or 5800x3D
2. Upgrade the GPU to something better in the Nvidia 40xx or AMD 7xxx range
3. Do both of the above
4. Or, do nothing and ride this machine out while waiting for the next console system specs and build something better than what those will be.

The last one is what I essentially did with my current machine, and is likely what I'll do this time around, too. 3800x is the same CPU (but not cut back like in PS and XB) and the 2080S is better on paper than the what PS and XB have. I don't mind waiting and tinkering with settings to make games playable. I got two young kids so 2026/2027 will be here before I know it haha."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Hell my 3080 Ti doesn’t meet the ultra requirements, which is a new experience for me. And my 12700k doesn’t either. At least I had the foresight to get 32GB RAM when I built this thing about two years ago."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,"I JUST upgraded from my 1660 super to a 4070 which, according to this, doesnt even meet recommended (3080 TI is slightly better). Ironically enough I got this game as a free download along with my 4070"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-11,"Yuuup, currently hitting a whopping 11 fps on mine at medium 1440 🙃"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"As the gap between the rich and the poor widens, the gap between average game specs and new releases specs does too"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It's a 6 year old graphics card... 
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Upgraded from a 980Ti to a 4080 super last week and now I see this 😂
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"To be fair, you might be able to play it at max settings, at 1080P lol"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I used to make fun of the series s for holding back the generation, but now I realize it's the only thing forcing devs to actually put the tiniest of attention to optimization"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Series S will probably be 720p using FSR
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"That might explain why it’s a 10700k (8C/16T) versus a 3600 (6C/12T).  The console hardware is Zen 2.  

It’s the 7900X for max which scares me.  Does it really make good use of that many threads?  Of it does it’s both refreshing to see a game be that aggressively multithreaded and scary to see given that most people are on 6 or 8 core machines."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"the Series X is much higher gpu wise. Series X iirc has 52 CU cores, which  is partway between a RX 6700xt and a RX 6800 (to put in perspective, a PS5 is about a 6700). The Minimum is a 6600, which is below PS5 spec(but not like far below). Series S is definately going to chug though as it's GPU crippled (6600 is a 28 CU part, Series S has access to 20) All RDNA2 generation."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,1440 and 60fps on a 4080 is a crime.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,You mean you don't want to pay £300 more to see somewhat shiny reflections in puddles?
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Metro Exodus Enhanced is still the visual/performance goat for RT.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,welcome to the Nvidia mindshare that valued Raytracing more than Raster Performance.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,fuck raytracing
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,The whip physics better be better than real life.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,If you don't use RT the tax is 0 XD
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,People should start to adapt to newer hardware instead. No use to hold back on technological advancement just because people expect the latest games to run with max settings on their 1080 in 2024/25.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Consoles always had, to some extent, graphically dumbed down versions of a game. You really think the consoles run at the same equivalent graphics settings as a PC?"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Bethesda published doom, id software actually made the games."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Right ? I assumed it would be on UE5 as this seems to be a trend but it's on Idtech 7 and Doom Eternal looked and ran great.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Bethesda is only publishing this game, MachineGames is making it. Like when they published Dishonored for Arkane Studios"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Ya something is wrong.


Wolfenstein 2 and Doom Eternal are the best visual/performance games on the market."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It's not even comparable what they're doing with the visuals between these games.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,id Tech 7 is amazing and well optimized. Ray Tracing is just expensive to run. It's going to be the way forward whether everyone here likes it or not. It actually makes game development easier so they don't have to bake lighting in all the scenes and it also makes things possible that were not before.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,[deleted]
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Absolutely insane I will ofc wait for the benchmarks but if 4070 ti super 7800x3d struggles with rt on 1440p then I'm not even sure what these devs are doing anymore.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Only upside, I don’t have to actually buy it."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"imho, it makes a game look bad and I won't ever give it a shot if the recommend GPU is one that released a year ago."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I'd normally agree with you, but I'm a little sketched out by their own admission that the target is 60fps. Don't get me wrong, 60fps is great. But if that's the high end ""target"" fps, it doesn't exactly instill confidence in ""purposefully overshoot the specs"". Sounds like they're hoping you get to 60fps, even with those crazy requirements."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,That’s a thing of the past. People said the same thing about stalker 2 and it ended up actually having undersold requirements which is fucking ludicrous considering they’re already high as hell.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I'm surprised Indiana Jones is still a thing in the first place or that there's enough interest to justify another game.

Making it super dependent on high end hardware will not help."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,There are other GPUs
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Still confused why so much effort into...Indiana Jones.

Prob should have put some effort into the movies first"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"100%, my 1070 felt like it lasted me about 6 years lol"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It's the recommended OS even for the highest of settings. I'm gonna take this as throwing shade at Windows 11.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Honestly that's a pretty good run considering just how fast graphical demand has outstripped hardware performance these last couple generations.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Their ""medium"" is native 1440p 60fps on high settings."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Ti
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"What 'medium'? The middle option which mentions high settings at 1440p?

Change the *settings* to medium, use some upscaling and I don't think I'll have any problems with my 3060Ti."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,I'm genuinely wondering why studio executives and publishers allow this specs race. Surely it doesn't make any financial sense to slash your potential target audience?
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Right ? Whose idea was that ? From my friends and I most of us don't bother with Raytracing. It's just too system intensive currently to be worth it.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,That’s native 4k though. Which tbh is a waste of time when DLSS exists.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Good thing I still use 1080p so my 4070 should run it just fine
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,That’s what has me scratching my head. I’m still pretty sure cyberpunk runs it on a 3090.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,It’s just this game. Even listing a 4090 for ultra is insanity.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,The game will run fine on your setup. Don’t let exaggerated system specs scare you off. Look at the requirements of Alan Wake 2 and how it performed perfectly fine even on mid-range hardware.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,"I'm a RT fan, and even I agree. It just doesn't look good enough in most games that utilize it. RT requires scenes that are fully designed around them to be worth it, but most games don't because they still have to be able to fall back to a rasterized renderer.

Even then, the performance hit is really painful if you don't want to use blurry upscaling."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"it all started with requiring SSD's

people said ""sure. i'll pay a lil more"" going from 50$ to 150$? no issue.

...so they're like. well we dont have to optimize load times. they can just buy an SSD. 

slippery slope happened. i called it back 2 years ago. 

and now we need a GPU from a year ago to run on minimum. yeah this looks about right.

going from 200$ to 600$? sure why not. oop. well now you need to go from 600$ to 1000$

when people give in to blatant consumerism. this is what it sows. its all tiny stepping blocks.

netflix has done it too. and other streaming services follows suite. 

and people insulted and called me crazy 🤷‍♂️ i'm just noticing patterns"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Specs here are no joke… like I’m over here complaining Alan Wake 2 and Monster Hunter Wild having pretty high system requirements. Even with the idea that things optimized/improve over time, it is still sign things will get worst with 5000 series cards in the horizon."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Devs can't bother to optimize anymore
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,those are the path-tracing specs. Youy need heavy dlss and framegen to stay above 90 with cyberpunk in pathtracing mode at 4K output.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,4k eats FPS like crazy
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I don't get how these specs are getting so much higher when games don't even look much better.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,This is on id tech 7 and developed by MachineGames. MachineGames also makes Wolfenstein which is beautifully optimized! They can do better.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,This shot says “full ray tracing requirements”. I just hope ray tracing isn’t forced on and there is an off or adjustable option.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,As a passionate Steam Deck enjoyer....I wouldn't tbh.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,It's id Tech.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,RX 6600 graphics cards support hardware ray tracing. What contradiction are you speaking of?
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"This is my biggest upset, it doesn't even look good."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"It probably doesn't, but nobody will put 20 or 24GB in their recommendations for ram,since  now a days you either have 16 or 32GB"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"No one knows for sure yet, but user speculation suggests that it won't."

1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I bought pretty much that exact same PC last year and it cost about 6.5kAUD. That didnt include things like a good 1440p 165hz monitor/mouse/keyboard/headphones which I already had.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,That's for the full RT mode.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,"Nope, no RTX support, and RT is mandatory according to this.

You could probably force it, like when I forced my 1070ti to play the raytraced version of Quake 2, but it's not going to be playable."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,">You can always play without ray tracing

You can't, it's required."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,Why? SSDs are better in pretty much every way when it comes to gaming.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,we must not be looking at the same screenshot. wilds is horrifyingly worse. higher requirement for lower resolution WITH upscaling AND FRAMEGEN
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,With wilds I at the absolute least handwave it because Japanese devs just don't seem to care about pc by in large. But this is the same studio behind wolfenstein who did an amazing job with those games for pc
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Optimization is a lost art and Nvidia killed it. Why optimize when you can AI upscale it all to 4K and interpolate the frames? Anyway, you'll still need a 4000 series GPU. So that'll be a lotta cash."

1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Why wouldn't it be enough for 1080p on high settings? They have the 3080ti listed for 1440p 60fps on high settings and it's only about 10% faster.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I just got a 4070 ti super and it comes with this game and can't even run it medium apparently. Came with it as an nvidia pack in ""Max settings ready"". It'd be a joke if it wasn't so anti funny. I feel your pain, I just dropped a load to upgrade and now this kinda BS."

but apparently not.. ""Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will require a GPU that supports hardware Ray Tracing. So, to run the game""

12 months ago only 44% of pc gamers had rtx enabled gfx cards.

1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Read the fine print at the bottom. This is frame generation and upscaled. A 4080 for high settings at 1440p but with DLSS balanced (below 1080p) and frame generation is terrible
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"The 3080ti is still a great GPU, it's just that this game appears to have awful optimization."

1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"It's stupidly hefty. 40'series is not common, despite you would get the impression if reading reddit. Even the minimum specs are kinda insane. And so far, the trailers definitely didn't justify specs like that.

Looks like ass, hard pass."

1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"At least with the ""Full RT Requirements"" there's at least partially a reason. Apparently those settings are actually Path Tracing, so insanely demanding even beyond the high standards of demanding games released recently. I don't expect many people to actually experience the game that way, I'll just stick to Recommended settings (maybe Ray Reconstruction if it's available) then smile and wave."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"That's a good point, I didn't catch that since I've gotten so used to these sheets putting it in there."

1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Ray tracing. Hyper realistic lighting and shadow rendering technique that requires dedicated hardware to run at anything that isn't a slideshow. And even with said dedicated hardware you still often need some clever upscaling trickery to get it to run at a smooth framerate.

Anyway, this one's looking like it wasn't optimized at all. Which is a shame, Machine Games usually do a pretty good job at that."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Ray tracing. Dynamic generation of light and reflections. Looks awesome on a high end rig, but is computationally difficult."

1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Then you have a very old card.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"on the flip side  - I would gladly play in 30fps on my 4090 if it meant 100% accurate path traced lighting.

1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I'm on 1070 also! Looks like we both won't be able to play this game.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Dude, my 1070 got me SO far, even when I switched to 1440p.  I was still able to push games on medium to 45 fps maybe 2-3 years ago.  Such a good card.  If you got it in 2017, I'd say good for you and that you likely got your monies worth for sure!"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,I have a 9700k and 2080 and I’ve found myself playing more games on console. Especially ones like this.  It’s easier than dealing with setting and whatnot.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I've played other games where the 9700k hasn't met minimum specs, but with 32gb ram and a beefy card it hasn't caused an issue, especially at 1440p"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I've got the same CPU and it's frustrating that it's not on there. 

I did upgrade my graphics card to an Rx 7900xtx from a 2080 this year though, so maybe that will bring me over the line."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I guess now, since it’s now below the recommended specs?!?  That’s absurd."

Edit: on that note, does anybody have awareness of which released games *require* baseline ray tracing hardware support even for RT off settings?


I know of Alan Wake 2 and now Indy. Are there others?"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Im going to assume anyone that cant afford to buy a computer in a first world country is a jobless bum. 7900xtx 9800x3d with nice parts is like 2400-2500€ you can skimp out and get it for like 2100-2200€ with the lowest tier stuff.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,How much did you get the super for?
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,There are NASA and space X employees in the local pokemon go group I'm in. None of them can run the game they said. Its pure insanity. People say you need NASA computers but even NASA folks can't. One simply does not try to usurp the old Crysis meme with your game.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,This is why I have never paid attention to a spec sheet the last 10 years. The higher tiers always put higher cpu threads and/ram when it just doesn't need them
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Series X nvidia side is like a 2070S so the min is even lower than that

1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Insanity in fact.  3rd most power consumer GPU to run the game at ""mid"" resolution and at 60 fps.  I would expect a 4080 to run at least 120.  Let's hope it's really 100 and they just round down to 60..."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,With full ray tracing? Absolutely reasonable.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Ray tracing will EVENTUALLY be so common that nobody will care.... We just haven't reached the point yet and this is gatekeeping so many people from even looking at playing this game.

1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"RT is more much more than that reflections, the best visual upgrade is illumination and shadows. Tho this seems unreasonable specs even if it's PT"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,The stupidest thing Nvidia did was make people believe raytracing applies only to reflections. Otherwise comments like these wouldn’t exist.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"If you think RT = shiny reflections in puddles, I have some news for you"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Control was really good too. I originally started it as a tech demo and then I forgot about the ray tracing entirely and started enjoying the game lol.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Actually, if you take any given console and any given PC with the equivalent hardware of that console, the console will likely outperform the PC, because the game has been optimized specifically for the console's hardware.

As a general rule, PCs only exceed consoles when they have significantly better hardware."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Pound-for-pound, consoles blow PCs out of the water when it comes to performance."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"They don't dumb things down, they stop devs from creating insane hardware specs for games. Without consoles to hold the team back, this game wouldn't be optimized for anything under a 3080."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Wouldn’t a realistic game with forced RT on UE5 have similar or even higher spec reqs?
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I know, I meant the wolfesnstein games were equally as optimized as the doom games"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Well the non raytracing requirements still require a 4080 for 4k 60. I’m assuming and hoping this is without DLSS.

And who cares if it’s easier for devs to implement? The cost ain’t going down for us. If these companies could make these games for 50% the price that price tag still staying at $70.

And if raytracing becomes standard, that means settings that don’t rely on raytracing will
Most likely begin to look worse and worse as time goes on."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"But judging by this sheet, you cant turn off RT, so…"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Read the bottom of the sheet. It explicitly says that hardware RT is **required** even for minimum specs.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"That's also aiming for 1440p as well mind. At 1080 it's going to be a bit more achievable, maybe? Though if its also  forcing RT as it seems to be then you're already limiting a lot of people out."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"This been in development for years alongside new movie, Indiana had movie released last year so one can assume that movie+AAA game project was Disney's way to revitalize the IP. 

Todd Howard also always wanted to make Indiana game thats why hes executive producer on that project so yeah."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"i'm aware, But i'm basing it off their requirement image."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Agreed. The last Indiana Jones movie worth watching came out 35 years ago.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Windows editions are like Star Trek movies - every other one is good
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Leave it to gamers to not read anything and just make assumptions based on where the GPU is located in the graph lol it's so annoying. It even says 1440p NATIVE, not even upscaled (upscaling is shown in the ray tracing section)."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Especially since I'm sure that ray tracing won't be absolutely incredible and barely noticeable.. Every time I'm told ""you'll see, ray tracing is a game changer"" and in the end the only difference is what? Reflections on  a windows.. Like really? Ray tracing annoys me. Can't we make more beautiful games anymore? We're going to force developers to make lighting effects that you don't notice anymore and that divide your frame rate by 3, so that you continue to buy GPUs.

And the worst part is that you always have a guy who will defend ray tracing like his mother because he spent $1500 on a card."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Yeah native 4k in really stupid at this point.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,Considering that there's no rasterization fallback for this game it might mean that they've built the game around raytracing. Guess we'll find out when reviews drop.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Yup for sure! But a 4090 should be able to handle 60fps without needing to use frame gen and DLSS
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Right? I watched the trailer and in certain lighting the character models look made out of clay
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,What? You don't want to see ALL HAIRS on the main character face in full 8k resolution?

1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"My bad here... somehow I thought about a different one... 

So does that mean that the non full RT has only traced shadows, right?"

1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I definitely agree that current optimization in the industry is..lacking. Very lacking. And I’ll concede that the “minimum” in this chart is too high and it’s because of forced ray tracing, which is obviously done so they don’t have to spend time implementing their own lighting system (aka, lazy shortcuts)."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,"No? Most new triple A games can’t do that. But I guess you also can’t in this game with all the graphic options turned on lol. 

Native 4K is unnecessarily expensive"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Sure it doesn’t look that great.

But even an RTX 2060 can run this game at NATIVE 1080p @60fps. That’s absolutely not bad at all. 

Normally these specs are with up scaling. 

Only the full path traced specs looks very heavy, but that’s always the case, and I don’t know if we’ve even seen the game with this. I hope it looks much better with it on."

1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"That game is going to run on a Series S. So unless the resolution goes down dynamically to 480p during forced ray tracing scenes, I’d wager that there won’t be forced ray tracing on Xbox"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Yeah... tomb raider did that in ps1.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"It doesn't technically require dedicated hardware to run at acceptable framerates to be fair though. Xbox One X had two games with ray tracing with no hardware acceleration: Gears 5 and Crysis Remastered.

This game is looking like it's optimized perfectly fine for having hardware accelerated RT as a base feature. Most games using UE5 and Software Lumen can't even average 60fps on a 4090 at 4K and they have a 4080 listed for that here with hardware RT. The few games that have hardware Lumen enabled the 4090 drops under 50fps at 4K"

1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Yeah, it's only truly noticeable while walking around slowly and staring at the environment. Moment to moment gameplay it won't matter much.

1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Yeah I kinda exaggerated by saying it's stable lol. I get lag spikes and frequent crashes but it's still completely playable, I've put like 70 hours into it

Make sure you're in exclusive fullscreen and use DLSS and frame generation, play a little bit more with the settings (global illumination is the one that has the most impact on performance) 

And use one of the performance mods on nexus!  This can completely fix performance issues depending on your config"

I’m just concerned about us hitting a gpu performance wall before that can happen - because obviously casually hitting 250 fps+ ray tracing is gonna require an insane amount of power…. They can only go so small on architecture… isn’t it like 1nm or somethin where quantum tunneling becomes an issue? And already at 4 or 5nm with the 4090?
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,I'm surprised there's still RT deniers out here
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Upscaling won't go away. Now that it's in the open, it allows developers to be lazy and just rely on it to fix their piss poor code."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Reflections are actually one thing done REALLY well using non-RT tricks.

What RT does better than anything is reflective illumination and soft glow. That's why Cyberpunk 2077 looks so incredible with it on. The amount of chrome and neon in that game really pushes it. Basically made for RT.

I can imagine that RT is pretty important in the tomb exploration sections of the game, with sunlight shining through gaps in the stone. Never looks as great when you fake it."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I agree but without RT it still looks good. Metro with full RT for the lighting is transfomative.

I have had my 4080 since 2022, so I figure I'll replace it in 2025-26 depending on what games I want to run at 4k + Ray Tracing. 3-4 years to be near the top setting is great."

1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"There haven't been any AAA games that have been built from the ground up with a fully RT art and asset pipeline. In this case, with much of the game taking place in cave systems, the ability to have a dynamic light that bounces (something raster lighting can't do) would help greatly in making those kinds of environments more dynamic and convincing.

People might not notice, regardless. It's easy to take a visual effect for granted when it looks correct."

Hell there are quite a few games where RT actually just makes a game look WORSE, or best case scenario, different. I’m not losing fuckin fps for “different”, either be a noticeable improvement or don’t even bother. "
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I prefer a less realistic, more stylized look anyway. Games with stylized looks don't need high specs to look amazing."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I didn't pay attention to that honestly, thats terrible. So...what does full ray tracing mean if they force it on anyway I wonder? What a piece of shit game to do that. Seriously. Does this mean on Xbox it will be below 30fps? lol 

I have a 4080 but I'm still pissed I don't have the option to turn it off and go for higher FPS."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,with path tracing\*
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-06,"A lot of it is due to how bad UE5 games are in terms of optimization. Especially with Lumen and Nanite, the latter actually being slower in scenes compared to just using LODS"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,"Yeah, at the LOW preset, which probably looks like ASS"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"20' series as minimum is insane. There's still plenty people with 10' series.

And the ""no upscaling"" is bs. It needs a 20' series card for that specific reason.

Edit: my year old laptop with a 3060 isn't enough to run this at minimum 👍"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I'm glad the 0.01% of users with 4090s can run it.

The rest of people won't be as happy"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Yeah, we know. But it doesn't matter enough for us to wanna buy a setup capable of running it."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"The game uses RTGI, it's using ray tracing 100% of the time even on the Series S. Metro Exodus: Enhanced used RTGI on Series S too, dropped to 520p on occasion, though."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,clearly you didn't see enough since you went back to look for more lmao
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I'm sure that's true, and I'm also sure it doesn't matter because I didn't notice it. I guess I was too busy actually playing the game to stare at puddles."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Does your time really mean so little to you that you will spend it on a laggy game experience?
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"If you have Game Pass Ultimate, you both get the game on day one and can use cloud streaming. It runs pretty well here with low latency. I use it when I want to try something new but don't want to download and install it."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Lol alright, you beat the other guy for squeezing out your monies worth.  Good for you man.  I hope it lasts long but maybe not too long so you can upgrade ? 

I'd bet a 1060 or 1070 does decent at 1080.  My brother had a 1060 and didn't update until this year.  I think he said he was getting 40-45 on most games nowadays on low or medium settings.  Not shabby for 7 years."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Those old Nvidia cards aged bad. The amd 7970 came out at the same time as the 680 and could play doom eternal at 60fps 
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Games still do NOT need ray tracing. But eventually it'll be as normalized as rasturization. The tech just isn't there yet
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"They have RT in the First Descendant and I can barely notice its there, as opposed to CP2077 which is just glorious."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Under ""Minimum"" it has the note ""Ray Tracing Required"".

If the minimum requires ray tracing, that's a fairly strong indication that it is not optional. You might be able to turn it off in the console (it  *is* still idtech) but if I had to guess, there probably isn't a raster fallback so it would break the visuals.

This is interesting, since it means that the game's art and asset pipeline is built from the ground up for ray tracing, there's a good chance that this will be more of a showcase than people are giving it credit for."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I still remember the Idiocracy of everyone calling out how unoptimized Alan Wake 2 was on PC when they released the specs.

Digital Foundry has to come in to shut everyone up"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Full ray tracing = path tracing. Standard RT is a hybrid solution.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,"I don’t know, nowadays very hard games to run can look great at low settings. Low settings is probably just ps5 settings. Look at Alan Wake 2. I mean it looks better with very expensive path tracing turned on if you know where to look, but low actually looks great and is just ps5 settings."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"No it’s not bs, look at the bottom. The RTX 2060 runs it natively without any up scaling. Which is dumb. Just enable dlss and put the settings higher but whatever.

The 20 series requirement is probably because of the ray tracing. I mean the 10 series is also very old. Alan Wake 2 also didn’t run on the 10 series."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I get the concern, but I managed to run Cyberpunk @1440p with path tracing on at 70fps with a 4070, it’s definitely possible using DLSS and the like. That’s precisely what those technologies should be used for."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Well, the ever present silver lining is that people will be able to enjoy it in its full glory ten years from now when graphics have already advanced well past that."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Jesus, I have a 13900K, 4090, and 32gb of ram, and I'm worried, it only targets 60FPS in 4k WITH DLSS3- and frame gen/ super res. set to performance. Meaning it won't run ""native"" 4k60 at all. Probably get 15fps trying to run native 4k60... ridiculous."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"The RT is noticeable in some scenes, but it remains totally useless in 3/4 of the game, I had the same experience with Control, the game was sold to me as one of the games with the best implementation of ray tracing.. I saw no difference between on and off, except on the reflections of a window.. Meh."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-07,it completely changes the way the game looks…
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I have nothing but free time my friend. I spend mine enjoying a great game, you spend yours posting snarky comments on reddit. To each their own"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I do have GP Ultimate, I will give this a try. Thankyou!"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,I’m still on my 970. Playing BG3 on it. It’s not terrible. But I would like to upgrade for CP2077. Prices seem pretty painful compared to back in the day
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I swapped 16GB RAM for 32GB and 2TB HDD for 1TB SSD this year for like less than $100 myself. After fresh Windows instal, this laptop is snappy and works just fine. Gaming is solid. I can't play latest games, but I still have pile of games on Steam that I bought years ago during Holiday Sale untouched. All the indie games are just fine and are super fun to play.  
  
Now, I'm getting notifications from Windows 10 about the need for upgrade to Windows 11. Problem is that officially, this laptop is not supported by Win11 lol. Once Win10 gets discontinued, I may just instal Linux or leave it as it is as a spare home machine. Battery lasts less than 1hr, but I use it plugged in anyway."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-17,"Yeah because it had better support for Vulkan, like the rtx 2000 cards had better support for ray tracing than rx 5000 cards"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Yeah, the game really has to be designed around its use otherwise developers have become so great at faking it that you can't tell the difference half the time.

Not only that but sometimes I think realistic light is worse than carefully constructed light by an artist. Some of the scenes shown for Avowed were too brightly lit with RT whereas without it, they were much moodier. I *want* my damp, underground scenes to be dark and moody.

1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"10' series doesn't support dlss, 20' does. I know they state it doesn't need dlss to run properly, but listing a 2060super as minimum says it does. That's the bs part.

It's also with all settings set to lowest, no bells and whistles. Dlss is actually a really good tool, but devs/publishers requiring it as part of or instead of optimizing is *bad*.

And you need 40' series for any raytracing."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"only possible with FG and DLSS Performance Mode, yeah no thanks"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Neither were you able to run cyberpunk with it's pathtracing mode when it came out. Same with crysis. This is just futureprooofing the game
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"And that’s why games that push ray tracing look like someone came in and polished every surface, even the dirt, to artificially create the reflections that would realistically not be so clean."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Good luck and enjoy!
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"It's not the best chart and it's not particularly clear about a lot of things, but it does say that ray tracing is required for every mode, even the the modes that don't do ""Full Ray Tracing"". It's at the bottom of every column, even Minimum, on the far left.

They're probably leaning hard on RT global illumination, which isn't necessarily"" Full Ray Tracing"" since shadows and materials can fall back on raster pipelines. It does add dynamic lights with bounce, which isn't possible with baked lighting and such a difference can have game design consequences which is probably why there's no fallback.

I can read just fine, so can you, presumably. I think you're just not comprehending it well."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,"The real reason that the 20 series is the minimum because 10 series don't support raytracing, and for some dumb reason, raytracing is mandatory."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I mean there are just a lot of API’s that the 10 series don’t support. I highly doubt it’s because it doesn’t support DLSS, because it does support FSR. AMD cards are also supported.

Look at Alan Wake 2, that ran into similar problems. The 10 series is very old.

Everyone is always complaining about DLSS, even when they actually publish system requirements that explicitly state “NO UPSCALING”. What more do you want??"
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,70 fps with framgen is like 35 real fps.. Oh boy.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Devs & publishers don’t “future proof” games. The majority of most profitable sales are made at initial release, so they want to hit a sweet spot so they can maximize those sales. They probably wanted a cinematic experience but PC performance improvement flatlined and the cost per frame remained huge during development. So now they’re left with these high requirements (insert “They chose poorly” pun here). It’ll be interesting to see the realized performance on consoles. If it’s passable, I’ll just play it there. When I can upgrade my pc to do Ultra settings justice, I’ll be onto other games while this on sits next to my Tomb Raider and Uncharted disks. YMMV, of course."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,[deleted]
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-05,"Yeah. But i'll put my last money that dlss is going to be mandatory for a stable framerate. No matter what that chart says.
But we'll see by Monday."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Let's see how it performs when it's out.
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,and worse input lag than 30fps
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"That text is justified to the right, under three additional columns also marked Minimum, Recommended and Ultra.

The implication being that the Minimum, Recommend and Ultra on the left are for the raster/non-path traced pipeline, which still requires ray tracing hardware for (I presume) RTGI.

That reading is the only way the chart makes sense, given the unqualified *minimum* spec contains the proviso that it requires RT hardware."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-06,"The engine they're using is the same as Doom Eternal's, which was really solid on lower hardware. I don't doubt that it can run at 1080P at a solid 60fps at all with the card listed, when I could run DE at 1080P at 150+ on a 1070ti."
1h5zljg,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I personally find discussions around frame gen induced input latency way overstated. Especially when we're talking about single player games where it isn't as important. It's really not bad, but you're right that people should be aiming for a higher starting FPS of course. Now if we're talking about competitive games where the lowest latency possible is important, then yeah no thanks. Keep that shit away from anything that requires quick reactions like fighting games or shooters."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"they even got the wilhelm scream, nice"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"looks pretty good to me honestly, I think it's cool to have it in both third and first person, and show off the whip like they are. Wouldn't be indy without the whip, some puzzle elements, treasure, globetrotting and fighting. Looks like they got everything. Troy Baker seems to be doing a good job at Harrison Ford's voice too. I'll give it a thumbs up and wait to see how it is at release. I won't pre-order a game anymore."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,1st person?  Was not expecting that.  Looks good!
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,That was an Imperial Japanese plane Indy was jumping on at the end. Has Indiana Jones ever fought the Japanese? That's pretty exciting.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Graphics look **slightly** bumpy around the edges… 

#But God Damn they nailed the the tone and voice 

I honestly wish they casted this dude as young Indy in the last film. Rather than use Ford’s old man voice"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Completely captures the vibe of the OG trilogy. I am hyped.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,They even put the Wilhelm scream in there lmaooo. Looks very cool.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Not really an Indy fan, but the MachineGames Wolfenstein games were almost perfect camp--this looks like a great fit."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I mean, I'm sold. I was excited when I heard the rumor, but this seems like exactly the kind of Indiana Jones game I've wanted since I was a kid. It's like you're him! While it's not Mr. Ford voicing him, whoever they got is *really* close. All around fantastic work being shown off. I'll be playing day one for sure."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,The movie we deserve.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Coming to GamePass too is a huge win.

19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,I'm really glad they didn't go for a Tomb Raider or Uncharted type game. This actually sets it apart from the video games that Indiana Jones influenced.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"I had no idea this was being made and went into this video thinking ""oh god here we go again another shit nostalgic cash grab game"" and I'm actually very surprised as i came out of the trailer thinking it actually looks really cool. So many of these action sequences look they fit right in with the original trilogy. Very cool stuff consider my excited for this game."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Seeing people go off about how since this is published by Bethesda, that it'll have to be ""saved by modders"" and full of bugs tells me that a LOT of people don't know the difference between a publisher and a developer on a subreddit dedicated to video games."

19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,This is giving strong Resident Evil 7 & 8 vibe by being a story driven 1st person game packed in a Indiana Jones nice coat of paint. Day f*cking one. Glad I went with the Xbox Series X this gen.

19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,This 3 minute trailer turned the game from something I was totally uninterested in to one of my most anticipated games.

19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Looks excellent, and they nailed the voice. Slightly ropey character graphics though, if you look at what Insomniac did with Spiderman 2 and Naughty Dog did with The Last of Us. That's way down my list of priorities though as long as it plays well and nails the tone."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"When they first revealed that MachineGames was taking on this project, I knew they would kill it. Their Wolfenstein games are incredible and the exact sort of design thinking you need to make an awesome Indiana Jones experience.

We all know the Nazi killing will be exquisite."

19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,I'm a fairly casual IJ fan but this looks really good. First person perspective looks great and could fit the series nicely and whoever voices Indy does a near spot on young Harrison Ford impression
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Been dying to see footage from this game. I think Indiana Jones is a better character for the story and narrative they wanted to tell with BJ in Wolfenstein. Can't wait to go killing Nazis with Machinegames again!
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"I don't care for open world. Don't care for cosmetics. Don't give a sh*t about co-op. Just give me a good Indy story, crumbs for me to follow and that epic theme song when I'm kicking Nazi-ass in the game. That's all I want from this game."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"The Indiana Jones movies are among my favorites, so I hope this turns out to finally be the 3D adventure game the series always deserved.

19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Thank god they got the likeness of Ford, too many licenced games dont use the actors faces which makes it look off brand."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"People were rolling their eyes at an Indiana Jones title and for good reason, it’s too easy to botch up and go for the lazy grab, but this looks like a love letter to Indiana Jones. I’m actually hyped for this dam!"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I’m still interested. Looks like a MachineGames game visually. Which means, not really impressive but more than serviceable. Animations (especially face) are quite stiff and rough to look at. The whip, while appearing fun to use, looked pretty wonky in its application as well. They make fun games though and I appreciate their implication that navigating the levels will allow agency in how solve problems, navigate enemy encounters, etc. Sounds like Dishonored in that regard (Here’s hoping)."

19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,This actually looks great.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"This looks absolutely fantastic, I plan to play it when it it comes out and I am able, like seeing Indiana Jones back in film, LEGO, and this has been awesome to say the least! 🤠"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"This looks pretty good, for an Indi game."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Damn this looks like a really good game. Can’t wait to try it
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"the game lets you punch nazis, whip nazis, shoot nazis, kick nazis.

I'm looking forward to it."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Interesting! They got the atmosphere right and the gameplay looks neat, with puzzles, fighting Nazis, whip-swinging and some cool set pieces like that plane fight."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"God, this could be fantastic. Please be good."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I hate 1stP

But I love Indy 

But this looks like a great balance"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Looks ok, nothing mind-blowing."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Looks great. Kinda reminds me of Dishonored.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Looks good and I'm going to play it regardless but i was really hoping it would be third person.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Hate the first person :/
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Indiana Jones and the Uncanny Valley
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,I’m cautiously optimistic
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Ok damn it I’m in
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,If this is even halfway decent I’ll buy an Xbox just to play :D Love Indiana jones
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Will it be on PC?
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Looks like Wolfenstein only Indiana Jones. Which is a good thing to me. I'll wait for reviews but I'll likely end up purchasing soon after release. Indiana Jones speaks to my inner child.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Not feeling it.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Maybe I’m out of whack but I don’t get everyone saying how good this looks - it looks pretty bog standard graphics wise and not really *next gen* or anything like that to me. Nothing is jumping out saying that YOU HAVE TO PLAY THIS ASAP for me
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,So excited for this
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,This looks pretty good. I think will be good too in gameplay time
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,My dad was a huge fan of Indy and died in 2018 from ALS I will be wearing my fedora while I play this. Fucking hell im so excited.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,This might explain Starfield..as much as I enjoyed that game it looks like Todd had his eyes set on his real passion project. I can’t say I’m anything less than fucking ecstatic. My inner 8 year old is screaming right now.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Looks great
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,THIS YEAR! Avowed and Indi I’m very excited
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Shut up and take my money!
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,This actually looks good?? I’m trying not to get too hyped up but this trailer was awesome
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Looks like they nailed it from the preview. Might have to pick up an Xbox after all.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Watching the live chat during the presentation on this game was insane. 

Apparently this game will be garbage because it’s first person and apparently it’s “woke” because some people working on this game, like, have dyed hair and piercings? I guess?

I think it looks sick. I hope they lean into the whip and the physics of pulling people and stuff to make some awesome emergent gameplay situations"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Honesty I wasn’t entirely impressed over gameplay from what i saw. It looks like it could get old fast. Also what’s up with the graphics? It looks weird.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I’ve never seen any of the movies, but after watching the direct I’m pretty excited for it!"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Without looking it up….Troy Baker voices Indiana, right?"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,looks like this is the next interesting one
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Can't wait !
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"I am not a gamer, just a huge fan of the character. Would love to watch a start to finish walk through"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Nice try. You won't trick me into learning spherical trigonometry with a game!
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Is that Harrison’s fords voice?
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,What an awesome character George gave us!
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Looks better than the last 2 films at least
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,That first Nazi talking to indie in the opening...was that Sam Witwer?
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,This should fill the void that uncharted left me with
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,I would've said the only thing that would make it better is if Harrison voiced the character. But the VA actually does kinda nail it.

19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,I want it.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,They made the TF2 medic into a video game character!
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,I'll play it!
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Darn, it looks alright nothing really wrong with it. But I was hoping for something more like third-person cancelled game with crazy physics (that were used in Force Unleashed) that was teased a long, long time ago : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_2UKZLH65U"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"It’s kinda interesting to see how gamers react to graphics differently depending on the developer/game I think. A lot of people commenting on the trailer complaining about the graphics in the game, but if you jump over to trailer for Avowed there’s tons of comments like “graphics don’t matter as long as the game is good!”"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Skyrim with nazis? Count me in!
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"NGL I think you’d get a way better Indiana Jones game by just playing Uncharted 2 while playing the theme song.

IDK, the gameplay looked so slow and kinda boring."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,"Nice, we finally might get a new Indian Jones story that fans deserve."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,Looks simply awesome.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,This is a day 1 purchase
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,"Ford looks and sounds spot on. It looks a tad too linear, but hopefully thats just for the trailer. "
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,"I love that they have a mix of first-person and third-person, it makes it stand out more compared to other games released before. Machine Games are also brilliant at making first-person games.

I think they nailed the feel and voice acting of Indiana Jones!

This game looks awesome imo"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Why is this first person? What the actual fuck
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,First person when playing an iconic character like Indiana Jones. Feels not right.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,It not being 3rd person is a big disappointment for me. It's Indiana Jones. I want to see him while I'm exploring... Imagine if the Batman Arkham games were first person during the exploration and the combat. It takes away from the fantasy of playing as this famous character.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,I’m ready for this to be better than the last two movies just like the new Spider-Man games have been better than the comics from the past two decades
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Nice!  I am in
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Indiana Jones is the perfect character to build a platforming, puzzle filled, action, adventure, game around! I’m honestly surprised they have an attempted this earlier, but I’m here for it now"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Story better be good
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Sure not treading any new ground but it does look good. Feels familiar and comfortable which is going to be important.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Ngl the title is underwhelming, even if The Great Circle refers to some ancient long-forgotten priceless heirloom."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,this looks so fucking good
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Indiana Jones!
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,It’s going to be cool using Indy’s whip in first-person. Can’t wait.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"It looks really good, captures a bit of the OG trilogy feeling. I'm cautiously optimistic however, you never know."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,This looks awesome. Love it. Hope the brawling mechanics are pretty in depth
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Looks better than the last film
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Looks awesome. I’m in
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Fate of Atlantis remake next.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"The year 2005 called, they want their graphics back. Good lord almighty that looks awful graphic wise. Story will probably be great but c'mon let's step up the visuals."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Man that doesn’t look great.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I really, really, really want to love this...but I have to admit that everything about it so far strikes me as painfully generic."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"The game was already confirmed to be first-person in an interview like over a year ago, but still it’s quite disappointing to see. Really just seems like a case of Machinegames making it first-person because that’s where their experience lies rather than doing what would be best for the IP. 

Games like the Arkham games and recent spider-man games make you feel like those characters without literally putting you in their shoes in first-person. If you’re working with these kinda legendary characters and IP then people want to you know, actually see those characters during gameplay and not just cutscenes. I think most people want to experience a classic Indy style adventure that happens to be playable rather than to literally possess his body with first-person camera that ends up looking more like a goofy VR title.

That’s just my 2 cents though. Don’t think it’s going to be a bad game by any means."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Meh. I got a bad feeling bout this.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,It looks promising. And I noticed how good character's hairs look. Maybe the best I have ever seen.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I'm not erect, you're erect. I'm desperate for something like this to be good."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I guess I’m the only one who thinks this looks awful lol, oh well each to their own lol"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Xbox finally pulling their finger out their arse and putting some decent looking games out. The Wolfenstein games were great; looking forward to this.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Welp, i'm excited."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Looking really cool, pretty keen for this one."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Didnt have high hopes but that trailer perfectly captures the feeling of the trilogy
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,I was honestly skeptical about this but the more I see the more optimistic and excited I am.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Promising stuff. MachineGames has made some good stuff in the past.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"I have to say, I'm cautiously optimistic."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"That looks like a 2019 game, in both graphics and mechanics. I am underwhelmed"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I'm really really disappointed that it's first person. 

I really was hoping this was going to be a third person game or at least have an option to switch."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Oh no it’s mid nooooooo
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Why fps???? No just no
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"The gameplay on this looks... not great. Not sure how people are finding it ""incredible"". And honestly, after the Starfield Direct, I've lost faith in the average redditor's ability to critique a trailer altogether."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,*cries on playstation*
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Looks generic and uninspired. Robocop: Rogue City has raised the bar for movie based games for me and this one looks so boring.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,The whole show was fantastic. Really looking forward to everything that was shown
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I see a lot of people disappointed that its in first person, but honestly I am glad it is. I imagine it makes it much more interactive and immersive when doing puzzles and sets it apart from Uncharted or Tomb Raider-like games"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,fucking hellllll whyyy first personnnnn
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,First person? My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined. First Avowed and now Indiana Jones. At least Visions of Mana looked cool I guess.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Hopefully on PC someone will come up with a third person mod.

Honestly really disappointed they have gone with first person as i don't really enjoy first person games."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"It looks good, but I don't know... almost every bit of first person gameplay outside of aiming the turret seems like it would have been served better in third person."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I've got a lot more faith in this now.  Could be fun.  Still not sold on the title, it just feels too...silly is the wrong word but the Great Circle doesn't sound grand enough."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"This looks amazing!! We just a need a mummy game now, like they had for ps2 awhile
Back. Nostalgia is hitting hard."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Crap title but looks decent
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,XBox only?
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Machine games is a good fit for campy funny action, and while I wish the graphics were more modern, I'm sure if the gameplay is solid ill forget about that and enjoy the ride"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,I'm very interested. I hope machine games lands it! I really hope critics/fans/gamers can steer clear of comparing this indy game to uncharted/tomb raider.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,It belongs in a museum!
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Not bad, I want to see more of the whip but not bad."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,It will scratch my itch for a lack of a new  tomb raider. Also big movies fan
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Oh HELL yeah. I think I’m about to start favoring unarmed combat…
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,I'm honestly excited for a solid Indiana Jones game since Indiana Jones and the Fate Of Atlantis
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,I can’t wait! Indianapolis Jones!
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Extreme Riddick vibes. I’m sure I’m not to post this. Think I saw some original devs when I googled it.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Stopped watching when I saw Todd Howard’s name.  I’m done being fooled by that clown.

Edit:  ok, I finished the trailer.  What am I missing here?  People say it looks incredible but I truly think it looks awful.  The whip animation (that is used multiple times here) looks really bad.  Honestly, the entire gameplay loop they show here looks terrible.  Whip the enemy with the same animation, pull them in, punch them in the face, sometimes use a gun that’s aiming looks janky."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,I saw this and thought there was gonna be another movie and was wondering how the fuck Harrison Ford is still able to do this shit.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Already better than the Dial of Destiny
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,The trailer is already 10x better than Dial of Destiny.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"I personally think it would be better if it was entirely 3rd person, but still looks really fun"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I am very happy they are not making a Tomb Raider / Uncharted clone for this.

Looks awesome, can’t wait."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Can’t believe the hype around this… it looks awful.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"This game looks incredible. 

Always exciting when we get to see such a full fledged debut of a game and AFAIK almost nothing about it was spoiled or leaked beforehand. Literally just the title right?"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Whoever the VA is, they did amazing, and if it's actually Harrison Ford, holy shit, the game looks amazing. This is a game I'd gladly pay $70 or $80 for"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,This looks incredible
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Todd Howard being the Exec Producer makes this a wait and see. 

 First person platforming is going to be awkward.

Combat looks janky as hell.

And who came up with that title? A four year old?"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-26,"Considering the fact, that this game will be made for a ""modern audience"", with Todd Howard as the director, I highly doubt that the trailer and preview material is worth anything. Especially with a female character, who's surly not at all inspired by the last garbage movie, where they just slapped the franchise 'Indiana Jones' on top of it. 
Smells like shit imo. The trailer doesn't show anything. It just tries to make you feel nostalgia for your childhood hero, whoms corpse is being shown off. 
Not something the fans of Indiana Jones deserve. 




Most of you guys never played a single game with Indy. Half of you don't even know the movies. Your opinion in this regard, is completely worthless. 






Just my two cents, since most people just love to eat the tiny little shitnuggets, presented by the one and only Todd Howard. You guys might also like some urincustard. "

19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Revealing what the ""great circle"" actually is in the trailer was a bad decision, seems like that may have been  important to the narrative??"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"This looks pretty disappointing. Graphics and animations look a generation behind. I was concerned about this studio making this type of game and from the trailer, those concerns seem valid. I'll give it a shot, but my excitement is massively diminished."

19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"First person kinda felt a bit wonky to me, but it grew on me by the end of the trailer. Voice acting is pretty good (though I wish they would've gotten better facial animations for characters speaking).

Hope that this is going to be good, Xbox needs it after Starfield."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,I was expecting something more like uncharted. After this gameplay doesn’t really intrigue me
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Don’t. Don’t give me hope.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Doesn’t look too shabby, I’m interested.  But I don’t get how anyone thinks that voice sounds much like Harrison Ford, it’s sounds exactly like Troy Baker with only the tiniest of hints here and there of him trying to talk like Harrison.

This might be the least amount of difference to his normal speaking voice I’ve ever heard from Troy in fact, I think they should have gone with someone who could have copied his voice a lot better, as long as they could act well enough too of course, that’s still crucial."

19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,I'm interested. Though I think the trailer is cut poorly.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Looks fun. I really wish it was 3rd person though throughout the whole game. I don't want to BE Indiana Jones, like they're advertising. I want to watch him. His goofy fighting mannerisms, seeing the iconic outfit, those are thjngs that add so much fun to the character. This is a video game of a crazy iconic character. Let me see him. If it's first person it may as well be anything else. 

Not game breaking. Just what I was hoping for."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"This is one of the few examples of when I'd support an AI voice actor (with the  original actor's blessing and adequate compensation, of course)

Harrison Ford will always be Indy to me. But he won't be able to do it forever, or even voice it.

Any other voice wouldn't be good enough."

19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,I am really not so sure about this. I really want to like it and I hope it’s an amazing game. It’s the first person for me. No problem with it but I’ve just got a feeling it’s going to be somewhat clanky and broken. 
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"First person? Eh...not exactly what I would have wanted, but it can very well set up multiple games being Xboxs version of Uncharted"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Are u all really saying it makes a hole different game because it is 1st person? I mean u actually said that if that same game was in 3rd person, you would have already played it +10 times (uncharted, tomb raider....) Are you all implying that it makes a hole new world, a new dimension, a revolution in the genere..etc. Just  because it is 1st person? lol. I really now understand why big gaming companies do whatever they want with us.

&#x200B;

And yh I dont like it being 1st person. Thats my opinion, I dont feel like beeing inside Indy. I want to see him, how he express, how he react, how he move, his non verbal lenguage. I mean if u want me to feel like the protagonist, just make myself the protagonist. If im interested in Indy, I want to see him, not been him inside him, yh it a little weird explanation I know."

I love Indy, but that scene with Marcus and Indy looked about as good as uncharted 3. Great game, and incredible graphics… for 2011.


I’m not gonna trash this bc it could be a blast and those graphics are certainly serviceable but this does not look like a 9th gen title"

19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Lost all hype for this when it was revealed to be first person, shame."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Holy crap the face animation is... almost non-existent. WTF. Tiny devs like Team Ninja did amazing face mo-cap *5 years ago*.  Now a AAA Indiana Jones game's characters are set 100% in the Uncanny Valley of 2014 graphics.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Look, I'll readily admit I am not an Indiana Jones fan. Watched the first movie, and it was good, it was fine. But is this game really something people are looking forward to? I mean, we have Uncharted games, we have Tomb Raider, what could this possibly do that they haven't done 10 times better? Their stories are more open because they are unexplored by 5 movies, and their gameplay can be whatever they want from stratch as opposed to replicating an already known character.

On top of that, Indiana Jones was cool because it was the first one. Now, we have dozens upon dozens of movies and games replicating what it did. Take the final action scene of the trailer for example, where Indy jumped from one plane to another. Tell me you haven't seen something very similar in at least 3 call of duties. Tell me this is more impressive than the plane in Uncharted 3. Now, are you willing to believe this game will have better gameplay than CoD and Uncharted? I honestly doubt it. So what exactly are we expecting?

I'm calling it now, this game will be at best a 7/10, about 73 metacritic score. Some people will love it because they love Indy and you know what, that's fine, be happy. But IMO I wish we could have something new from the people that made Wolfenstein.

remindme! 2 years"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Really hoping the gameplay isn’t just a reskin of wolfenstein.

19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Looks like fun! I don't have an xbox but I'm happy for those who do that are excited for this. If this was a multiplatform game I would've bought it day one.

19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Why does it look like they hired a ventriloquist to model the mouth movements?
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"I'm a big Indy fan so I will probably subscribe to gamepass for a month or two to play it. Otherwise, I dislike almost everything that I've seen. And if I wasn't an Indy fan I would probably skip it or wait a long time to play it.

For starters, the ""Great Circle"" is the worst Indy title of all time. They should've at least called it the ""Circle of Death"" or something to add some spookiness and spice. A ""Circle"" doesn't sound mysterious, dangerous, or interesting in any way. I'm not saying the actual plot will be bad, but it doesn't get me hyped. Indiana jones and the big rectangle?

I hate the FPS design. It doesn't feel like Indy at all to me. And FPS doesn't suit the action of an Indy adventure. You can't engage multiple enemies at the same time in FPS like you can in third person. And third person provides better visuals of fighting, jumping and whatever else is going on. FPS is better for games with heavier involvement of swords and guns. But Indy is more of a melee fighter with the occasional gun use. In the video the enemies looked like they were lining up to get punched and the whip looked janky. I haven't seen a game yet make punching enemies in fps look fun and this game doesn't look different. I understand that they will revert to third person for specific actions but I estimate that will only happen maybe 5% of the time.

They better give me multiple things to swing on to make up for everything else.

Story seems okay so far. Graphics seem decent? Not cutting edge but solid."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Looks incredible like I am shocked that a game under Xbox can actually look good being they have just made crap for like 23 years but man why does it have to be first person? When I see first person I basically lose all interest in a game.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Calling it now, downvote me all you want, this game will be a disaster and will be a laughing stock of 2024 akin to LOTR Gollum"

19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"I saw this and thought, first person indiw would be a surprise, and not sure that would work.

think i might be right"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"I hold Emperor's Tomb and Fate of Atlantis in high regard when it comes to Indy content. Almost as much as the original three movies.

This game is checking all the right boxes when it comes to feel, sound, looks. It seems to give good old Indy in varying, interesting locations and action set pieces. Can't judge yet on the story, but hope they don't go too wild and just focus on good character building.

Visuals seem a bit choppy, but I am putting that down to early production."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Hopefully coming to pc as well.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Why does Indy sound like Jeff Goldblum lmao
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19, Not even one snake reference I am disappointed!
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,if on PC i'd play based on that trailer....wouldnt pre order though
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Looks like it would be fun, hopefully something arrives on PC that isnt a broken port"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Looks dope but I wonder if it’ll basically be an interactive movie
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Gameplay seems a little “ehhhhh” but I am here for more LucasArts and Indy.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Why has this blown up my timeline today... everything has been related to this game
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,[deleted]
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,It’s not a lucasfilm production with out it.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,I heard it in my head as I read this
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Honestly that alone sold me on the game. Incredible attention to detail
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Hopefully the signature punching sounds too
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"TIL that scream name. Always heard that scream sound effect in various movies, shows, and games."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,TIL that scream had a name.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,LoL. That's the biggest thing I took from it too.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,it better not happen every time I pull a guy with the whip
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"There's actually a few different takes of the Wilhelm scream, we should popularized other screams"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,at this point it’s more impressive if a game or movie doesn’t have that scream in it
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"I finally have a reason to turn on my series x. I mean the Xbox is ACTUALLY going to have games! 

The rest is just icing."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,the first person view took me by surprise. I think i'd rather third person like Tomb Raider or Uncharted.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,I cannot stand that stupid scream. Takes me out of whatever I'm watching every time.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-02-10,"They’re German, of course someone’s named Wilhelm"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,That’s troy baker again?? God damn he’s talented
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,It looks like it's all first person except for cutscenes. I didn't see any third person gameplay
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Same. I’m super hyped, but it is on them to make good on the promise before I spend money. I am patient"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,">... I think it's cool to have it in both third and first person, ...

That's what I wanted for REmake 4.

>I won't pre-order a game anymore.

Good."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,"This Indiana game looks awesome IMO

I think they nailed the feel and voice acting of Indiana Jones!

I also love that they have a mix of first-person and third-person, it makes it stand out more compared to other games released before."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"First person in action and exploring, thirdperson in platforming/traversing and cutscenes."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,[deleted]
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Just as an aside, a few months ago I stumbled onto a B-game from about a decade ago called ""Deadfall Adventures."" If you want a first-person Indiana Jones game, that's basically it. They even shamelessly rip off the mine cart chase from Temple Of Doom - to awesome effect. 

The game isn't bad too, although the pacing is deliberately slow and exploration-focused. So it might annoy people who want fast action."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"It was kinda obvious, considering who is making the game, when it was announced years ago"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"there is a chinese sign on the ground in that brief sequence, judging by the year 1937 and japanese airplane in a heavy city enviroment with river, its 99% battle of shanghai."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"The devs stated that Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and Imperial Japan will all be antagonists at different parts of the game.  I guess they're going full-spectrum Axis on this one!"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Yeah, whoever that is nails his voice. Marcus, on the other hand, didn't sound anything like Denholm Elliot, but, whatever."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,They took a page out of Sony handbook at voice acting and finally hired Troy baker
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,This is gonna sound weird but the game reminds me of Indiana and the infernal machine. Game got a lot of shit but it was a very interesting game (i played it on N64).
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"""Watch me"" was perfect Harrison Ford"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,It literally just sounds like Troy Baker.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Is it not AI? I guess I assumed they AI’d Ford’s voice. The voice actor nails it, minus a little bit of the gruffness."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,I honestly did not expect to be so impressed lol
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Yeah definitely gonna watch the indy films for this, never have been interested before and when i watched them as a kid i barely paid attention"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Love Wolfenstein
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,They're the experts at creating Nazi killing games.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Did you ever play Indiana Jones and the Emperor’s Tomb? That game absolutely nailed the Indy vibe.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Troy Baker is voicing him!
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,One can only dare to hope.. :-)
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,EXACTLY what I was thinking.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,[deleted]
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,PS5/PC gamepass combo has me spoiled with the amount of games I can play.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Microsoft is killing it this gen, glad that I picked up Xbox over a ps5."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Most game pass games are kinda half-assed or at least a year old
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Not really. Its like when movie instantly go to stream services since it was not good enough to make money in theaters . Its bad sign
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,It is?! Awesome!
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Don't you mean candy man?
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Yeah. They stuck with what they do well, which is a positive. It’s funny that we’re still going to be killing nazis under the same formula. Except this time it’s grounded instead of on the moon.

The least exciting part of the trailer me was, “Executive Producer Todd Howard”."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"That's actually quite a hot take. I was kinda bummed it was first person, but damn you're right... I've played that game 4 x with Uncharted, 6 x with Tomb Raider, 1 x with og Indy game.

If they can pull this off in first person, and really nail those transitions back and forth from third - we could be onto something really unique in the space."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Why? Seems like those games would be natural fits and they play great.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Exactly right
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,"Indiana Jones is much to iconic of a franchise for that comparison to matter. Those games were merely inspired by Indiana Jones. Indiana Jones was always the standard. All the game needs to be is a fun reflection of the movies. The more that Indy in on screen the better. Keeping him off screen is a shame, especially since they did a decent job of the model."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Wait, they didn’t?  Sure looked like Uncharted to me. See those puzzles?"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,To be fair. The Wolfenstein games were fairly buggy in their first weeks too. I don't think I could boot New Colossus for weeks.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"This is why Bethesda's extremely aggressive shoving of their brand onto games they don't even develop is so grating - it hides the talent of the actual development teams that made these games. In this case, *Indiana Jones* is made by MachineGames, the developers of the excellent new Wolfenstein trilogy.

Would be nice to see people remember that rather than just assume it's another Gamebryo RPG."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"I was most excited for Avowed gameplay when it started but by the end I had almost forgotten about it. The Indiana game looks so damn good, so faithful to the movies from my childhood. I am so excited for this game! 

Troy Baker nailed the performance too."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Ha yes!
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Right? I need this game to be good!
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Comes out Fall of this year. And yes, it’s on Game Pass day 1 since it’s a Microsoft 1st party game."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-20,Same. I went Xbox this gen (my last console was ps3) because gamepass sounded too good to be true and that thing evolved like a mother fucker!
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,~~Marvel~~ Microsoft Cinematic Universe
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,The first person part lost me but maybe you can switch back and forth at will. Would be the best option imo
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,They said you can take an enemy’s gun so I bet you’ll have plenty of chances to shoot those Nazi bastards with an MP40 etc
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,It's not the beat buts its definitly good enough to serve its purpose. 
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I struggled to play the Wolfenstein games as something about maybe the fov or camera movement made me feel badly motion sick so i was only able to play for short periods at a time.

I've never played any other first person game that's made me feel that ill and I'm not totally sure what it is about those games that triggered it."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Yeah facial animations need the most work imo. Everything else looks fine.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I think the game looks fantastic and I'm really happy about it being first person, and I love what Machinegames has done in the past. But I agree, the cutscene animations take me out of it a bit, especially when I'm supposed to be looking at Harrison Ford. I knew it wasn't gonna be movie-level but I just expected a bit more from AAA and this IP in 2024. But I'm on board for this regardless, can't wait."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"I mean most indie tittle are pretty cliché. Kind of fit the vibe. Could have been a format like : ""the circle of spirits"" or whatever but I find that fit less the theme. "
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,It just works.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,That’s kinda Indiana Jones’ whole thing though.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I think I’ll wait to make a judgement until a hands on. It looks good, some bits were a bit rough but it’s not the final product; but there’s been a few IP titles that have looked great in trailers & cut scenes that haven’t hit the mark at all.

But I was critical of the decision to make an Indy game and wasn’t interested, but I’m interested to see how it actually is now, so will be keeping an eye on it."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Me too, my opinion could definitely change, but I really don’t need to be in 1st person to feel more connected to a character, i feel like 3rd person combat would portray Indianas character infinitely better than 1st person"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,I actually prefer it in first person. It may give us more control of the whip and sets it apart from Tomb Raider and Uncharted.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Yes, on steam I think it said"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"It’s a Microsoft 1st party game, so yes."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I mean graphics aren’t everything, people are excited because of playing an Indiana jones game that captures the essence of the original trilogy which they can’t do anymore in film because of Harrison’s age and not wanting to recast him, this seems like the perfect way to continue an iconic franchise and while the graphics may not be top tier the content of the game is more important and they seem to have gotten that right form what we see"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"It’s best to just ignore those people, anyone genuinely using ‘woke’ like this isn’t worth having a serious discussion with"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Wait what about the trailer is 'woke'?

A female secondary protagonist? Cause lol.

Killin' ~~Nazis~~ Natzees? Cause that's MachineGames' business and business is a-boomin."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Yep, because it’s an Xbox pc exclusive brace yourself for endless YouTube videos about how great tomb raider is and how trash this game will be."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Honestly, I’ve become so removed from giving a shit about what people think, because people in general have gone insane

I have a core group of people I trust and that’s all I need. My beliefs may not be what others believe , but i feel I’m a somewhat self aware and good person, I might be able to learn from People that differ from me in an intimate setting. 

But I feel like the internet breeds frothing edgelords, trolls, and political radicals that don’t have another outlet for their frustrations

So it’s best just not to give a shit"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"The graphics look unpolished but it's still a while from release, so they have plenty of time to get the looks right."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Yup
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Because it's made by Machine Games, go play Wolfestein The New Order and The New Colossus, they are one of the best FPS devs. If someone knows how to make a game about punching and shooting nazis, are they."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Agreed. The first person segments of the trailer I felt like I was just watching some guy with a whip and not looking at an Indiana Jones game. The combat looked like a standard FPS with nothing special aside from the whip with only one animation. I also don't get the praises for ""differentiating itself from Uncharted."" Like hello?? Indy predates Nathan Drake by almost 30 years. Why tf does it need to ""differentiate itself"" from the series that was basically ripped from it?"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Huge mistake imo
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,It's also in 3rd person. You'll see him 3rd person in traversal
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,That Batman VR game was pretty fun though
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Batman Arkham in first-person sounds actually cool
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Yeah that it’s not coming to PS
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"You’re not the only one.  The gameplay looks terrible, especially the whip (it’s the same animation over and over.)"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Honestly, if it had been third person it probably would be received as “uncharted but not as good”."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,If you watch the footage it shows that climbing and some traversal is in third person and the combat and puzzles are in first
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Yeah, the 1st person feels very janky.  The whip looked really bad."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"If it’s successful, it might come to PS given the most recent announcement about Microsoft porting “their” “exclusives”"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"I'm with you. Not sure where the 1st person hate is coming from considering the history of COD, Halo, Doom, Dishonored, Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Amnesia, Bioshock. Like suddenly 1st person isn't immersive anymore? 

Also we have no idea yet if they have a toggle to 3rd or not. 1st just happens to look cooler in a trailer where you're selling the idea of BEING Indy."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I'm not a fan of the title either, but knowing the Indy series has always had a campy vibe i'll just roll with it lol"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"For consoles, yes. And PC."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"I kinda thought the same thing…. Thought for sure it would be getting shit on, but I guess everyone saw something I didn’t. "
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Bro it's on game pass, you can try it and after that buy it, or not buy it at all!"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Revealing it in the trailer could also suggest that it's not particularly important to the narrative
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Uncharted was based off of Indiana Jones. We’ve found the real great circle.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,What do you think uncharted is based on lol
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Yeah, 1st person is such an odd choice."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Wolfenstein and Doom are famously finished by modders, indeed."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,This ain't Bethesda
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,You just regurgitate talking points huh?
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Extremely said, indeed,"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Are MachineGames’ titles typically buggy? Todd Howard and Bethesda (and their custom engine) have nothing to do with the actual development of this game.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"It's literally not made on creation engine.

It's not even made by Bethesda. It's made by Machine Games. They use ID Tech."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"It's id Tech. Did you forget how humans looked like in Wolfenstein and Doom Eternal? 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlrywxWfpyM"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Takes two seconds to see machinegames is making this, you know, the ones that make the wolfenstein games? 

Do you think the same team at Nintendo works on every single Mario, Zelda, Metroid, etc. using the same engine?

That is if you’re talking in good faith, because anyone seriously playing console wars in this day and age is either 5 years old or just trolling"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"It's literally on iD Tech, which Doom Eternal runs on and looks incredible. Bethesda is just publishing the game. It's also third person climbing/cutscenes"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"What console wars brain rot does to a person:

This game isn't even made by BGS. By the way, first-person helps give this game a unique feel rather than being compared to Tomb Raider or Uncharted."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Why do you guys want xbox to make sony games? If you want play sony games, but thier console. Xbox biggest success was when thier identity was gamer dude fps console. And I love that - give it reason to exist - Sony to focus on 3rd person action adventure, Xbox to focus on first person games."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Really? The first person perspective is what I'm looking forward to the most. Otherwise it would just feel like another Tomb Raider clone like Uncharted..
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,I always wanted a first person adventure game I don’t see the problem
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,So true. Gamers love garbage games.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Actually I'm hyped if it just a Wolfestein with a Indy skin.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Where have you been, bud?"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"No, Xbox and PC only."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,You got all of that from a sub 3-minute trailer?
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Other way around bud. Indy was here first
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Video compression. It look significantly better if you watch it in higher quality on a larger screen.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,I don’t think it does at all.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,PC is always an option
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Xbox and PC only
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Why would Microsoft make a PS5 game?
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,You = uncultured
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Surely you mean Tomb Raider had an IJ feel?
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Uncharted wishes it had varied gameplay
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Xbox isn’t remaking 3 yr old games tho
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"It’s time to switch buddy. 
The Xbox Series is calling."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Only available in the current generation, the Xbox One is 11 years old, stop dreaming about eternal support, a PC with more powerful hardware than It no longer have Support."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,It’s primarily 1st person with 3rd person traversal segments and cinematics. You won’t be able to just switch the entire game to 1st person.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Don't think it's going to be on either
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Did you watch the video with your eyes? There was a lot of gameplay I picked up on with my eyes. Maybe try that.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"It's namedropped in the trailer. >!He lists off a bunch of ancient ruins, then shows if you draw a line from one to another, it's a straight line in a circle around the globe.!<"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"If and when the next Star Wars movies come out, they better have the Wilhelm again!"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,they even got the AUUUUEEEGH nice
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,And the signature whip sound
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"If anything, it’ll help give this game its own unique identity so it doesn’t seem like a Tomb Raider or Uncharted clone with an Indiana Jones skin."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,All male protagonists are assumed to be Troy Baker or Nolan North until proven otherwise.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Yeah that’s deffo Troy Baker, sounds a lot like his Bruce Wayne from the Telltale Batman"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"That's what everyone else i've seen has commented on and when I listen closer, it sounds a \*helluva\* lot like him. So i'm pretty sure it's Troy Baker, but I don't think it's 100% confirmed anywhere?"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I remember in Bioshock Infinite that I thought Booker was a dead on Ford impression, so this totally tracks, lol. "
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Bit of a shame tbh, would've preferred Harrison Ford, really does not sound any different to when he originally played Indiana Jones, or the guy who voiced Han Solo in LEGO Star Wars the Skywalker Saga would've been better, that guy sounds almost exactly like Harrison Ford, albeit a tiny bit more exaggerated.

&#x200B;

It's unfortunately mega obvious at multiple points in the trailer that it's Troy Baker and just kinda jarring to hear his voice coming from Harrison Ford's face."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"I thought it was actually Harrison Ford until my husband said no and asked me who I thought it was. My first thought was Troy Baker. I was like ""god damn he's good"""
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,He absolutely SMASHED that impression
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"whenever you enter climbing segments and certain bits of gameplay, it zooms out to third person apparently. The developers comment more on this on the behind the scenes video, its like 20 minutes or so."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"That was how Machine Games did things with their Wolfenstein reboot. Looks like it’s a similar engine in terms of graphics and some of the animations/concepts (that running jump off of one plane onto a Japanese zero looked weirdly familiar— possibly because we jumped onto the wing of a B-52 in the intro to Wolfenstein: The New Order about a decade back with Machine Games, and I *think* that they might have reused the animation, just in an Indy rig!)

Looks interesting, certainly. I dunno how I feel about first person Indy, though. I think that this might be the first time we’ve gotten a first person Indy game."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Seems like a combo that makes a lot of sense!
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,You sure about that? It looked like it was just cutscenes. They had you jump from one plane to another in first person. I didn't see any third person gameplay.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Should have been switchable.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Sounds jarring
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Plus allows it to not be constantly compared to things like tomb raider and uncharted.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Yeah, I can't really think of another 1st person game with a whip...there may be one out there but I can't recall..."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"They had a whip in Call of Juarez, the original one iirc. Also used it for 1st person platforming, which... wasn't great"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Also, thats what the studio is good about"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Absolutely right
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,I hope that means a Club Obi Wan level.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Where did you learn the year of it was set? 

I was torn between Shanghai (My initial guess was a chase scene down the Bund) but I could have seen Hong Kong or Singapore depending on the year it was set."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,That’s Troy Baker btw!
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"That's Troy Baker?! Holy shit, it's uncanny."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Holy fucking shit.

Troy nailed it"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Yeah, was definitely getting Infernal Machine and Emperor’s Tomb vibes from it.

Definitely a good thing"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,you and me both
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Man Raiders is probably the best adventure movie ever made. Last Crusade is also insanely good.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,wife and i went thru them all the past few months. first one and crystal skull are my favs. newest one isnt half as bad as everyone says it was. enjoy!
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,I hadn't heard of it but I'll definitely check it out! Thank you!
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,I'm not sure who that is but he did a fantastic job!
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,This right here. It’s such a smart move by xbox
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Lets not make this a console war thing. Lets enjoy games.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"> Microsoft is killing it this gen

Lol wot you cannot be serious"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Well to their point of gamepass…. You get a PS5 and then gamepass on PC for the Xbox exclusives. I play Xbox games on my iPhone at this point
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,I mean if you enjoy it that's okay. But how are they killing it? Haven't most exclusives so far failed?

19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Yeah gamepass is there only thing. Besides thatz the games they've made have been shit
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,It’s a first party microsoft game.  All first party games are added to game pass day 1 no matter what.  Literally a company policy
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Gamepass had several great day one releases last year. Sure, there were a few duds like Payday 3 or the messy Cities Skylines 2 release, but still dozens of other great games."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Or first party. Lol
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,It's a first party title from Microsoft.  All first party games release day one on gamepass.  It has nothing to do with the quality of the game.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"All MS exclusives go to GamePass, don't they? I was playing Forza on PC GamePass a while ago and saw Starfield, Halo, and other exclusives available to download."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"It's a bad sign that people can choose to subscribe to an affordable service where they can play a variety of games that they want?

What exactly is bad about that?"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,What? Lol
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,actual brain rot
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I still cannot believe that people like you still exist, how the actual hell can you complain at paying a sub that gives you access to a shit load of quality games and all first party titles, brand new and old.

A gamepass sub would last you roughly 5-6 months when compared to the price of a single full price game. 

Also it allows people who do not have as much money to enjoy gaming in a cheaper and fun as hell way."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Also him, yes! I was caught up on the Nazi at the start, who I'm 98% sure is being played by Sam Witwer just based on the look of him"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Sadly, the name Todd Howard doesn't evoke that same level of enthusiasm it used too."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Because we’ve all played that kinda game more than 4-5 times, if you’ve played through Uncharted and Tomb Raider.

We’d all say they were phoning in if it went that route and underdelivered, which tbh, machine games isn’t going to top Naughty Dog’s uncharted game design. Let’s keep it 100"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"He’s not saying that those games are not good fits for their gameplay or that they’re bad, he’s saying that it’s good that this game is going in a different direction as to not feel like an Uncharted knockoff.

(Something the tomb raider reboot trilogy absolutely REEKED of)"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"That’s great, thanks for the confirmation 🙏👏"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Opps.. here I go, murdering Nazis again."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,They will probably limit ammo though.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Exactly. It's jsut probably turn the game easy mode and not fitting of Indi so they didn't show it. 
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Same.

Was a lot of people complaining about that at the time the first game came out and there was some i think ini setting mods on PC to alter the FOV and disable the camera bob which helped a bit. Was still ending every gameplay session feeling a bit dizzy though.

Also the only fps I've ever experienced that with."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,I think we’re mostly in the same boat! I’m very much looking forward to it and hoping the game really provides that feeling of Indiana Jones with great interactivity and player agency. My qualms are with visual fidelity falling short of expectations with what we’ve seen. But I’m still very hopeful for a great time.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,100%. The titles are all dumb but last crusade has meaning to a lot of cultures (none American) and temple of doom sounds sinister but fuck if I saw a genuine temple
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,It just whips.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Yea for sure it’s just funny because they do the wolfenstine
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Sure, but this is what they decided to show, and to me it's not very impressive, I hope the game turns awesome even tho I'll probably never play it."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"If anything, first person (in games like this at least) actually make me feel LESS connected to the character. For example, the part in the trailer with the snowy bridge rocking/shaking but the first person camera not reacting to it at all. I know it lasts for all of 1 second but you literally see the bridge twist almost 90 degree in front of him but the first person camera perspective keeps walking forward like nothing's happening. Or the part where he takes out his pistol and gets what I can only call ""Call of Duty arm.""

Just not a fan. First person camera made it feel like I was watching some regular guy with a whip for most of the trailer, and the random third person switches during certain actions was jarring. Like, you grab a rope to swing on and it randomly goes third person, and then goes first person again when you let go but are still in the air? I don't know about that one lol"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Thank
Because I skipped to see gameplay heard music and was like ""thats enough Im buying that shit"""
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"In the full presentation on the Xbox live developer direct there was whole video that was a bunch of developers for the game talking about the game. Some of them had dyed hair and nose rings and stuff. The chat was saying the games “woke” because the developers are “woke” because they “look woke” or something?

It was truly wild / funny seeing those reactions from people who are apparently more triggered by piercings and tattoos than my grandparents would’ve been lol"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Hope so. I am interested in the game but i do think it looks unfinished and need more under the oven.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"> If someone knows how to make a game about punching and shooting nazis, are they.

&#x200B;

Yoda ass speech pattern"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"EXACTLY! Why let a fear of comparison to Uncharted and Tomb Raider lead you to making a worse game. Just make it third person and make it unique in other ways. It's already different by being set in the past, having already established characters in it, the whip etc... The 1st person look her looks really forced. It doesn't feel right at all."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"From the trailers third person is only in a few rare moments. Third person exploration would've been amazing. Walking around slowly in old temples, seeing Indiana Jones walking through them as you control him.  It should've been all third person and first person for the shooting. It's like Avatar all over again. At least with that game it made sense with Pandora being the main selling point. The biggest selling point here is Indiana Jones and I'm barely going to see him whilst playing."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"No, it doesn’t lol"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"It’s neither a niche nor a live service multiplayer game, so very doubtful."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"lol keep dreaming, they only do that with old or smaller titles. port begging is so cringe"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,It really feels like people are wanting it to be good instead of actually thinking it looks good.  It looks very floaty and janky like all Todd Howard games.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,[deleted]
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"So why do the visuals look so bad here? I was super excited at the idea of an Indiana Jones game, but the graphics look way worse than even Uncharted 4, which came out almost 8 years ago."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"It's Todd. It's all the same people. They all work in the same building. Gtfoh with that non sense. They aren't as secular as you think lols...

I used Spider-man as an example of a game that shouldn't be first person due to having webs

Indy has a whip. Should be 3rd person

Also, game looks dated. If you think this is quality then that's why this is poor quality."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,In the land of rumours where Xbox games are coming to ps.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,As god intended
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,True! In all honesty I’ll probably end up getting an Xbox at some point. Fable is my wife’s favorite game series and I’ll do anything to get her playing games.

19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Yeah, maybe lol"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"It’s really not, this game looks really bad and every Xbox game this gen has been underwhelming at best, terrible at worst."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I’m not hoping for eternal service, I moved to the PS five before they announce this game I haven’t used my Xbox in years. Also, geez 11 years. I feel old"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,I guess a lot of the dev team is here! Can you share the timestamps of actual gameplay?
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"I meant this comment to be ironic, not serious, my apologies."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Ironic that this game should have to differentiate itself from those games when both of them are essentially Indiana Jones ripoffs themselves.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"If it's a woman it's Laura Bailey. 😂

19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Honestly, I think Harrison Ford would have given a flat no even if he was offered this role. I don't think the dude is interested in doing anything other than movies that are well written or pay really well in his eyes."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Which is dumb. Whats even the point, when the majority of the gameplay will be first person? Who is it even for? People who like 3rd person games aren't going to suddleny want it because they can see Indiana Jones climb a drain pipe for 15 seconds lol."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Brilliant tbh, couldn’t have designed it better in that regard"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,They said it in the direct snd youncan see the third person when he swings with the whip.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Sure, more options is great. But if they had to choose between perfecting one way to play the game this seems like a great mix of both."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,I really hope it’s switchable
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"It worked out pretty well in Rainbow Six: Vegas 2, and that game is 15+ years old.

Third person when you're taking cover, first person when out in the open"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,if it was a direct reskin of Uncharted nobody would complain
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Sounds a lot like Deus Ex: HR style; I can dig it off it's done well. 
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Well, it's settled then. Indiana Jones and The Great Circle is hands down the greatest whip based fps game of all time."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Ratchet & Clank 3: Up Your Arsenal had a 1st Person Camera option and the third weapon in the game was the Plasma Whip.

Plus in 1937 japan didnt have full war with Uk and US yet, its before pearl harbor, so only explanation is Shanghai.

And the setting year is on steam and their front page, setting in 1937"

19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Instantly knew it was him. Like I was first going well that sort of sounds like Harrison right and then the voice a little bit changed to like a mix of Joel and Sam drake and I was like yep Troy baker without a doubt.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Temple of doom is fun but I just hate how blatantly offensive to Eastern culture it is at times

19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Agreed.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Chill, the guy simply stated that he doesn't regret his choice. I swear reddit is so sensitive about this ""console war"", it's getting ridiculous. Apparently writing ""xbox"" and ""ps5"" in the same sentence is enough to get downvoted to hell ? 

Both console have their pros and cons, anyone with a brain knows that. Still, people are allowed to have a preference, don't they ?"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Why not ? I also believe that Game Pass is getting better and better each year. There were a lot of good games in 2023 imo, personally I really enjoyed Lies of P, Starfield, Coral island, Dead Space Remastered, F.I.S.T., Grounded, Gotham Knights (kinda sucks but fun in co-op), High on Life, Medieval Dynasty, Moonlighter, Planet of Lana, Remnant II, Sea of Stars, The last case of Benedict Fox, Tunic, Vampire Survivors, Wo Long, and of course Valheim. 

Pretty worth it for 140 euros a year if you ask me. The only game I bought in 2023 was Baldur's gate 3. So for the price of three games in total, I got to play that many games. I honestly don't see what's the problem here, unless you're someone who's only interested in AAA stuff"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Yeah I was like that too to an extent. I mostly gamed on PS4/Switch/ PC when Gamepass first became a thing and realized I liked gaming on my big screen in the living room and invested in a Series X last summer and have enjoyed playing games on all three platforms.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,PlayStation too… you just haven’t realized it yet. Sony has razor thin margins

I was unsubscribed most of the year because most the games I wanted to play word games not on Game Pass and had to be bought Like Alan wake, stray, Diablo 4, baldurs gate 3, dredge and cyberpunk phantom liberty. Just throwing shade because of that games you mentioned and the Bethesda shortcomings n whatnot. It’s a good deal if you have a backlog but I don’t mostly besides all the other stuff from last year.

Let's do that... Respectfully, you're a 100% wrong. ND has amazing set pieces, but their gameplay isn't one of them. Hell, Tomb Raider has better gameplay mechanics than Uncharted.

Machine Games can totally beat ND here."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"This game does not look like it plays as smooth as either of those games. If I’m wrong so be it, but why fix what’s not broke? 

To me the appeal of this game is playing as Indy and the story. No one would complain that it uses similar mechanics as Uncharted, because those games are super fun. But you’re like, it’s unlikely they could capture those mechanics even if they tried."

19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"I have a feeling the emphasis will be more on evading trouble.  Indy tends to escape first and fight when he HAS to (or sometimes when he's just feeling saucey).  Him mowing down rooms full of guys one after another doesn't really fit the tone.

Likelihood is you'll probably only be fighting 1-2 guys at a time, as we seen in the trailer, and any time you're fighting MORE than that you're probably incentivized to GTFO and quickly make it to the large stone door that's closes JUST in time for you to make it through. Or the collapsing cave or right before the dynamite blows up something. etc.

Sprinkle in a turret section or two and you've got a pretty solid Indy experience"

It has an 88% on RT and great audience ratings across the board. Indy fans as a whole loved it, so I don't think it's hated. It just didn't do well at the BO, sadly. But that's more of a lack of interest thing.

Thankfully it's done great on streaming and home unit sales."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Oh for sure! And honestly Xbox is still an amazing console. The ecosystem is so fucked now a bit lol I must say.

At least with GamePass, a PC or PS gamer can still enjoy Xbox’s ecosystem. Only PC gamers can enjoy PS+ online service but even then, I haven’t heard anything special about it.

My big thing is own a PS5 (I started on PS, they got me early as a child) for exclusives, subscribe to cloud gaming services like GFN for some good PC games when wanted, and then GamePass for *everything* else.

Like right now, I’m playing Shadow of War through GamePass on my flatscreen using my MacBook. That’s pretty fucking tight!"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,I don't think anyone should doubt the sales...  It's the reception of the game that's a little lackluster imo. Mixed to mostly negative reviews on steam for a $70 game is a hard pass for me. I'll wait for the game to cook more or eventually try it on a deep discount until I hear more about how they've improved on the product.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Sports games also sell a lot.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"GamePass is designed for experimentation. 90% of the games I loved this year were games I never heard about, and that I would most likely never have bought. If you want GamePass to be a catalog of all the AAA games you are expecting, you are clearly using it wrong. It's like expecting the latest Hollywood releases to be available on Netflix day 1, it doesn't make sense and we all know that this isn't the way it works (for now).

Or you could also simply be patient and wait for the GP release that will almost inevitably happen. There are so many great games on GP, it's not even an exaggeration. But if you're only focused on playing these specific titles as soon as they come out, then it's obivously not for you."

Machine games is NOT making a game like that.

They’re doing an FPS with light TPP during traversal and other instances. They specialize in FPS, so no they would not make a better third-person perspective game than Naughty Dog"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"I think it's just that Machine Games wants to stick to what they do best which has only been first person games. So them incorporating their experience and sticking with that sounds like they'll nail the first person aspect.

19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Exactly, he’s got tons of star power in the voice acting world, at least for video games and anime. Just look at this thread and how many people are going nuts over it haha. It’s outside of Reddit too. 

Im not trying to say he sucks at his job or anything, but he’s one of those voice actors who absolutely might get chosen over someone who could be better suited for a role because his name is more recognizable."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,I thought it was good - not great. I do not think it was better than the person in the trailer.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Nonetheless… **I couldn’t tell.**

Also… overused isn’t bad.

**Telltale Batman, Uncharted 4, TLOU, there’s a REASON he gets roles.**

#He’s good"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,One of the most iconic villains in the history of Bollywood. When he got older he played these tough but kindly grandfather roles which left such an impact on me that I bawled like a child when he died.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Yeah, online discussion is a big bubble. And it typically is negative.

In my personal life, anyone I know personally who saw it really liked it. The audiences I saw it with applauded it, literally. Was a great time.

The main place I see it get hate is YouTube. Which...let's be real, YouTube has been a toxic place for awhile especially in regards to anything Disney or Lucas related. We're at peak anti-Disney/Kathleen Kennedy hate era, so anything they make will be DOA for many.

Check the Indy subreddit or r/movies. It did great on there."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"For sure! I do actually plan on trying it out either this year or the next. But the original point was about Xbox exclusives. I wouldn't consider it a banger to buy one of their consoles... And even then you referenced steam sales. Which is exactly what I would play It on. Which is why I wouldn't buy an Xbox, I'm covered with a PS5 and PC for myself."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Nobody does that. They get a month-long GamePass sub to play Indiana, and stay subbed longer than that for other games."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Personally I wouldn't get game pass to play only one game, I would buy, but it's not just it, it's many more games and new games each month, plus it gives you access to multiplayer"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,No but I have it because games like this consistently come to it.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Bro idk if you’re being purposefully ignorant, but you have a reading issue.

Edit: you’ve literally just come full circle on why they didn’t clone uncharted which was my initial fucking comment. Jesus dude lmao

My original comment was in response to people saying their DISSAPOINTED it’s not uncharted"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Why is trying to innovate and break out of tired formulas a bad thing? Not everyone's a massive fan of Naughty Dog.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,I never said it was you. “Guys” is plural for a community that is coping throughout this very thread. I wouldn’t have to bring the PC up if you didn’t assume that stating facts is console warring but you do you my guy
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Didn’t know stating I don’t own a console cause I’m not a kid is cringe, but I know you’re not talking about cringe with that pfp… you definitely should have put more effort into your grammar lol"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,Not “really excited” for it. I know how to limit my expectations while still keeping it at the back of my mind
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"You clearly don’t know what you’re talking about. They added an entirely new game mode, 3 cut levels, better controller features and improved the visuals. And it’s only $10"

19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"The nice thing about Steve is he can do several voices and not sound the same.

Compare to Crispin Freeman who has exactly two voices or Johnny Yong Bosch who has exactly one."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,And an actual cloud service. Sony wished it had so they had to partner with MS lol
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"Is Uncharted a tired formula? Seeing how Uncharted is inspired so much from Indy, seems like a natural pairing."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"Finally the pfp that I specifically made to piss off neck beard losers is pissing off neck beard losers

Also what does being a kid have to do with anything LOL"
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,As someone with a 3D modeling degree and multiple assets used in AAA games I think I know more than you. lol Hopefully someone buys it then since they just played it. Not even an Xbox guy but this sub would murder them if they did that. Just trying to call a spade a spade.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,Steve definitely can but does the for lack of better terms his Tank Dempsey voice for more than half his roles.
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"There have been 6 Uncharted games, there have been 3 Tomb Raider games using the Uncharted formula. I'd prefer a game that pushes the action adventure genre forward rather than an Uncharted game where you play as Indiana Jones."
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,I don’t think it pisses anyone off lol. You think you matter more than you do. Console sales are driven by kids. Nobody buys toys anymore. It’s not hard to understand. But you somehow projecting that I’m insecure for blowing that guys back out for assuming I’m console warring is pretty funny tho
19a0erd,2024-01-18,2024-01-19,"The last Uncharted was 2016 and Tomb Raider 2018. That’s not really milking the market dry. Uncharted 4 also had really fantastic reviews. So again, seeing how Uncharted is already so heavily inspired by Indy, does it really seem that out of place?

Also we’re talking Indiana Jones, not really the source of new creative inspiration."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,Minus a few bugs preventing me from getting all of the notes in the game it was an absolute pleasure to play.  One of the biggest gaming surprises for me in a while.
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,"That's why TGA events should be hold in Jan or Feb to get a chance for late November and December releases, this window is always overshadowed by next year Contenders because of recent games have this recent memory bias and of course this year these games can't compete in the game awards"
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"The audio for punching Nazi's will never get old.  There were some annoying soft lock bugs that required some wizardry to get by, but overall an amazing game."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,Game is a masterpiece. I just hope they don’t screw up the sequels. Amazing voice work by Troy Baker
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,Got video card driver issues and can’t load the game in the Vatican. I can roll back drivers and get it to work but then my drivers automatically updated again and I haven’t bothered to roll them back.
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,"Troy Baker's voice acting is really amazing in this game, I did not finish it but it's my surprise of 2024 tbh, did not expect to enjoy it that much

For me the only cons would be:

* Some bugs here and there
* Graphically intensive, I feel that some issues may be linked to optimisation BUT there is a ton of options, at least on PC. The game is very beautiful, uses ray-tracing not as a feature but at the root of its illumination system. I am upgrading my GPU in few days/weeks hopefully but I saw that even 4090 in 4K were struggling, at least without frame gen. Nevertheless, some weird stuttering and frame drops in too many areas
* AI is..I have no doubt they could make enemies more realistic but really in some cases I'm like...""dude I just threw an umbrella in front of you, come on find me""."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"I expected nothing but had nothing to lose with it on Gamepass...

Got the unexpected treat of the year - felt like a kid watching the original 3 movies at Christmas time again. Top tier and looked/played just amazing on a decent spec PC."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,"Great game. It really gave me that feeling of being on an adventure.

I hope there is a sequel. The stealth can be improved and I think a couple more set pieces would be welcome, but as long as there are more dungeons to explore then I'm in."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,It deserves it and shows a lot of awards shows are held way too early.
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,"I really enjoyed this game but the GOTY talk is surprising me a lot. 

For me it would have needed better stealth mechanics and easier traversal / better open world design to hit that bar."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,Don't care about a reward from a site that gave dragon age veilguard a perfect score.
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,Played it for about 4 hours and haven't picked it back up again.  I don't think it's for me at all.
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"I've played it for a fair amount now and it's a good game no doubt, but it doesn't touch Metaphor."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"I legit don’t understand the unanimous critical and public praise. I had to force myself to finish it in the hopes that I’d finally understand. It’s got very high highs but too many lows. Outside of brilliant cutscenes, the open zone gameplay was so inconsistent. The stealth genre is one of my favorites, so my biggest complaint is how heavily it relies on a stealth system that, between daft AI and terrible combat encounters simply doesn’t work. If it were primarily linear sequences followed by treasure hunts, it’d worked better for me. It’s also being praised for its visuals, but on XSX the lighting issues and pop-in frequently break immersion.

Help me understand!"
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,"It's the best Xbox game in a long time. Still wasn't better than Astro Bot, Metaphor or Yakuza Infinite Wealth to me though."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,Well deserved.
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,"I probably just don't get it. Game was okay at best, better just rewatching Raiders of the Lost Ark instead."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"It was one of the few games that made me want to immediately replay it after finishing. And Troy Baker…. Jesus what the hell guys. I have never heard a more perfect Indy VO performance. He got all of the range in there: soft and ponderous Indy, sarcastic Indy, and loud commanding Indy. It’s truly his best work."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,Tried so hard to get into this game. Felt so clunky with huge sections of downtime doing padding stuff in between sections where I'm actually doing Indiana Jones stuff.
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,"Damn bro, this came out in December."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,"2024 was such a banger year for video games. There's been such a diversity in GOTY winners between publications, kinda digging it."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,Game was meh. Troy Baker made it bearable.
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,Is the gameplay and mission design good?
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,Shame it makes everyone sick though.
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,"Eurogamer are idiots , not a terrible game but not worthy game of 2024"
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"Just finished it yesterday. Have to add, Voss is a god damn good character. The right amount of smart, stupid, hilarious, and intimidating, all boiled down into a single man in a complete package of such a fun villain. Definitely on my top list of great character in games.

>!Such a shame that he died, but Machinegames managed to make me love a new character that much so i dont worry if the sequel (hopefully it'll happen) will have another fun villain. Even his bodyguard, the one in the mask that didnt talk, seems mysterious and interesting enough for me.  !<"
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"It might be really good at what it is, but it isn't what I wanted. Wanted a Tomb Raider game, found a melee brawler with code breaking.

Spent quite a few hours in the Vatican and just got bored, as I can't quite move on till I feel I am done with the area but it kept giving more code breaking puzzles and combination lock chests. The recent Tomb Raider games are more my thing."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-04,"Honestly same. Can't say I played anything else this year that blew me away quite like this, and such a joy to play! I bet people who haven't played it are confused af on account of the weak marketing campaign, but frankly I just finished a 70-hour playthrough of a 30-hour game because I kept going off track to clear enemy camps over and over lol and I already wanna start over. 

The Indy game being my GOTY2024 was not on my bingo card tbh."

1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,"Great game, they should turn it into a movie!"
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,Well deserved
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,"added to wishlist when it goes for sale, Mirosofts net worth is more than my country’s gdp, they should consider better regional pricing"
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"I'm just about to finish it and it's a blast, they really captured the swag of indy, the awe of the locations, the touch of comedy sprinkled in the absolutely bonkers action sequences and they absolutely nailed the cheesiness of the villain and his abuse of his underlings. Best Indiana Jones since The Last Crusade."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,Yeah I think I agree with them. I've been slowly making my way through it and it's been a pleasure to play.
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"I'm playing this now and it's like playing the movie after last crusade.

Truly superb..great game."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,"Maaaybe, it was very good. Although I had too many soft lock bugs, one nasty little one which had me in the wrong uniform on the wrong side of a checkpoint.

And the final area felt rushed, like they were only 1/4 of the way through it before getting the call to ship it out, so to speak. Also troy's voice acting throughout the game was epic, but again sounded more like him than Indy in that final sector."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,One thing i hate about this game it is ray tracing required. Ofc it will be bad optimized.
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,All the side missions are dogshit tho
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,Must of been a slow day for Eurogamer plus doesn't really mean anything
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,Its funny their game of the year is always something that was released in the last 3 months of the year.
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"My main problem with this game is just how awful and terribly dumb the AI of the enemies is .. one of the worst I have ever seen in a videogame.. it would somewhat work if the game wouldn't insist to use stealth all the time where you see just how bad the AI really is .. even on the hardest difficulty the AI is terrible and it just ruins the game, atmosphere and immersion"

1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,My only problem with the game is controller issues. For some reason the game gives me stick drift even though my controller is brand new (and I don't have stick drift in other games).
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"Well if only Microsoft released it earlier it would have won TGA and they would have one win last year at least.

Now they arent going to win shit cos GTA6 is going to win next TGA"

1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-04,Why does this game need ray tracing? Can anyone explain why?
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,Is it worth $70 or should I wait for it to go on sale?

1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"I’m about half way through, I think and I’m having an absolute blast. I didn’t expect much but it carries so much of the spirit of the movies and is just fun in moment to moment gameplay. It’s a shame it didn’t get GotY consideration, imo."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,These types of games are awesome to play when you don’t want to spend hundreds of hours collecting items and just want a good story.
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,Mine too honestly
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"Would've been a 9/10 for me if not for the NPC pestering me the entire game.  Even with her, it's still my GOTY.  

Bum year though. Indiana, DD2, SM2, and a few nicely updated classics..  

Do better, industry!  I have money you can have if you make more games."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,Take a picture of a completed puzzle for the puzzle hints. I used the fountain puzzle. Allowed me to get all notes and achievements. Fixes the bug for some reason.
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"I wanted to 100% the game, but it became too much of a hassle getting back into some of the tombs to get collectibles I missed."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"I am in the same boat. The game is awesome and I consider it a must play for everyone who loves both Indy and adventure games. It is one of the few games I had a desire to 100%, but there is a book in Sukhothai that I learned but it did not register, so I can't get the achievement."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"You're lucky you aren't stuck not being able to even buy the camera since Indy just picks it up and puts it down when trying to buy it.

Such an amazing game and I really hope I don't have to start all over to see if I don't get the camera-buying bug again."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"I already decided it goes on the backburner until I have hardware that can actually handle the game without compromise.  Unfortunately, that ain't today or in the foreseeable future.  I've long since concluded that it's just better for me if I don't waste a good game on a system that's not ready for it.  Made that mistake too many times in the past."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"I’m just spitballing here, but it’s probably held in December because of the combination of the holidays freeing up all the devs to be able to travel and attend the show, plus the Holiday shopping period giving a boost to the nominees/winners. January is usually the worst month when it comes to retail spending."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,"I feel the same way. So many bangers always drop in the last month. Or at least they should can't for next year's.

I feel they do that to up boost sales for Xmas. It is a business, after all."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,While I do feel like it had a good chance of winning awards people would still say that about whatever month starts the award year. Even as it is you have people saying any game from the entire first half of the year is at a disadvantage.
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,That would just shift the problem to Jan / Feb releases being overshadowed lol
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,If rebirth was released later rather than February I feel like it woulda won GOTY 
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,"Nobody forced them to release the game in december. The rules have been the same for a decade now, they knew when TGA was and when the window is. MS could have released it in january instead.

Goty lists are done when they are for a reason. People in media will tell you when they do their goty lists in jan. no one reads it because no one cares anymore. Interest drops massively after christmas."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"Yep, Indy deserved a shot this year. Now it has to compete with GTA 6 (among others) which is stiff competition. Not that last year wasn't, but it's probably not going to hold a candle to 2025."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"Really? Where? Not doubting you, just haven't heard of that before?"

1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,"Agreed. I was like oh cool this will be a solid 7 for me I love indiana Jones but was sure it would be a shitty cash in, but nope. Solid 8.5 - 9. I only docked a point for replayability. Otherwise it's almost a perfect game."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,Oh wow I just assumed it was Ford!
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,"Same here, the game crashes at the Vatican no matter what I do. Had to refund it because of this, and I loved the first few levels. Bummer."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,Refund it if you still can
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,"> Nevertheless, some weird stuttering and frame drops in too many areas

Depending on the hardware in question a lot of that is from people turning the texture pool setting too high. It's not a simple texture res setting, it's sort of a texture cache/streaming setting. The textures can look great on lower settings, but cranking it can easily blow past a lot of cards VRAM capacity especially when combined with other VRAM heavy settings."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,I Kinda enjoyed the goofy ai 🤭. definitely had some fun stacking bodies in the room like the hitman style

Now if you turn on PATH Tracing, that is entirely a different deal. NO game has fast path tracing yet. We might see decent performance on the 50 series, maybe."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-04,"Ive been noticing an odd bug with my 4070. Im using DLSS and  full RT with most settings on medium- ideally I’m around 80-120 fps until a cutscene plays.

I’ve noticed it seems to have improved the more I’ve progressed but for a good chunk of the early Vatican game play I was stuck at 60fps unless I restarted."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,"What it does really well is nail the experience of the movies. It's the best Indiana Jones movie we've gotten since the original trilogy, and it's not even a movie."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"Yea, the poor AI really kills it, and you can just punch out the entire city when you trip and suddenly get spotted by every NPC in the map."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,I think it's because nothing oustanding came out in 2024.
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,Tbf it's open world - but it isn't really meant to be an open world game. If the sequel does get made they need to push it much more open world though. For sure.
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,In this case I agree with them : Indiana Jones is a really good game and deserves a reward... You should try it !
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,"They also put it above rebirth on this list which is just...I don't even know how you can justify that, the gulf in quality between the 2 of those games is insanely huge."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,Opinions can differ. Having a review that differs from the pack every once in a while actually makes them seem more legit in my eyes.
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,"Same here, just felt to “in between” to me, combat that I didn’t find exciting and exploration that I didn’t find relaxing, very heavy on cutscenes and stoppages didn’t help me."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,"Same.  I'm not interested in playing walking simulators.  This games ""combat"" is nauseating."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-08,"I don't get it either. Could it be people playing the game haven't figured out they can just run to the nazis one by one and punch them? Because that's been the game for me. It's almost like a walking simulator but you have to button mash sometimes. Puzzles are no different, I just run to the first lever I find, activate it without a thought. Everything is so mindless.

I just quit shortly after Indiana Jones needed a lighter to continue his adventures."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"I agree with a lot of that. The terrible AI almost ruined it, stealth and combat are serviceable at best. And idk, I wanted a bit more out of it emotionally, like Uncharted 4. It's really ""just"" an Indiana Jones treasure hunt story."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"A lot of the ""praise"" is paid engagement by the publisher.

Also, people expecting a 6/10 experience got a 7/10 experience and are glazing it. Compare that to expecting a 10/10 experience and getting a 9/10 from the other actual GOTY nominees this year + recency bias, you get this.

Don't believe the manufactured ""hype""."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"Astrobot kept me engaged all the way through, even if it wasn't particularly difficult. With Indy, I stopped playing after the beating first world."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,Yes it is.

1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,This game was an insane surprise. I expected mediocrity… I got an extremely enjoyable and beautiful ride.
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,Not great. The combat is poor and the exploration is sluggish with the way the climbing animations have to fully complete before the next animation cycle starts. Makes everything feel stiff except for walking.

1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,The amount of praise this game gets on these sites is so disproportionate to how mediocre it is. And there's no way there's this many 40 something year olds this impressed by some nostalgia bait.
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,It’s on PC and xCloud too.

1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,This is such a millennial take lmao
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,"Yeah for some reason one of the Sukhothai notes is bugged if you watch a cutscene before taking a photo of something. This is what I also had to do, definitely an odd issue."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,Currently I cant re-acquire the small cogwheels to complete the rest of the puzzles.  Apparently the developers are aware of this.
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,This worked for me as well a couple of weeks ago. Shame it’s still not patched for completionists who are still playing. But great game otherwise.
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"I cant pick up a medicine bottle, know a fix for this?"
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,Damn...that sucks.
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-04,That’s so early in the game (like 30 minutes of gameplay). Just restart
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-05,Ran great on my 2060 super so it doesn't need the best stuff.
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-23,"3090 with an R5 3600, max settings and DLSS quality (although DLSS doesn't make a huge performance difference for me in most areas of the game).

IMO the game is best played with a gamepad, and anything over 60fps is gravy.  On my PC I'm playing with 100+ fps in most areas and when I'm gamestreaming it to my TV /  NVIDIA shield, it's locked at 60fps.  Game streaming it is just as much fun / immersive as playing at my desk on the PC direct.

In case this info is helpful to you in deciding when your gear is ready."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"Yeah, ad money is going to be by far the best just a few weeks before the holiday season. It would be way nicer for the sake of the awards to have it mid/late January, but ultimately TGA, while very fun, is not particularly award focused anyways. There are plenty of others that ARE more critical/award focused that do it at different times anyways, they just aren't the big popular one haha."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"You'll notice all the youtubers pumping out content in December then a graveyard in January.

The ad rates are pretty much the best in December of any time in the year."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,I’m indifferent about it. It will just go into the 2025 rooster of games. Whether the game lands on 2024 or 2025 awards shouldn’t really matter much.
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,"We rarely ever get a notable december release like this. I think cyberpunk was the last one, and that game was woefully incomplete at launch anyway."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"Yeah but if they choose an almost empty month there would be less complains. December, at least during the first half of the month, usually has important releases. This year alone we'll have GTA6 (if it doesn't get delayed). A December 15th or December 20th limit date would be better."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,No it wouldn’t. Those aren’t part of the year in question
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"You'd be surprised, a lot of people claim games released in the first half of the year are at a disadvantage."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,I'd have preferred that over a Mario Galaxy clone.
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"The most frustrating one I experienced was returning to areas to obtain items for one Ancient relic. The previous areas fully reset. But you couldn't progress as you already collected Quest items that you now had to pick up again.  
I could still finish the game, I just couldn't obtain the last Relic for the post game puzzle."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,I couldn't drop off a ledge a couple times.  It took some weird ass camera angles to be able to get the game to let me drop.
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"It was patched two weeks ago but there was a particular vine that was simply impossible to climb. If you were on PC you had to install cheats to allow you to noclip past it. Console players were screwed.

The devs apparently had a workaround which required you to reload saves of up to 1 hour previously and talk to a specific NPC. Still very frustrating."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-04,"Had 2, both in the second last zone. One locked the camera the horizontal axis and could no longer look up or down. The other dropped me under a hill when accessing the menu, was stuck between the map floor and ground level, both got fixed by rolling back the save to the 2nd newest autosave"
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"There’s one mission where you’re exploring a tomb with your companion (first time you encounter scorpions, IIRC), and there’s a place you need to boost her up to, but sometimes she just goes nonverbal and stands in the hallway staring at a wall. Only way to fix is to rollback to the previous save."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,">i thought ford was actually voicing it.

Ford from the movies, yes.

Troy sounds more like Indiana Jones than Ford does now."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,I actually prefer that it doesn't have replayability. I feel like the kind of systems that provide replayability would have worsened the experience. I'm very happy that I managed to get and do everything in one playthrough.
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"I’m on gamepass. No rush, I can wait for a patch. Things the risk with playing games at launch."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,"Yeah I was able to play with my regular 4060 using medium texture polling and was getting well over 100 FPS in almost all areas except for the river jungle with the boat that was very intensive but I hovered in the 60s

But most importantly I was playing in 1080p"
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,"The visuals, sound design, story, and performances were all top notch, and I really enjoyed most of the sneak > discovered > fisticuffs > back to sneak gameplay. 

I hope the next game adds more ways to interact with the environment for distractions/takedowns, and either more fast travel or better vehicles in the “open world” sections."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,"I wasnt sure if i was going to like it cause im not really a stealth game player, so i first watched all of the movies and then i got a month of gamepass. I really loved the game, doing a bit of exploring and  getting outfits for indy allowing me to just walk by enemies was really nice.

The story and humour was really in line with the 3 original indy movies, but it probably could have been a tad shorter because it started to overstay its welcome during mid act 3.

I hope they make more of these and refine the formula because this was a really nice surprise and really close to being my personal goty."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,"If you edit all of the cut scenes together, it is a top-tier Indy film. It also happens to be attached to a fun game."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,"Say WHAT!? 

There were some straight up bangers this year.

Rebirth, Astro Bot, Metaphor, Silent Hill 2"
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"This year has had banger after banger and is way, way better than the AAA bloatware fest that was last year."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"My main complaint right now is that it is *too* open world. I don't need 15 minutes of bumbling around in between the major set pieces, especially when those set pieces are so solid. This is a linear game at its heart and the open sections detract from that imo."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"I did, and I can see why the people who loved Dragon Age think this game is GOTY"
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"Recency bias.  Rebirth was released early on and all media seems to have forgotten about it. 

I agree with you that Rebirth is way ahead."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"Having reviews that consistently heap praise on mediocre AAA games , wow, so brave. I'm sure access journalism isn't playing any part in that"
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,Combat never gets better or sees any variation at all throughout the game either.
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,"Yeah.  The cut scenes are great though, good voice acting.  Just a very triple a game with so so mechanics"
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"The joy of discovering secrets is a thing too, and I enjoy the puzzles a lot, that's what I love from this game the most, the combat is just optional as I prefer to always go in stealth mode anyway."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,I thought of it more as a walking in circles looking for obvious shit simulator 🤣
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-10,"Hahaha when Indiana Jones was so unprepared that he had to go on a mission to find a lighter, I seriously contemplated quitting. Unfortunately, I forced myself to complete the story in the hopes it’d finally hook me and I’d understand the hype. Outside of my praise above, I had no luck."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,please touch grass for your own health
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-02,"""to me"""
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"What are you smoking. This is the Indiana Jones movie that we've been asking for since the original 3! It had a great story, great acting, great settting, and pacing.

It also is selling really well, enough for Disney to want more.

Why make up this nonsense to be the edgy one? Lol"
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"Exactly this.

It doesn't seem to work though looking at how it sold so little."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,"I reckon its Christain conservatives that love this game , any piece of media that posits that God is really actually is always a big hit in their circle. Like you said, the player count numbers I see suggest it's a tiny vocal minority online that care about this game. If Ubisoft released a game with this shit stealth sections and brain dead ai it'd be memed to hell and back."
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,Because joyless nerds like yourself who never played it shit all over it.
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-04,"Reddit opinion can be disproportion to how it actually perceived in real world

1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,I guess that's what I mean. Flesh out the open world more if it's going to be open world.
1hs2wgm,2025-01-02,2025-01-03,It didn't take long to find a review that shatters your [point](https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-horizon-adventures-review).

Hopefully the writing is witty and well written, like the old Indy LucasArts games and the puzzles are good.

If this game is good it will be like an extra long 8hr original Indy trilogy expereince. Bad and it will be more like that last two films combined with a walking simulator, and a tacked on terrible first person whip mini-game.

1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Looks awesome. Nothing has really scratched that Indy itch other than Uncharted and Tomb Raider and it's been awhile for both of those series. I'm really looking forward to getting lost in this.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"For the first time since Knights of the Old Republic,  I’m jealous of XBox owners."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Cutscenes look nice but I'm still yet to see any gameplay that actually looks half decent. I wish I was as hyped as everyone on Reddit seems to be but I seriously don't see what people are excited about from a gameplay standpoint with these trailers. 

Pretty wild that any comment straying from the ""this looks incredible!!!"" vibe is getting heavily downvoted here as well. Are we that desperate for a solid Xbox game that we can't even entertain some criticism?"
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I’ve never seen any Indiana jones movie but this looks fun.

1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I subbed to Game Pass for Stalker 2 which I haven't played much but seeing this game coming I am glad I subbed, looking forward to it."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Have they shown really any REAL gameplay besides small snip-its?  Seems like every video I see is mostly cutscenes
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,As a life long Indiana Jones fan… I’m glad this is coming to Gamepass cause there’s no way I’m paying for it.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,A little late to post this here but I didn’t see it posted at all oddly enough.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I seriously hope there's a reference to the fridge he uses to hide
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"We need VR for this game, I’m really excited about it"
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Reminds me of LA Noire a bit.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Add a lil more bass and the voice is perfect. 


I upped it for the trailer and it sounded much better. "
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,it would be fun if Great Circle = Stargate
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,They absolutely MUST have a part of the game have snakes!
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,I'm very nervous about this due to the last 2 movies. I want this game to be awesome
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,…is it a walking simulator?
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,This game needs a 4080?
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"# It's so hard to get Indiana Jones's face right. All these years, and it's still not there."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Excited for it but if I seen any glimpses of a modern audience touch I’m out.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,There was no marketing hype for this game. Dis y'all see any online ads? It feels a bit 'naked' not being bombarded by content creators and ads for this. I am also 'cautiously optimistic'. Will wait for review embargo to lift the veil on this game.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I’ve got $100’riding on this being 75 and below. 

Don’t surprise me now Microsoft."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,does anyone know if there will be any preload for the gamepass pc version? rn there is just what ever it is with 10mb
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"While It seems cool, you can tell It Is a Bethesda game lmfao"
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Didn't think this game would be for me, and the trailer solidifies that. Hope everyone who's waiting for it enjoys it though."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Oh wow, it’s first person. That feels like it’s you to be weird, no?"
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Looks good sadly i wont be trying until they remove denuvo
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I was excited until I saw that stealth seems to be the encouraged way to play the game. Still gonna give it a shot, but I honestly wanted something like Tomb Raider/Uncharted. Absolutely respect them for not going that route, but I would be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Is this the first time Troy Baker has just done his Troy Baker voice?
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Was Bethesda not allowed to use Fords face? That really disturbs me. All the faces look weird somehow.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Looks fun.  I'm not crazy about the First Person POV.  but, I know many others like that.  I'd rather it was a 3rd person like Uncharted or Tomb Raider.  But I get it, and this was probably done to further distance itself from those other 'treasure hunter' games."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I feel like games were making good progress with lip sync animations in recent years, but for some reason things now seem to be getting worse. It doesn't seem like the characters are actually speaking the words we're hearing in the cutscenes."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"This is from machine games. I'm extremely confident this will be amazing. Their games always have amazing writing, phenomenal visuals and action... It's machine games!"
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Am I taking crazy pills? I don't want to shit on anyone's parade but this trailer is absolutely god awful in every way. 

Lazy editing and cut scenes. Snippets of lifeless voice overs. Janky looking gameplay.

Uninspiring."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Enjoy Your female protagonist! She constantly makes Indy look stupid throughout....

5min into a puzzle? She solves it for you"
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I remember playing Indiana Jones and the infernal machine on the family computer. I can't wait till I can get a console to play this
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Alright, this has made me somewhat optimistic of the game. I was skeptical before, and to some degree I still am, but I suppose I'll wait for a review or two rather than writing it off. At the very least, really love the tone."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Isn't this the game that is blacklisting reviewers because they're only allowing positive reviews? 

Also, the fact that the embargo is on the same release day is always a giant red flag."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,$90 Canadian < 20hrs gameplay. Not even Harrison Ford @$90. No thanks.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Why does he sound so weird?
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Indiana Jones and the incomplete rhomboid
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I’m really hoping it’s good. Microsoft needs a win. I just hope it’s not a Redfall situation where it’s bad,  and we come to find there was trouble behind the scenes."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"god that gameplay looks bad , also those character models look really rough and stiff , world looks great I mean it looks like Indiana jones but idk that gameplay looks like it will get old very fast, as someone who hated all the forced stealth and melee crap in Wolfinstien I am worried about an entire game just on that"
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Hope this game does well enough for the sequel, Indiana Jones and the Mediocre Rhombus, to get made."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Amazing music but doesn’t make sense to use the Arc of the Covenant theme.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Yea we saw it yesterday when it was posted over and over
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"WTF - doesn't even look like it should have the requirements from the other post..

It looks fine, but I don't see better graphics then shadow of the tombraider here.."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Why does it feel buggy...
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"This trailer looks circa 2011 and not in a good way. 

Play dough models, heavy focus on static environments,  strong mood lighting to hide detail, clunky animation. 

Idk man. Who is this even for? I can't think of a classic action series more out of the public eye right now than Indiana Jones. 

I'm glad it's happening for someone, but it looks roughhhhhh.

Edit: obviously graphics don't make a good game. My favorite game is Old School Runescape. But for an action single player RPG coming out in 2024, the trailer has me worried. Feels like shovelware for a movie that doesn't exist."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I’m really hoping this isn’t just shitty Uncharted 4
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I have yet to see a single person excited for this
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,The tiny bit of actual gameplay in that trailer looks awful. Seems like it could have a fun story though.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Stiff animation, plastic-ish textures ... looks like a 2010's game. Who's behind this? Oh Bethesda, not surprising."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I still don't understand the choice to make it first person perspective
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Happy to be proven wrong but massively expect this to be utter shite
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Looks exactly like Far Cry
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"This looks like a serious contender for the ""Best Graphics"" award from the 2008 Spike Video Game Awards."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Those original point and click Indy games, particularly Atlantis, are so good!  Still a fun retro playthrough. Wish they would remaster them ala Full Throttle and Day of the Tentacle.  

That said, I also really hope it is the first one.  Looking forward to really enjoying a play through or needlessly suffering through a playthrough while my game pass is active this winter. Either way..."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I wonder if any of the writers from back then even still work there tbh.  That’s was a very long time ago, 30ish years."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Indiana Jones? Grounded? Every movie in the franchise has had fantastical or supernatural elements.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"The devs themselves have been pretty clear that the game has to be a hard reset if they want audiences to latch on to the franchise like Gen Xers did 40 years ago.

I saw Dial with my dad when it premiered and I was the only person under 40 in the theater, that's not great for an IP. 

Nostalgia only takes you so far and gets you dwindling returns, if you can't make something that modern audience would actually like there's no point in throwing money at legacy IPs, and companies want those IPs to be worth the investment they've made. 

Square has pointed out the same problem; they keep making Final Fantasy titles aimed at people who know the IP from its glory days, and it turns out that audience isn't enough to sustain their budgets.

If this game does well, it will mean more than Crystal or Dial ever could have meant for the franchise."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Good news! The game’s definitely gonna be at least 4 hours longer than that
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,PC gamer got to play it last month and it sounds like a better Gollum https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/after-three-hours-with-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-i-dont-think-its-the-grand-adventure-machinegames-is-pitching-its-just-a-fairly-basic-stealth-game/
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Hey, I like Crystal Skull and Dial of Destiny. This game takes place in between those original movies, so it makes sense that it would feel more like those films than the last two. In Crystal and Dial, Indy is in a very different time in his life."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"How adorable, i lost hope when they started talking about how the game was made for a ""modern audience"""
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,I can't wait to play it 2-3 years from now when I have built a new PC that can run it decently. 
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"First time I heard it I knew it was Troy because I've heard him a million times. But I still wasn't 100% sure. It's really, really good"
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"It's weird to see Troy Baker's voice coming out of Harrison Ford's head though, its a very good impression but its not convincing enough to make me not get uncanny vibes."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Really? Cuz, the first thing I thought was, ""That's an imposter. What have you done with Indy!"""
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Still sounds like Troy to me but he’s doing pretty good
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Take a gander at the system requirements. It's going to run like ass at 1080p on the vast majority of systems, even with upscaling and frame gen on."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,they gun fuck it up. Search info about it. Embargo on release date + review manipulation
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Too late, the horse is already dead and they are going to beat this IP until their arms get tired."

1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I truly don't understand what people don't like about Crystal Skull. In terms of tone, it's much closer to the original trilogy than Dial of Destiny."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"New movie was quite strong! Leagues above Crystal Skull. Of course, not quite original trilogy, but man it left me wanting more movies."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"PCGamer had an article about how it seemed to have a lot of forced stealth in what they played (and somehow the whip doesn’t break stealth maybe, I’m not quite sure if that was true but that sounds dumb if it is). Funny cuz Star Wars: Outlaws is actually trying to remove some of its stealth segments…"
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,New movies was pretty good.

1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"If it's fun, who cares. I'm tired of chasing graphics.... Just make a fun game. Most of my favorite games from the last 3-5 years look like they could be on late PS3 or Early PS4."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Yea looks chalky and a bit outdated. Hopefully, everything will be set. Overall looks fun to play. Definitely tomb raider vibes!"
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I get the impression it's going to have a lot of the ""PRESS X NOW"" mechanics during cut scenes which is the worst way to ""interact"" with an adventure game."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Considering it’s mo-cap I would imagine that it would be “low-res” and not wooden, although I really like what I’ve seen of the cutscenes, personally"
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"12700K/3080 Ti for recommended is rough, I'm not sure why they want mandatory ray-tracing. RIP for anyone on a GTX 10/RX 5000 and older, I guess."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Damn, that’s got to be the highest recommended requirements I’ve seen."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-08,Are you sure about that?
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I mean Ford these days sounds like a Ford with mouth full of marbles too. But I get it. There are times it is spot on and other times it sounds off.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Troy Baker. If it’s a video game lead, odds are it’s Nolan North or Troy Baker."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Soundalike is as good as we'll get considering Harrison's age. Definitely better than using an AI model trained to do Indy, don't you think?"
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"You mean they didn’t want pay for him.  “But he sounds old,” they could certainly fix that if they wanted. Troy was cheaper, and legally can’t copy Ford that closely. I just see this as another corner cut by the executives who don’t ultimately care that much for the product."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Honestly if this ends up just being a bit of mediocre jumping and just-fine gunplay inebeween cool cinematics, I will be happy enough provided they hit the tone and atmosphere."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Brother the only thing this sub does is shit on games these days. Let people be excited for something they are excited for

1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Honestly, I just wish it was fully 3rd person.  First person action/adventure puts me off in a big way unless it is somehow spectacularly done.

I'm not not getting ""spectacular"" from the gameplay clips I'm seeing.  But as an Indy fan, I may give it a try in spite of that."

Raiders was a foundational movie for me and has been my favorite since I was 9. I want this game to be good so badly, but I’m expecting the worst and hoping to be surprised"
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Do yourself a favor and watch 1-3. Peak adventure cinema.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"What?? Please please watch the original three. They stand the test of time. Great writing, classic adventure, nothing like them produced these days.

1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,If you have game pass. You are paying for it.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,This game is below AC Mirage and Cities Skylines 2 on Steam global bestsellers. Ludus non grata
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,It has forced ray tracing
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I think the first person thing is because it’s what the studio is familiar with since they worked on wolfinstein. Honestly we don’t get many first person games nowadays out fps so I say it’s a welcome change from the norm of 3rd person over the shoulder
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I kind of agree actually. I was watching videos on Horizon remastered and the commentator complimented the facial animation and lip sync and I actually thought it looked very meh. It’s been a long time since I played L.A. Noir, but I feel like that game did lip sync better than every game released these days and it is 13 years old now."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,What?
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"No it isn’t. I’m not sure where you’ve heard that but that’s obviously false ffs. 

Redditors really are something else man"
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,You are talking about dragon age veilguard.

1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I wouldn’t go as far as saying he sounds so weird, but I certainly don’t understand why people are saying he sounds just like Harrison Ford either."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,It's rsytracing required  and the req target is 60 fps. That's why it's high.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,It's raytracing required  and the req target is 60 fps. That's why it's high.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I think the exact moment is 0:27, when the Bethesda logo shows up."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It's a Bethesda game.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Looks excellent to me. Who needs super-realistic graphics? If you can show facial emotions it's enough. So yeah, I think you might be spot on with 2010-2015. That's when the graphical improvements slowed to a crawl anyway.

That said, Uncharted 4 was 2016 and its facial animations were about on par with this one, so I do hope the budget and dev time went into other aspects."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Nothing about this trailer looks 2011 to me
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,aka Uncharted 4 lol

1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I liked the Wolfenstein games they did and I liked Uncharted. If it reviews well I might pick it up.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,You blind
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Make that 4 people

We shit on that now? At least it will perform like butter, unlike UE5 garbage."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,But it’s not Bethesda…it’s Machine Games developing it which is who made the last several Wolfenstein games

1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"They say it's because they want you to feel like you're Indiana Jones and that it makes it more immersive for the player. But the real reason is because it's made by Machine Games, who exclusively makes first-person games."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,DAY OF THE TENTACLE!!!
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"No chance. But that doesn't mean the new writers can't be up to the job. The trailers definitely suggest reverence for the franchise, rather than trying to reinvent it."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"The balance between elements is not always the same though.
Another example would be Pirates of the Caribbean. There always were supernatural elements there too. But if you take the first, it's a solid 80% pirate stuff, while it's not the case in later movies."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Right lol


Christians somehow think the ark isn't ahistorical"
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Crystal skull is a pretty garbo film but it got me into Indiana Jones as a kid lol. When I saw the trailers for Dial Of Destiny I was immediately put off by it -- it just seemed like it would be another form of nostalgia bait like The Force Awakens was. 

I hope the game attracts more people to the IP though, there's some potential for a series of games."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Its MachineGames that are doing the Indiana Jones game. Some people were confused about a first person view Indy game but then I remember that MachineGames did Riddick Escape from Butchers Bay and the recent Wolfenstein games and those were all first person view with an emphasis on animations.

If I recall, even some team members and lead designers from the Butchers Bay team returned to assist with the Indy game."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I have nothing good to say about those movies. I can't remember anything positive at all, except the nuclear fridge sequence, which raises a smile, but for the wrong reasons. I guess Dial was slightly better... 

Lost Ark - 10 Temple of Doom - 8 Last Crusade  - 10 Crystal Skull - 2 Dial - 4."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Same, and when the rainbow hair dude showed up I was pushed even further away - May eventually try on Game Pass but probably not lol"
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,I'll be playing this on series X so it should run fairly well but I also hope to have put together a decent PC to replace my near decade old laptop in the next few years.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Sometimes it sounds like Harrison Ford yawning
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Enforced ray tracing?! Wtaf...
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Made with with id tech tho.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Review embargo until release day has been Bethesda’s policy for years
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Idk about that, Machinegames did a pretty good job with the Wolfenstein franchise, like 4 very good games to one mediocre one. I think they're one of the better studios out there. Even though the mediocre one was their last project. So there certainly is room for doubt.

At least they have ample experience with shooting Nazis :-)"
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I searched info about it and it said the embargo lifts on the 5th, which is one day before early access and 4 days before actual release. What's a red flag about that? I'm not sure about review manipulation or anything like that, but if the embargo was lifted on the 9th, I'd see what you're saying. But I'm not seeing it?"
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,The embargo is on the 5th 4 prior to release dude
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"GTA 5 has a review embargo as well, as does many other games that have been very successful and well received. It's only a red flag to the stupid who don't know any better."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"In the past decade, they did one movie and a single game"
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"It's MachineGames, generally their games have been good."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,tbh they’ve killed it this year
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Over reliance on bad CG and digital effects, lazy writing, and the Tarzan sequence for me."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"- Watching an old grandpa get his shit kicked in by fascists isn’t fun

- Excessive cartoony CGI made it feel too modern and slick vs the retro “golden age Hollywood” look of the old movies

- The atomic-age paranoia at the center of the story wasn’t nearly as spooky as ancient pseudo-biblical mysticism and didn’t really feel like Indiana Jones."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I liked crystal back when I watched it in cinemas and I still like it now 

I think the main issue is that it really doesn’t hold up compared to the trilogy and it was at a time when George was being very weird with his work that even Spielberg wasn’t feeling it 

But even then it was well made and you do get the spirit which DOD really lacks"
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,The hiding in the fridge during a nuclear blast and the tarzan shit ruined it for me
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,The ending was a history geek's fever dream fantasy.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Hey now. Don't say you enjoyed Dial of Destiny, or you'll get a swarm of people crying and bitching about it."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"The person who wrote that preview review was definitely missing out on something, because the devs have explicitly stated that there is no forced stealth (so no failstates for if you’re discovered in stealth) because they ‘believe in player agency,’ as they say.

I can’t say how accurate the whip part is, but it can be used as a distraction against enemy guards, although if they mean that enemies nearby don’t hear if their buddies get whipped by Indy then I don’t know how accurate that is.

A fair few of the reviews of the hands-on preview were very positive though, so I have a lot of faith."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"For me, games like RDR2, TLOU 2, and Ghost of Tsushima, and GOW were all released on the PS4 near the end of it's lifecycle and they look and play so damn good. Hell, BOTW and TOTK are 16gb and 32gb total in storage and are so well optimized. Everything is getting away from these kind of developments, and publishers are relying on DLSS/FSR and frame gen technology to bridge the gap. But that gap is quickly become a wooden bridge that would make even Indy assess the risk of trying to get across."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Reddit: “games need to focus on graphics”

Also Reddit: “games need to focus on gameplay”

Also Reddit: “games take too long to make”

Also Reddit: “games are too expensive”"
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I highlighted the RT required part because that's crazy on the minimum for all those GPUs, like what? From what I've seen and heard it is very likely that it is using RT Global illumination but it's a bit hard to tell from the short clips.

Edit: Oh yeah I think they are, based on DF's hands on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4PHRLXmnNM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4PHRLXmnNM) they are talking about it around the 5:50 minute mark."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,That's. . . That's fair actually yeah Ford also sounds this way now.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"No idea why they hate him, the dude is great"
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,My favourite tip of his about getting into voice acting for video games is: *Wait until Nolan North and I die.*

1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Agreed. Honestly Indy games have always used soundalikes. I remember the voice of Indy in fate of Atlantis before I even heard Harrison Ford
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,">“But he sounds old,” they could certainly fix that if they wanted.

They couldn't for the last film but you think they could have here?

>Troy was cheaper, and legally can’t copy Ford that closely.

And this is absolute rubbish btw"
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Voicing a neutral or negative opinion about something doesn't take anything away from the people that are excited for it though? 

I think this sub is pretty fair in terms of being able to voice opinions on either side honestly, but I've noticed a lot of threads about this game across various subreddits where anything other than praise is drowned in downvotes."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,I was referring to the several other comments here that were heavily downvoted within minutes of this thread being posted and are still in the negative.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Criticism of a game that has yet to come out is speculation.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,And then stop. There is no 4th movie. Nope.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Acceptable Polygon.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,No I’m not. I’m paying for Stardew Valley. Every other game is bonus content.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,The game that’s not even out yet?
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Wow that’s crazy. It’s kinda similar to how GTA 6 sold zero copies. What a flop
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Downvoted for stating facts because redditors don't like the truth is the most reddit Thing Ever.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,">with since they worked on wolfinstein

Or Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay.  
I don't understand why Machine Games hasn't talked about this."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Based on the gameplay they’ve shown it also looks like it might be going for a very light immersive sim feel, which makes more sense in first person. Despite being based of a movie franchise it doesn’t look like it’s trying to be as “cinematic” as something like Uncharted."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"If you say so, must be true."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"No, if they don’t trust that it will get reviewed well by letting reviewers see if first, that shows they don’t trust the product which is something that is concerning/a red flag. Just because you say it’s not, use the word “obvious” like it was “common sense” (something that’s not a thing…I’d put *obviously* here… but well we just don’t all come to the same conclusions especially since there are so many different and differing pools of information…)and blame some group (which you are curisouly a part of) doesn’t mean to people who think critically about these things what you think it means.

It’s a red flag. Even if they didn’t read it somewhere, delaying impartial reviewers and hoping people will just buy it because of FOMO (or better yet super buy it for early access) is always a red flag (in every industry)."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Well it's not like ge can bring harrison back, dude is old as hell and probably just wants to retire.

Troy sounds pretty close to him."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"It's a MachineGames title though, Bethesda just published it.  The engine is apparently id Tech."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Bethesda isn’t developing this game lmao
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,lmao
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"No it’s not. Machine Games is the dev. “Bethesda”, the publisher, not the developer, is publishing (funding) it. It uses a completely different engine (id Tech) that Bethesda, the developer, uses (Creation Engine)."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"The facial animation is the part that looks uncanny valley to me. In a game that is probably going to have a TON of plot related dialogue, I don't want to be looking at Bethesda-dead-eye no matter who is making it."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,2015 then.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,4 was a fine gamez a bit overrated but still solid.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,yeah but its first person and not a cinematic bland third person game with poor rpg elements made by Sony. Obviously that makes it a 2010 game!
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I just feel like the whip play is more suited to 3rd person and would come across as more visually impressive
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I'm one of the few that actually enjoy Crystal Skull for what it is. It had some pretty fun moments and didn't really take itself too seriously. I definitely enjoy it more than Temple of Doom lol.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Honestly, I was fine with that movie till the last 5-10 minutes. I never expected it to be as good as the original trilogy, I didn't care about things like the lead fridge. It was fine, right up till the alien scene and the saucer flying off.

They already did the Ark of The Covenant, they could have done very similar here and just have it be some mystical power and revelation of this. It didn't have to actually be aliens and a space ship."

1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I mean we have to wait. But embargo on release date is always a giant red flag plus they're blacklisting reviewers for ones that will give them positive reviews. Also red flag.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Embargo release December 5 at 7pm ET/4pm PT.

Release date December 6 at midnight. So are you telling me that 5 hours difference is a whole day, news to me. 

Usually when companies are confident in their product, they release the embargo days before the release date, so reviews, sites and word of mouth help with the popularity and sales. If they release it the same day (or in this case a whooping 5 hours before release) it means they know the reception won't be as positive. 

I don't know how long you've been in gaming but this is pretty much known."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Both editions enable a 3-day [early access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_access) period to play the game from December 6, 2024. Do your research first pls.

  
Also embargo is lifted on **December 5 at 7pm ET/4pm PT**, barely 5 hours before the release."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Stop making sense. People just like to think Indiana Jones and Star Wars are the exact same properties.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"If by ""it"" you mean two huge studios, then yes they have."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I guess I can see the argument for CGI but it's not something that I feel really changed the feel of the movie overall in my eyes. It still more closely aligns to the vibe of the original trilogy more than Dial to me. The Tarzan sequence is so similar to the mine cart sequence in Doom that I really am surprised that people don't like it. The original trilogy is so goofy at times just like Skull.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"The point I 100% agree on is your last one. The pseudo-biblical mysticism is what makes Indiana Jones, Indiana Jones in my eyes. It's why I don't love Doom as much.

Also, Indy is known for getting his shit kicked in many times in the OG trilogy. He always was rough and tumble, and barely survived many of his encounters with enemies. He is scrappy and always on his heels. Your first point is completely in line with that especially as an older dude."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I don’t disagree with what you’ve said but the “golden age of Hollywood” was actually about the time that the original films were set, not when they were Meade"
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"It was pretty fun watching a nazi wildly shoot hitler's buzzsaw out of a WW2 era airplane at a bunch of romans, I'll give it that.

Probably the one good scene out of that entire movie."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"It was fine. It was never going to be able to recover fully from Crystal skull, and was likely never going to give you that feeling of satisfaction and them riding off into the sunset like from Last Crusade."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I recall a lot of reviews really trashing it online but when I actually watched it, I thought it was decent. Way better than Crystal Skull which I actively disliked. There were a few issues I had with it, but for the most part it held up really well, in my opinion."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"They’re not even really bitching about the movie they’re bitching about the temerity of Phoebe Waller-Bridge existing. 

Or at least that’s how some of the bitching about it reads to me. Even people that have some grounded criticism that holds up delve into anti-woke nonsense."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Well I don't but I'd like too. Fingers crossed tho!
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,The amount of work that goes into making the games you mentioned are about to cripple the industry though. It's not sustainable.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I'm currently playing Xenoblade Chronicles Definitive Edition, and I think it looks fantastic. I've played modern games with all of the graphical enhancements, but I still think older-style games look as good or better in some cases."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,You really tore down that straw man.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Edit2: Further digging found this [https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/indiana-jones-great-circle-geforce-rtx-40-series-bundle/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/indiana-jones-great-circle-geforce-rtx-40-series-bundle/)

They are bundling it from 4070 and the 4070 laptop versions probably for a reason, (excluding the 4060 and the ti versions) while mentioning path tracing and DLSS again. Oh boy the end of the year when it comes to performance between recent titles seems very questionable this year."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Both of them and my other favorite VA, Robin Atkin Downes are all on Saints Row 4. Of course RAD is the only one you can pick and still feel awesome

What's funny is Troy and Robin are ""Boss 1"" and ""Boss 3"" but Nolan's voice is simply ""Nolan North"""
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"It’s not really the performance just the way he acts as he does come off as pretentious in the last few years

Personally I’m indifferent if it helps him bring out good performances then all the power to him"
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Well they de-aged him with that dumb CGI filter they seem to have to use in all superhero films nowadays (and really it's super easy barely an inconvenience to do this with just a voice, not to mention that AI that is super good at it now, or you know just ask the actor to enunciate a little more).

Absolutely not rubbish, Troy is both cheaper and cannot copy Ford too closely or he would likely be sued, just like actors are suing AI and would sue anyone who essentially stole their work even if it as just a really good imitation.

You people never show any evidence."

1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,Temple of Doom is my favorite! I love the original trilogy. Don't care for the recent two films.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,That’s just how they do things. People were saying the same thing before Doom 2016 came out and now it’s generally seen as one of the best single player shooters from the last decade.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Do a little tiny bit of history research on their practices before acting like this is some new, dastardly tactic and you'll look a little less like an ass."

1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Stop putting words in my mouth. I never said 5 hours was a whole day, but please keep acting like a child. Sounds like you just believe whatever slop some raging youtuber fed you for breakfast. Show me the proof of review manipulation that is 100% irrefutable so I can see all the ""research"" you've done on this topic as well.

And if people didn't like the 5-hour difference, then they wouldn't bother with early access. That's pretty easy to figure out. Not that hard to see that people who want early access will just dive in, regardless of when the embargo lifts.

Most of the general public will be able to view reviews well in advance of the street date on the 9th and be able to make up their minds. Whether they're confident in their product or not, people will still have plenty of time. Stop acting like it's some panic choice they have to make because the embargo lifts at the zero hour. Your argument is disingenuous at best."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"If you are waiting for the midnight release to get the game the absolute moment it comes out, you can read some reviews in that window."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Bro just don’t buy it then and wait for reviews and gameplay to come out. There are many reasons for an embargo but if you don’t like it, don’t buy it. Makes no sense why people think they have to flock to the internet to complain about something that barely anyone actually cares about. If it’s a trash game, people will know very quickly"
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I can't wait for the new Indiana Solo movie
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,no that ain’t what i meant
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"It's definitely still an Indy movie, but look at the two sequences mentioned and you'll see how bored Spielberg seems at directing another one. The minecart chase is visceral, exciting, and really fun--done with practical effects, mini's, stunts, and care. The vine swinging sequence is Shia on a green screen with terrible, unrealistic (especially their ""personalities"") monkeys. 

I liked Crystal Skull for the most part, especially as a 50's Pulp Sci-fi, but stacked up against any of them and it's a complete let down all around."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Your confusion comes from the fact that you're comparing it to the Dial, a movie which did not yet exist when it released, rather then the original trilogy. It is not a good indy movie plain and simple. You can say the same about Dial. That doesnt make Crystal skull good in any way shape or form."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,What? I think the best scenes were in the beginning. If they had managed to keep the vibe they had at the castle and on the train the movie could've been a solid 7.5.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Oh I agree. But people act as though Dial of Destiny beat their children. It was fine, but nothing will ever top the first three movies."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"I left Crystal Skull feeling disappointed and kind of bored, and I despised Shia lebouf’s character (probably because he just acted like Shia Lebouf, who is a pretentious twat). I left the new one feeling thoroughly entertained, even if I didn’t think it should win any awards. I genuinely don’t get the hate. IMO it was better than temple of doom, but not as good as the other two originals."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Wow. I mean, they're making it so that almost anyone with a Redeon or a low-end or old GeForce GPU can't run their game at 60 FPS. I wonder how the XSX and PS5 will fare because they have pretty poor RT performance."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I mean yeah he might get kinda pretentious sometimes but that’s tolerable at best and as long it doesn’t affect his voice work then that’s fine by me. Same with Steve Blum too when he goes on his political rants on twitter but besides that he’s still a great VA like Troy or Nolan.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Dude his performances are rock solid. That’s really what matters and also why he keeps getting work.

TLOU1/2*, Far Cry 4, Batman Arkham Origins/Telltale Batman, Uncharted 4, and one of my favorites, bioshock infinite.

#He’s ubiquitous because he’s damn good

Personality wise… I mean, I don’t like Mel Gibson’s politics and he’s insufferable in regards to his work with Passion of the Christ, but ***I ain’t gonna say Mad Max or Hacksaw Ridge are bad movies because of it.***

**I didn’t like the game at first… then I played it. I love it. If you still don’t like it, perfectly fine, but I’d say it’s one of the greatest games I’ve played.*"

This is indeed *absolute* rubbish.  It's not some knock off or imitation product, this is a fully licensed Indiana Jones release *literally using his likeness*.  You are completely off base, doubling down didn't change that, but hey try tripling if you like."

1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,I'm purely speaking about the embargo. I couldn't find anything about a blacklist or whatever else they were saying. They do that sort of thing with movies too when they don't screen them for the critics. Blacklisting reviewers and only allowing positive reviews doesn't make sense when there's currently an embargo on ALL REVIEWS so I don't know what they mean by that.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,well it's impossible to 100% replicate a voice. he was probably the closest they could find.

1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Spielberg didn't want to direct another Indiana Jones movie. Lucas begged him into doing it and he quarter assed it
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"You do have a point about the visceral feel of it, that's fair. I will still stand by my points though. I guess I just think the sequence itself isn't anything different than any other Indy action sequence. And I do think that Aliens in the 50s fits way better in the Indiana Jones canon than time travel.

All that being said, the reason I always found the central mysteries of Indiana Jones so intriguing is because they were looking for Biblical artifacts. There's an air of mystery that even Doom doesn't have, and I think the movies suffer when they strayed from that. Not sure why I even feel that way but it's something I noticed when contemplating it recently."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I do love the pattern of elevating a bad movie by releasing a new even worse one. Thanks, Disney! (altho ya probably done before)"
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It wasn't fine.  It somehow ruined Phoebe Waller-Bridge for me.   She somehow ruined the movie.   Now I'm just expecting her to ruin Tomb Raider.
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Temple of doom was never very good, let's be real. It just gets forgotten between the two really good ones."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"I truly don't understand what people don't like about Crystal Skull. In terms of tone, it's much closer to the original trilogy than Dial of Destiny."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Ha! Temple was my favorite as a kid mostly because there was a kid my age in it at the time I saw it and it had that amazing mine-cart scene. Woosh!

Yeah, overall I agree though."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Sorry didn’t explain myself properly I also like his performance too, I was just explaining why people didn’t like him as this is the common stuff people say when Troy Baker is mentioned. I did add that I was mostly indifferent to what he says 

I really like his performances too all the way back when he was voicing multiple characters in the Trauma Team game on the Wii 

But yeah I hope I made myself clear on that"

It’s a heavy story based game, I can’t imagine they want people posting gameplay spoiling the story before it’s even out. Again, we will be able to see once it’s out if it’s any good. No embargo would only help those pre ordering the game and if you’re still one of those people pre ordering games then you’re part of the problem"

It doesn't mean the game is going to be shit, but the practice itself is shit, and a lot of companies do it to avoid bad reviews killing launch momentum."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Well the Sankara Stones are part of another cultures “bible.” Aliens are ok, I think I was disappointed the evil villain was punished for wanting to pursue knowledge and not necessarily for evil. I think practical effects and magic just seemed to be funner and more magical than CGI and aliens. You have to maybe earn one of them with a team and limits and the other you can just pay for anything to be shown. I liked the Crystal Skull movie more than the Dial (progressively lamer titles, now we’re after a circle :( I mean I liked the Tomb Raider where we go after King Arthur’s sword. It had a lot of opportunity for educating the players on Arthurian Legend that I’m not sure fake skulls, Antikythera mechanism had (an ancient computer maybe but it was very quickly turned into a very contrived magical item that required a plane and stuff). I dunno rocks over a pit of gators and Shortround (how did they not make him the new Indy :( over whatever was constantly happening with Indy’s double-double-double spy friend and escaping magnets or whatever."
1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Okay, then it wasn't fine for you. That's perfectly fine as well lol. I'm just saying it won't ever touch the first three movies."

1h5o8ea,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"There are many reasons for an embargo on reviews and yes lots of these companies are doing it for bad reasons but there are many other reasons a company can fair justify one. It may be that they couldn’t deliver a build they were happy with early enough for reviewers (not a good sign) or the fact that this game is very heavily focused on story and having gameplay and reviews out in the wild can ruin it for someone before they can even get their hands on the game. Let’s just hope it turns out to be good and if not, we can decide not to buy it like adults"

1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,"I was reading an article on the NVIDIA site about the full ray tracing (also known as path tracing) awhile ago and it said these features may not be available at launch. Most likely some nvidia driver shenanigans going on, where both the game and required drivers are coming in too close to have it ready for early access. 

What makes this extra confusing for consumers is that “full ray tracing” is actually path tracing which won’t be available at launch, but the game will still use ray tracing in general, just not “full” ray tracing. They could’ve just stuck to the path tracing name, but NVIDIA must keep being NVIDIA."
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,Is this so that streamers that play it during early access don’t have all kinds of performance issues live on stream and push more people away from the game?
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,"You mean the release date? The rest are playing the ""Late Access"""
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,Imagine paying $100 for early access and getting a worse product than those who choose to wait.
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,"Bethesda moment. 

MachineGames: yeah so we’ve got all the ray tracing ready for December 9th release date. 

Bethesda: that’s great but we are doing an early access period to get some more money! 

MachineGames: …but the Ray Tracing won’t be fully implemented until December 9th

Bethesda: I don’t care"
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,"Is ""no ray tracing"" the new ""locked at x fps"" thing that folks get mad about?"
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,I always turn off raytracing when I can anyway. The visual improvement is barely noticeable compared to the performance hit.
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,"DLSS is broken.  Frame gen causing huge stutters every 2 seconds.  DLSS causing weird graphic shimmers everywhere.  Other than that game runs fine, but all this advertising of how great DLSS and frame gen is shouldn't be marketing towards these features if it's broken AF.

For a Bethesda game and Nvidia sponsored I'm a bit disappointing so called features ain't working right from the start."
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,"Wait, this is in early access? I swear the marketing made it seem like it was just… out. Isn’t it single player?"
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,"Hey guys, the game isn't done yet.  You're going to pay full price to play test it."
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,Rt or not. The game is definitely not a looker compared to most high-tech games on PC
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,I’ll wait until it’s like $20 next Christmas.
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,"**We do not follow the Customers wishes, and ""X"" never, ever marks the Release Date.**

But I'll wait anyway, even if it's just out of spite."

1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,So is the path ray tracing something that can be turned off or down? I have the game since it came with the video card I purchased the other day and I have all my settings maxed out on a 1440p monitor and I’m getting 100-120 fps with DLSS set to quality or balanced. I can’t remember. I’d hate to play all weekend then Monday comes and ray tracing drops my frames in half. I’ve also only played the opening. Wondering if the game gets more taxing.
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,"Just updated my driver, my game won't launch. Saying can't find English driver not updated."
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,"The game performs exceptionally well and looks wonderful as it is. 

Admittedly I'm using a high end GPU (7900xtx) but everything is set to high, 4k, and it happily breaks 60fps at native 4k. Then I click on dynamic res target of 120fps and away we go! 

Great environments, models, materials, and lighting.

Path tracing is a technology which is just too far away.  1080p/30fps on ""low"" with a 4070, what a joke. It doesn't matter if it's coming later. Nobody will be using it."
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,Need to make a great first impression before hammering performance with ray tracing.
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,Is this PC only?
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,"Yeah…I will rarely purchase games on release these days. Especially considering the company. The game will still be there in a month or so, there’s no rush."
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,"They could put a decent video card in it. For example, a gtx 1080 ti etc., no game to date has such high requirements.👍👍"

1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,Yet people keep paying…
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2025-02-06,"The thing is as per the game specs, the game cannot be played without Ray Tracing function. I purchased a new desktop, time anyway. And to my surprise RT is NOT turned on when Optimized in NVIDIA. I wrote NVIDIA they said Indiana Jones is not even yet supported?? Silent Hill 2 is also not supported yet! This was 2 days ago. Like trying to make sales on bogus requirements? Nothing new I guess. "
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2025-02-06,Also I don’t think there is anything preventing you from changing the options in the game itself? Not sure I am nee to this stuff. 
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,So the game will be all fixed for the PS launch then.

1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,Not massively different form $70 at launch and still having a worse time then someone who wated for the first sale and got the game cheaper and fully patched.
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,How so? They get the same exact product as everybody else at the same time as everybody else. They just also get early access.
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,I can totally imagine it. The industry has been like this for 20 years
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-10,"Exactly it’s wasted money. I would boot it up and realise I can’t get the best experience, then turn it off and wait for the feature.. which defeats the point of early access."
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,more like “the early access idiots will still give us their money”
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,"Yes and it's hilarious because going off the recommended specs, most people won't be able to enjoy it."
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,"Who knows, some gamers just get mad about everything."
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,"They're heavily advertising path-tracing features, yet they're not even including it in the game's most expensive edition."
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,"I have a 3070ti which according to hardware surveys is still better than what most people are running. Having ray tracing turned on immediately drops FPS to nearly unplayable levels on most games. 

The only people who care about it are people with top end systems, and people who just want to be upset about something."
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,"I think one of the issues here is that the minimum system requirements for the game is a graphics card with Ray tracing, and now they're saying the game won't launch with full ray tracing."
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,"Very much depends on the game. The Witcher is a great example for how much ray traced global illumination will make a scene look impeccably good with realistic lighting compared to their rasterized lighting. Just means less work for the developers with a much better outcome but yeah, the performance cost is still too high imo to make it a hardware requirement."
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,"Early access as in ""you can start playing it 3 days before the official release if you pre-order the Deluxe Edition"""
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,"Well almost every AAA game has some type of ""early access"" now. Its the weirdest trend in recent AAA gaming imo. Maybe im just too ""old"" to not get into whole FOMO.

Specially why pay like $100 when the games gonna be on gamepass day 1?"
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,More than full price.
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,The Bethesda Way.
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,It’s almost like as consumers we have the choice to not do that if we don’t want to. Crazy concept. I know.
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,"if i ever become a gamedev or something,  i will try to make a simple-ish game, that would be like BL2, where it isnt graphically intense but will look amazing.  cell shading is  amazing.   more games need to be geared for tech that is still 5-15 years old and easy to play for people on older hardware."
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,Why would you buy it?  It’ll forever be on Gamepass.
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,It’s on gamepass so you could just play it for $12. I think you would be able to finish it in 30 days
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,I’d imagine you won’t have to wait that long.
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,You can preload it now on game pass
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,"Same. I can load the artbook, that's it...lol....Injust restarted my PC. I'll post back in a few"
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,Still nothing
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,"It's running at a solid 60 on series s and it doesn't have ray tracing options - so yes, it's irrelevant"
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,No
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,Console won’t have path tracing so yes it’s irrelevant.
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,To get people to buy the deluxe edition
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,Or there is a delay on driver updates that typically coincide with big releases.
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,Except this isn't talking about the base RT implementation lol reading is hard
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,"It’s the path tracing that is not in, RT is."
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,People don’t really care about anything other than frame rate performance but Nvidia has helped brainwash and destroy gaming with their gimmick this generation. Ray tracing is great but it’s strange that they’re forcing it on the industry while requiring games to run their proprietary upscaling AI tech just to get it to work. 🤷🏻‍♂️
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,Yeah it needs a driver because Nvidia sets flags in the new drivers to enable certain features and performance based tweaks in the games. Without it the game runs poorly. For example in this game without the latest driver you will get poor performance but with the updated driver it’s 60fps (or better) on the same hardware.
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,"It always has RT, it doesn’t even support no ray tracing. The path tracing is missing (full RT) on the requirements, probably some bugs appeared in reviewing and ID software needs a few days to implement the fix in the engine."
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,"""They turned Indiana Jones into antifa wokeness propaganda"""
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,Lol.  I see what u did there.
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,What? This has to be bait right?
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,It's getting 9s across the board
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,Same
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,Still not working for me on pc… anyone else get the digital premium upgrade? Surely you don’t need to buy the game separately too?!
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,That happened 11 years ago. That’s not relevant at all
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,Only for cards without proper RT hardware.
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,"Yeah flip the switch and turn it off then, your drama card has been revoked."
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,Ray tracing is always on. Path tracing is not enabled until the 9th
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,">Since it’s Bethesda… and their recently destroyed reputation…

...their latest mainline video game has an average score in the low-mid 80's, higher than the internet's beloved New Vegas lmao"
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,"No, raytracing is built into the game. You can't just pull it out like that."
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-10,I’m not sure what point you’re trying to make? OP is right that the term ‘path tracing’ is a more suitable term and ‘full ray tracing’ is just confusing to consumers.
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-11,No kidding! I have a 4080gpu and I get 120fps without path tracing and 13 fps with it on. Which makes no sense that a 4080 brand new system wouldn't be able to run path tracing. I've been told my ram is causing my problem.
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,Yes. Look at the system requirements. 90%+ of the Steam Hardware Survey is going to have a *bitch* of a time running it at decent frame rates *with* upscaling on at basically every resolution. It's cheaper than spending another year optimizing it though and we all know reviewers won't have any issues on their 4090/9800x3d setups (and they wouldn't admit it if they did because that might piss off Microsoft and get them fewer review copies going forward).
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,You got downvoted but in general yes. From what I understand you cannot turn ray tracing off at all in this game.
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,"Definitely doesn’t seem to be the case, reviews are great so far"
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,Looks like you were all wrong.
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,"why would a game being incomplete in EA be a bad sign? That's just the definition of early access. If anything, it's reassuring that ""early access"" isn't just being used as a marketing gimmick.

edit: nevermind lol"
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,It's probably shit.
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,Not sure what's wrong with your pc did you download the drivers ? I'm playing at supreme settings at 4k dlaa and from the first two levels am getting 55-80fps
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,Refund it
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,medium is broken right now

1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,Most of the time yes however I will say that as the years goes by Red Dead 2 on PC keeps becoming increasingly buggier and glitchier as they Continue to update online nonsense it's somehow affects single player in ways I don't personally understand

Now, why anyone would accept paying $70 for early access of what's supposed to be a AAA game from a major studio that hasn't released anything good in over a decade is absolutely beyond me."
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,"Well, for those who waited to play Concord…"
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,"In Australia, the Early Access Edition is AUD$175 but it also comes with The Last Crusade cosmetics and access to the future story DLC"
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,If I buy something like this generally buy the version that comes with the DLC since these companies like to nickel and dime on the DLCs and take forever to lower the discount. These versions usually include the early access sadly.
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,I never even use it because my gpu just melts. Or rather it feels like it will melt even tho it has safe temps its just noot worth the increased heat
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,they are including it in all editions. Stop misrepresenting the problem.
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,"Because it still has ray tracing, they're just calling path tracing full ray tracing now for whatever reason"
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,Why though? It doesn’t even have multiplayer 🤷‍♂️
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,"It's a $35 ""upgrade"" to get early access if you already have gamepass. Which is still stupid but at least it's less stupid"
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,"We used to go to Gamestop at midnight to buy games the second they released. Kids get real excited for video games, it's not too hard to figure out."
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,If you own a PS5 or don't have gamepass
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-09,You need Ultimate which is 20 bucks
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,Such bullshit they should have this shit ready lmao not surprised but I’ve gotten multiple early access upgrades and never had an issue you’d think with the biggest release they got in a while they’d want it to run smoothly .
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,So it is relevant?
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,These comments are all over YouTube already.
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,"Is that a quote from something? All I know is that Indiana Jones, Captain America, Republican (extinct, not current), and Democrat (classic and current) believe it is good and natural to punch them in the face or Wolfenstein their asses on sight."
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,I was right.
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,same
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,You can’t turn off ray tracing. It’s forced on all the time in this game. You can turn off path tracing
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-10,Path tracing is not actually 'full ray tracing' because there are still several other sub settings that need to be enabled
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,The most popular card is a 3060 which should run the low preset completely fine at non upscaled 1080p. You could maybe squeeze in 1440p with DLSS Quality
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,">Yes. **Look at the system requirements**. 90%+ of the Steam Hardware Survey is going to have a bitch of a time running it at decent frame rates **with upscaling**

Actually, the system requirements show the non-path tracing show resolution targets at native resolution (4k, 1440p, and 1080p). Those requirements are heavy for those resolution/framerate targets, but various youtube videos show it running quite well considering that it's always using ray tracing, such as [a 4070ti getting over 60 fps at native 4k, max settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZC_C7uvPMtE)."
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,An RTX 2060 gets native 1080p60 at low according to requirements. That isn't high setting requirements at all.
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,I wonder if user reviews are going to be negative because people will just think it’s unoptimized. 
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,Don’t trust reviews.
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,It’s three day early access. They’re not doing anything meaningful in that three days.
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,Lol its getting tremendous reviews as the embargo dropped. Gonna be a massive hit!
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,"Been playing it this morning, it's great."
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,"I didn't know drivers came out today, I'm restarting right now and I'm about to try it again"
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,"People that complain about the state of a game when they pay for early access deserve to mocked. 

And playing a game day one in 2024 doesn’t make much sense if you aren’t fine with broken quests and various bugs."
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,"They're like vegans and civic owners. Gotta make sure everyone knows.

Jokes aside though, the longer a game has been out, the more updates and everything it has received and it should be a better experience. At least for single player games.

Multiplayer games it's a bit different because the player base and/or updates can die off, but there are still games that it applies to such as FFXIV, FO76, and other live service games that don't remove content (looking at you Bungie)."
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,I actually address that in a comment further down.
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,Its a fantastic game as long as you never play it or watch gameplay.
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,Did they even have an early release for that game?
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,"Oh, I'm not saying games aren't worth it at release. Even most AAA games are IMHO. But those games, such as Stardew are still a lot better now than they were at launch."
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,"Sucks for the people who missed out, but Concord got better with each patch until it's shutdown."
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,"Right but isn't the base version also $120?


So at best you could say they paid $55 for the early access which ignores the DLC value.


Just a bit of a bad arguement people claiming they pay a huge amount just for that while ignoring plenty of other aspects the package comes with."
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,"Of course, it will be included in every edition—except the most expensive one, the early access edition, where it won't be available at launch."
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,That includes the dlc and cosmetics though.
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-07,"Well at least no one said on those that ""Sorry, midnight release will be 90 dollars. Its 60 dollars if you come back in few days""

1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,But it never *looked* better. Those character designs were horrendous. Nobody wanted to play as a space grandma or genderfluid mushroom.
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,"Correct. The base game itself was AUD$120.

I remember vividly when the base version of Capcom remakes started at AUD$100 instead of the usual AUD$80 that had been the norm for at least a decade.

Then came all the releases in 2023-2024 with base versions starting at AUD$105-110.

Indiana Jones being priced at AUD$120 makes me think the Indy IP itself is what's adding to the stupid increased cost, because Star Wars Outlaws also came out this year and wasn't this expensive.

I'm deeply worried for the future of gaming."
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,"The edition includes all functionality every other edition gets. That is like saying none of the editions get the second patch because they don’t have the patch yet when people start playing.

1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-11,I don't know what point you are trying to make. 'Full ray tracing' is a stupid term. I have never even implied that I am for it.
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,None of the major publishers do paid reviews.
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,Yep changed nothing other than the drivers and it's easily 60 fps now
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,Where have I said I'm a patient gamer? Im way too impulsive.
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,Best shooter released since Hell Let Loose to me. Game was fantastic to play.
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-05,"Yeah pricing in general I completely agree, it seems a bit wild for what it looks to be!


It's £59 on steam whereas baldurs gate 3 was £50, it has substantially more content involved and replay ability, couldn't ever consider paying that much for what will likely be a very on the rails with some puzzles (great or not!) and limited time (fine for your normal pricing).


I would presume you are right in that it's taking a sizeable chunk of the costing, the only good thing I guess is it's on game pass so for me I will just subscribe for a month at some point when I'm in a position to sink some hours into must haves."
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,Ofc buddy ofc....
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,Awesome :) enjoy the game actually saying that disable dlaa for some reason it was giving me artifacts just using taa cleaned it up for me. Sucks we don't get path tracing until the 9th though hopefully I don't finish it by then
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,"That’s fine, but the character designs and art style lacked attractiveness. If the gameplay was that good then Sony needs to take the skeleton of Concord and use that as a basis to build more appealing-looking games from."
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,"Interesting, I'll keep that in mind but yeah it's actually pretty good, just played for about 10 minutes and enjoyed it, also I'm doing easily 120 locked at 1080p high after getting the drivers. Wonder how it'll look with the rtx patch once that comes out"
1h7j43b,2024-12-05,2024-12-06,"While I don't think the character designs made a whole lot of sense, they fit the aesthetic of the universe and maps they created pretty well and I overall liked the look of the game. If others didn't, then fair enough to them, but I've never really cared about how characters looked in a game where I couldn't see them except to shoot at."
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"I liked it! The “fight slapstick”, musical cues, and dialogue felt very in the spirit of the movies. Set pieces looked good too"
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"first person adventure game, i guess they didnt want to get compared to Uncharted which is kinda funny because Uncharted is inspired by indy and basically legally distinct Indiana Jones

Im expecting this to play more like Resident Evil"
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Looks pulpy and fun ngl.

I wasn’t thrilled by a first person adventure platforming thing but it looks like a good time"
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Was kinda hoping to see actual gameplay rather than just a really long cutscene.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,anyone else finds it a bit odd how at the end they show these big open areas but there is always just one single area attacking the player?
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I like how similar to the original movies it all feels. Matched the visual style real well.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"This looks awesome. I'm not a huge Indiana Jones fan, but I'm totally hyped for this. Now I have to watch the movies."
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,5 minute mark confirms that signature crack of a punch so this game is going to be a 7 at minimum for me 
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Fuck yeahhhh
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,This looks like it could port to VR well.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,so hyped!! hope it turns out great
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"It sounds like Harrison Ford? Did anyone confirm if it's actually him?

I would love If it's actually him, a way to keep him forever young."
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Is it only first person?
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Looks and sounds awesome!
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,the environments seems amazing I'm hoping the exploration and the puzzles will be amazing too
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Looks awesome but the lack of specific release worries me if it’s truly 2024.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,2006 graphics
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Looks like it could be fun. Face animations look a bit stiff.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"It actually looks....really good? Wasn't expecting that considering its a movie tie in and the movies haven't been great lately. I'm happy to see they at least captured the vibe on Indy. 

Not sold on the name though."
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"I just learned it’s going to be first person only. That’s a bummer, I’m a huge fan of this kind of games (Uncharted, Tomb Raider). I was looking forward to it, but first person always makes me nauseous. 
I wish all games could offer both options."
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,They really did the writing extremely well for the characters it seems from this showcase. The nazis seems hilariously ridiculous and evil and Indy seems exactly like Indy.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"I love the humour, the music is perfect (as I expected), the action looks fun. It captures the first three Indy movies so well. Cannot wait!"
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"I'm just waiting for IGN to release a ""really makes you feel like Indiana Jones"" review so I can know if this game makes me feel like Indiana Jones. Otherwise it might make me feel like Batman."
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Exciting. I hope there are lots of things to go out and collect and complete. Perhaps historical artifacts or pieces of some greater puzzle
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-11,"Five minutes of video, of which seven minutes are cutscenes (that's a joke, just to be clear). 

Love the IP, but would've preferred to see more gameplay."
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-14,I think this game should have been a third person game
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Looks like Tomb Raider. Not sure they need to reveal the great circle untill one plays the game.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Troy Baker's definitely locked in on some Ford-isms in the dialogue. 

Machine games are a great studio so looking forward to playing for this at Xmas!"
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Indiana Jones, making circles great again"
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,hope they do the whip well! its really fun to use in Phantom Abyss for like platforming and stuff.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,My interest is now peaked even more.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Man am I tired of Troy Baker..hes like the chris pratt of voice actors.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Would love another SCUMM-game like the Fate of Atlantis.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"I’m going to be honest, this looked fucking terrible. I’m not saying the game is bad, or trying to dunk on anything or tell people not to like the game. It’s just that the animation looked terrible. Very rough, almost blurry or mushy. I could not possibly care less for Indiana Jones, and this cut scene did absolutely nothing to interest me. And, it’s supposed to launch within the next 6 months, but it STILL doesn’t have a release date? Based on what I’ve seen, it wouldn’t surprise me if it gets delayed. 

Again, I’m not saying the game is bad or it’s going to bomb or whatever, just that it looks terrible to me and that, in this age of making everything appeal to the widest audience possible, it’s hilarious that they are going big budget on an IP that hasn’t had a good movie in 40 years lol."
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,and overrated troy baker who cant do an indy voice is of course in the game. overrated
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Personally I think the Nazi humour is to much Wolfenstein. Also the voice acting was kinda bad for Indiana Jones at certain parts.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Genuine curiosity, no trolling here...

Who is this for?

I thought the entire Xbox showcase was incredibly strong, but for me, this was the one showcase I did not care for."
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"I agree, I feel like they really captured the feeling and the vibes of the movies for sure"
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,When that nazi went “choo choo” I cackled
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I had to laugh when they discovered the ship on the precipice just like the submarine in Uncharted 1
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"It's also made by machine games, who made wolfenstein so it makes complete sense for it to be a fps"
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,How would it be like Resident Evil?
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Honestly feels so off seeing this super long Cutscene with like 0 impact to anything happening and then these super slow first person clips.

I have no idea wtf their design is.

Indy's voice is on the dot tho"
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,If this game were 3rd person I’d be so hyped for it. Only seeing Indy on cutscenes just kills it for me.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Because it looks like Uncharted 4 released 8 years ago.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"On the topic, I came across an obscure old B-game last year called ""Deadfall Adventures"" which is literally an off-brand first-person Indiana Jones knockoff. It was eurojanky, but actually pretty fun. 

The sequence recreating the mine car chase from Temple of Doom was practically worth the price of admission by itself."
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,It really is a great circle huh?
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Platforming and traversal is all in 3rd person, they said it back at the January direct"
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,The first person perspective was the gameplay. But if you mean like playing some of the game and not just some clips I can see what you mean.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,The trailer earlier this year contained much more gameplay.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,[deleted]
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-11,\*enemy
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,You’re in for a treat!
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"You *will* be a huge Indiana Jones fan after the movies.

Just uhh, just feel free to skip Crystal Skull. That one doesn’t really count."
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"I pray someone makes a competent vr mod, my life would be complete"
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Troy Baker, pretty good impersonation in my opinion, but I can still hear Troy in it."
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,The performer did a phenomenal job
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"First person for shooting and puzzles but third person for platforming and traversal, you can look at this in the reveal from this past January"
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,yes
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-13,"As someone who grew up in that era, I can say that is absolutely incorrect."
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,How so?
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"It's not a movie tie-in, its just a stand-alone game based on a movie franchise. Hate to nit-pick but i feel like that's a pretty big distinction - means they arent pressed to follow a plot pre-determined by a film."
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Should’ve gone with “Indiana Jones and the Big O”
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Machinegames are a solid team.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"They confirmed it’s both third and first since January, just depends on what part of the game it is where the perspective will switch [1:30](https://youtu.be/0e17p2IVDUU?si=jAzFiTSuN3hzv2Mn)"
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-13,It could not be further from Tomb Raider. What do you mean?
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-13,"They spent a lot of time in the whip and it is dynamic. If you whip their gun it will come flying out of their hands. If you whip their feet, it will trip them etc.

It’ll be fun to use it for traversal as well."
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Who cares what you think. He fucking nails the Harrison Ford voice and cadence.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Who cares.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"thats because he is a better voice actor than anyone else, that means he is in demand"
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"I agree the full body mo-cap/animations look really off and make the ok but not great facial renders look like a fake head on a wobbly-bobbly early 2000's physics ragdoll.


A couple of glaring examples are when indy is told to put his hands up his face is registering some emotion but his body language is off. Also his whip onto a blimp of w/e it is, looked super stiff and un-natural."
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"I know you're being down voted, but I agree this cutscene didn't look great. The animation and facial features looked unpolished, and the fur on the hats/coats looked like alpha models. The cutscenes they released in previous showcases looked much better."
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"what games are good according to you that looks good , animation looks good, doesn't look rough , blurry or mushy ?"
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Then don’t buy the game if you don’t like it.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Me I love Indy, haven’t watched the latest two movies so probably why I’m excited for it"
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Me. I love Indiana Jones and videogames.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,This is probably the game I'm most hyped about from this showcase lol.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Indy movies have grossed over a billion dollars in theaters, and you're asking who's this for."
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,They made the game for me specifically.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Me
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"this game is for adventure lovers, indiana jones lovers, and single player games lovers"
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,People who love Indiana Jones?
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,People over the age of 45
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"And indy's little confusion then agreement with nothing but subtle facial gestures.

They understand how to act."
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Me too. It felt very intentional haha
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Its always wise for a game Dev to play to their strengths.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,But the Wolfenstein games are all bad.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,The two newest installments were first person and not run and gun.  Puzzley
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,They're FPS games with lots of puzzles.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Idk what all the people saying ""it's just Troy Baker"" are on about, it's a pretty spot-on impression and Baker gets a lot of Ford's little mannerisms down very well"
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,I will never understand this mindset. I vastly prefer first person.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,It has 3rd person as well during certain gameplay.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-13,You’d just see the back of his head if it were in third person though.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,It isn't. The previous trailer had first person gameplay
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Interesting, so it swaps to FPS for combat and puzzles?"
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"I mean when all you've shown of gameplay are little blink and you miss it snippets, yeah I'd rather actually see that than a six minute cutscene."
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Damn, I enjoyed it. Everyone talks crap about the nuke fridge but I counter it with Doom's raft/fire heart and some of Crusade's plane scenes. The Jones movies have always been a bit campy and fun."
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,That's the only one I saw.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"I should have guessed it was him, he's in almost everything, lol"
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Yeah i can hear him dropping his diaphragm to get into Ford's vocal range. He did great, but i think he struggled. Can't blame him with such a distinct voice as Ford."
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"I can honestly see people getting annoyed or sick of the sudden change to first person sections if they were playing in third person before with no warning

  
But i would see a solution being short cutscenes that have the nazis storming in to ambush Indiana, and a sequence plays to then transition into the combat"
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Please tell me the third person camera in transversal mode isn't off centered. Please.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Something about their expressions or lack there of.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Oh that’s great news then! Thanks! Other comments seemed to indicate it was first person only.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Yea, it’s really hard to describe, it’s like the whole thing has an uncanny valley aspect to it. It reminded me of the older generation games when a character would look just fine standing there, then they’d bend or turn or crouch and their clothing would be revealed to be a solid part of their frame with no sort of fluidity or flow to it. The eyes, the faces, the movements, it all just looks off somehow. It all seems like it’s running at maybe 80% speed at times. The lack of actual gameplay (for longer than .5 sec quick cut clips) is a real red flag for me considering this game is supposed to be launching in less than 5-6 months."
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"I mean, did you watch the showcase yesterday? Pretty much everything showed well aside from this. Sure, some was CG, some ‘in engine’ and some was actual gameplay, and I know every game/engine/studio handles these sort of presentations differently, but this is the only game I can think of that looked jarringly unpolished. It would be one thing if it was a design choice, like south of midnight or Mixtape, but this just looks bad. 

Just to name a few games that looked visually better, artistic and stylistic choices aside, and not discussing my opinions on the games themselves, this is purely the visual quality of what was shown. Doom, CoD, South of Midnight, Mixtape, Avowed, Fable, Stalker 2, Perfect Dark, State of Decay 3, Expedition 33, Flight sim, and flintlock. I’m sure there were more, and someone will probably comment about whatever game(s) I’m forgetting with anger, I’m just saying that Indiana jones was the worst visually of all the big AAA games there. Something is really off. 

Again, I’m NOT saying the game is or will be bad. I’m not saying you can’t be excited for it, or that you shouldn’t enjoy it when it comes out. It’s totally fine to say games don’t show well."
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Also me too
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Yes. 

The last crusade came out in 89' and the 2 sequels since have been debatable quality at best, but universally agreed as lesser then the original trilogy.

Just because a movie made alot of money (looking at you crystal skull) doesn't mean it's good.

For all we know the game may be great, and I truly hope so. But it's a strange choice to throw alot of money behind this ip."
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"I'm not saying you're strictly wrong but there need to be more qualifiers.

I am all three of these things but it's not for me. Like very clearly not for me. During the first half of that video I was not sure if this is some advanced satire that I just don't quite get or if they are being serious with this. 

Looking at the comments here I can't deny that there is an audience for it but I can't tell you who that is. If you had to specify further - what version of indy or what type of single player game would one need to love in order to appreciate this?"
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-13,"I’m 22, I’m stoked!"
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"“…I can’t give you what I don’t have.”

The VA they have for Indy is REALLY talented as well- when I first heard the trailer I had to double take because I couldn’t quite tell if it was Ford or not. It’s a bit more obvious when he’s yelling, though, Ford has a very distinct “loud” voice."
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"I always think this statement is funny. It's not wrong at all, but it always makes me think of respawn, they went from Apex Legends, a FPS battle Royale, to Jedi: Fallen Order, a single-player soulslike."
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Nope
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,That’s just you know like your opinion man
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Eh? Why do you think they're bad
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Bro what RE games did I play?! I don’t remember any of them being FPS. Unless you’re trolling
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"he's in too much shit and some people have soured on him. I agree, he's in way too much and I honestly roll my eyes whenever he pops up in a video game at this point. 

But his impression here is great and I look forward to playing this game."
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,I enjoy first person but I feel with a character who has such an iconic look such as Indiana jones that third person would make more sense.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-11,"Specifically during climbing, swinging, and mini-cutscenes."
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-11,"I believe so. I think it’s still majority first person, but things like climbing will be 3rd person"
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-11,It's a 3.5 minute cutscene. The gameplay snippets are just all really short.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"I didn’t really care about the Nuke fridge, it felt pretty Indiana Jonesy to me- it was just the rest of the writing of the movie that was just kind of awful. It’s pretty hated movie"
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"That would explain why you aren’t a huge Indiana Jones fan, legitimately. It was not a good movie."
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"He has the voice pretty much nailed but not quite how Harrison talks as indy.

Can't quite explain it but there's certain little inflections missing and stuff. Like some of those lines I could hear how Harrison would have said them but Troy doesn't do them."
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,You can...what? Can you explain how that's even possible?
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Switching back and forth works for Destiny, people will get used to it here too."
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"It basically is, its only gonna switch to third person when you’re climbing things or shimmying on ledges"
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"It is. It only has short third person sections when climbing. You cannot switch yourself or use third person elsewhere in the game, only those short predetermined climbing sections, the rest is locked first person only."
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Nuances always get lost ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

People keep parroting that the Kotor remake is a PS5 exclusive since the 2021 reveal when at the simultaneous press release they said it was PC/PS5 AT LAUNCH then other platforms would follow in due time but you never hear this, people to this day just keep sharing the incorrect info lol"
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"This whole situation is getting more and more prevalent in video games, rushed cash-ins on movie IP's. Gollum, Robocop and this to name just a few.."
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Exactly, I should have clarified. They grossed over a billion dollars OF THE 80s. If we look at number of tickets sold it's probably one of the best selling franchises ever. Plus all the merch + licensing money. Spielberg & Lucas were already well off before Indy, they were 'fuck you I'm doing whatever the hell I want' rich after Indy.

A strange choice... an Indy product that works in the timing of the original trilogy. I can't believe I'm having this conversation. Todd Howard is probably still furiously masturbating about producing this thing."
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-13,Because of Indiana or just because the game looks cool? I’m genuinely curious. I just get the feeling most younger people have zero interest in Indiana Jones.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"You're definitely right. It's not a hard rule and there are absolutely exceptions.  But then you got Rocksteady going from Single Player action game to live service shooter.  

It's probably more accurate to say a dev should be afforded the time to get a game right instead of planning on set deadlines."

1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Lol he's an extremely talented and popular voice actor. Why isn't he allowed to have many jobs?

That's like being upset at any A list actor for being in lots of movies. Like one of the really talented ones."
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-11,So Chronicles of Riddick like camera switching?
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-15,At least it's leagues better than Dial for Diarrhea!
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Yeah that's what i was making by struggling. It takes a lot of effort to hold a tone outside your natural range. So the more subtle nuances are lost due to more effortc being put forth simply to speak!
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"So your diaphram is like sort of in your chest it takes a lot of practice to take control of it, but if you can, you can altar your voice *drastically*. I dont know if ""drop"" is the right term, but he's clearly speaking in a lower register than he's naturally meant to with his voice, so he's taking greater effort to keep in that register and mimic inflection, that it feels a bit stiff"
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Same with Helldivers.  It's not a hurdle.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"we're gonna agree to disagree. 

If I misinterpreted this I apologize. it just comes off extremely funny and again. you speak so confidentiality that you can't believe you're having this conversation as if it's a no Brainer.

You believe the ip is gonna succeed because they're basing it in a time period of an ip from 35 years ago? and these people who love this ip have the newest generation Xbox or a PC capable of playing this game?

oh sweet summer child

this isn't star wars which has remained in the zeitgeist of media with toys/cartoons/shows/video games coming out annually.

All I'm hypothesizing is that the ven diagram of people who are indiana jones fans and people who have an high end PC or an Xbox to actually play this game would be something to look at."

1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Yeah listening to him try to sing in TLOU2 was funny cause of how much effort it must take to just do Joel's speaking voice.
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"I feel this. As someone who's damaged their throat and even had surgery on it, maintaining a tone is hard. I'll never sound how I used to (woman), but now if I don't concentrate every time I talk to maintain a tone similar to what I used to have, it's like two raspy whales raping each other, tbh. Mentally and physically struggling to maintain a tone that doesn't 'come (new/default natural) naturally' is exhausting and hurts some days."
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-11,When does it switch?
1dbzze4,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"I don't know if the IP is going to succeed, I don't have a magic ball. And I really don't care if it does, because I'm not a fanboy. I'm more likely than not leaving the Xbox system behind for next gen. I think it'll be at the very least a decent game, but not because of the IP, because of Machine Games. And people were asking for big IPs for big games for the Xbox, and that's exactly what it is, whether you believe it or not.

You should probably ask yourself a better question: who's paying for the bulk of new releases and who's paying the bulk of GP subscriptions? I really don't think it's the 16-25 age subgroup. One thing's certain, Microsoft knows better than you and I."

1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,Dial of destiny was a flop so it’s hard to say how well this game will sell. Making it cross platform will help it sell a little bit better
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"Just like Starfield is out on PS5 for months now, if you believed rumours."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"I literally just bought an xbox series x, for just 3 games and now 1 of them isn't an exclusive anymore.

Those games were Indiana Jones, Fable, and Outer Worlds 2."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"I really bought a Series X for nothing lol. I picked it up for the occasional Xbox exclusive, and then to play some 360 era classic games that I love.

Starfield was mid, and literally everything else will come to PlayStation haha. 

At this point, the Series X is a 360 for me."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"Should have seemed obvious as soon as that Insomniac - Marvel royalties agreement leaked. Disney demands a pretty massive cut and they'll need to put this on as many screens as possible to recoup that investment.

TBH I'm expecting this to be a solid 8/10. Fantastic design and attention to detail that is ultimatelylet down by awkward first person mechanics for fist fighting and whipping. The gameplay they've shown of the first person fighting looks like it's not that engaging and will get repetitive fast. I'm mostly looking forward to playing this on Gamepass just to experience a new Indy movie"
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"not playing until the sequel, the Marvelous Square, comes out"

Every game deserves to be played by all the people who are interested playing them no matter the platform"
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"As it should because it’s based on a popular third-party IP. Now, bring Spider-Man to Xbox."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"Yeah this has been going around a fair bit. Cant remember who said it, but essentially it was said that the press already know and have signed NDAs. Probably find out tomorrow at Keighly’s ONL"

1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"Its basically Studio suicide to release an exclusive on just Xbox at this point. Far from shocked. 

What Dev/studio/publisher is gonna turn down an extra 80 million dollars worth of sales from the leading console market holder?"
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,With Todd Howard at the helm? I can't wait to see what shallow and boring mechanics he surprises us with this time around.
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,Still disappointed this went the bethesda first person route. They make an okay sandbox but the controls and movement are always so awful. Really wish any other studio would have gotten this license.

1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"I think its a smart move from Xbox as they have to accept defeat in this generation of console sales and by putting the game on the PS they can still make money on game sales and then when the next generation comes around they can hope to have some solid Xbox only launch titles and they can take another shot at being top of the console sales, also they just spent an ungodly amount of money on studios and they have to consider how to start making some back ASAP i would assume."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,Sucks about the first person camera. Probably going to be a 6/10
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,Oh wow suddenly the game isn't shit? Who'd've thunk

Like Jaws, Jurassic Park, or Star Wars."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"I didn't see Dial of Destiny because it looked like an awful attempt to bring Indy back and, as Disney has tended to do with their historic characters, they made Indy a complete shell of his former self.


Compared to the trailers for the Great Circle it looks like it's capturing the tone and style of the original films and I'm excited as hell for it.


Hell Troy Baker is doing an amazing job of matching the cadence and inflection of how Harrison Ford spoke in those movies."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"I think there's still love for the character/setting. People just weren't that interested in seeing 80 year old Harrison Ford trying to relive his glory days. It also didn't help that neither Spielberg nor Lucas were involved in the project. Dial just felt so unnecessary.

The damn thing actually made me think Crystal Skull was better by comparison."

1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,Why is everyone talking like exclusive are good now? I remember when most people hated exclusives.
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"Yep, same here. What an absolute let down Xbox has been"
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-21,I bought a Series X a year ago in anticipation of Starfield and still haven't taken it out of the box. 
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,Yeah I upgraded from my One X to Series X for Starfield but it was such a soulless mess
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,The 360 is the greatest console ever made.

1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,I thought the first person fighting looked awful and boring and uninspired from the trailer. But maybe I'll be wrong.
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,Also MS wants to be a publisher first at this point
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,I highly doubt anyone in the press signed an NDA but they probably agreed to an embargo on the story
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,because they hired MachineGames to do it and that's what they do best.
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,">What Dev/studio/publisher is gonna turn down an extra 80 million dollars worth of sales from the leading console market holder?

1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,Square Enix said the same about Playstation and they didn't exactly sell their either.
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,I dont think he has much to do with this game...its a machinegames game that is just published by bethesda that is part of MS...not a bethesda game studio game
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"It's been developed by MachineGames and not Bethesda (Bethesda are the publisher not the developer).

It's the same development team using the same ID Tech engine as the past few Wolfenstein games so if anything it will feel a bit similar to those."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"They made Doom and Wolfenstein. The former is known for having some of the crunchiest, most satisfying fps gameplay around. Skyrim/fallout are not the only games they make. "

1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"The dialogue was trash though. “While you’ve been playing your game I’ve been playing you” or something, way to on-the-nose and not a good line anywhere but in the context of “you’re in a game, get it?” Also gotta love a guy getting headbutted by someone who is literally buried in the ground, and has no range to do so, because he can barely move his neck. They can defintely make things look great but without Harrison Ford’s voice and a compelling comedic story, I feel like this will go the way of the last two movies."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"More polished product is fine, but if it's delayed one year on PlayStation, then I'm certainly not paying day 1 prices. 


Game gets delayed a year, means it should be priced that way -- with a serious discount."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,I would make the argument that most modern media leans too much into comedy.

1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,Pretty sure Jaws as a franchise is dead and Star Wars just canelled their newest big budget show after 1 season. Nostalgia pandering is starting to get diminishing returns. 
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,Indy’s Lego sets also go hard
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,Even the Developer Direct stream for the game this past January only showed title cards the first 3 movies. Pretty clear the vibe they're going for here.
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"It was sad to see the lack of interest in the new Indiana Jones movie - like, I hated it and thought it was by far the worst out of the five, but people didn't really seem to care either way. I think in part it was because the movie wasn't very good though so I hope this game might do at least something for the franchise."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,And U2.
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,The only real option for film is prequels and after Solo bombed Disney lost any appetite for recasting Harrison Ford. 
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"It is a pretty shit practice, but it definitely burns to back the wrong horse and miss out on all the good exclusives on other platforms."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"I don’t think exclusives are good. I literally bought an entire second console just so I could play a handful of games I would have no other way to play.

I would love if all games were available on all platforms."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,I am enjoying my Xbox X.
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,Except for the fact that it had a 55% failure rate. You could argue it was actually the worst console ever made.
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"I mean, I can’t afford a PC. Plus, I know my spending habits, and a PC would be a total money sync for me. I wouldn’t be able to stop upgrading and customizing. So I play it safe and stay on console."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,Yikes
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"The OG trilogy is still timeless IMHO.

It’s a similar case to Jurassic Park.

And gonna be honest… JWE2 is probably a game I’ve sunk more time into this Gen than almost any other game."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"I must be a different breed, i don't get why people hated this movie so bad. I had a great time"
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,And yet Spiderman 2 sold a jilliom units. There just isn't a huge market for JRPGs in the states. Its niche.
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,And yet the trailer for this showed the clunky fallout/elder scrolls shit.
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,Yeah I kind of hate that with subscriptions a lot of services are just pushing something out and don’t care what it is. D+ for example. It’s like they have your money so there’s not as much reason to try.

1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"My favourite part of the super grounded and not at all ridiculous first three movies is the part where they jump out of an airplane in a life raft and use it as a parachute to land on a mountain side where they then ride the raft down the side of a snowy mountain only to fly off a massive cliff and land in a river unscathed where they proceed to navigate through rough water rapids.

Like, dude, it's Indiana Jones. It's been ridiculous from the start. That's what I love about them lmao. If your gripe is that Indy can headbutt a dude for comedic relief while buried in the ground, I don't think this franchise if for you."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"It's not delayed a year, it hasn't even been announced for PS5 yet for it to be delayed. It's going to be released a year later on a different system by choice. There's a difference."

1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"the franchises are not dead but people are sick of the low effort nostalgia pandering

If they did something people liked it would come back...don't have faith in Disney though"
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"It lacked interest because there wasn't anything interesting for Indy to do/explore. 

Imagine Indiana Jones was exploring the Pyramids?

Imagine he was finding Atlantis?

They had an opportunity to have Indy + (insert popular historical/mythology site here) but they didn't even bother to explore that angle."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"Audiences definitely did not care, there was zero excitement leading to its release.

I think there are many reasons:

1. There was no marketing to make it feel like an “event”. Just a few trailers, and that’s it.

2. Harrison Ford is too old to lead this kind of film. I love the guy, but the days of him leading big adventure films ended decades ago. Everybody in the audience knows this. It made it seem like the movie is for 60-year-olds., like the target audience is significantly older than Top Gun: Maverick.

3. This franchise is not “current” and far too many years have passed between the sequels. Younger kids don’t grow up on these movies unless their dads force them to sit through it, it’s not like it was in the 80s or early 90s when Indiana Jones was one of the most popular big-screen heroes.

4. Crystal Skull killed the franchise. I know at the time some people were okay with it because of the memberberries and the excitement of seeing the character back on the big screen, but I think most have gradually eased into an understanding that it was an awfully disappointing movie. Everyone was content with just letting the franchise end.

5. No Steven Spielberg. Although his name is no longer the big box office draw that it was 25 years ago, his reputation remains incredibly strong. And people knew he wasn’t involved in the film as a director, so right from the beginning they knew something would be off, like it’s not an entirely official sequel."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"I think it was more the fact people expected it to just be more of the same from the last one. Not that the IP has no fans.

Star Wars and Marvel are the same way right now...people lost faith in the movies but still love the IPs...just want good stuff."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"Sad, but not unexpected.

I expect this game to garner the same amount of attention... That's to say, barely any."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"Worse than the alien one? 

Oh no."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"Yeah, at this point it might be better to just let the franchise live on in games and other media, rather than trying to make any more movies."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,If handled correctly it could be a James Bond sort of thing...there are plenty of things you could explore and do and not try to just be a Ford clone.
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,There would have been several but River Phoenix overdosed in the Viper Room. He would have been perfect.
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,There you go Xbox is starting that trend.
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,Preventing you from playing those awesome 360 games.
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"Save money my friend.

It’ll take time, but as of now, got 2K saved up after 1.5 years."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"With the amount of game sales, and learning that you don't always need to buy next gen hardware... You'll be amazed on how much money you save. 

You also get the added benefit of retaining all your games regardless of generation. I got a stack of PS2 games I can't play because I don't have a ps2, same with some 360 and PS3 games. 

Also forgot to mention the biggest money saver once you go PC.. 

***NO LONGER PAYING A SUBSCRIPTION TO PLAY ONLINE MULTIPLAYER***"
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,What?
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-21,"In the rest of the movies, the mystical aspects remain almost..... ambiguous? I can't think of a better word for it. The events clearly *happen*, like the Nazis getting melted by the Ark or the UFO taking off. But they are witnessed and survived only by Indy, his entourage, and the viewer. There's not really any evidence otherwise that they actually happened. That's something that I appreciate about the series and I think Dial of Destiny lacks."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,It's only sold 11 million as of early this year. That's not that impressive honestly for that large of a budget first party IP.
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,I don’t know how you think you would know how it feels to play without actually playing it. 
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"The game is being made by the Wolfenstein team, not Bethesda proper, meaning it won't be running of Creation Engine. What are you even talking about?"
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,[deleted]
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"What you described from the movie was a pretty well thought out stunt that involved a lot of work and was very much in keeping with the adventure aspect of Indiana Jones. What I saw in the trailer was a box check villain just like the guy from Raiders and a pretty poorly-conceived “comic relief” needed box check as well (just have him headbutt him…somehow). I expect this low level of production and writing to continue through the game, like how Indy just sorta repairs a tuk-tuk or whatever with some gum in the lastest movie. It’s stupid, low effort, poor writing, box check, etc.

*. Apparently you can supposedly use all sorts of things for a temporary radiator leak patch. I thought there was more damage to the vehicle than that. ~~My mistake:~~ https://car.tips.net/T012013_Emergency_Radiator_Repairs.html#:~:text=To%20get%20the%20most%20out,to%20your%20favorite%20mechanic%20shop.

** Oh right it isn’t just a radiator crack but he somehow fixes it that way (from IMDB): Indy uses gum to plug a hole in a radiator, then asks Helena to ""try and start"" the tuk-tuk. The radiator cools the engine, and does nothing to prevent it from starting.

***Oh, and if I recall from the game trailer Indy jumps from biplane to biplane like wind isn’t a thing. You can’t even stand on one of those while it’s in flight without having to hold or be strapped into some sort of rigging, because unlike the plane, the person isn’t an aerodynic shape with large wings being propelled forward by an engine.

Falling out a plane on a raft you’re strapped to and then getting a fun snowy slopes-to-river ride (while getting buffeted, “the ouchies,” the man gets his mileage and is repaired by lady kisses/glory points) is just cool and kinda believable."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"I literally had to google Andor after this comment and I had no idea it even existed. Totally missed this show entirely.

I'm surprised they made a whole series off a side character like Andor,  I barely remember him from Rogue One."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,Mandalorian yes with Grogu and mando merch. Andor? Not sure I would call that a lucrative franchise. Its a good story but you aren't going to see kids with Andor stuffies and shirts.
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,Mando yes but while Andor was highly critically acclaimed didn't it bomb like super hard?
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"That, and Star Wars games tend to be solid. And sell really well. I think Outlaws is going to surprise a lot of people with its sales."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-22,Atlantis would have been great and they already had a story ready to go from the game on PC. Huge missed opportunity. 
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"Yeah it's a shame - I've heard some people say it's because Harrison Ford was just too old but I really disagree with that - he did a fine job and he was not the problem with that movie. Such a missed opportunity.

I see what they were doing with his arc, but it just didn't work in the end and him being miserable for 99% of the movie and not even choosing his own fate in the end didn't work at all for me. I thought they did have a mcguffin with at least some potential but it was just poorly executed and the final product was a mess that was anything but tight.

But I do think you're right - had it been really good it would likely have become popular too."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"Yeah - I thought Crystal Skull was by far the worst out of the four, and that dial of Destiny was by far the worst out of the five. For all it's faults I thought Crystal Skull was far more effective and ultimately enjoyable."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,It costs like $5 a month for a subscription
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"Yeah it's running on the ID Tech Engine which is the same engine used for Doom & Wolfenstein.

And if it's going to feel anything like other Bethesda IP it would likely be closer to Wolfenstein as thats been MachineGames primary IP the over the past decade."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,">Their only competitor is Gears of War, but that's aliens and weird shit.


I take it you dont like the gears of war franchise? What ""weird shit"" is in Gears of War?"
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,You really would prefer a fifth game from the same franchise over something new?
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"Yeah I felt the same way beforehand, and then I saw it - extremely enjoyable, something completely different and a breath of fresh air. Some of the best writing in the entire franchise at times."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,I honestly didn't realize it was the same guy. Still a really good show though.
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"That adds up. 

I don't want to be paying another fee just to play with friends on consoles, while on PC it's literally free. 

The greatest con ever pulled wasn't the devil saying he didn't exist... It's Microsoft/Xbox convincing a whole generation of gamers that they need to pay to play online with their friends. It was so convincing that it even made Sony decide to demand paid subscription for PSN on PS4, and Nintendo to charge for their online service."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"Personally yes, there’s nothing else like Uncharted. The insane level of details in the world that ND creates is amazing, and the gameplay of Uncharted is next level. Just a fun adventure game."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,I had the same thoughts when I was 12 tbh. I pay more for my mortgage in a month than I pay for the subscription over like 18 years.
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"I rather they continue to grow as a dev and apply their level of detail to make more new worlds and thought provoking games like TLOU2 even if they are divisive. 


They probably outgrew the Uncharted series. At best, pass it on to a different dev and let them make a spinoff or something.
Drake's story is done."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"So why are you paying for an extra fee when there exist services that doesn't charge you?

If you saw that the bank somehow tacked on an extra $100 fee on top of your regular mortgage payment, wouldn't that tick you off?"
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,I mean they ended with some play time for his daughter which to mean sounds like they’re leaving the door open for her to take on some adventures.
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,So I pay an extra few months to play with my friends. Why is that such a big deal to you? Lmao
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"I think that qualifies as a spinoff but I dont think Naughty Dog wants to continue on Uncharted... just my opinion. 
The word is they have a new I.P. coming up next then TLOU3."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"Cause I don't like predatory business practices. If you keep letting shit slide like that, it sets up for worse stuff later."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,Oh man just wait until you hear about Netflix and Planet Fitness
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"That's completely different though. 

With netflix and planet fitness, you are entering a service. You're not buying the equipment, you're not renting the space, you're just bringing yourself.

With consoles, you bought the console. You bought the game. Now you have to shell out more money for a subscription plan to play online. 

If you really want to compare this to planet fitness or netflix or spotify, it would be similar to (Using planet fitness as an example)

  - Buying an approved ""Planet Fitness"" clothing from Planet Fitness. (Buying the game)
  - Buying a membership to use the gym ""area"". (Buying the console)
  - Buying another subscription to just use the machines. (Buying the online multiplayer sub...)"
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"But you can buy the movies and gym equipment yourself, and use them whenever. You don’t have to pay to keep using them, like if you had Netflix or Planet Fitness. Same concept."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"No, it's not. 

If you're thinking that way, that's more of akin of ""Fuck it, I'm making my own console."" 

Planet Fitness/Netflix is not making you buy their product to use their services.  

You don't have to **buy** anything to go to Planet Fitness, you can show up in whatever (depending on the place...). You don't have to **buy** a special display for **only** Netflix, you can use what ever device you want. (Remember when you still had to buy a xbox live membership just to use netflix that you already paid a separate subscription for, back in the xbox 360 days?)

You have to ***Buy*** a console first before being able to use their services. You have to ***Buy*** the game. You have to ***Buy*** the subscription. 

Tbh, the way [the car industry has been going lately, it feels like its going in the same path.](https://www.kiplinger.com/personal-finance/automakers-added-subscription-fees-raise-legal-questions)"
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,You don’t have to buy the subscription to use the console though
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"We're talking about actual console use, not gamepass for PC or PSN for PC, or even GeForceNow or something because that's more akin to Netflix. That's an actual service. 

Game online subs for consoles is different. 

If you want to play multiplayer on a PS5, you need an online sub. If you want to play multiplayer on xbox, you need gamepass core sub just to play online. If you have to pay more money to unlock a feature that already exists natively, that's predatory."
1ewigtu,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"How is that predatory? You don’t need a gym membership to get fit, you can do that natively. You don’t need Netflix to watch movies, you can do that by buying the movie outright. SaaS is nothing new, but for some reason the gaming community acts like it is."
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,"*It's authentic to Indiana Jones. It's authentic to the stories that we've told. And again, to the point of between the two movies and how the story really connects those two movies. So it's an authentically told story that I think fits really well in everything else you've experienced with Indiana Jones.*

So it's not canon, but it is if you want it to be?"
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,Does anyone actually care if it's Canon? Just be good.
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,"As long as a game doesn't retcon or alter events that happened in the movies, it doesn't necessarily need to be canon. It just needs to ""flow"" with the rest of the movies. 

I'm very much looking forward to this game. Troy Baker's Indy is so close to Harrison, and it looks like a lot of fun."
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,"GW has been miles ahead of fandoms by saying for years “everything is cannon and nothing is true” 

We are talking about mass MASS market pulp media far more than we are engaging with it. These productions are soap operas ( succcession & shogun and so on )and mass market serial pulp (Indy. Star Wars. Star Trek etc) and serials.  Designed to hook you in to next weeks showing. 

They upped the film quality and sound quality and got a little bit more specific.  But this is all escapist content designed to give us a dopamine hit and make us want more.  Take a deep breath. Back away a little."
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,I've never watched Indiana Jones.  Should I play this first?
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,"It's a officially license product approved by the IP holders , who I'm  sure are overseeing in some capacity. 
Other then somehow blatantly contradicting the events with the movies ( which the movies themselves already fuckin did with  temple doom being set before the events of raiders but somehow  Indy is a complete skeptic to the supernatural ) I don't see why it couldn't be ""canon"" ."
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,"I mean it's as canon as the cartoon and the comic books are...

Like what kind of question is ""is it canon""? Is anything outside of the movies ""canon""? Does anyone care?

What does ""canon"" matter in a world where we regularly just reboot shit all the time? What happens to ""canon"" when they make another Indiana Jones movie in 10 years with an entirely new actor?

Remember what happened to the ""canon"" in Star Wars?

Are we worrying about the ""canon"" in Bond movies?

/rant"
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-30,"I don't think it matters. Indiana Jones is a character that can drive any adventure tale, assuming it fits the theme. I just wonder if they somehow managed to attain the rights to include Sean Connery's look and a sound-alike to portray his father in the game. Seems like something Bethesda might try to pull off."
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-30,"Canon, not canon, who gives a toss really? It doesn't even really mean anything in the end. Let's just hope the game is good."
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-30,such idiotic world we live in
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,"Who cares if it's ""Canon?"" That's such a stupid, arbitrary concept for something like this. It doesn't effect the quality of the product or your enjoyment of it. No movie or future television show will ever acknowledge the game, and the moment it contradicts something, guess what? It's no longer canon. It doesn't matter."
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-30,Early impressions  seem to be very underwhelming
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,"Oh it's not actually a Bethesda game, this gives me a little bit of hope for it"
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,"I'd be fine if more IP holders treated their franchise like George Miller does Mad Max.  Just a bunch of modern folk tales featuring a character and setting.  Don't worry too much about the continuity and enjoy the ride.  

I feel like Indiana Jones is perfect for that kind of story telling."
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,Who actually gives a damn about Indiana Jones canon after the latest movies anyway
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,Indiana Jones always worked better as an anthology of his adventures rather then one continuous story.
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,Sounds like the devs wanted it to be canon but didn’t get the official stamp of approval.
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,"I mean, no. It’s not canon, but it fits well enough that if it were canon, they imagine it wouldn’t change anything about current canon. 

Non canon. Fits well in current canon. Basically exactly what they said."
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,I'm ok with that tbh. It's fun to be able to tell non-canon stories as long as they're authentic to the setting.
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,"Sounds good to me tbh. Depending on how people feel about the game, it’s up to them if they consider it canon or not"
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-30,Fair enough
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-30,Canon is in the eye of the watcher
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-30,So basically every form of tie in media ever
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,"Agree. I am tired with this demented lore lawyer obsession with everything being canon, and this somehow signifying quality. I just want a good Indy story. I don't give a flying fuck on its canonicity."
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,"Fair. Canon can be fun for Easter Eggs and world building, but I’ll take “merely” authentic and more importantly *good* any day."
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-30,"More than you'd like to think. Look at the Star Wars fans, they were told their noncanon material was still noncanon and they absolutely flipped out. Canonicity really gets under skin for some reason."
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-31,"You should give Raiders of the Lost Ark and Last Crusade a chance. The game is irrelevant to this; they're just really good. See if you like them. You'll probably enjoy the game a lot more having seen them, too."
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-30,"At least Star Wars movies have an ongoing story. You can watch first 3 Indiana Jones movies in any order because they all have their own begining, middle and end"
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,...Bethesda's resume absolutely annihilates MachineGames' lol
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,"Indiana Jones already did that storytelling. The original trilogy barely really cared about connecting the films beyond a few little things. It was a serial, i.e, each film is it's own contained story. 

It's just that now modern online fandoms are obsessed with lore and canon etc."
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,"I wish Indiana Jones could become a movie character like Bond. 

I just want more archaeologist adventure movies and the Uncharted movies ain't it"
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,"I agree. Indiana Jones is essentially a kind of modern folk hero in many ways.

Mad Max is definitely a post apocalyptic folk hero archetype."
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,I feel like the already had the Star Wars expanded universe and shredded it when continuity hype was peak so they could do more focused branding and then proceeded to have no focus so idk if they’re ready to make it back to this concept
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,"It strikes me that a story depicting Indy and Lara Croft struggling against each other with both their goals and their approaches, in the ways the differ AND their similarities, would be both totally fascinating and absolutely the wrong franchises to tell that type of story in."
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,"Honestly the problem isn't the IP holders it's the *fandoms*.

People today make fandoms their entire identity so OFC they go apeshit when something is made canon they don't like (which coincidentally is everything these days).

So it's easier to just make a few things canon as possible.

Also yeah it's dumb. Canon vs non-canon is just stupid fanboy argument shit. Who cares? Go out and touch grass. There's more to life than franchise media. Stop taking it so seriously."
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-30,I've never understood why all Star Wars games had to be canon. Why can't they make a self contained game set within existing canon? That doesn't mean that a game can't be a part of the main continuity but it seems to me that forcing every game to be would be very creatively limiting.
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,"Last one actually wasn't bad, but damn the alien one was terrible"
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,The last one was pretty good 
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,Especially one like indy where it's like... he's just on another adventure. What other story or reason does there need to be?
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-30,Canon leads to lore. Lore leads to headcanon. Headcanon leads to suffering.
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,Bethesda's resume absolutely annihilated Bethesda's resume
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,"In terms of scale? Yeah probably.

In terms of technical stability? Not really."
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,Temple of Doom takes place before Raiders and nobody batted an eye.
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,"We had this experience with great little side bits like The Fate of Atlantis, and The Infernal Machine.

More adventure tales are great, and don't have to be perfect canon."
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,"No- fandoms back then were obsessed with lore and canon, too; Indiana Jones was just one that wasn't."
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,Uncharted didn't even understand what Uncharted is
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-31,The TV series with Sean Patrick Flanery was excellent.
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-31,"I suspect it came about as a genuine attempt to lower confusion. I grew up in the 70s, and people today are often  unaware of how much Star Wars lore was created by second and third parties before ANY of the sequels came out.

By the time Empire was released, they'd had more than 50 issues of a Star Wars Marvel comic released that introduced entire new branches of government, aristocracy, a Jabba based on the ""holding"" character from the original shoot (a yellow, wizened older alien humanoid); they'd also had the tremendously popular ""Splinter of the Mind's Eye"" by Alan Dean Foster and other novels, and Splinter had a completely different Darth Vader backstory to being a Skywalker.

Lucas had a lot of input into these side projects, but then totally upended them by introducing limitations in future movies (Luke's parentage, there being only two sith at any one time) that didn't match what was in the comics or novels. 

Then, after he'd ret-conned everything with the first two sequels, they allowed game licensing (such as Galaxies) that introduced even more non-canonical stuff and more decisions had to be made.

So they pretty much had to clarify it on an ongoing basis, as the initial popularity coupled with loose story controls led to huge swaths of lore not making sense.

It wasn't that fans were crying out for more minutiae: I think most hardcore fans always wanted Star Wars to get a little darker, a little more like Andor, with solid story arcs etc. But the popularity led to writers trying to find new angles and characters constantly."
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,"Crystal Skull was a weirdly bad Indy movie... but it could've been an OK, goofy movie with another name/set of characters involved."
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,Wait... you're saying Dial of Destiny was better than Crystal Skull?
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,In terms of good games. Definitely.
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,I don't even think the majority of film goers noticed.
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,"In an effort of fairness, I’ve constantly heard complaints about this throughout my life.

“How could Indy not believe in magic if he experienced everything he did in the temple of doom?” 

Stuff like that. 

Now, that didn’t mean people disliked the movies or ultimately abandoned the franchise but people definitely brought up some continuity issues. 

People also thought it was silly that Indys dad was only 12 years older than him but they worked so well together in the movie everyone turned a blind eye. 

Point is, people did care just not in the same intense way people do now a days."

1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,"To a point, and a lot of it was more nitpicking and having fun with it.

I mean okay hey those early forums for the Sci-Fi stuff we had? I mean on one hand? Yeah you did have that small group of unhappy fans who would rag on stuff like Star Trek: TNG, DS9, Voyager. But lets be real here. Do you think lets say TNG would survive past season two with today's fanbase? I mean sure I can point out Code of Honor and how that turned a lot of people off from Star Trek, hell Voyager's Garrett Wang stopped watch Trek due to that episode. DS9 had people claiming it wasn't 'Trek' and there was a small group of Babylon 5 fans who felt Paramount ripped off JMS. And Voyager is well... Moving on!

And that's just Trek. I mean remember you did have other shows like Highlander, Kung-Fu: The Legend Continues, the remake they did of the Outer Limits, Poltergeist: The Legacy, Friday the 13th, hell I'm even going to throw Stargate SG-1 on here. Back then? I mean no one cared that Highlander ignored some of the first film and pretty much ignored the second and third. Kung-Fu was fun even when it got weird. Friday the 13th didn't have Jason showing up ever. And Stargate SG-1 did sorta ignore things from the film. Back then? Most of us could live with it. Today? I think you'd have a very vocal group losing their minds over those due to not following the lore/canon. Hell god knows how today's fanbase would take the Battletech cartoon, aka the one that's 'canon' as it's a Fedcom propaganda cartoon.

And keep in mind I'm not even getting into syndication shows that where pure cheese and based on some sorta lore like Hercules: The Legendary Journeys or Xena: Warrior Princess, I mean they where like I said pure cheese and we all knew it and watched anyway. And chance are you'd have the fanbase today screaming about projects like Gene Roddenberry's Earth: Final Conflict and Andromeda. I can already see the people screaming, ""Gene Roddenberry did make this crap!""

To be fair true. If Roddenberry did? See TNG Season 1."

1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,"When their best games were Skyrim and everything before it, and each game release got progressively less interesting to play, it's very difficult to even entertain this opinion. And even their best games were absolutely amateur on a technical level. They were great RPGs in a great many ways, but with having less and less emphasis on free form RPG elements, Bethesda's games aren't really going anywhere. They're all designed like Morrowind and have a fraction of the actual depth and variety somehow. Since Skyrim, Bethesda games have regressed hard.

Bethesda's games were always janky as shit and stilted in the technical department, but they made that up with variety and authenticity in the RPG elements. Without that, they're just shittily designed action/adventure games with no substance or depth."

I think people did care, it’s just a combination of “It was harder to connect to other people that cared”, a higher barrier of entry and whatnot…and the product was good.

Like people have always had complaints about casting, but if the show/movie is good people let it be.

Like if Borderlands had somehow turned out good maybe people would have forgiven Cate being like twice game!Lilith’s age, lol."
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-30,">“How could Indy not believe in magic if he experienced everything he did in the temple of doom?”

This REALLY bothered me in Dial of Destiny. I find it impossible to believe that Indy would still be an atheist/rationalist given everything he's personally witnessed. The dude has had direct contact with at least two capital-G Gods. He watched his father get healed by a literal honest-to-Jehovah miracle. He's met aliens, for crissake.

If I'd been writing DoD, I would have gone the totally opposite direction with it. Old Indy is kind of a crank, borderline conspiracy theorist, because he's seen *so much* that he's willing to believe almost anything.

(And maybe the worst part was how early in DoD, he says he doesn't believe in magic... but then later casually mentions that time he was controlled by a voodoo doll. The writers couldn't even keep his story straight!)"

Ignored the third movie too you forgot that as well. Also to be fair it was slightly better the Highlander: The Source. Of course that's like saying getting stabbed is better then getting shot. Both are god awful, but at least the second has some bad comedy and Connery hamming it up.

See that's the thing it really depends on *where* you went back then. Usenet was always a shithole however you did have to be a bit of a high level nerd to be on the newsgroups. Things like AOL and the like where much more tame, but part of the reason for that was there was more moderation going on.

1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,"Sure, but like, their quality before was Fallout 3, Oblivion or Skyrim which are literally among the 50 greatest games ever made, not much can or will reach that level from almost any studio. 

The rest I listed were at least good, if not great in a few cases. Maybe not to you personally but broadly speaking they are pretty good or great or well recieved. 

Dishonoured 2 and Prey are very well liked, Starfield got way over hyped by critics which led to a backlash of fans going too far the other way but to most normal people it was just a pretty good game.

I never said anything about Redfall or Ghostwire so I don't even know why you're bringing them up. 

Deathloop and Rage 2 are good games, nothing crazy impressive but fairly good fun games. 

Also within the last decade was Evil Within 2 which wasn't as good as the first but was still a super fun survival horror, Fallout Shelter which as far as mobile games go was one of the best and Fallout 4 which is excellent and is very nearly as good as their other Elder Scrolls/Fallout style games (especially with the DLC), hell it's even a few people's favourite Fallout."
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,"yes and i'd argue this decrease in quality, which you have clearly pointed out here, coupled with a couple disasters along the way like fallout 76 and redfall, and if we're being honest starfield as well, then I can clearly see why OP commentor would be happy its not the current Bethesda that is making Indiana Jones."
1gevwju,2024-10-29,2024-10-29,"I don't know how you can look at DOOM or DOOM ETERNAL or Dishonoured or Prey or Fallout 4 or Hi Fi Rush, or Wolfenstein as a decrease in quality. I mean I can see how you specifically could perceive it that way because you're all negative. But in general I don't think many video game fans see those as anything but amazing. 

Like, have they released some dude too? Sure, but what company hasn't. 

I don't think you can say the Indiana Jones game will suck just based on Bethesda being involved when in the past decade they have been involved in all those genuinely great games."

1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"This game doesn't have stealth mechanics, idk what you thought would happen. You can have 40 fasciste's chase you and as long as you hide for 3 seconds in a dark corner they will forget it forever. You can't stealth takedown anyone , and there's nowhere to hide the bodies, so the fact that you can even carry them (which makes you run out of stamina within 2 seconds even if you've upgraded your stamina) seems entirely pointless. It's not like the enemies patrol around or even have an aggro system if they find a body. I had one body discovered once and nothing came of it, they didn't find me. 

The gameplay is weird at best in this game. I'm  not calling it bad, but it's like MG made a game Arkane should have helped with and just left out all of the Arkane parts except they kept in some extremely light stealth mechanics and ""restricted areas."""

1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"Probably my favorite of the year.  On the surface its nothing incredible, but often times it feels like its straight out of the original movies, and captures that feeling better than anything disney has made (not like that says much).  It also leans into the immersive sim genre more than I expected, though maybe some will disagree with that take. 

Its probably just because I had rock bottom expectations, but its way better than I would have thought."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"I really quite like it. Not super challenging or anything, just a ton of fun to mess around in, with lots to see and do. I'd really like to see a whole series of Indiana Jones adventures in this style, even if they just drop new episodes as DLC or something."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"Best game I've played this year if I'm honest. I wasn't expecting it at all. Trailers didn't really appeal though I loved Indiana Jones growing up.

I've grown jaded with gaming in the last year. Don't have the time I used to have. A number of games disappointed me and even ones that were good just felt overly familiar. 

This feels fresh. Nothing else is quite like it. Wolfenstein and Dishonored had a baby with tomb raider and Uncharted. It's goofy, addictive and fun. Brilliant cutscenes and voice acting. Excellent level design and diversity to biomes. Solid length unless you're obsessed with 'beating' it. 

Made me love gaming again so far. Everyone should try it."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,Honestly it plays like one of the older 3 movies. Quips and all! Lots of jokes to get from the movies and I’ve had almost no bugs at all. First game in a long while I’m looking to get 100% on.
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,and how does it stack up next to Lego Indiana Jones?
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"It's very good. The combat is laughably easy, unless you play on the very hardest difficulty in which case, you get knocked out with a single punch. So I do wish that they'd have found a happy medium between the ""hard"" and ""relentless"" dificulty or whatever they call it. Hard is way too easy, the hardest is too OP to be fun.

But aside form that, phenomenal voice acting, direction, and game design. Puzzles are interesting and not the more common ""find a key, unlock a box, find another key, unlock another box""

easy 9/10 for me."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"It’s fucking blast, the story, gameplay is smooth, the CRACK of the whip is so satisfying. It has its shortcomings but they are more personal preference. Overall recommendation: highly"
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"Pretty fun, just not all that long.  The main story is great, and the visuals from just walking around and exploring is awesome.  I think it's one of those games that's probably best for Gamepass, as it's a fun cinematic game but you probably won't spend over 15 hours on it.

Edit: You know people are right, it's probably more in the 20 hour range, 25+ if you're going after all the relics."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,It's a fun game for sure. But imo not very challenging. Or let me say; not at all. Even on hard.
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"If you like Uncharted or Tomb Raider, you will love this game. The Studio nailed this game. They did a great job. 

You just have to understand what type of game this is. Most of the issues people have with the game are not understanding what game type this is."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"Great honestly. Was a good refresher for me. I dont want to eat my words, but im hoping this is a good omen for future bethesda titles."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,I’m a huge Indiana Jones fan and I am enjoying the game for sure. I’m still at the Vatican but so far I’ve got lost on this level like three times and the backtracking is kinda nuts so far but that could totally just be me being an idiot. Hopefully it’s easier to navigate in later levels
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,Pretty damn good man. I didn’t expect it. But there is a fair amount of action and fighting and gunplay and then the puzzles are sprinkled in and then there are entire sections that brake up the monotony real well. The pacing is very good as long as you’re not trying to 100% and find everything. The mechanics and systems are good and encourage discount secrets to level up abilities so anytime you find a secret and get some points it’s a little dopamine release each time. I highly recommend
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,Really good. I've been mostly playing it through the Game Pass cloud gaming stuff during downtime at work so haven't made much progress I don't think. Just got to the first main underground area in Vatican City. But it nails the feel and tone of the old Indiana Jones movies like Raiders and Last Crusade. Like probably the best one of these treasure hunting globe trotting games since Uncharted 2 imo. This just really feels enjoyable so far.
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"I know you’ve got a hundred comments already, but my two cents: if you like movies, this game does an incredible job of making you feel like you’re in a classic adventure movie, more successfully than any “cinematic” game I’ve played. The score rises and falls as things happen in the world and it’s a BEAUTIFUL score. Set pieces and level design is fantastic. Voice acting, dialogue, and general writing is great and the story hooks you. The facial animation is…out of this world. You can truly truly read the emotions on Indy’s (and side characters’) faces to the point where you can see the thought process leading up to the “eureka!” moment of cracking a puzzle or deciphering a clue. And so far the pacing is great. It’s at the very least worth the $1 for 14 days game pass deal just to try."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"Really good! I don't like the Indiana Jones movies, but I'm having a blast with the game"
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"It feels like playing the movies. Well, the good movies: Raiders and Crusade."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"Awesome! Series S is kind of a crappy experience on a big TV though, quite blurry."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,Actually pretty awesome. The world is so fun to explore and there’s tons to do
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,It requires hardware raytracing and won't launch without it.  First game I've seen in years that won't run at all w/o a current gen GPU.  Wasted a few hours downloading this crap for it to fail on launch.
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,Look at all the fascists this guy punched out. How can you not like a game like this?
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"It's really good, just wish the enemies didn't respawn. Did a good chunk of the Vatican and when I made it back to the start, everyone was alive again. That was pretty disheartening."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"I found it to be pretty boring, to be honest. I especially disliked all of the climbing. So slow and tedious, and not rewarding in any way.

It was also really annoying how the game will present you with something you need (like a camera or a rebreather), but you don’t have enough money to buy it, so you have to backtrack and get it later.

It was also incredibly annoying how shooting someone in the face doesn’t kill them instantly, even in the easiest modes. But I can just punch them to death? Nonsensical."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"It's not good. Story on rails, bad fight and movement mechanics.

When I read the comments here, it sounds like I played a completely different game."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,Extremely average game praised due to its skin
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"It's really, really good but I'm not going to sugarcoat it.. the enemy AI is absolute garbage, like immersion breaking bad.

Combat IS fun, but it's like beating people with special needs."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"It's kind of janky in my opinion and the start is very slow,- but I think it's fun."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"If you like the old Indy movies, it will be a revelation. But you got to suspend some disbelief. 
I think it’s no spoiler to talk about the Vatican as it’s the first stage. You of course puzzle around and clue out thing to end up in some insane-hidden-for-ever church with dozens of hoops to jump through to open the final door etc.. and it feels great. And then you go through a door and end up in some secret study where there is the still warm coffee of the guy that just left. 

So either they have to do that while Rigamaroll each time they want to get some work done… or it’s completely unnecessary because there is some regular door somewhere else. 😂

I don’t mind though. It’s fun to puzzle things out and find some ancient secret etc. and there is always stuff to find and do. I’m just playing along the story and not going for much side content or completionist stuff, unless it naturally fits into my progression. 

If anything, it’s a bit easy since basically every mystery has a map marker etc. so you can’t get lost. Only thing I find a bit sad. For me those games were fun, when you got stuck on a puzzle for days. But whatever. Feels more like a movie anyway and thus I don’t mind so much."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"Its a fun chill game, not super crazy but still enjoyable."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"I've found it quite boring to be honest. I'm on the second area and it feels really stiff, and the AI is not great for a ""stealth"" game."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,Sadly uncharted was designed so this stuff fit the plot whereas here it all feels so weird.
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,Same! Especially when I have ammo for my revolver. Popping them like balloons is so satisfying.
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"This game is making punching nazis cool again, and I'm here for it."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,The only good nazi is a dead nazi my grandpappy always said.
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,Yep. In and out of game.
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"I like to kill them all while still being stealthy. Pretty early on, you unlock the ability to kill someone by strangling them with your whip from behind. That + pulling people off ledges with the whip + pushing people off ledges, shit's so good."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"PSA: no matter what difficulty level you choose, select “very hard” on enemy detection.  It makes “going loud” moments much more frequent and you don’t have the immersion breaking blind AI that happens on the lower difficulties."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,Stealth is an extremely boring mechanic in most games. Really no reason to do it.
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,I threw a bottle to distract one of them but gravity led it straight to his dome.
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,Not him but I was holding a candle and walked up to one of the red posters to read it and one thing lead to another....

1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,Locked until the game sends you there.

1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,Especially since they are fascists and nazis. It's very satisfying.
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,Depends on the area. Mission critical points seem to keep 'em dead.
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,Depends on your definition of killing. I sneak whip attacked a Nazi who promptly fell down a very deep elevator shaft. So he was Batman levels of 'knocked out' or as I would describe it... dead.
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"No clue, still in the Vatican myself. So far it seems like it"
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,I'd be very surprised if you couldn't. I just finished the Vatican section and I still haven't used the revolver a single time.
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"I don't see how sneaking up behind someone and smashing them in the top of the skull with a sledgehammer isn't killing them, but that's videogame logic."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"Medium, but you can get a book that restores three stamina instantly on enemy knockout."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"So far, at least in the Vatican, there is only one heavily water-focused section that lasts about 2 minutes. No creatures so far. That being said, I would NOT recommend this game for you, as Indy is VERY expressive and the drowning and struggling noises he makes (and he starts making them after less than 5 seconds underwater) are very realistic - I have no issues with water and find them a bit disturbing anyway."

1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"It's on the Series S. Lord knows what upscaling crap it's doing. Granted, it looks better on my TV - I prefer the TVs sharpening to the game's, so this is with in-game sharpening turned off."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,On PC I had to turn off all the blurring because they went too crazy with that setting
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,we've seen what he's done to our colleagues

1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,Why does Warframe always haunt me.
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,Don’t nonlethal takedowns knock them out indefinitely? I remember my pacifist and violent runs were basically the same but I pressed Q instead of R
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,Mankind Divided was even funnier. It's still pacifism if you get the cops to kill the bad guys for you!
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,Not enough windows nearby
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,Remember... No Russian
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,Fuze stealth. Can't hear me if there are explosions happening around you.
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,No big surprise
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,And brotha’- the darkness is coming. You need to RUN.

1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,How does it compare to Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure?
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"Controls are horrible. Indiana moves like an 80 year old with terminal arthritis (have you heard his death throes when he's climbing!?). Fighting mechanic feels like we're back in 1997 prince of persia. And i am not impressed with the graphics.

But it's immersive as shit. And i like the lack of reminders telling you where to walk and what to do. Sometimes you just wander around aimlessly and find a random quest.

So, a pleasant surprise."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,I may have to check it out then. I keep hearing good things.
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,I’m going to play it now. It looks fun
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"Beautifically said, I completely agree."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"It feels like an old school game, which i think is the big appeal too. Its well made and generally feels good to play without trying to be more than it is"
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"I had some bugs but it was almost exclusively the haha funny type stuff. NPC gets stuck thinking it's in combat even though everything is calm and just keeps shouting threats while going about their day, Indy's hand twisting around when interacting with a puzzle while holding a torch, notepad gets stuck in the air, etc. I had one crash a few hours in, but that was it really"
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"As someone who 100% Lego IJ, Great Circle is fun as fuck and makes me want to go back and play it again haha."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,LMAOOOO BRUH 💀💀💀💀💀💀
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,I’ll try it man. Love all the responses on this sub
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"I’m loving jt too but I really don’t understand the brawling. Also it’s kind of ridiculous the entire map swarms you when you get noticed, and you either have to get lucky and hide or fight off the entire map of NPCs or just restart checkpoint."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"must be a skill issue, I 1 v 10+ dudes WITH GUNS on the hardest difficulty, this game is total ass. Stealth is pointless"
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"All the sound effects have a really meaty quality - the whip crack, as you say, Indy's revolver, and best of all - the sound of punching a nazi in the face might be the single most satisfying sound effect ever."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,I'm 10 hours in and i just left the Vatican
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,You must not have done much side content?
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"Good to know. It’s hard finding solid games right now after Elden ring DLC, BMW."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"I guess you probably just focused on the story. I have 18 hours into the game and just finished Gizeh. I know that compared to Elden Ring 18 hours may not be much, but for a single player story focused game its actually quite decent. I expect to be around 22 in by the time I finish. By comparison this is about the same it took me to beat Alan Wake 2 which was another amazing single player story driven game."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"15hrs for a AAA $70 game?! WTF, man. Definitely a wait to play for free game, then.

Edit: I’m replaying CP77 where I have 15 hrs logged, and I haven’t even done The Heist"
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,Only challenge I’ve had so far was the boxing ring
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"Agreed, while the hardest difficult, whatever it's called,  is simply just a wildly disproportionate damage scale so you get destroyed by a single punch. Wish there was some in-between, because the fistfight mechanics do feel pretty good, but because the combat is so easy, you don't really get to test yourself because it gets so button mashy."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"Yeah, absolutely."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"It’s one of those games that you play once and might be done with it.

The difficulty is meh. When you get in the shootout that is when things get spicy. But honestly if it’s a fist fight? It will end like the pic from OP. Which is hilarious to me."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"Yeah, the AI of enemies is really, really bad and dumb"
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,Uncharted yes. I did enjoy it. I love naughty dog.
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"This game doesn't compare to uncharted. Uncharted was polished and had way better set pieces, mechanics, and enemy AI. At least, I wouldn't put them in the same category."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,Everyone keeps talking about this area of the VaticanZ
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,The map is surprisingly useful
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,Love this thanks man. I’ll get on it. Feels like a great Xmas game
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,Can you blast your way through missions?
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,Hahaha true
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,Wait..what?! They respawn after you die or just after you leave the area?
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,Yah in need of a new game after black myth wukong but on the fence about this one. not a fan of COD. I feel like next year and 2026 is when the best games come out
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,I’ll get into it
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,I heard the stealth is weak. It’s not like AC or ghosts of Tsushima
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,I do hate that they can take multiple shots to the face at the later levels.
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"I'm just about finished with the vatican map and haven't shot my gun once haha

bonk"
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,“Always was.”

1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"Ah, thank you. Nice"

1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,Fieldwork I'm guessing then
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"Oh shit....thinking about it now I did knock out one guy and he fell into a pool of water, so uh.... Not sure he'd have survived! I got an achievement for it too! lol 😆"
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,Well you've the mechanic down for sure lol!
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"lol true, I've obliterated some dudes fr"
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,Thanks for the reply. I might check this out. I can deal with water stuff in games if I know there’s nothing down there.
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"Either way, dead is good."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"It's the thousandth post from the indy game of bodies on the floor and you say ""oops stealth didn't work as intended""


Is this your first game?"
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"Playing on hardest difficulty, people seemingly have blinders on for such a “great game”"
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"I turned it all off in the Vatican but partway through Egypt in one of the tombs I realized just how photorealistic the game can look with things like Chromatic Aberration and high quality motion blur on and just stuck with it. It really paid off in the third area. I was RP ""walking"" through the entire area in aww of how real the scenery looked. May depend on your GPU though. I played maxed out settings minus Full RT as I have an AMD gpu and sharpness was never really an issue."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"Because Warframe is slowly becoming every game of every genre.

It just recently became a dating sim."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"You did however need to be very careful where you left, and how you dragged, the bodies. Sometimes people would die randomly while unconscious."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,So essentially... being an entitled white lady in America?

1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"Asking out that dial tone again, are we?"
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"I assume most people playing it got it with Gamepass, which will at least make a game feel like they got it for free."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-18,"How long have you played this game? The ""story on rails"" is a weird take, the game opens up to a hub where you can go wherever you like, kinda like Dishonored or Deus Ex."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"Not sure why you're getting down voted. I think this is a sensible take, as someone who has not touched the game at all."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"Yeah I had briefly heard about it on TikTok, and was surprised it was that bad. Story on rails, bad fight mechanics."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"It's got the right tone, but a totally different style of game.

I was delighted yesterday when I found a merchant who said he was ""selling these fine leather jackets""."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"Apples and oranges, one is a point and click game, this is kinda like an immersive sim? With looooads of stealth elements (think dishonoured) with some puzzles"
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,Try to climb like him. I'd love to listen to sounds you'd make lol.
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-18,"Climbing ace will allow you to sprint climbing and you get 3 upgrades for this, climbing really isn't an issue.

And regarding fighting mechanics it's completely different from PoP and more like Riddick."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,It's on Gamepass.
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"Oh yeah I had it exit to main system menu twice. And another where I was inside of Gina’s head and saw her eyes for a couple seconds, but that was about it."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,you're SO cool
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,/r/iamverybadass
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"Agreed. No way they were that quick. Im now finishing up Gizeh and have easily racked up 15+ so far trying to 100%. 

This is not a short game. Nor does it look to be overly long. Some people rush things"
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"I did, and I edited my response to show I undervalued the length of the game.  20-25 is probably more accurate."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,My 100% playthrough took 19 hours and 9 minutes
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"It’s 15 hours if you plow through it MAYBE. 

I’m 14 hours in and I just got to the second big set piece. Tons of side missions. Lots of exploring. 

It’s an extremely fun and immersive game."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"Just a heads up that you can easily just buy a month of gamepass for 10-15 bucks, cancel the renewal immediately, and play the game for basically that price. And it’s for sure worth 10 bucks."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,It’s 15 if you rush it. I’m 30 hours in my first playthrough and still have more to go.
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,Not every game needs be a bloated fucking mess. I can’t stand this logic. For every good open world game like Cyber Punk there are a million that are just empty pointless wastes
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"Again, it's on Gamepass.  Just get a month of that, play through Great Circle as long as you want, and then play something else until the subscription expires."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"I think this is a bad way to look at games. It’s not like say the Witcher 3 or cyberpunk where you will get hundreds of hours- but honestly the opening parts of both those games are some of my least favorites and with say elden ring by the time I got to the mountaintops I was just ready to be through with it. Newer RPG assassins creed games are a good example of long but not worth it while the others are good games but with their share of bloat

On the other hand space marine 2, Indiana Jones, and the dead space remake are great games but they don’t have a large time commitment to them. A great refined experience such as the OG halo trilogy can often be more worth it than a stretched out one such as infinite

Also I’m not even done but I’ve definitely spent at least 15 hours on the game and I accidentally ended the egypt section way earlier than planned so I missed a good bit of content"
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"The duration of a game doesn't necessarily mean it's better, replay value is more important. If that 15 hour game is one that I can come back to multiple times, then it's a good game.

When you look at the legnth of a total playthrough, you do end up seeing the Ubisoft problem, where there's a ton of next to pointless activities that only serve to boost runtime. 

If that 15 hours is a one and done experience though, I would wait for a sale as well."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"I look at it this way, it's about $12 for a movie ticket which lasts about 2 hours.  This is 7.5 times that amount of time which in movie-watching price would come to $90.  So it's not unreasonable if you look at it that way."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,Boxing rings can be kinda bullshit. In the desert one well fighting the last guy if I parried than hit him 3 times he would instant punch me with no animation and couldn't be blocked. Had to just slowly whittle him down with 1 or 2 punches after every parry and it took forever.
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"Honestly, not even that really. Just parry, punch, punch, repeat. Apart from the occasional animation where the hit happens later/earlier than I'd expect, you can beat anyone easily 1 on 1 without a scratch"
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"I haven't tried to kill whole bases with guns but you would expect some kind of wanted system here. Because it makes little sense that you can kill a whole camp, then move to the next 50 meters away and everything is fine. 

Still a fun game though, as I said. I think I even enjoy the smaller linear parts the most."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,Just like the movies. All the enemies were dumb as shit.
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"So it's realistic. They are a bunch of fascists, after all."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"That, but also in the adventure parts. Everything is pretty much on rails. The paths are all very clear and straight forward with almost no tricky jumps. In that regard Tomb Raider is way harder."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,Yeah I’m running around with the map out the whole time
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,Hm hard to say because I don’t play that way. Like the game levels are pretty open map that you can explore and either B line the mission of find treasures and puzzles. First area is Vatican City and the area you can explore is pretty big
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"Yeah, I had left the area and they were back when I returned. Honestly, I haven't seen anyone else mention respawning enemies, I'm wondering now if it's a Bethesda Bug ™️. I gotta test it out again."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"If you have Gamepass, it's worth checking out. 

In general I've not been in need of buying games frequently with Gamepass."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,Yea but worse is the climb8ng mechanics and whip climbing feels sluggish as he'll. Like animations have to fully complete before the next input is registered.
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"Ugh, that freaking Himalayan level.  It should not take 5 two-handed hits to the face with a lead pipe to take down one guy in a parka."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,I just started playing (just resurfaced up the bulldozer hole from the catacombs below the Vatican) and I'd already forgotten I even had a gun lol
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,not every game has to be for you
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"Indiana Jones is pretty timeless, and the game sticks to the feel of the films quite well from what I’ve played so far. If you want a more shooter version of it, I recommend the new wolfenstein games, made by some of the same people"
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,No it's not
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"I know, just finished the game. We are talking about the posted image."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,I OVER FED THESE MEN!?
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,You can also push a surprisingly large number of enemies off convenient ledges or out of windows. I love any game with a mechanic that lets you do this (although nothing will ever surpass dark messiah of might and magic).
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,">It just recently became a dating sim.

1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,">It just recently became a dating sim.

I know, planning on dating Pablo's Mum but it's hard to say no to Eleanor."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,Just like IRL so realistic!
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,Ah. It was such a long time ago I don’t remember at all!
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,I got gamepass for 1 dollar and played this one through... but ill be recurrent subscriber so they gained that atleast.
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"As with almost all Tiktok news. This is just blatantly false. The game is amazing and this is coming from someone who doesn't even care for Indiana Jones.

There is a reason it's scoring so highly."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"he wouldn't even need to climb, he'd backflip himself up and land elegantly without making a sound"
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize games were all supposed to be immersive sims of my own life. 

I also didn't realize people here enjoyed waiting 5 minutes to climb a wall. 

Anyways, as I said, controls and movement is shit (most of which resemble really old games and revert quality of life changes the industry adopted years ago). But I enjoyed the game still."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"That seems incredibly fast to me. That's all relics, side content,  and everything? I call BS but if you can prove it, I'll eat my words lol"
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"That’s reassuring. I generally take this slow and explore everything before moving on. I’m on PS5, which it’s not even out for yet. Regardless, I’ll wait."

1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,Final German boxer in Egypt is the hardest fight IMO.  I revisited it after I got some combat/health upgrades in Thailand
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"Yeah the small linear parts are the best. Does feel like and IJ movie. But I just vaporized two camps in the last part of the game…when I finished the last one and walked by the previous nuked one…they were all prancing like nothing happened.

Keep in mind I am sure I violated 15 Geneva conventions. But they all carried on like nothing happened"
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"I've found so far (still only in the second main region) that doing larger missions often opens up new routes, by unlocking gates or similar, that make subsequent navigation easier. Learning where the fast travel signposts are has also helped save on shoe leather."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"Yah you’re the first person to mention this so I was shocked. that would be so annoying. I’ll hook up the Xbox and play the game this week. is the Vatican that annoying? 

In BMW there was an area called the pagoda which I swear to god was the bane of my existence. I died in that area more than I died to any boss and I just about lost it. I hope it’s not that annoying."

wish there were more great releases out this holiday season."

1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,Did you grab the books that increase your damage? Cause it only took 2 for me. Or are you playing on the hardest difficulty?
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,One of my favorite things about this game is if you have a gun in your hand and use the interact button Indyll flip it around and it becomes a melee weapon. More games should do that.
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"It took me forever to figure out how to use the repair kits, so my gun was broken for almost half the game."

1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,https://i.imgur.com/WSvAXDL.jpeg mad weird getting defensive over people beating a game quickly
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"The flip side of that argument is that there are many of us who PREFER a tighter shorter game. I’d rather pay $70 for a game that keeps me entertained for 20 hours then a game that’s so big and long that after 20 hours I stop playing because I can’t keep track of wtf is going on. I suspect much of the divide can be attributed to available gaming time. I’ve got a career and an 8 year old. I’m lucky if I get 6 hours of gaming a week. I often loose track of the various story lines in massive opens world games and end up giving up as a result. 

So you’re not wrong, but there’s a large market for shorter, tighter gaming experiences than you might think."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-18,"Alright, just retested this. From the starting area of the Vatican I went left where the post office is and where you photograph the cobblestone workers. Killed all the fascists on that side. Went back to the starting area and this time went right to where those barracks and that jail were. Killed everyone on that side. After. I went back to the post office side. Everyone was respawned. No fast travel used and I didn't die at all."

Well, thanks for letting us know you prefer bad movies to timeless classics. Ya know, you really should’ve led with that to avoid all these back and forth comments."

1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"Apparently, although I can't understand why."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"Appreciate it! I was surprised to see my final time, I doubt it’s gonna be big in the speedrun community but could see someone from there pulling a sub 5 hours on just the main story excluding cutscenes (not sure if they are even skippable or not story was too good to even think about skipping one)"
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"I hear you, I guess for me, I want the graphics and polish of a AAA game, but I prefer it to be 15-30hrs of playtime. I’m totally fine paying $70 for that. 

That said, a lot of what I play are indie titles that end up being a lot cheaper. The level of polish in Indiana Jones makes it worth the sticker price imo but I also recognize lots of folks want more value for money. I’d rather really high quality but shorter run times. 

So I totally get where you’re coming from. It works for me, but won’t be enough for others."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-18,"Yup. It really sucks. It's not like they're hard to kill, but it's just annoying to stealth for like an hour trying to clear a place only for it to just not matter in the end. I still haven't seen anyone else talk about the respawning, I might make a separate post asking, but if you do decide to test it out on your end, let me know the results. Maybe it's just my version of the game, and uninstalling and reinstalling will fix it. Idk"
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"Indiana Jones knows how to use guns because he's a veteran. Served in WWI and WWII.

And [renowned author Dan Brown](https://jimmyakin.com/2024/03/dont-make-fun-of-renowned-dan-brown.html) is not actually informed on the subjects on his novels, but tries to get just enough to make things interesting for people who don't know."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"If by “story on rails” you mean there is a story then yeah…what game with a story isn’t “on rails?” inb4 “open world games” - the game is set in multiple open world locations and there are secrets and side quests that are completely optional…so if by “on rails” you mean that main quest missions have a defined beginning and end, then yeah I guess you’re right? 

Also, the combat is good. It’s 1930’s fisticuffs and you’re encouraged to look around and grab improvised weapons, of which there’s like 100 in the game. The combat sound design is great as well. 

Your complaints seem specific to an entire genre rather than a title."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-18,Because we have played it and it's great ?

1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"I played the Uncharted series, and those were wonderful games. Indiana Jones is pretty bad compared to that."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-18,It's not.
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"Dude chill you just don't like campy movies. You prefer grounded realism (even if it's just the illusion of such, The Da Vinci Code is a terrible movie) and that's fine. Lots of people enjoy camp and it's an art form in and of itself. Let them enjoy it. Also whether you like it or not Indiana Jones remains an incredibly popular IP with considerable staying power and the original movies have aged pretty well (maybe not Temple of Doom). 

The Great Circle is a game made for people who like those movies and like the IP. For that audience the game is a fantastic success and nails every aspect of recreating the original movie feel. If it's not your vibe just move on.

-signed by someone who is definitely not a boomer and loves Indiana Jones"
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"Executive producer of Great Circle on Uncharted and Tomb Raider: 

“These are both a fantastic series of games, and it’s hard not to be influenced by the quality and execution of any titles coming out of those developers. There are definitely a few things that set us apart though; not only the obvious first-person perspective, but our non-linear structure that is more grounded in player movement and combat, as well as the overall pacing of the game. Those things differ quite a lot.”

Great Circle was marketed as being different than both, so if you expected a spiritual successor to Uncharted that’s kind of on you my guy. That’s just not what the game is trying to do."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-18,"That game is the definition of ""story on rails"" lol.

Still great tho but it's a really weird complaint here."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-18,"It's a critical and commercial success, your opinion is pretty much not shared."

1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"I did not expect that, but I expected something good. Instead what I found was awkward puzzles and bad mechanics. Feels like we've played different games."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-18,"No, you're weird"
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-18,You're all wrong
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-16,"It's a big name gamepass release with a console focus so player counts from steam don't mean much. The majority of people will be playing it via Xbox or PC gamepass which doesn't release player numbers. It's also limited to graphics cards capable of Ray tracing so that narrows the potential playerbase considerably. 

The last two indiana jones movies have been hot garbage so the fact that the most recent film which had an extremely bloated budget broke even isnt too bad. It outperformed The Hunger Games, Napoleon, Dungeons and Dragons, The Flash, the Marvels, Killers of the flower moon. All either big IPs or movies from lauded directors. 

I just dont understand your entitlement when it comes to this game. Like your offended machine games didn't make the game you wanted. Machine games owes you nothing. There are hundreds of generic FPS titles released every year, they decide to do something different and unique to deliver a specific kind of experience that gamers have widely responded positively too, and your acting like a spoiled child who doesn't like the fact that some people can enjoy it?

Edit: and I'm not even going to tackle your lack of understanding of camp because I feel it would be easier to explain colour to a blind man than make you understand what makes movies good or how camp can be fun or how it continues to be prevalent in modern movies."
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-17,"Okay, so how are the puzzles awkward? And which mechanics are bad?"
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-18,Good to know you have shit tastes in games
1hfoyjc,2024-12-16,2024-12-18,"I don't, but thanks for your input"
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-20,"it amazing it really feels like a classic Indian jones film, like feels like some lost VHS tape someone found of Indian jones movie it fit perfectly in the old ones"
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-20,"Fate of Atlantis. Though, I am very biased towards those old Lucas Arts games. I remember getting a collectors set of them around Christmas time in the early 90s with Sam and Max, Fate of Atlantis, and Day of the Tentacle."
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-20,No mentions yet for The Emperor's Tomb? 😢
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-20,Fate of Atlantis is the quintessential Indiana Jones story that would have made a perfect 4th movie. So yeah IMO it still is the king of all Indiana Jones games even if the gameplay doesn't hold up.
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-20,"I've not played any of the Indiana Jones games, but The Great Circle feels like one of the movies from the original trilogy in video game form, right down to Troy Baker sounding just like Indiana as played by a young Harrison Ford."
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-20,I just wish it were on the PS5.  I worry it won't run very well on my gaming laptop.
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-21,"I’d say yes. It seems to understand that Indiana Jones was always an adventure move with action sequences, not an action movie.  The lazy approach would have been an Uncharted clone but that would have missed the essence of the films. I’m glad that the game is mostly exploration and puzzle solving with some action weaved in."
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-20,"As a massive Indiana Jones fan. I am one of the people who is saying this, yes. It's not only the best game, in my opinion. It's the best story and direction since the orignals. Fate of Altantid is also right up there as well. I remember being totally hooked on it as a kid, but it was limited in how it could tell the story. The great circle felt like I was actually watching a movie. It's one of the few games I was excited to put down my controller and watch cut scenes for. Troy Bakers voice work was just impeccable. Every yell, grunt, and breathe sounded like Harrison Ford. That and the insanely detailed character model took it over the finish line for me."
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-20,This is Lego Indiana Jones slander
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-20,Absolutely. It felt like a better movie than that recent one they put out on Disney.
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-20,"Fate of Atlantis will always be S-tier. Trying to determine whether The Great Circle, a completely different genre of Indy game, is a stupid waste of time.

They're both awesome Indy games. Hopefully we can have more awesome Indy games in the future."
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-21,"Only if you want to argue ""for the era"". The Great Circle couldn't have been built when the older games were released. Any reasonable debate is over after you play the ""Raiders"" replication opening.

The game engine/graphics is top-tier (#1 Digital Foundry's graphics 2024 awards), had AAA resources, was clearly built by people who love the franchise, the story is better than some actual Indiana Jones movies, and the voice actor absolutely nailed a young Harrison Ford."
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-21,I mean yeah. It's not like the bar was very high.
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-20,"Graphically spectacular, decent story, mid gameplay. Just my opinion"
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-20,Hands down
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-20,"It's the spiritual successor to the original film trilogy IMO. It's a very good game, especially if you have nostalgia for the old films. One of my favourites I played in the past year for sure, but probably not one of the greatest ever. I'm very much hoping for a sequel because I think it could be improved upon a little"
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-20,"I am enjoying the Great Circle with Indiana Jones being my favorite movies ever (obligatory, there are only 3)


Its fun, the gameplay is fresh, I was so pumped when it came out. But there are some flaws. The writing is a little bit off.  There are times when I feel they apply marvel humor to Indys character. The movies always had a great balance of humor and serious action. The game has Indy being the brunt of the joke to many times. Whether its him trying to feed a pet snake while other people are coming up with a plan or getting knocked out by a vase in the middle of a fight with the Nazis (played for laughs)


Its frustrating because it feels so close, and when you are in a cave and Indys talking about an ancient civilization it feels so on point. But he's missing a certain edge he had in the films.


That being said I would say its probably an 8/10 and really gives off Indy Vibes"
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-21,No one else remembers the Raiders of the Lost Ark game for the Atari 2600? Only me?
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-21,it's actually the old Lucas Arts game 'fate of atlantis'. Gods it was good.
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-21,"It's not just subjective, it's also a completely different kind of game. Doesn't really make sense to compare them. 
It's great, though, I loved it. Some annoying bugs, though."
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-21,Haven't played great circle but I'll never give up on Fate. Still holds up. Replayed it last year (I am a sucker for adventure games though)
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-21,"I'm a huuuge Fate of Atlantis fan, but even I have to admit to this possibility."
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-21,"Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised after launching the game. Very smooth gameplay"
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-21,After Lego ij? Sure!
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-21,Fate of Atlantis was a gem. So hillarious.
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-21,"Yes it is.

Its my goty for 2024"
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-21,"Yes, 100%"
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-21,"Haven't finished it yet but as a kid I really really enjoyed The Infernal Machine and The Emperor's Tomb (for the fist fighting in that one mostly). 

This one is great so far though and I am loving the main antagonist hahah he is really great in his scenes with Indy."
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-23,"For my money, La-Mulana is the best Indiana Jones game."
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-24,"Played them all, and nostalgia aside the Great Circle is far and away the best Indy game. It's truly a masterpiece, and extremely polished and optimized."
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-25,"It feels like a f***ing great movie. 4 hour cinematics, a great villain, losts or secrets and collectibles (perhaps too many and break narration pace). It's pure Indy."
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-02-21,It’s amazing. Thank you for creating it.
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-20,Without question
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-20,"Just story wise, I still think FoA is the best non-movie adventure. That being said, the acting, cinematography, dialogues and the villains from great circle are out of this world. So, please, give me a remake of Fate of Atlantis done by Machinegames and Troy Baker, thank you!"
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-20,"The game is a big meh for me, i don't get it."
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-20,I have insane nostalgia for Fate of Atlantis but quality wise it probably is
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-21,"I don't remember the game because I only saw the one clip as a kid, but where Indi punches the nazi and little swastikas fly above his head is an image that's always stuck with me"
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-20,Sure but it's not a very good game either way. It's just a very low bar
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-20,"The Great Circle looks great and has cool bits but the gameplay is extremely mediocre.

Terrible combat, poor puzzles, boring stealth mechanics and really dumb enemies. It is a shame, it started off great but went downhill very rapidly."
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-21,It's a shitty game.

1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-20,I can't wait to get dementia so I can play all those games again for the first time.
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-20,"I remember getting a similar set, with a bunch of their games on CD. Definitely Sam and Max and Day of the Tenticle - the talkie versions with full recorded speach.

There were others in there I can't remember. Maybe it was this set? But for some reason I think there were 6 disks in it, not 4. Doing some quick googling, it may have been The LucasArts Archives Vol. 1 - With Atlantis, Sam & Max, Tenticle, Rebel Assault, Screen Saver & sampler CD.

Pretty phenomonal value for the time."
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-20,"oh yeah. those were the times.

i remember playing sam & max over and over again bdcause i laughed my a§§ off every time. and i dont knos how many times i have played that, or fate of Atlantis or maniac mansion"
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-20,Or the infernal machine
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-21,The Emperor's Tomb is my favorite Indiana Jones game! It's also the only one I've ever played. It may just be a coincidence though.
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-20,It's coming!
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-20,It is coming to PS5 soon.
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-21,I think its slated for a spring release on ps5.
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-20,Get gamepass and stream it
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-20,Dial of Destiny? I was 100% against that movie... and then I watched it. I thought it was pretty good. It's a lot better than Crystal Skull. I had a lot of fun watching it despite going into it with a very negative attitude.
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-21,Fate of Atlantis is pretty highly regarded.
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-20,Too soon.
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-20,"They pulled a bunch of these as reference from the original movies. I actually appreciated it, and I found the humor very much in line with the OG movies. The game is also 10 times as long as a movie, so you're obviously going to experience a lot more of it in comparison."
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-21,"People accuse ET of being the worst game, but that was only because it sold so many copies and was a Christmas release that disappointed children.  Raiders was abysmal."
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-21,"Part of me wants to give Fate of Atlantis a try, but I personally am not a big fan of adventure games as I can never figure out what to do or where to go without a guide."
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-20,yes i mean thats what you asked right haha
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-21,That's the one! Don't think I played Rebel Assault much. I also remember having to do something to get the voices to work.
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-20,"I grew up with and loved Infernal Machine on N64, but the game is generally seen as pretty bad.

I've actually heard better about Emperor's Tomb, but I never played it tbh,"
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-21,"Not supposedly.

It's coming, and all ms games too.

Edit : He edited his comment to remove ""supposedly"""
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-20,"The whole “young Indy” decision was terrible, that and the NY scene look like total CGI slop, but the basic gist of Indy helping his wayward treasure hunting goddaughter avoid “the dark side” worked for me and I feel like it got a way worse rep than it deserved."
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-23,"Raiders was absolutely impossible to figure out, especially for a kid. Yeah, honestly even as a 5 or 6 year old, I was able to play ET and complete it successfully. It wasn't good, but it wasn't broken or anything. It was a huge commercial disaster, but there were far worse games."
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-21,"It's certain better than Kings Quest levels of adventure game logic, but there are a few times where there's minor pixel hunting or having to go through a dialogue tree in *just* the right order. Luckily some of the puzzles you can bypass by choosing to fistfight. The mini game honestly sucks but it's an option in certain cases where they deemed the puzzles too obtuse or just as an alternative. 


For me, and many others, I think the pleasure of adventure games comes when you do hit that wall. Turn it off, walk away for a day or a week then come back and see if there's a ""eureka"" moment that you were snowblind to. 


Last ditch effort, there's a lot of sites that offer ""hints"" instead of outright solutions to the puzzles. I find that a lot more enjoyable than just getting the answer but have had to use em on occasion."

When I was younger I'd waste a lot more time stubbornly trying to figure out what to do next. Now I'm more likely to try for twenty minutes and then go ""Alright this is bullshit, what am I missing here?"" and look up just the thing I'm stuck on and then go back to playing normally. Too often this is only to realize that the solution was not obvious to begin with, or was poorly explained or telegraphed to the player in a way that I know I never would have figured it out."

That is probably why I loved this game so much. We can't really experience rewinding the clock at this level for movies yet, but it worked immensely well in a game. It hit the nostalgia feels on a level that I don't experience as much anymore."
1i63d47,2025-01-20,2025-01-21,My biggest issue was taking away Indy's agency at the end of the movie. It was meaningful when Sean Connery as Indy's father told him to let the grail go and he did it of his own volition.

1ex63lq,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"PS5 have outsold the latest Xbox near 2:1.  Assuming there is some cross over, MS is still missing out on a large market chunk by making exclusives.  So not having exclusives just makes business sense. At this point though and going forward, unless MS goes in a different direction with their console - as Nintendo has done with the Switch, what is the point of buying an XBox over a PS.  An XBox owner will miss out on PS exclusives while a PS owner will get everything (minus PC and/or Switch exclusives)."
1ex63lq,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"1. Some gamers need to stop pretending exclusives don't matter. They do. They are, and always have been, a big factor for the decision when buying a console. Big name exclusives literally sell consoles. So obviously, less exclusives means less console sales.
2. And no, the additional revenue of selling first-party games on other platforms doesn't offset the decreased console sales. There's A LOT MORE MONEY in selling hardware, accessories, subscriptions and a 30% cut on *ALL digital transactions* than in just selling games. So, Microsoft doing this shift in strategy is not simply a way for them to make more game sales; it's a sign they are giving up on the (traditional) console business.
3. Xbox gamers have the right to be mad. They bought an Xbox because they expected they would only be able to play xyz game on Xbox. Instead, they could have bought a PS5 and still play those xyz games, but also play Spiderman 2, TLOU2, God of War, etc."

In an official Xbox podcast a couple of months ago, Xbox president Sarah Bond teased that Microsoft will deliver “the largest technical leap” with the next-generation Xbox.

At least for me I like timed exclusive games way better than fully exclusive games, and I like platforms having timed exclusive games better than a platform that have no exclusive games. It is a happy middle ground, in the exclusive discussion.

I do hope Xbox settles down on their exclusive policy soon, for me it feels like they are testing what way works the best. Hopefully they go with most games becoming timed exclusives, except for strictly multi-player games which I think should not have any exclusivity.

The only thing they would need to work on is how long a timed exclusive is supposed to be exclusive. I think a year might be good, but I can be swayed to a little bit before or after a full year."

1ex63lq,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"There really is zero reason to be upset with this unless you just like toxic console wars.  

You are acting like third party developers don’t exist. Which they obviously do. Xbox is now a (kinda) third party developer that just so happens to also make their own hardware. 

This also isn’t a new strategy. They have been going down the path of the hardware in front of your TV mattering less with xcloud in 2019. You can even just play on a Samsung tv with no additional hardware (other than a controller). 

There also is no reason to be worried about future hardware. Xcloud runs on blades with Xbox hardware within it. 

Any of their engineering work to make the next Xbox hardware also counts for their work on xcloud. Some of that work may carry over to a portable device. 

Console sales alone are not the number that matters to Microsoft. This isn’t just “coping”, they are playing a different game. Xbox didn’t go out of business when they started releasing on Windows on day one in 2016 and this is no different. 

Just because Sony (who is slowly realizing it) and Nintendo don’t follow this practice, doesn’t mean that it is the wrong choice. As gamers we shouldn’t be advocating for anti consumer practices. 

For anyone saying, well I bought Xbox on a promise of games. Well you still get the same games. This doesn’t change that. It isn’t like Xbox is releasing a game exclusive on PS5 or something."
1ex63lq,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"I got a series S for gamepass. I did 2+ years of gamepass. Played most of the catalogue. Never renewing, never buying xbox again. And I have a 950+ game catalogue.

I couldn't even bear to play Starfield. 15 hours in and if I had to read another AI dialogue my god. And I love Indy to tears. I was born in 1986. Those movies were my childhood. My first GF studied anthropology because of Indy (she was going to study archeology but well, life). I tell you, this is gonna be just like that Spielberg/Lucas South Park episode. Just fucking see the latest Wolfenstein game. The coop one. Also played that one, also can't remember what the fuck it was about. Microsoft can't do games. They even FUCKING DISBANDED TANGO GAMEWORKS. TANGO FUCKING GAMEWORKS. Gone. Now they work at Krafton I heard. They just going to drop xbox and go into cloud / gamepass where they will fail again.

I guess that Blade game gonna be timed-exclusive like Indy too.

Pay full price on PS or get it for ""free"" on Game Pass.

Sony pay a fuckton to Disney for full exclusive rights to keep making Spider-man and Wolverine games.

Microsoft pay ""less"" money to Disney for ""timed-exclusive"" rights.

Indy is cool and game look good but wish it had 3rd person camera options so I can see his model and outfits and gadgets. I fucking wish Cyberpunk had a 3rd person camera option too.

Microsoft's 1st Party games won't ever leave Game Pass so that is good I guess.

1ex63lq,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,I game on PC and own a ps5. Exclusivity except for hardware requirements or lack of funds (I’m thinking of indie devs that only make games for pc) is immoral.

When gamers say things like ""Everyone should have access to all games regardless of platforms"" I couldn't disagree more. More people playing games isn't necessarily a benefit to me. I was just fine when Nintendo ruled the industry and games were more of a niche hobby rather than something that rivals the movie industry."

Microsoft celebrates because they now have another lever against Sony. ""See? We're the cool guys now and only Sony does evil exclusives!""

If exclusive games is all you care about for a console then ps isn’t doing much better. more and more of there games are going to pc I’m willing to bet they’ll make a pc type gamepass in the future more then just the ps+ streaming they currently have.

They messed up and are being smart to make some money since they paid for all these studios.


But if they still have interest in making consoles and as long as they maintain some games like Halo and Starfield as exclusives.. they will have the leg to come out on a showcase and say, these games will be on all platforms.. but these big games here will be exclusive to Xbox. 


And if they have more of those big game AND they don't flop, people will still have reasons to buy it. "

This is fucking over your customers.
1ex63lq,2024-08-20,2024-08-21,"Nintendo will not follow this way. 
Neither Sony. They will release some games on PC for gain. Nothing more. 

People realize that MS purchased many good studios, with great games in works that would be great exclusives and increase Xbox sales. 
MS releasing these games on PlayStation, means there is no need to purchase Xbox in future if you will play their games on PlayStation. That leads to Xbox console sales going down together with GamePass sales going down because most of it is on consoles. People will not purchase games on Xbox knowing this brand potentially may be closed down and in future without Xbox console their library would be useless. So they will build game library on PlayStation. 

So after some time Xbox will shut down. 
Sony will have no competition in stationary console market. 
If there is no competition and gamers have no other choice to play these games - and you are focused on increasing profit - you increase game prices, console prices, PS Plus prices. And gamers have no choice they will have to buy it anyway. 

That is called a monopoly."

It’s about the fact that people bought an Xbox hoping for good exclusives and haven’t really gotten any this gen, and the fact that Microsoft is killing anyone’s motivation to buy an Xbox which means the platform might not be supported for much longer. If someone bought an Xbox because they thought this and other games were going to be exclusive they’re going to be pretty frustrated they didn’t just buy a PS5."

All consoles, including Playstation sales are slumping, maybe not as bad as Xbox, but there are still a hundred million+ of gamers out there not buying a console just to play a game. That is money left on the table that Sony could be raking in for their investors. My last console was an Xbox 360 and PS3, but I've been upgrading my PC and buying games on Steam for over 20 years. Sony could be making more money off of me and many others. With the cost of AAA games costing $200+ million, even having a console with 50+ million units isn't a big enough base to make a safe bet of recouping your money. Why wouldn't they want a piece of the 130 million Steam users?"

1ex63lq,2024-08-20,2024-08-21,"True and when they basically funded the development of Rise of the Tomb Raider and got absolutely shit on for having it timed exclusive, they basically gave up on this strategy of buying launch exclusives or funding of previously multiplatform games.

1ex63lq,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,I agree with the sentiment of consoles each having exclusives. They make games only for their platform so you buy it. Without exclusives would Sony or Nintendo even exist? You’d just get some random gamestation grey box that put out the same game. None of the great games we associate with Sony or Nintendo or Xbox would have existed without exclusivity.
1ex63lq,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"You have a minority opinion on reddit, but I kind of agree with you. The most iconic video games that got many of us into this hobby in the first place were exclusives.  

The whole point of consoles, and why iconic characters like Sonic were even created, is to attract customers to game *exclusively* on them. The console war made Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft innovate and try to one-up each other over the years, whether that be through hardware or software, and us gamers reaped the rewards.  

Microsoft losing the console war is not as good as Sony fanboys think it is, because Sony have already become arrogant and obnoxious. I say this as a Sony fanboy myself, having owned all their consoles from day one. Microsoft fucking themselves out of the race doesn't benefit gamers in the long term.  

Disclaimer: I'm fine with PC being the gateway for the console makers though, and having their 'exclusives' available on that format at a later date. But in principle, I think exclusives have been an integral part of the gaming medium, and have brought us much joy. If exclusives completely ceased to exist across Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo, I feel like it would have negative ripples long term. For example would Sony have bothered to support and fund the making of Ghost of Tsushima in an alternate world where exclusives did not exist?"

Weird thing is, that XBOX is shifting away from being a console company to being a subscription service while Sony is still a console manufacturer and game publisher. Yet MS holds Sony to their own standards and makes open comparisons between them, which gets increasingly absurd.

So the game started as a multiplatform game (makes sense, since Bethesda hadn't been bought yet by Microsoft when they and Disney made the deal), then Microsoft and Disney renegotiated to make the game exclusive, and now Microsoft has turned that into timed exclusivity."

People keep repeating this but ignoring that xcloud is just running Xbox hardware. Its blades with Xbox series X hardware in it. 

Xbox has been pushing xcloud pretty hard. 

So I guarantee you that the work they are doing on their next console is also going to go towards xcloud. That is shared engineering effort, incentivizing the hardware being released. 

Also Sony is also releasing games on Xbox. Remember their Bungie purchase? Marathon is hitting Xbox. MLB the show is on Xbox. 

You’re jumping to conclusions and being worried about an outcome that is ignoring that Microsoft is playing a different game. They also care about Windows. They care about xcloud.

Xbox will stop selling as many consoles now that gamers believe they will eventually get the games on PS5 so they’ll just buy a PS5. 

This will lead to future Xbox exclusives not getting as many sales or gamepass subs as Xbox needs to hit its growth levels.

So to make up for the lack of growth and revenue Xbox will release more and more exclusives until they are all on PS5."

Exclusive games = a reason to build home consoles at a subsidized price. 

If you do not make exclusive games then home consoles are no longer subsidized so their price will increase massively. Classically consoles have been sold at a loss or very low margins because they are trying to get people into their ecosystem of software where they’ll make more money."

Ahhh yes the normal Redditor WHO DOESN'T FUCKING READ!

Do you understand what go's into making a game when it's a licensed property? Wait why am I asking you don't. I own an IP, you come to me wanting to make a game based on that IP, you may have to pay a fee to do it, and in general I can tell you what I want/don't want in that game.

This is why you've had CBS/Paramount telling the Star Trek Online Dev's no Player Androids, and they nixed a system that would have allowed you to play your second officer, why? One of the vet rewards is an Android Bridge Officer. It's why back in the day if you made a Star Wars title you'd have to clear things with Lucas himself. Note something that's still on going, now you just clear it with the Lucasfilm Story group.

And that plays into business side of things as well. Chances are Disney did the math, went to Microsoft and pretty much told them to make the damn thing multiplatform rather then just come out with it on Xbox/PC.

How is that so fucking hard to understand? Oh I know, ""B-bu-but- Phil said!"" - Yeah about that there's a saying we hear all the time over in the wrestling world. ""Plans change."""

Controllers work on pc. Pc can be displayed on a TV. Console experience works through steam big picture or Xbox app.

And then when you're done using it as a gaming console, it's infinitely better than any console as a media station. Every streaming service, every communication app, no worries about whether they ported it. Everything just works.

The only actual argument is that consoles are easier to buy, but that's an incredibly small hurdle."

Plus other new games eventually get added. It’s just really good value."

I mean enough games have had significant enough problems with it that I just never use it (since I don't know if a game will have those problems). Stuff like features not working until game reboot (like Remnant 2 just will not let me make a mulitplayer game off quick resume). Several games have had achievements completely break from using it.

No web browser, no dynamic themes, no dolby vision for gaming, can't even play a music cd. No vita support. Not to mention the biggest console ever created. I had to buy a new tv stand just for it. The pulse headset has zero bass compared to the xbox wireless headset and the controls on it are archaic in comparison. Remote players are a dime a dozen; you have one in your pocket. The vr headset has two 1st party games and zero otw. There's not even a dedicated vr menu, the sweet spot is tiny and you can't do anything *but* play games on it; no maps, no youtube, no 3d movies etc. I should've waited to pick it up at $300 instead of paying all the money for the launch bundle.

Xbox announcing a PS5 port of their next big ""console exclusive"" four months out from when it launches, and then putting that out not even half a year afterwards is a massive difference. If this was a PlayStation game they would've at least stretched it out to a year before letting it go"

With physical copy you can run it for years. 
With cloud you cannot if they remove it or you stop paying subscription fees. 

After some time sum of subscription fees becomes >>> costly than buying a console itself.

1ex63lq,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,Why do you think Microsoft has spent BILLIONS acquiring game companies? The money is in owning the games. Consoles make no money other than subscriptions.

If Microsoft wants me to support Microsoft, then they should do things that make me confident in the Xbox brand. Instead, they're constantly having conversations about how they're not sure what to do with the Xbox brand and questioning its future. I spend hundreds to thousands of dollars a year on video games. I'm not spending that money in an ecosystem that has so much uncertainty attached to it. 

Will I buy/play games from Xbox studios on my PC? Absolutely, and I'll continue to be a game pass subscriber, as well. But I'm not committing more money into the Xbox ecosystem out of some sense of ""brand loyalty"" when Microsoft themselves are so wishy washy about committing to Xbox.

They need game sales on platforms that they cannot put game pass on. If they were doing great and didn't need money, then why did they recently increase the price of game pass to $240/year?

That’s why you’ve seen the price increase massively and it is specifically increasing again due to adding Call of Duty. 

You’ll see it continue to increase in price if Xbox gets more big games on it. Don’t worry though, Xbox hardly makes any big games so it will probably not get another price increase for awhile"
1ex63lq,2024-08-20,2024-08-21,"I agree with you sorta. It’s kinda weird seeing more and more games go to ps.not sure if it makes it better or worse but it seems like maybe the ones that are going to go to ps might be timed release. like 5 months after day 1..so I think people who deal with big FOMO or content creators looking for there next stream or video will either get Xbox or pc so they can be “first” .. I still think there is reasons for Xbox though like if that where all your friends play, or you have a big library of bough games. My library is 15 years worth of games so I wouldn’t want to lose those/ leave Xbox unless I have to"
1ex63lq,2024-08-20,2024-08-21,"After that when Sony realizes there is no longer a real competition they will increase console prices, increase Plus prices and game prices. Because that is also logical. 

If there is no other cheaper way to play these games and you are forced to buy PS and games there - you can pay more."
1ex63lq,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,Well tell that to Microsoft then and ask them how much they’re making on these ‘console selling’ exclusives. They’re making *so much* they feel the need to port to other consoles.
1ex63lq,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"> It’s $240+ a year. That means they’d have to release at least 3 AAA games that you personally would’ve bought otherwise every year.

Or you could use your brain and… cancel the subscription when there isn’t something you want to play. lol. 

Also even if you don’t use Gamepass, you still have to pay for online… which you conveniently didn’t mention.

But sure, it’s such a better value to pay $70 for a game that I finished three months ago for like $15."
1ex63lq,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"If you're into any sport, there's one game now you theoretically only need one other AAA game. But like if you play more than three games a year it's easily worth it. There have been tons of smaller amazing games on there."

1ex63lq,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,Yep. Last 3 games I played and beat were long and I spent $40 on them combined and it took me 4 months. I saved $40 right there alone
1ex63lq,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,It's free a year if you do Microsoft rewards. And really it's only 60 dollars a year when you consider you'll be buying xbox live to play online anyways and gamepass is only an additional 5 dollars a month

1ex63lq,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"I’m afraid it is. 

Video game consoles exist as an easy and cheap route into gaming which the vast majority of people prefer over buying expensive and complicated PCs that they have to build out themselves usually. 

Video game consoles are inherently subsidized machines because of sales volume and exclusive software. 

Classically they’ve built and sold consoles at a loss or very very low margin because the volume of the sales in addition to attracting software and accessory sales tied to that ecosystem. 

Exclusive games are incredibly important in order to continue this business model and the practice of building cheap, easy-to-use, and powerful consoles for the cost, that are secure and have robust OS’s. 

If you suddenly take away exclusive games then you can no longer subsidize the box. When you can’t subsidize the box and have any exclusivity in software then your sales fall unsustainably and you exit the business. 

Because Microsoft is seemingly going this route it means that what will happen is they will either stop producing Xbox consoles (they may still make controllers), or they will attempt to make very expensive non-subsidized PC gaming machines. Which means you might see a $1000-$2000 Xbox for niche PC players. However, before they do that I think we will see them do one last attempt at hardware with this (confirmed from Phil), Xbox handheld which better be a hybrid for their sake."

But the fact is our traditional part of gaming is dwarfed by the mobile gaming market. A market that services like xcloud can tap into. 

Even if we are just looking at more traditional gaming, services like xcloud gives a cheap in that is unparalleled. Hell if you have a Samsung tv (certain ones) you don’t even need anymore hardware. Just a controller. 

Not everyone can afford to buy a console or a PC. We can argue all day long about better performance, better long term investment, ability to always play, etc etc. but if you don’t have the money, that is irrelevant. 

Maybe you enjoy the occasional game but you don’t have enough time and can’t justify the purchase. 

They are not targeting us with xcloud. Not in a meaningful way.

>Xbox physical releases are often a code on a disc or smart delivery with an older Xbox one copy on disc. That defeats the purpose of getting a physical release. 

This is not true. An Xbox serise disk has as much data on it as any PS5 game, and they both require day 1 downloadable patches. The difference is with XBOX you can choose to download the whole game and not use the disk, which is great when you have a modern connection, as copying off a blueray is stupidly slow.

The only other exception is if you put in a 360 disk, which it then downloads the serise/xbox one version."

Also, I didn't mention price, just that there're considerably more choices for a pc than consoles. PCs are usually more expensive, but while admittedly, it's hard to do, you can absolutely get a similarly powered pc for the price of a new Xbox.

Again, I'm annoyed with the lack of effort. You're describing my, and other people's, entire problem with consumerism. People spend $500 every few years to get a new console, meanwhile my $800 pc from 2016 still plays games at high-very high 60+ fps.

It's a waste of money due to laziness, and it's annoying because it directly contributes to anti-consumer ""exclusive"" games. If gaming pcs had more marketshare, we wouldn't even be having this back and forth."

1ex63lq,2024-08-20,2024-08-22,"not saying that its not a problem. But more of a correction on what drives you can use. Although the xbox console is limited on what drives you can use, it is not locked to buying the ones specifically tailored for the Xbox technically. Sony's implementation is more loose on what drives you can use, but may bug you if you use drives slower than 5500 Mb/s (but can technically be ignored). It's less about Sony's method being better than microsofts in this case (because it is), but more about the technicality that you can use other SSDs on the Xbox Series, it's just a smaller pool.


It's similar to how Sony handles Variable Refresh rate, where Microsoft took their own implementation of AMD's freesync over HDMI, so it only looks for monitors with Freesync/adaptive sync availability, vs Sony's implementation is using the HDMI 2.1 standard for VRR, so monitors with HDMI 2.0 or lower, despite having freesync capability, cannot be used with a playstations implementation of it.

About the Xbox hardware, at some point if they realize it will not sell and cover production expenses - and 3rd party developers stop their support of that platform, there will not be an Xbox hardware anymore. 

I own them both, XSX from premiere and PS5 for 1-1.5 year. 
I purchased XSX to experience some older Xbox games and mainly to ensure I will play Bethesda/Zenimax and later on Activision games. We did not know whether they will become exclusive and future Elder Scrolls being exclusive after you spend billions of dollars is logical. 

Now seeing most of not all of their games will land on PS5 and definitely PS6, there is no sense to own Xbox console. It’s better to sell XSX and buy Switch.

1ex63lq,2024-08-20,2024-12-11,"What big games did Sony have this year? Astrobot? FF16 and FF7Rebirth that aren't first party games, and square have confirmed multiplarform from day 1 going forward?"
1ex63lq,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"But that's why I made the comment, you know? Maybe my comment broke down the last piece stopping that person from buying a gaming PC. Maybe they never considered the things I said, and I genuinely changed their view (or at least planted the seed).

More gaming pcs = more pc marketshare = more devs moving away from exclusivity.

And less exclusives means more games for me. (And everyone, but mostly me.)"
1ex63lq,2024-08-20,2024-08-21,"The Wii was a fun family console, it was literally a party console. The controllers were good for it's intended purpose (Wii Sports and the like) 

If you were playing it as a singleplayer console then IMO you were playing it wrong."
1ex63lq,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"The Wii remote was great for kids and old people, that literally just reinforces my point."
1ex63lq,2024-08-20,2024-08-21,"It clarifies nothing. I am aware how corporations work. Microsoft fiscally reports on Microsoft’s profitability and only reports on revenue from their divisions (you can Google their earnings reports to see for yourself). So when we say Xbox is part of a multi-trillion dollar company, it’s partially because we don’t know the granular finances of a division like Xbox.

Furthermore, in the latest earnings report Xbox revenue was up significantly and only slightly dipped when excluding the ATVI addition. So the very original point OP was trying to make where I jumped in is Xbox doesn’t care about console sales anymore (which is true considering in earnings reports for a while now the division has generally focused on service & software wins) and the main reason they can afford to pivot away from console sales is because of the treasure trove of Microsoft wealth they can tap into to acquire companies like ATVI. The semantics of how we label Xbox within Microsoft truly don’t matter in this regard."
1ex63lq,2024-08-20,2024-08-21,"Um the fact is Microsoft is the parent company of Xbox which makes Xbox, uh, Microsoft?

Still have no idea what point you’re trying to make."
1ex63lq,2024-08-20,2024-08-21,Yeah it would never actually happen but Microsoft literally does have the assets to be capable of buying Sony. That’s the irony of whoever said they can’t afford it
1ex63lq,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,I'm right there too. Will probably buy another Xbox if I need to
1ex63lq,2024-08-20,2024-08-20,"You’re fine to enjoy staying on Xbox, I literally have no problem with that and maybe you need to go back to school as your reading comprehension skills aren’t on par with a 3rd grader. 

I’m just telling you facts, the reasons you listed aren’t valid reasons as to why people will stay on Xbox till the end of time lol. Why not reinforce your pointless comment with a disclaimer saying “I just like Xbox, I’m not trying to convince anyone else that these are reasons to buy one for themselves”"
1ex63lq,2024-08-20,2024-08-21,I don't think a single person said you can't enjoy playing games on your preferred console. All anyone is doing is pointing out that a particular console brand seems to be dieing.
1ex63lq,2024-08-20,2024-08-21,">That’s YoY Q4 growth, which compares Q4 2023 to Q4 2024, not the entire fiscal year of 2023 compared to fiscal year 2024.

That's what ""year over year"" means... Smh.

""Devices revenue decreased 11% (down 9% in constant currency)""

Reading is hard huh buddy?"

1ex63lq,2024-08-20,2024-12-12,"Astrobot is literally a first party title, and Square was never first party. They were thrid party exclusives. And sure, they aren't made by Sony, but the only place to play them was on a Playstation, and all of them are all goty contenders. 

My point is mainly being there's just better shit to play on ps almost every year. And sure, all those games getting pc releases and all, but still, like I said before, most people don't want to wait 1-2 years for games they really want. 

Sony literally has objectively one of the best track records out of all publishers. Pc is still out of reach for alot of people. So no it's not just buy a pc or build a pc for most."

Are you trying to bring up console revenue now rather than total gaming revenue like it’s going to help your argument? "
1ex63lq,2024-08-20,2024-08-21,There absolutely is not hundreds of games worth playing in it for everyone. Its only good value if you game like 20+ hours a week
1ex63lq,2024-08-20,2024-12-12,Nintendo has a significantly better track record then Sony. Sony also aren't releasing enough games anymore. It's not the PS2 era. My ps5 is litterally a dust collection machine

1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-10,Aren't there tons of tweaks you can make to enemy difficulty?
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-15,"I have it on the easiest setting and this by FAR the most difficult game I have ever played and I have played virtually any game you can think of at least to some degree going all the way back to the NES. There are enemies all over the place and the moment you are seen, immediately between ten to twenty guys with full automatics and clubs surround you and within two hits you are dead. The very least they could have done was attempted to capture the tone of the movies. This is the exact opposite with having to perpetually be stuck in all out war with giant battles. That is NOT how Indiana Jones should be. And what is the point of disguises that don’t fool ANYONE. You get immediately attacked the moment anyone sees you. The disguises are completely pointless. And it’s trying to be a first person combat shooter without giving you an actual gun besides the useless five round revolver that’s insanely complicated to reload with all three bullets they provide. Indiana Jones SHOULD be a stealth and  puzzle based game. "
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-18,Not sure if you guys are playing the same game as me. Takes about 8 punches and by that time 15 other nazis are after me and kill me. All this on easy mode.
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-17,"Easy? Feels weird to say this, when it's later pretty hard to get ""cought"". Which gets pretty annoying since you suck at shooting and reloading in this game. Calling it easy is pretty annoying."
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-18,[removed]
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-10,It is too easy but combat isn’t the focus of the game. It’s more like Hitman. If you don’t enjoy the immersive sim elements and are disappointed with combat then you’re probably not going to enjoy this game.
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-10,"When you have to run back to an area for something you missed and have to sneak past 20 people, it's nice to be able to just knock them all out instead imo"
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-10,"It gets harder in the last big area, more guards with guns and armoured enemies and big boys."
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-25,I'm playing on easy and I find this game to be very hard. I've died countless times. I don't know what ur talking about easy.
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-10,"Were there fights where Indy trades a ton of punches with his adversaries in the films? I must have missed them.

I don't think it's supposed to be a game about combat. You're supposed to try to avoid it. And it's easy to get overwhelmed if you attract too much attention. 

That said, you could try the highest difficulty (Very Hard) before posting to Reddit about it not being hard enough."
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-10,"Some enemies take a lot of punishment. If you are using the improvised weapons sure you can wack most guys a few times and they are out but the weapon breaks after a few hits. Ammo is scarce and attracts attention so you really don’t want to use guns.

Also it’s easy to get overwhelmed if you don’t stealth past certain areas and you will end up dead."
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-10,I suppose combat isn't the main focus but having no consequences does sound boring
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-10,"It does get abit more harder.im not that far in I don’t think,but you eventually run into guard dogs and military officers who will see through your disguises. More guards using guns instead of boxing.depending on the area your at if you ruin your stealth you can have like 20 guards after you.not sure if it gets even more harder then that as I don’t think im to far into the game yet"
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-14,Not me literally stuck in a boss fight because I can't win at fights 😅
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-19,pro gamer moment
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-29,It wasnt as easy as i expected this game to be tbh
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-10,"It's a game based on a major franchise from decades ago.

They want everyone to be able to enjoy it no question.   hold forward and win."
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-10,I haven’t finished it yet but I tend to agree with you
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2025-01-04,"Showoff.


/s"
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-10,Im already on hard mode. Those are all maxed out. Still the guards go down in three punches.
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-10,Yes and it also increases the number of enemies that you encounter
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-20,"You gotta be kidding. I really like this game but there's no fucking way you actually believe this is ""the hardest game you've ever played"" if you have actually ""played virtually any game you can think of"".

You can like the game and defend it without making up absolute nonsense."
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-15,"I totaly agree with you. When you're killed, enemies respaw even if you've killed them. It's a shame."
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-15,"learn to play, this game is laffable easy, still fun tho."
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-23,"Same for me. It takes three punches to knock me out, about 10-20 to knock down any enemy, and Indy gets gassed after throwing three punches or blocking three punches. Enemies seem to have no stamina bar and keep throwing relentless numbers of punches and I can parry and get a few swings in before I'm out of stamina and they're not getting staggered by my swings anymore, and just punch through me and knock me out."
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-18,I was on the second level of the game so maybe that’s why?
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-26,"Played on hard and that never happened unless someone seen me hot another guy, I would knock out  guys 8 feet from one another and they would never hear it, which was comical, and I rarely ever used guns that does alert everyone."
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-26,Game was WAAAAAY to easy dude.
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-20,God awful is being nice
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-10,Yep that’s me. Huge Indy fan too so it’s a bummer the game didn’t click. And I’d liken it more to Dishonored without the powers than I would Hitman.
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-17,I also just think the combat is overall trash.
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-10,In Raiders of the Loat Arc the big guy near the experimental flying wing is a tough fight and Indy wins by tricking him into getting chopped up by the prop. There are enemies in the game that aren’t pushovers.
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-15,"And if you died, enemies respaw even if you kiled them. Take Voos's gold is a nightmare. I don't understand some who said the game is too easy"
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-14,"Yeah bro like what, I’m here for help to beat the guy in the first fight like come on.. gave this guy 20 punches and he still kicks my ass in three punches..

Edit: made it through the scene, shot him with the revolver:)"

And there is nothing wrong with that you just need to accept the reality. Work yourself and enjoy the game dig deep and explore like indiana jones and learn to take game at ease.

You get killed with two punches or a bullet, but to kill them you have to fire with your gun four or five times."

1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-26,Get more books and load up on nazi money if you get all items in the vatican it makes the game even easier.
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-25,"So, does it get harder OP? Because the first level is as easy as it gets and I just bash people over the head with stuff."
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-20,Lmaooooooo
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2025-01-03,"Its not a hard Game, when you Go by the book. I get it, that its an Indiana Simulator, but a bit more *pow pow* wouldnt hurt in the situation that i talked about above."
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-16,Yeah I love the franchise but this game bores me to tears
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-10,"Yeah it’s a mix of all three but the game’s combat sandbox isn’t as strong as Hitman for sure. 

I’m not a huge Indy fan but I loved this game. I enjoyed the exploration, story and puzzles. Combat is laughably easy but it is so amusing lol. Thwacking Nazis with a dustpan or a guitar and pushing them off ledges is so satisfying. The game isn’t long enough for this to become monotonous and an annoyance imo."
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-13,"I just watched the movie last night, and that was no trick. He was getting his ass handed to him, and the rotating plane took care of the rest"
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-24,Yes I’m trying to get Voss’ gold right now it’s awful. Hardest part so far by a mile.
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-26,I beat it on the hardest difficulty and thought it was to easy some games just click for some people I guess.
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-24,Are you ok? What are you on about?
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2025-02-06,lol wut
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-15,Exactly. There are guards EVERYWHERE and they swarm you and you can shoot them repeatedly in the face and they still keep attacking you. Yet two hits from them and you’re dead. 
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-24,Stop repeating yourself. Souls games are getting old and you have said the same thing in 4 posts
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-26,"Just get the disguises then enemies will never attack you, just look out for captains, but this game is seriously way to easy. I had fun tho didn't like the last open world level very buggy, short, slow and annoying still worth it."
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-25,It sounds like (from other people) it gets harder. I’m waiting for a performance update to come so that I can maybe play with Ultra settings with some level of Ray Tracing. But if that’s not in the next update I’m just going to play anyway
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-26,"Nazi shotgunners have body armor, bigger guys take more hits and same with guys with helmets, I got all books to make indy stronger and faster and it never seemed to work at all except carrying more food and bandages. I played on hard and it was ridiculously easy I'd knock out guys a few feet from one another and they would never hear it, puzzles are easy hardest thing about the game was some of the chest passwords I'm bummed I already beat it I did have fun except everything was pretty obvious like walls that break, trap floors and other traps lol and Gina never stops yapping and berating indy."
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-10,I have two non-gameplay gripes that drive me crazy. 1st no option to turn off the white dot. Like are you kidding me? Then second how almost every door you have to press one button then wait a second and press another button to open it. Drove me crazy.
1hav87a,2024-12-10,2024-12-19,"Yeah in at the Ziggurath and just gave up because there are so many soldiers and too few weapons. Can't even find bullets for my own weapon, found 4 and takes at least 2 to kill one soldier and hitting them with objects barely makes a difference. And I'm playing on easy. I think their difficulty levels are broken and doesn't work how it should. "

1hkkkw6,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"You wanna talk cool print ads? How bout the one they handed out for the original Assassin’s Creed at gaming conventions. You are greeted by an all white page with one neat little bit of blood spatter accompanied by the text “The first one is always the hardest”. 

On the backside is your usual screenshot and protagonist collage encouraging you to pre-order the game. But it’s obvious there’s more to it because you can feel that it’s thicker than a normal flyer. 

As you separate the pages, you hear and feel the tearing of paper and as you continue, it slowly dawns on you what’s happening. On the left page you find a decapitated head and on the right is the headless body. 

Right above the bloody neck stump is the text “Congratulations on your first kill”.

Was such a satisfyingly visceral experience."

1hkkkw6,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"With the momentum of Great Circle I’d really love some sort of Indy Collection. Greatest Adventures, Infernal Machine, and Emperors Tomb are three I’d love to play on current systems"

Also my wasteland 1 book that actually contained the text for the quests."

Like you control Indy with wasd and the camera with arrow keys. Also, have I mentioned that you unholster your weapon with space, so of course you have to jump with alt and shoot with ctrl, because again, no analog anything, so don’t bother using the mouse.

Kid me did not bat an eye at this configuration and proceeded to play the entire game without even thinking that this would probably make way more sense on a gamepad."
1hkkkw6,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Your right?! It wasn't even on N64 I don't think? It was leaked basically complete, but never actually released for N64? Edit: I'm Australian and I don't think it appeared in Aus for the N64."
1hkkkw6,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,The hat with the negative connotation is actually called the trilby. Most people just call it a fedora because of their similar looks and the fact that no body actually needs to know the proper name of more than three types of hat.
1hkkkw6,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Correct - Infernal Machine only made it to N64 in the States for some reason.
1hkkkw6,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,I was watching some YouTube video about it. Didn’t it end up getting content cut but certain bugs were fixed? The PC version had a monkey island Easter egg iirc.

1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"At least it isn't a looter-shooter with a battlepass, I guess? Idk, I get that you basically have to already be working on the DLC to justify making it, but announcing it just seems trashy. It seems like it would make people less likely to buy a game too."
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"More like: ""if you invest in this game and you enjoy it, just know there’s more content coming"".

Almost all games with DLC start production on the DLC long before the game is released, whether they tell you or not. Game development takes years.

Otherwise, we get a Elden Ring situation where there’s a gap of several years between the game and the DLC."
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"It's a standalone story, and the base game is also a standalone story, it's not cut from the base game ever"
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Games have been doing this for years since like mw2/360/ps3days only difference is now they tell you beforehand. I promise you alot of games during development most of these things are pre planned. Not sure why gamers act like this is something new
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Well stop buying games altogether then, I guess?

Almost all AAA games start developing DLC long before the games are released. What do you think Season Passes, which have been releasing with almost every single AAA games for about a decade now, even are?"
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Whats ridiculous about planning to make more stuff?
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Me.
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"People who enjoy first person exploration/ light immersive sim games, and people who enjoy the Indiana Jones IP. I don’t think it’s hard to figure that out at all."
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Not to be rude my man but that was a pretty shitty question.
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Ive had it pre installed for months, so definitely me."
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,planned DLC isnt really a red flag.
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It’ll be on gamespass
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It’s on game pass so you don’t need to spend $70
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,I'll wait for the PS5 version that comes with bug fixes and the DLC.
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,">Otherwise, we get a Elden Ring situation 

How are you using this as an example of anything other than the gold standard for DLC done right"
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,I shouldn’t have to invest or “early back kickstart” a game from Bethesda.
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,">Not sure why gamers act like this is something new

Because people aren't thinking rationally. They decide if they like the actor and then make their decision of the action based on that. 

This sub threw a fit when one game (I think AC shadows) offered the ability to buy the physical merch stuff without buying a copy of the game. Didn't matter that that was an objectively good thing for consumers (more control over what you purchase). People didn't like the game so everything the game did had to be bad."
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Why?  If someone had asked that about Concord would you have thought it was equally as shitty a question?  Because the answer for Concord was almost no one.

Seems relevant to ask who this game is supposed to appeal to if they arent the target audience."
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Day one DLC is trashy, something releasing a few months down the line to continue the appeal of a decent base game is pretty reasonable."
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,DLC doesn’t go to gamepass unfortunately.
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"It's not going to come with the DLC included on PS5 lol, why would it?"
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Whether Elden Ring DLC was good or not is completely irrelevant to the point.

The point is that they started working on the DLC when the game was released, and the DLC came out 2.5 years later. Elden Ring was a massive *massive* success so they could afford this much time between the game and the DLC, but other games can’t wait 2 years. If DLC doesn’t release within 6 to 9 months of the game, people forget the game even exists.

But if your argument is, somehow, ""the DLC is so amazing because they only started working it on after the base game was released""… consider that the Witcher 3’s DLC are considered some of the best DLC of all time… and both of them released within one year of the base game. There’s absolutely no conceivable way that they worked on Blood & Wine for only 1 year."
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,It's good dlc but but theres also nothing wrong with working on it earlier. Which was the point i think
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,What? Buying a game is investing in a company.
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Yeah this isnt a troubled competitive hero shooter that had bad feedback on beta…
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"It's Indiana Jones.. a world-renowned beloved franchise, not some generic soulless EA cash grab.

(Could be a Bethesda cash grab tho)"
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,Comparing Indiana Jones to Concord. You cant be for real right now?
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,This isn't day one dlc
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"It was an investment purchasing daggerfall, knowing the company would grow and improve from there. This is a 7.5 billion dollar company asking to support them and trust they will release a full game eventually for just a little bit more money."
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"How is this NOT an attempt at reviving a dead franchise (that killed itself with its latest movie installment) just as an attempt to make money? Make a new exploration IP inspired by Indiana jones and a lot of people would play it and would probably attract a newer and wider audience.

Those movies fucking suck"
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Because IP cash grabs arent a thing?

""a world-renowned beloved franchise""

Guess you didnt catch those last movies."
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"That was my point...

Something that is finished up and releases a sensible period after release of an already complete base game is a positive thing, this seems to fall in that category."
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"Babe, I’m sorry to tell you, but ""invest"" is also just a synonym for ""buy""."
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,I think this game looks like the most 'true to the source' IJ product since Last Crusade
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-22,"Nah, those movies were fine. Your shitty comment fucking sucks though."
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,That doesn't mean its not a world-renowned beloved franchise.
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-03,"Ah right, my bad"
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"To buy something is to obtain it in exchange for payment. To invest is to put capital in something with expectation of it to increase in value. 


I didn’t invest in my groceries or my pants."
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-22,"You should try kissing me and pretending I’m Indiana jones, maybe I can find your lost temple or raid your arc afterwards? Someone call todd Howard!!!"
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,"The literal definition of invest is: ""devote (one’s time, effort, or energy) to a particular undertaking with the expectation of a worthwhile result; or buy (something) whose usefulness will repay the cost.”

When you say ""I’m investing a lot of time in this dumb Reddit conversation"", does it mean I’m expecting this conversation to increase in value?

Invest in a game = to buy it and except to have fun for many hours.

Same thing for your pants. You *buy* some cheap WalMart pants. You *invest* in a pair of Levi’s hoping you’ll be able to wear them for a few years."
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-22,"Figures that you’re too stupid to spell a three letter word correctly. Embarrassing, though."
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-04,See how your last example is a difference between buy and invest? And how they’re not synonymous babe?
1h5yhuz,2024-12-03,2024-12-22,"Sorry I didn’t realise I was talking to the real Indiana jones, you look shorter than I remember though."

1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-01-23,Because consoles exist
1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-01-23,"[https://www.vgchartz.com/article/463482/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-was-the-2nd-best-selling-game-in-the-us-in-its-launch-week/](https://www.vgchartz.com/article/463482/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-was-the-2nd-best-selling-game-in-the-us-in-its-launch-week/)

because steam is not the only platform in existance. it also on gamepass and xbox.

game did so well they were given permission to make more. game will also release to playstation which will earn them even more because it will be released togheter with their expansion.

steamcharts in general is a unreliable way to determine succes. it shows how many players are playing the game AT THE SAME TIME. but you know time zones exist, jobs exist, etc.

and since indiana jones had a early access weekend and then got released to everyone on a monday it has drasticly diluted the steamcharts numbers.

you should not use that chart as a accurate depiction on how much it sold."
1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-01-23,"Because it’s on gamepass, and Xbox store for PC, and on Xbox. Steam isn’t the only place to get it."
1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-01-23,The world doesn't revolve around Steam
1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-01-23,"Peak player count is almost completely irrelevant for single player games. As for sales estimates, the game probably didn’t have the inflated ridiculous budget that other AAA games are given, which means the developers don’t have to sell millions of copies to make a profit on sales."
1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-01-23,Game Pass
1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-01-28,That's what happens they force ray tracing on games. Many people didn't even bother to buy it because it's unplayable on older hardwares. Same with Star wars outlaws or Metro Exodus Enhanced edition. The upcoming Doom the Dark Ages might end up the same fate as well.
1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-01-23,"I think it's one of those things where it had a reasonable budget and expectations, which is rare nowadays."
1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-01-23,"Games that are released with Game Pass in mind (I'd bet it's the majority of Microsoft-backed games these days) have different metrics, sales numbers come second. They'll probably measure how many people signed for Game Pass AND played this game right away, probably focusing more on the released window for the game (i.e. this game has brought X new accounts to Game Pass). They'll probably check how many people are playing the game right now via their service, and how many people are sticking through Game Pass after subscribing ""because of Indiana Jones."" It doesn't hurt that the game was a well received, both between gamers and the media."
1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-01-23,"Steam sales are unreliable since it released on Xbox and Game pass, also it's probably one of the more graphically intense games released in the last while so not everyone will be able to play on PC to begin with so no point in buying it on steam.

I think once it releases on PS5 we will see a big influx in sales as I know a few friends who don't have an Xbox or a PC that can run it and will get it once it comes out on PS5."
1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-01-23,Completely dissagree. It's AAA titile. Much more people want to play it on GamePass than other games. So much higher player base was on Gamepass than usual game. Also it has strong marketing directed into consols. I Think thath they kind shoot their own leg with this gamepass however overall A lot of players played it. Even if sales and steam numbers doesn't show that
1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-02-26,"Most probably around 200-300 thousand copies.
The guys at Machine games are saying it sold worse than the Mad Max game from Avalanche. They can't wait for the PS5/Pro release.
If the game doesn't pick up sales machine games are going to ""restructure"".
4 million reached means nothing to be honest."
1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-01-23,"Because the game is awesome, therefore it's a success regardless of sales"
1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-01-23,"Why do you care?

If the company is happy and they are the ones that spent the money...how does that affect you?

It's not a pissing contest. There are no prizes to be had."
1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-01-23,">I am aware that it is on GamePass

Then that should be your answer.  It's a fantastic game, but it's also a game that can be beaten in under 40 hours so there's no reason not to just play it on Gamepass."
1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-01-23,Because it’s on Gamepass
1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-02-03,"Well first of all console players, second of all it's a story game, it's not a pvp or online game, it's not gonna have a consistently high playercount"
1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-01-23,"We don't know how well the game did, but It can't be great if it was 14th in the US in its release month. I doubt it sold massive numbers in Europe and Asia.

Has Microsoft or Bethesda released any player count updates like they did with Starfield?"
1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-01-23,It also looks cheap from budget aspect
1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-01-23,Doesn't help that the game is probably 10 hours for the main story and like 20 ish if you do side missions. So that's naturally going to results in a lower concurrent player count if people finish it quickly
1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-01-23,"That data is completely irrelevant, 2nd in its first week on sale, it's been out for at least a month now, and the permissions talk came from Jez Cordon, known Microsoft shill."
1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-01-23,"While that’s a commonly said take, it is a good indicator of a game’s longevity.  Some single player experiences come and go and are lost to time, but games like Witcher 3 and RDR2 are still seeing great numbers well into their lifecycle.

Sure, no one should expect those games to put up multiplayer game numbers, but maintaining a player count for single player games is damn impressive.  Hades 2 comes out in early access and the original Hades sees a boost in player count.

Context is always good to have when direct comparisons just aren’t relevant."
1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-01-23,"It's really not, every other single-player game that has had high CCUs. This is just another narrative Xbros throw around. Sales don't matter, until they do."
1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-01-28,"I don't know what to believe, people claim that Indiana Jones game is a success, but I am looking on Steam numbers and don't understand where is success."
1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-01-23,"Why would you think that? It's a licensed IP, those never come cheap."
1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-01-25,"Unless you have proof of its actual budget and license feeds, then you got nothing....  there is no way for you to know if the budget was reasonable.

It wasn't clearly cheap to make, though.  Mo-cap, Disney licensed IP, etc etc....."
1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-02-27,Why people talk about success then?
1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-01-23,Because people can be curious.
1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-01-23,"Bingo

People can shat all over Microsoft's offerings - Starfield - the Great Urkel - whatever-title-makes-you-bigmad-at-the-moment - like, fine, I get it, they're shallow and all based on flash... but they've made Microsoft fucking bank through GamePass 

To the point that XBox is becoming more and more a *brand* and less and less a console 

Microsoft is playing the 'console wars' on a different front than the other two members of the big three - they want their titles (and, more importantly, their service) on ***everything***

Not quite unlike how Netflix blew up back in the day 

It didn't have the *best* service or even the *most* offerings - ***but you could use it anywhere***

Convenience often beats performance"
1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-02-03,It had a magnitude less peak players than Veilguard that is considered a flop.
1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-01-25,"People down-voting you for calling how it is, sad really..... 

The only thing that we got so far in terms of sales is US December 2024 sales.  And like you said it debut at 14th, which isn't bad, but it isn't great either, especially for a brand new game with high meta score released on both Xbox and PC."
1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-01-23,"true, indiana jones is supposed to be a movielike experience which is a one and done deal.

they made a better indiana movie than most of the actual indiana jones movies"
1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-01-23,"sure but those are open world games where you can do alot more things and hades 2 is created with replayability in mind.

indiana jones is just supposed to be a movielike experience that's basicly a one and done deal. singleplayers games do not HAVE to retain players, they just have to entertain the players."
1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-01-24,Indiana Jones is nearly a dead IP. They likely got it on the cheap. Apparently Todd Howard wanted to make an Indian Jones game for a long time but the price was never right until now.
1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-02-04,"Yeah but you're only looking at steam, 4 million+ have played the game so far, obviously steam is the smallest portion of that"
1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-01-23,"Not a hard achievement - there's like... two unqualified *good movies* and, like, *bits* of Temple of Doom that people can tolerate if they're on YouTube and it pops up a meme compilation??? xD

Also, it does a good job explaining why Marian broke off with Indy and just gave up trying to connect with him - like, we *already knew* Indy was a bit of a selfish douche bag constantly running from personal responsibility - but it's still fun to see that knowledge fleshed out"
1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-01-23,Woosh
1i8211w,2025-01-23,2025-02-04,"Yea, the problem is that ""have played"" is not the same as ""have bought"""
1hq0agu,2024-12-30,2024-12-31,"The praise is definitely exaggerated.

I found it so far to be a decent game but it lacks *many* idiosyncracies of other Bethesda games.

A lot of it seems to want to be an Arkane game, but it plays nothing like any Arkane game. For instance the picking up bodies mechanic is literally useless and pointless - there's no box to shove them in or anything. You bottom out on stamina instantly when trying to carry bodies. Why does the game have quarter baked stealth mechanics if it's not a stealth game?

The AI will chase you but as long as you can hide for 5 seconds in the dark they will completely bugger off.

It's made by MG who is great at first person shooters, but shooting in the game is usually the worst thing you can ever do. The shooting is also clunked out and you can't even use iron sights.

Many of the puzzles, so far, to me, seem dumb. I hope they get better but the Jesus wine blood puzzle was nonsensical for instance, the little white puzzle box thing in the Vatican was also silly. Hopefully it will get better."
1hq0agu,2024-12-30,2024-12-30,"I also found the NPCs annoying, not their characters but mostly the fact that they wouldn't shut up trying to give me hints. They really need to add a ""Hard"" adventure difficulty as a way to disable this.

1. The combat is a pretty standard light/heavy/parry/dodge system. You were never supposed to run around gunning everyone down or sniping them from the shadows. Have you seen an Indiana Jones movie before? They absolutely nailed it.

2. I really don't share this experience. Wasn't the white paint splashed everywhere obvious enough? Maybe they needed to make it yellow so you could see it. If anything, it was almost always *too* obvious. My only complaint on these grounds is that some of the collectibles are damn near impossible to see, especially the tarot cards.  

3. The stealth system is hit or miss. Some areas are so dense with enemies that you can't really do anything and your only option is to obtain a disguise at which point it usually becomes overly trivial. That said, I had enough satisfying moments both sneaking up on enemies and taking them down silently and also being caught at the last moment and forced to throw a frying pan at the unsuspecting fascist.

You didn't mention the exploration, the gorgeous world, the puzzles, the story, the characters, the quality of the acting or how authentic it is to the original Indiana Jones movies. Those are the qualities that people like me loved in the game. If you want a stealth combat game, there are plenty of options. If you want to BE Indiana Jones then you have this incredible game."
1hq0agu,2024-12-30,2025-01-09,"I’m with you 100%. If it wasn’t based on famous IP, it would be mid at best. The voice acting was incredible and damn if it didn’t really seem like Harrison Ford a lot of the time, but that cut scene novelty was the main draw. 

And wow, there are almost 4 hours of cut scenes. This is basically a CGI Indiana Jones movie with some light puzzles and exploring in between. 

I’m especially confused by the overall gameplay and share your “is this what people find fun?” incredulity. The “dungeons” were extremely linear - there’s only ever one way to do anything and you just have to poke around to find it. And your abilities and ways you can interact with the environment are seemingly random. Sometimes you can climb vines, but not usually, sometimes you can climb on ledges, but only specific ones, sometimes you can attach your whip to things, but only designated spots. 

And the “open world” is hardly open. You can only interact with a smattering of objects and there’s no gear to upgrade or collect, and few cool abilities to acquire. This may be true to the movies - obviously Indy doesn’t grow or learn or upgrade anything in a movie - but it’s boring gameplay.  

Finally, the lack of manual saving was frustrating especially with such large open world areas. Several times I got trapped or stuck or bored and wanted to revert back to an earlier point, and there’s no way to fast travel (except at designated spots) or reboot from a saved spot. 

The graphics are gorgeous, but pretty pictures aren’t why I play games. Maybe that’s a big draw for people now, but I’ll take better mechanics over better graphics every time."
1hq0agu,2024-12-30,2024-12-30,"For me it was a decent once only play through, would I buy the next installment certainly would, there have the knowledge now to improve on all the things that were a miss"
1hq0agu,2024-12-30,2024-12-31,"I cant stand Nikki or whatever her name is.  ""Hey! I think this is what you want! Hey! Hey! Hey! Do this!!! Right now!""  She ruins the immersion, the atmosphere, and the puzzles when shes around."
1hq0agu,2024-12-30,2024-12-30,"I agree. I kept seeing all the hype about how amazing the story was and how great it looks so I caved and bought it. It turns out it's just a really basic Immersive Sim like Dishonored but without any of the Immersion or any of the interesting stuff like the powers or the world setting.

One thing that pisses me off, and it's *really* petty, is that the puzzles are so 'videogamey'. Why would the guys who hid the temples under the Vatican include multiple metal rings on chains that can only be pulled, handily, by a guy with a whip. It's really lazy design."
1hq0agu,2024-12-30,2024-12-30,"I couldn't finish it, I found the gameplay was boring with terrible repetitive, clunky combat, really bad stealth and the puzzles weren't great."
1hq0agu,2024-12-30,2024-12-31,"I have not finished but it’s a great story with compelling characters and utterly convincing dialogue. Downright impressive graphics with a plot that keeps me pushing forward.

The gameplay loop is simple but the world and story are so engrossing that I don’t mind or even notice most the time.

Not every game needs complicated leveling systems or sophisticated combat. If you need those things, this game is not for you. That simple really.

If a playable Indiana Jones movie sounds good then this is for you."
1hq0agu,2024-12-30,2024-12-30,"Prepare for your downvotes, don't you know it's illegal to say anything negative about this game?

Having said that I agree with you completely, it was a gorgeous looking game that was just alright to play through. I died in 1 of the big set pieces about 5 or 6 times because I kept missing the path you were meant to take because the pillar was falling outside of my line of sight.

The areas got progressively worse as the game went on and while it felt like it belonged with the original trilogy there were 2 sections that felt completely out of place for indiana jones. 

The final level itself also felt straight up like generic video game mission and not like an indiana jones experience (until the final showdown section) which really didn't work as a proper experience because of how clunky combat is."
1hq0agu,2024-12-30,2024-12-30,"Agree with 1 and 3, and 2 partially (I got lost on the boat ride and also changing planes because I wasn't sure what the game was asking me to do). It actually reminded me of Star Wars Outlaws a lot which got dragged across the coals when it released.

Instead of an instant fail with stealth everyone gets alerted so you just funnel them all somewhere and swing away (I would sometimes just let myself die to have another go). I saw a few posts of people with a pile of corpses in one location so I know it wasn't just me. You also can't carry weapons up ladders in this game. 

Clearing out a camp and then coming back 5 minutes later to see it fully reset with the exact same enemy placement also felt a bit weird.

I enjoyed the game and did all of the side stories but am still a bit bemused by the overly strong positive reaction. If it was an unknown IP I might not have spent as much time with it, hearing the iconic music pick up quickly made me forget my complaints."
1hq0agu,2024-12-30,2025-01-08,"overall agree. It feels very clunky, just feels like I am playing in slow motion and the combat overall is ok, but I don't understand the crazy praise its been getting. I prefer a game that feels much more fluid."
1hq0agu,2024-12-30,2025-01-14,"It bothers me the most when you want to unlock the door with a key, you have to press ""D"" and he rotate the key in RIGHT side, but it should be ""A"" and to the LEFT, it all depends where the knob and lock is.  
Sorry for my inglis and my OCD"
1hq0agu,2024-12-30,2025-01-14,"For me this is also just a weird game. 

I rather have a new wolvenstein tbh. This melee combat feels bad, half of the time the parrys dont even work and I expected way more from the whip. 

Not being able to aim down sight is also just really weird. It feels cheap and why even bother with guns anyway as two hits from a stick does the same amount of damage as 2 bullets. 

Also the third person view when you go climbing or swinging just puts you out of the moment. 

Idk this game has some weird decisions going on."
1hq0agu,2024-12-30,2024-12-30,"Dude, the game is incredibly immersive. The stealth isn't supposed to be like Metal Gear Solid or Dishonored, because Indie isn't Solid Snake or Corvo or Empress Emily. The combat isn't like a straight up action game, because Indie isn't Dante. He isn't a master swordsman capable of stringing together complex combos or a skilled martial artist who knows multiple fighting styles. He's a brawler, he is scrappy and resourceful and uses whatever happens to be nearby.

""Is the goal just to learn the game's combat, stealth and other systems well enough to be able to exploit them?""

Um, yes. It's called player freedom. Trusting the player to figure out what to do next without holding your hand the entire time. And don't pretend that the puzzles involve no problem solving.

It feels like your complaints boil down to ""I'm not into this kind of game and don't understand why others are."""
1hq0agu,2024-12-30,2024-12-30,I thought the hand to hand combat was incredible if you know what you’re doing. I never got sick of it in my 40 hours
1hq0agu,2024-12-30,2024-12-30,"I haven't played the game myself, but from everything I've seen pre- and post-release, those are some of the things that made the game unappealing to me.  Other things I don't like include the way materials move. Indie's jacket looks weird on his body, it moves weird too. First-person with switches to thrid-person, smh. The game looks janky as hell."
1hq0agu,2024-12-30,2025-01-08,Stealth and hiding bodies just give so much Dishonored vibes. Dishonored nailed it.
1hq0agu,2024-12-30,2024-12-31,"That's something I fail to mention, the body hiding mechanic is utterly pointless.

I found myself hiding bodies at the start of the game, it was only later I realised there's actually no urgency if somebody stumbles across 1 that I stopped hiding them.

Nobody shows up guns blazing, they just look for your briefly then give up and even then by the time they find it you're long gone because their paths so rarely cross each other."
1hq0agu,2024-12-30,2024-12-31,"Yeah i'm not sure I really agree with any of the criticisms at all. It's possible OP was looking for a shooter to play or something I guess? But it wasn't what this was ever supposed to be, and they nailed what it is. The combat system is pretty standard but honestly it's so chunky and satisfying and well animated I think it's great, throw in some whip stuns/disarms and all the different ways to approach stealth, and it's great. I especially love how Indiana Jones it feels when you do alert an enemy or two and instead of just spam machine-gunning them down like most games you scramble around and whip a bottle at their face or grab a shovel and bonk em 😂I think the stealth was OK overall, I can't think of many games that have done it meaningfully better I suppose. I also love and think it's so funny that they did away with a single repetitive takedown animation and instead if you hit them from behind in stealth your weapon just becomes that, and it doesn't matter what it is it doesn't alert enemies (i.e. cracking a glass over their head lol!). Somehow just worked great in this game and felt so Indiana Jones.

I agree about the guidance as well. It was always crystal clear exactly where to go about 99% of the time IMO, there was one spot i got confused at but it was because i had tried to climb a vine and it didn't work (i aimed too high originally i think), so i spent a while trying to figure it out, but then got it the second time. I think their marking was generally good, but I wish on the harder exploration difficulties they would make the NPCs stop talking, as you say, they sometimes gave hints as to what to do that I didn't really want (it never actually helped me i was already figuring it out, but either way) but mostly they just wouldn't shut up on a few occasions when waiting for you hahaha. Like every 3-5 seconds repeating the same damn lines. I'm lookin for secrets just chill for a second man!!! I don't even think for this last one it should be tied to difficulty (a harder to navigate hard mode would be fun tho!), they just gotta turn them down 😆

Overall I think it's honestly my GOTY, I just had an absolute blast playing it, and while I loved the tomb raider games a LOT, this feels like an even better version of it for me, and the cutscenes/story etc. were such a pleasure to watch, too. Also, Troy Baker's Indy was so much better than I ever would have thought, I don't think even once did I feel weird or out of place because of it. Lastly, it is an absolutely GORGEOUS game on PC, and I was extremely pleased with how polished it was and how nice it ran given the settings I used. I'm really excited for more going forward, it's very clear it's a very talented studio, using a great engine, that absolutely adores and cherishes the source material. Very excited to see what they do next!"
1hq0agu,2024-12-30,2024-12-31,"Yes, that's what I meant about the NPC's. Their characters were fine for the most part. 

I'm not even sure how much combat should be in this game. I get there has to be some to keep people happy, but in the movies, if Indy can't win a fight with a couple of haymakers, he's got to think of something else that usually involves his wits, luck, allies, or as an absolute last resort, his revolver. Indy isn't trained in combat, he's an archaeologist, and is not going to go round for round, dodging and parrying blows with some muscled-up Nazi who is. If they were going to do combat, it'd been cool if they had come up with something a little more creative, like disarming people with his whip, throwing sand in their eyes, cutting down a chandelier, pushing them off a ledge, heck, even the ol' tap on the shoulder nope I'm on the other side gag. Make it fun. 

No, I didn't bother mentioning the good stuff, because that's already been covered extensively by most people talking about the game. Like I said, I enjoyed it, I'm glad I played it, the story captured the spirit of the source material better than the later source material itself. That stuff was all great. But if the game hadn't been Indy, I wouldn't have finished it."
1hq0agu,2024-12-30,2024-12-31,"> Some areas are so dense with enemies that you can't really do anything

I really think the designers had 0 intention of supporting Dishonered-style ghost playthroughs. The game feels like you are absolutely supposed to ""stealth when you can, brawl when you can't"" and if you try to use the same approach (all stealth or all combat) in every situation you're Playing It Wrong."
1hq0agu,2024-12-30,2024-12-30,"Harrison Ford praising Troy Baker shows how good that performance was, because Ford has a long history of just saying whatever he wants and being pretty protective of the Indiana Jones character.

I also think Voss was basically pitch perfect as an Indiana Jones villain. Just the right mix of menacing and goofy/pathetic.

It's an Indiana Jones game that gets the Indiana Jones aspect nearly perfect, while the game part is not bad, but has a bunch of flaws."
1hq0agu,2024-12-30,2025-01-24,Because the chains were meant to be pulled by giants.
1hq0agu,2024-12-30,2025-01-01,">compelling characters and utterly convincing dialogue

I very strongly disagree. I haven't finished the game yet but since the introduction of the woman sidekick at the end of the Vatican level, I find the writing of the dialogues immensely bad. We are here victim of the avengers type of writing once again: everyone is a smartass, their humour's only register is taking jabs at one another and it's absolutely not funny.

I'm not even sure I will continue playing because I'm very driven by the characters writing and this is failing miserably."
1hq0agu,2024-12-30,2025-01-07,"I've gone into it as a playable movie and so far I'm getting exactly what I expected from it. 

having grown up in the 80s I've watched the original 3 movies plenty of times and I think that has helped with my enjoyment too"
1hq0agu,2024-12-30,2025-01-09,"Yeah I never would’ve played this if it wasn’t Indiana Jones and I would expect it would be mostly ignored if not for the famous IP. 

Most of the praise amounts to “it feels so much like playing one of the movies!” rather than “I really enjoyed the actual gameplay in these specific ways”. 

As an Indy fan, I enjoyed the ride, but I kinda wish I’d just watched a supercut of the 4+ hours of cutscenes."
1hq0agu,2024-12-30,2024-12-31,"I haven't played MGS or Dishonored, but I've played the entire Uncharted series extensively. Nathan Drake is a modern day Indiana Jones. The open world exploration of Uncharted 4 is leaps and bounds better than Indiana Jones. I am playing Indiana Jones currently and I just can't really get a good grip on the main story when I am constantly finding offshoots of other quests and random tasks.  Case in point, I got a prompt to take the priest's picture and then overheard the conversation between two nuns that the picture was for. This has happened at least a handful of times over my 4 hours of gameplay. The game is overall enjoyable, but it has significant jankiness that keeps me from really wanting to play it more."
1hq0agu,2024-12-30,2025-01-15,"This argument doesn't hold up. Just because a character isn’t a master swordsman, martial artist, or stealth expert doesn’t mean the gameplay has to feel uninspired or poorly executed. Indiana Jones is a brawler, sure, but in the movies, his fights are, clever, and engaging. In the game, while the ability to pick up objects to fight adds some flavour, it quickly becomes repetitive. After the first few encounters, I found myself bored. A good game should present challenges that keep players engaged—not just systems to go through the motions.

The stealth is even worse. There’s a mechanic for hiding bodies, but it doesn’t seem to have any real purpose. Worse, there’s little incentive to use stealth at all, at least in the first few hours I’ve played. If these mechanics are going to be included as core gameplay elements, they need to feel meaningful and well-designed, which they aren't.

Being dropped into hub-style levels to collect medicine bottles for pamphlets feels neither interesting nor engaging. I play games to escape, not to feel like I’ve clocked in for another shift. This trend of injecting busy work into games—endless fetch quests and checklist objectives—detracts from the experience rather than enriching it. Instead of adding depth to the world, it makes the game feel like a chore. 

I also don't think this would be getting 1/2 the praise it is if it wasn't an Indiana Jones game."
1hq0agu,2024-12-30,2024-12-31,">Overall I think it's honestly my GOTY

I think I agree. I've played some incredible games that I'd rank above it but those were all released in previous years. This year, Balatro would be closest but honestly, Indy is on a tier above for me.

Anyone can sit and poke holes in the game like the developers who criticized Elden Ring for its UI but taking the game as a whole experience, they set out to make an Indiana Jones game and they absolutely nailed it.

I'd have to give it a 10/10, not because it's perfect (because it isn't) but simply because it is the pinnacle of what it's trying to achieve and I think we'd all be hard pressed to find a fan of Indiana Jones that doesn't love this game."
1hq0agu,2024-12-30,2024-12-31,"Combat wise you suggested 2 things that are possible.

Disarming enemies with the whip and pushing them off ledges, in fact I'm near sure there are achievements for both."
1hq0agu,2024-12-30,2025-01-11,"Have you seen the movies? The characters are always quippy, it’s part of the charm."
1hq0agu,2024-12-30,2024-12-31,"Yeah exactly. I might even say Shadow of the Erdtree is the best thing i've played this year, but my game of the year and the thing I did have the most fun with, was still Indy. Even if that's hard to explain lol! It was just... so fucking good. The world, the way exploration was done, how the progression and unlocks happened, the ability to flip back and complete old sections, the chunky and improvised melee combat, the tombs/puzzles i could explore for ages. It was just incredible.

I also just played Balatro for the first time a couple days ago! I'm lucky to not have an addictive personality and it hasn't had it's hooks in me in that way, but it is fucking awesome and so simple/innovative, yet very deep as well."
1hq0agu,2024-12-30,2024-12-31,"That's fair, I didn't know that and I'm not going to pretend like I did or blame the game for not telling me, it probably did. I don't feel like those kinds of dynamics were central to the combat, though, it felt like it was just a slugfest to me.

Edit: I still have stuff left to do in the game, maybe I'll load it up sometime and try those."
1hq0agu,2024-12-30,2024-12-31,"Disarming is largely useless, at least I found it to be. It's was usually more effective to just charge and start swinging.

Like wise shoving people off ledges was mostly a case of if the situation presented itself."

I just had to continue the main story missions and some side missions too. Things like the Sewers and the Museum, all had locations that I couldn't access before progressing missions.  

Indy will actually say out loud something like ""Better check if there's anything else before heading to..."" Which means you're on the last sorry mission for that level, so if it's still not open it'll definitely be linked to a side quest."

1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-06,i deadass thought this was a screenshot from a hitman game
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-05,"This game was so wonderful. It was easily worth the $70 asking price. Its also the first game in *years* that I put time into 100%ing and got all the achievements. I'm eagerly awaiting the DLC!

It really felt like a classic Spielberg movie in game form. I was so happy because my grandmother and I were huge Indy fans and would watch that trilogy together all the time. This game captured that feeling and took me back to my childhood. Major props to MachineGames!"
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-05,"And then you go up the stairs and there's two people still trying to screw in lightbulbs for eternity.

I love this game but the NPCs are a little basic, but it made for a good laugh."

1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-05,Which game?
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-05,Maybe there's a secret passage behind it and that allows you to bypass the whole game and get an alternate ending.  If you'd only waited for him to get it in the right position you could have saved all that trouble.
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-06,They have done a great job on the scripting of NPC's in this game.
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-06,"I see this game everywhere, what do you think about it?"
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-06,He's lazlo the greatest mind of his generation
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-06,Which game is this?
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-06,I'm still at the Vatican for hours! Is there still more campaign!?
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-07,"This game was fab and the voice acting from Indy and Voss was spectacular. It was a little buggy for me and the 3rd act dragged but I still really enjoyed it, looking forward to a sequel hopefully!"
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-05,Life situations are the best jokes)
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-06,This game is top notch. Played it last weekend. Made so much fun.
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-06,this is literally me
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-06,For me the best part was Indy talking to Gina about looking for his cat mummy while spying on the airship 😂
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-06,Doesn’t take much for ya does it
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-05,"Those priests are some dirty ol dudes, man...   😆"
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-05,Hi
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-05,I love when games put extra detail into NPCs
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-06,"I was carrying around a paint brush in the Vatican. Then realised I didn't need it, so just randomly dropped it and kept moving. Maybe ten minutes later I went back to that location amd it was still there with two nuns hovering over it and one of them was saying ""where did this paint brush come from?"". 

Some of the details in this game are just insane."
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-06,"I too like these interactions, however it's funny seeing the NPCs waiting for you to get close enough to trigger the interaction. You can always tell because they are doing something slightly more interesting than the surrounding NPCs."
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-05,[deleted]
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-06,"It really reminds me of the older assassins creed games at times as well. You can fight, but it is much easier to just avoid them."
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-06,"I should finish it, I was having fun until my gamepass ran out"
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-06,"Yeah- I had given up hope for a good Indiana Jones. I’ve gone old waiting… but this one redeemed the series. Can’t wait for the next entry, and hopefully it has some Temple of Doom vibes!"
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-06,I would've gotten 100% but one of the ancient relics glitched into the floor or ceiling so I could never get it.
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-07,There’s gonna be dlc?
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-06,"The fact that it's on Xbox game pass makes it worth the month subscription alone, not to mention the rets of the catalog on there."
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-06,Might be the best looking game I've played on console.
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-06,I paid $1 to play and finish it!
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-06,"If you take a picture of them, they eventually finish, if I remember correctly. Made me think there was something you needed to do to get these priests to get the frame straight, but I couldn't ever find anything."
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-05,Looks like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-06,"I finished it yesterday and enjoyed it, I'd give it a solid 8/10. My main issues were some technical niggles including 60fps cutscenes with frame pacing issues, animations in cutscenes would sometimes bug out and slow down so the characters would look odd, and it has some of the worst LOD pop in I've ever seen even on max settings. Other than that the AI is really stupid, their detection time is way too long so you can literally just sprint up to their face and bonk them on the head. Also while their are plenty of guns it never felt worth using them as the enemies are massive bullet sponges and firing a shot brings an army of them down onto you. 

The major highlights are the voice acting and story, you'd never know it wasn't Harrison Ford voicing Indy, Troy did an amazing job. And it wasn't just him, the main villain was incredible. And unlike the ranged combat I actually enjoyed the melee combat, there is an absurd amount of weapons, including weird ones like umbrellas, paint brushes and pasta strainers.

Overall it felt very true to the films and sets the tone perfectly, and for the most part it's a well made game that ran great for me other than the issues I mentioned earlier. There is also a ton of side content, some interesting, some filler, so if you're a complitionist I could see you getting 50 hours out of it, I finished it in 20 doing the main campaign and a few side missions I was interested in."
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-06,"It's literally right there at the beginning of the post, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle."
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-06,Yeah and u will enjoy it surely
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-06,You say that like it's a BAD thing to be easily amused...
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-06,I wonder if thats a hint cause maybe you didn't find it but there's an NPC talking about having misplaced a paintbrush if you bring it they're thankful. I think you even get a small amount of perk points
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-06,There's a NPC in one of the courtyards looking for it.
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-05,"I don’t think it’s fair to compare the two. They’re going for complete different things with their scope and world. 

To me, the Indy game was all about the romping around adventure and strong characters. Which it def delivers on. It was also the studios first big step into games like this, coming from wolfenstein. 

And rockstar has a dev team in the thousands, dev cycles nearing a decade for rdr2, and they specialize in those worlds and npcs with help from their engine. They are nearly a class of their own with the scale of their games. 

IMO Indy had just enjoying fun dialogue and actions to make it FEEL alive. Sure I can’t talk to them all and have specific interactions and such, but it didn’t need too. 

Sorry for long response. RDR2 is my top game so felt obliged."
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-05,">what's stopping Indiana Jones from doing the same in 2024 with a smaller game? 

Probably several hundred million dollars worth of budget and a few thousand developers."
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-05,"Comparing this game to RDR2, the highest quality videogame of all time makes no sense lol"
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-06,"Totally agree! Man, I need to pick up the Ezio collection. I've been craving the OG AC experience lately!"
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-06,I couldn't agree more! I think Temple of Doom is my favorite of the series!
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-07,"From what I read somewhere, yeah lol. I don't remember the name and I'm not sure how close it is to release, but that's what I heard!"
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-05,"Thanks. Saw Nazis, should have known."
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-06,I got it bro thanks a lot for your explanation I'll check out the game then I was already looking for a game to play for hours these days so this is good thanks again bro
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-06,"Sorry, missed that"
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-06,"Yes, there are a number of ""lost item"" hidden quests you can do. Generally speaking, if you can interact with it, it has a purpose."
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-06,Seriously? It's was one of those brushes you find everywhere to bop nazis on the head with.

1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-05,Because it's technically a midrange budget game as far as AAA goes
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-05,Because most unscripted/background NPCs do that in this industry? Rockstar is known for making the best unscripted NPCs.
1iiknq4,2025-02-05,2025-02-07,maybe reddit bots down voting a word in there
1expqed,2024-08-21,2024-08-21,"Man, I still remember the old point and click Indiana Jones games. How far we've come..."
1expqed,2024-08-21,2024-08-21,Part of me still wishes this game was going to be third-person but I completely understand why they didn't go that route and really enjoyed some of the company's previous first person games (and the Riddick game).
1expqed,2024-08-21,2024-08-21,I really wish this was going to be a 3rd person game.

1expqed,2024-08-21,2024-08-21,I get that they had to stop the PS5 version and then start it again at some point but a delayed PS5 version won't help if the game is as meh as it's appearing to be.
1expqed,2024-08-21,2024-08-21,The game releases to abysmal sales and lackluster reviews. Comedy ensues.
1expqed,2024-08-21,2024-08-21,I mean technically we also had a classic Tomb Raider style Indiana Jones

1cn6o65,2024-05-08,2024-05-08,"yep, its being developed by MachineGames (the devs in charge of Wolfenstein serie). Being based in Sweden its less touched by the closures, like Arkane Studios (Lyon)"
1cn6o65,2024-05-08,2024-05-08,"I think this is Machine Games under Bethesda, but I ask because when I clicked on Tango Gameworks in Steam it jumped to this game, which is on my wishlist."
1cn6o65,2024-05-08,2024-05-08,"I think so, but I imagine people are a little bit nervous about it. MachineGames are a great studio, and this game will have Disney money behind it, but something that perhaps wasn't so clear when they started work but is in the wake of Indy 5 is that Indiana Jones isn't *actually* a very strong brand. Dial of Destiny was one of the biggest Hollywood financial flops of last year and I'm not sure how well this game will actually sell.."
1cn6o65,2024-05-08,2024-05-08,Yes.  Microsoft would wait to shutter the studio *after* they finish the game.
1cn6o65,2024-05-08,2024-05-09,"Indiana Jones and the Mediocre Rectangle didn't make it... 😢

Microsoft, how could you do this?"
1cn6o65,2024-05-08,2024-05-08,"I want the mod that replaces all indie dialogue with AI Harrison ford. It’s a great impression, but it’s the uncanny valley. It sounds very good but is also definitely not Harrison. It takes me out of the fantasy a bit."
1cn6o65,2024-05-08,2024-05-08,Wonder if it changes the equation if Sony ends up owning Paramount.
1cn6o65,2024-05-08,2024-05-08,"Gotcha, thanks."
1cn6o65,2024-05-08,2024-05-10,So Blade is safe then too?
1cn6o65,2024-05-08,2024-05-08,"""I want to replace human 'uncanny valley' by AI 'uncanny valley'"""
1cn6o65,2024-05-08,2024-05-08,I want the Bobcat Goldthwait mod.
1cn6o65,2024-05-08,2024-05-08,Disney owns the Indiana Jones IP. Paramount just has the distribution rights to(i think) the first 3 movies. So the contracts are with Disney not Paramount.
1cn6o65,2024-05-08,2024-05-08,Contracts are already signed for the game
1cn6o65,2024-05-08,2024-05-10,"yes ofc, Blade is still being developed by Arkane Studios, which is based in France, not Arkane Austin"

1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,You should try Max Payne 3 and Deus Ex: Human Revolution
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,"Have you played Beyond two souls or Detroit become human? 

Asura's wrath is only on 360 and PS3 if you happen to have one of those laying around, gameplay really takes a backyard for the cinematic moments, and oh boy are they cinematic! 

The Warhammer 40k space marine games are nice


The darkness 2 is a more gameplay focused entry, darkness 1 is one of most favorite games but it didn't come out on PC. Two is an all right place to start playing but I don't know how invested people get starting at number two because of all of the crazy great storytelling from the first game really pulling it all together


Deus Ex games are chock full of story to steep yourself in

Song of nunu is simple enough and it has puzzles

Ruined King and convergence are others tied to the same universe as song of nunu, all very different games 

Remember me is another from the capcom next Gen golden years 

Mirror's edge doesn't have much in the way of varied gameplay so the story has to be front and center 

Now for some rapid fire
Lost planet 1, devil may cry 3 and 4, Darksiders, Star wars Republic commando, bright memory infinite, Wolfenstein New order"

In 2018 and Ragnarok the interactions between characters are really well made and the voice acting is superb. 

A controversial take here for sure, but i really enjoyed God of war Ascension if you hace access to a PS3 give it a go.

However, I think the best example of this, in terms of hitting the category, as well as overall quality of the game and writing, is Alan Wake 2. 

The writing and story is just sublime and it even blends live action directly into the game. It's one of the most incredible games I have ever played, and i've never quite felt the same feeling the story/writing gave me before. It really was like being in a horror story/movie! The story is really the crux of the game, but the gameplay is very fun as well and it's probably the most stunning visual game I have played as well, though Avatar:Frontiers, path-traced Indy, and particularly path-traced Cyberpunk come awfully close. 

I would also look into the Yakuza games. I have only played 7 and partially 8, but they're *extremely* story driven and have fantastic characters/acting etc. The only issue if you're very specific about it may be turn based combat and some grinding at sections. Definitely worth a look though. The older ones are all live action, and also very story based AFAIK."

1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,"This is an old trend by now. You can also try some old and great examples like the Max Payne series and Fahrenheit/Indigo Prophecy.

Heavy Rain is another example similar to Fahrenheit and by the same director (David Cage) who made a name making titles in this style (a few mentioned here as well), but I didn't like it anywhere near as much as Fahrenheit. Which is not perfect but at least it's way more atmospheric and less tiresome.

The first one that I personally remember having movie-like qualities is the masterpiece (imo) of Silent Hill 1. You can try the brand new reissue of its other masterpiece brother, Silent Hill 2, but 1 also has its very low-fi graphics that were made like this due to the limitations of that time, but in a brilliant way play a huge part to its otherworldly creepiness."

1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,"Max Payne 3 feels definitely like a movie, the prequels are also good, but 3 is the most movie like imo. If you liked GTA 4 and 5, this is a solid bet.

Metro series can be very cinematic and i think fits your description of unified strong story and gameplay.

Maybe Call of Cthulhu if you like Lovecraft, the game has a couple annoying stealth levels that kinda break up the pacing, but otherwise is a good eldritch detective story.

Dishonored is also great and has a strong story, but maybe it's more immersive than movie like?

F.E.A.R 2. I liked the first game (and DLCs) more, but they are a bit aged and might fall into the other category like Half-Life. 

DOOM 3 (the original version) maybe, the story was pretty simple, but it was a pretty coherent action survival horror.

Wolfenstein games are a pretty good fit imo.

I haven't played it but i heard Ryse Son of Rome is pretty good."
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,"I hesitate to recommend the Metal Gear series since 4 is still trapped on just the PS3.

1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-22,"Most Ratchet and Clank games since the Future series, but especially since Crack in Time were phenominally movie like to me. I still remember seeing its incredible teaser on a little monitor at an EB Games and wanting to get a PS3 just to be able to play it.

Rayman 2 and 3 were also the first games to make me feel ""this is so much like a movie!""

They were the earliest I can remember playing to reach that movie like threshold. But I know there are so many other games out there, especially today, that seem to make better unofficial movies or TV series than most actual movies and TV series. Like for real, I think the game industry is revolutionizing beyond film at the moment"
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-22,"Can you elaborate the Call of Duty part?   
You mean the cutscenes are just there to have an excuse to play a first person shooter? 

And also the Ubisoft part?   
You mean having a minimap with collectibles kills it for you? 

I'm not familiar with Bethesda games.   
I think they are generally rpg games with character creation?   
Would that take away from the movie aspect of them? 

I also haven't played Spiderman, which is a good example in your opinion.   
But I can't tell the difference between Spiderman and Uncharted just to pick one example."
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-22,The new Indiana Jones and the Great Circle game. Turn the view to cinematic and that really does it.

1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,"I've always been under the impression Kojima is a guy that wanted to make movies, but ended up doing video games instead.

Like a Burger chef forced to make hotdogs. But his hotdogs sell so well, and he has a reliable long term hotdog restaurant now, so he can't really go live his dream of selling burgers from a van.

Could be wrong. Just the vibe I get. The movie games. His Hollywood actor fetish. His role in the game industry. His obsession with movies and film culture, etc."
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,Damn I should have added this to my post. I wish I could play them for the first time again 😭
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,This has popped up enough times I gotta check it out
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,Definitely this one.
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,Can also add Heavy Rain.
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,One of the biggest flops of 2024.
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,"These definitely hit the story element, but genuine question— are they like, fun to play? They always gave off the vibe of having the opposite problem and almost seeming Heavy Rain-esque. But they certainly seem cool"
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,Yes completely forgot about these!!
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,"I didn’t think it was big into story, I always thought it was more like underwater No Man’s Sky?"
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,"LOVED The Darkness. Miss those games.

Beyond Two Souls wasn’t even on my radar. Thanks for that suggestion (among many great suggestions). 

Republic Commando and DMC3 were some of my all time favorites back in the day"
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,I’ll second this. The original Mafia is also very story-driven.
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,Adding Star Wars Outlaws. It got a lot of hate for some reason but it’s amazing and you feel like you’re in the Star Wars universe.
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,Lmao for real
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,Is the story legitimately good? For some (absolutely unknown to me) reason it was giving me Red Faction: Guerilla vibes
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,Is the story legitimately good or is it more like Skyrim (not shade on Skyrim lol)
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,I think you mean Telltale’s games. 
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,That’s why I said (mostly). Only reason I included them is I think the FFVII story/characters are strong enough where it carries it for portions. But Rebirth especially is very much JRPG
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,Despite being a good game I’d say that’d fall into the bad example category based on my question
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,Weird to be downvoted for stating games which are basically cinematic experiences.
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,"I still have to play mafia 2 and 3 (maybe I'll do it before they launch the next one, in anticipation) but the first chapter is really story focused. I did enjoy the original one as well, but it's more than 20 y.o. now, so if you don't need to play everything I'd just go for the definitive, adds a bit to the story, graphics is good and the whole structure of the game is composed of flashbacks and cutscenes, voiceovers that explain not only why you're doing the mission but the implications in the whole game world. You'll definitely enjoy it, have fun"
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,For sure. Has better voice acting than most movies.
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,Especially the first 4 hours. you barely had to touch the controller.
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,"This is exactly what Kojima wanted to do in his youth but he stated that it wasnt possible to do those sorts of movies in Japan at the time, hence why he went to konami and worked there which brought us MGS and in a sense death stranding as well"
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,"Maybe you can. I bought recently the Mass Effect Legendary Edition when it was on sale last month. Very cheap because of the sale, and I had never played any Mass Effect game. Although I play on Xbox, my guess is that it might be available for other platforms."
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,"Also, Beyond Two Souls, Days Gone and Horizon Zero Dawn"
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,It's amazing.
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,When I told a twitch streamer I had this on PS4 but hadn't got around to playing it yet he commanded me go forth and do so as my next game.
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,"It's really fun to play (if you like stealth and solving puzzles). And i don't think this game has the opposite problem. At least for me. This game is immersive enough, and whatever upgrades you get throughout the gameplay is justified via storytelling."
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,Definitely fun to play.
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,If you like puzzles and sneaking around. Got bored of it. Great game but not for me
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,"It's not a story driven game, it's a highly survival based game with a goal of getting off the planet. While it can feel cinematic, the plot is very much not the forefront. I think it's a good game, but not what you're looking for going off what you say in the post."
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,"On the surface yes. But when you play it, it's actually one of the best games ever in terms of ambiance and exploration (not in the sense of looting stuff and crafting). It is unique. I will not remember NMS but I will forever remember my experience with Subnautica 1."
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,"The story’s okay, it’s not a highlight but I didn’t hate it, though the characters and their stories are great"
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,"Well they have been adding to it with the later patches, especially the evil side. There's several characters called ""origin"" characters who are basically in game companions that you can control, or make your own. There's also a special origin character that's not in the game that's based on some of the backstory.

There's several ways to beat the game and you can be good or bad. I beat it as evil and destroyed the world in one ending, and went crazy in the other.

I would say the story is good if it's your first experience with it. I played the game since the first beta so I have practically memorized the lines and the story doesn't really mean much anymore."
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,Play FF15 then. To this day it is the only game that has made me cry at the end credits
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,"My good friend keeps begging me to play it, I feel you. Definitely heard good things about it"
1i6bhg9,2025-01-21,2025-01-21,Try it. Do not watch any YouTube videos to avoid spoilers.
1hk23p0,2024-12-22,2024-12-22,No.
1hk23p0,2024-12-22,2024-12-22,"The game was cool.. but pretty easy even on the hardest difficulty. Which is fine as you can tell they were focused on telling an entertaining Indy story and delivered IMO. Troy Baker did a fantastic job for the voice acting.

It looked nice and felt pretty well polished from the start (which is rare these days) but game of the year it definitely wasn’t. Still recommend and if you have gamepass it’s a no brainer"
1hk23p0,2024-12-22,2024-12-23,Nope
1hk23p0,2024-12-22,2024-12-22,I don't think it would have beaten astro/rebirth/metaphor. It would have been nominated for sure but I think even though it straddles a genre that the media tends to love (cinematic games) it sits a step below the ones that tend to win goty and is too much of an immersive sim for most of the media to pick as goty.
1hk23p0,2024-12-22,2024-12-22,that's a terrible sentence. get your tenses together.
1hk23p0,2024-12-22,2024-12-22,Absolutely not. Might have a nomination in a category but nowhere near GOTY worthy
1hk23p0,2024-12-22,2024-12-22,Not a chance in hell
1hk23p0,2024-12-22,2024-12-23,Nope but it has chance in Best Performance or Best Narrative
1hk23p0,2024-12-22,2024-12-22,"Would have been nominated, but Astro Bot is damn good."
1hk23p0,2024-12-22,2024-12-22,It’s most definitely my personal GOTY but I doubt it would have won tbh
1hk23p0,2024-12-22,2024-12-22,It's a good game but it's not GOTY material. I don't even think it deserves the scores it's been getting.
1hk23p0,2024-12-22,2024-12-22,"GotY nominee maybe, it definitely deserved it over something like Wukong, but not won. Judging from the wins, Astro had it, then Metaphor, then either Balatro or Wukong. If it means anything, I would be very surprised if Xbox did not get a nomination of any kind next year. They've just got a lot next year, relative to 2024 where they had two big games... and one of them fell outside of TGA's eligibility."
1hk23p0,2024-12-22,2024-12-22,It wouldn’t win 2024 and it won’t win 2025 either. Probably wouldn’t be nominated for either as well. It’s a fine game but very movie ish and less actual game.
1hk23p0,2024-12-22,2024-12-22,No. Probably wouldn’t even be a finalist based on its Metacritic score.
1hk23p0,2024-12-22,2024-12-23,Maybe nominated and maybe win some more minor GOTYs but would not win TGA GOTY.
1hk23p0,2024-12-22,2024-12-23,No.
1hk23p0,2024-12-22,2025-01-02,How did a rip off mario win over Indian Jones or black ops 6
1hk23p0,2024-12-22,2024-12-22,"No, the game is really well made, but it wouldn't be a GOTY contender because it's for a very specific group of people in terms of playing/enjoying it."
1hk23p0,2024-12-22,2024-12-22,"That would make it the first Indy game to win GotY!

I don't know, it is pretty short, not super deep. I did love the story but it was mostly in the cut scenes. Just finished it last night and I was amazed how long the ending cut scene was... it felt like most the final fight was a movie and then... well, it ended in a very Indiana Jones movie kind of way. 

Still, I loved it. Was my favorite game of the year, but that is more of a comment on the games this year just not being my thing."

1hk23p0,2024-12-22,2024-12-22,"I agree with what you say but there are definitely some sections that a very ""video gamey"" that feel completely out of place within it."
1hk23p0,2024-12-22,2024-12-23,"It was the most ""recency bias"" game I've seen this year.  Had this released back in January/February, it would have been forgotten about by the time awards season came around."
1hk23p0,2024-12-22,2025-02-05,"soo basically most Sony 1st party games? i'm not dunking the games themselves but they also do the same thing and they can win GOTY like Last of Us Part 2 did somehow even tho so many people hated it. Astro Bot seems like a good game, I'm not interested in it, but a W's a W for it."
1hk23p0,2024-12-22,2024-12-22,It has a 5 point higher score than wukong.
1hk23p0,2024-12-22,2024-12-22,Metacritic score is not a good barometer for the quality of a game. Game journos are bad bad
1hk23p0,2024-12-22,2024-12-22,And ufo50!
1hk23p0,2024-12-22,2024-12-23,I see. Sorry.
1hk23p0,2024-12-22,2024-12-22,"Yes, i finished it and did a lot of the side stuff."
1hk23p0,2024-12-22,2025-02-05,Well yea i sorta agree but i do think some of the 1st party games are more of a “game” like astrobot and ghost of Tsushima.
1hk23p0,2024-12-22,2024-12-22,Yes and everyone knows that Wukong didn’t get a spot based on its merit
1hk23p0,2024-12-22,2024-12-22,Game journalists are the people that vote for the TGAs

1hk23p0,2024-12-22,2024-12-22,Which are?
1hk23p0,2024-12-22,2024-12-22,"Is goty a good barometer of a game even?

Astro bot is a mid platformer with some charm. Its not even in the top 20 games this year, yet it had high metacritic and won goty.

Game journalists don't actually know how to vet quality game design, and metacritic score is clogged by tons of random ""critics"".

The best game of 2024 was ufo50 and I think only 2 publications got it right"
1hj7b3m,2024-12-21,2024-12-21,Dragons dogma was overshadowed because it ran terribly on release and still kinda does.
1hj7b3m,2024-12-21,2024-12-21,"How could you forget Rebirth in this list? It's like everything we should want AAA games to be. It's packed with more diverse content and scenes than practically any game I can remember recently and it knows how to have fun with itself and let loose, something many AAA games lack because of the budget getting higher and higher. There were at least 5 times where I thought to myself ""The devs were on acid when making this part"" because of how wild things were getting.

Also not to nitpick but astro is not AAA. That's like the game's entire point, to have a more sustainable path forward for the industry. It only had like 60 people working on it for a few years, it's very AA."
1hj7b3m,2024-12-21,2024-12-21,"I would argue that a lot of those were good *because* they defied conventional AAA thinking.

Stellar Blade threw social responsibility out the window and just full committed to the horny.


How Helldivers runs a live service would make the execs at most AAA companies sick, thinking about how much more they could be exploiting their players.


Astro Bot is a pure love letter to Playstation and gaming, and not easily replicated with all the IP involved."
1hj7b3m,2024-12-21,2024-12-21,"Stellar Blade, Astro Bot and Helldivers 2 aren't AAA titles and Indies weren't overshadowed.  We literally had one up for GOTY in the biggest awards show of the year last week."

1hj7b3m,2024-12-21,2024-12-21,"Most of these were around 50 mil, so on the low end of AAA budget. While bigger games like concord and Veilguard underperformed"
1hj7b3m,2024-12-21,2024-12-21,What “political pundits” are you talking about?
1hj7b3m,2024-12-21,2024-12-21,"Considering how much money was put into Concord, can you blame it being used as an example? 




You name dropped Dragon's Dogma 2, which had an estimated budget of 70-120mil, about a fourth of Concord's budget. A game failing that bad with that massive of a budget is an utter embarrassment. 




You also conveniently left out all the less than stellar games in the AAA cacategory. Those names you dropped are great because they dont actually do what the other AAA titles do. The state of gaming when it comes to deluxe pre-orders and microtransactions is just not it. 




Theres no reason for this to be political at all. A lot of AAA games just arent that great anymore. "
1hj7b3m,2024-12-21,2024-12-21,Sure indie games can be fun. But AAA games have much more money put into them. Making them bigger and higher quality games. Which logically means that AAA games are far more likely to be superior to smaller and cheaper indie games.
1hj7b3m,2024-12-21,2024-12-21,"How are any of those games politicised?  
AAA games should be popular, that's the whole point of them being a AAA game."
1hj7b3m,2024-12-21,2024-12-21,"It was also basically half of a game too, and still is right now. Between the lack of enemy variety and the way the game just kind of runs out of things to do surprisingly early on it feels like the game needed another year of work."

Half the games you named aren't even AAA titles. "
1hj7b3m,2024-12-21,2024-12-21,The pundits live on outrage. AAA games are an easy target because they are well known and thus has a bigger audience than a random indy game that barely anyone has heard of.
1hj7b3m,2024-12-21,2024-12-21,Sounds like you've been following too much of it.
1hj7b3m,2024-12-21,2024-12-21,You just said 'Rebirth'. This isn't r/FinalFantasy and I'm not involved with the series. 'Rebirth' could be anything.
1hj7b3m,2024-12-21,2024-12-22,"Just by repeating that they're not AAA games doesn't make it so. Anyway, how are you supposed to bring up politicization without politicizing yourself? And I'm not mounting defenses against billion-dollar companies, they don't need it. I just wanna call out the political propaganda of whichever youtuber likely sparked this post in the first place. Either way, I wouldn't be politicizing if this insane political discourse around fictional females and polygonal proletarians didn't exist."

1hj7b3m,2024-12-21,2024-12-22,"I'm interested in knowing what you think AAA games are as opposed to AA. Size of the developing company? Amount of money poured into the game? 




Helldivers 2 was created by a relatively small studio. 




Stellar Blade was made by a Korean company known only for mobile gacha games and not even one of the larger companies like Nexon. 




Those two games at least were not big budget powerhouses. 




Anyway, it's not about the fact you're bringing up the issue, but it reads like a veiled attempt to take a pot shot at the side you disagree with and not really a post to have a ""friendly discussion"" like you claim in your edit. The tone you take isn't quite friendly. "

1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I’m absolutely loving the game. My fear is they do what happened in the films. Go in with weak stories that no longer feel like a Indy adventure.
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"The easy mistake to make here is to think The Great Circle did well because it's an Indiana Jones game, and forget that it did well because it's a great game."

1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"It might still be hearsay at this point, but if it happens I can only hope that MachineGames has the juices in them for more Indy games.

That said, if they DO get stuck on the Indy treadmill, it'll be kind of a shame since they'll likely be too busy to make Wolfenstein III or that Quake game they were mulling over. Unless their new Sundsvall division helps them juggle projects better, giving them enough manpower to work on Wolfenstein III AND the next Indiana Jones without spreading themselves too thin.

Speaking of Indiana Jones, I reckon there's ample space for him to have adventures during World War 2, especially since he was still adventuring in Fate of Atlantis (on the eve of the war) and the opening of Dial of Destiny. Considering that the Nazis were up to all kinds of sinister japes before the war, I doubt that they'd dial that back DURING the war, and presumably neither did Indy.

That in mind, if MachineGames gives us another globe-trotting adventure after Great Circle, I don't doubt that at least one of them would take place during World War 2. I doubt they'd be given clearance to have Indy team up with B.J Blazkowicz, but I wouldn't be surprised if they slipped a Wolfenstein reference in there at least once. I mean, even before The New Order, Wolfenstein has had elements of Indiana Jones DNA in the mix, partly thanks to the contributions of Xatrix (Return to Castle Wolfenstein) and Raven (Wolfenstein 2009), though you could argue that it started with Spear of Destiny for Wolf3D."
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"The entire article was written because of this:

""According to a tweet by Daniel Richtman, an insider in the movie industry, it ""Looks like we're getting more Indy games."" ""

Some guy on X who works on movies predicts that the success of Great Circle means more Indiana Jones games, and now everyone is extrapolating that to suggest there are several in development.

That guy has nothing to do with Disney, Microsoft, or game development in any way. He's just a guy who said online, ""hey this game is doing well. I bet they'll make more of them."""

So authentic!"
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I feel like the only person who thinks this game isn't very good. There are way too many cutscenes that go on for too long, and in a lot of them, I would like to be participating as the player. Like, if something exciting is going to happen, let the player be the one to do the cool thing, don't just show it to us, that defeats the purpose of an interactive game. 

The NPC's are incredibly annoying, especially Gina. You've just walked into a new area, you need to take a second to get your bearings and at least see the puzzle or whatever, and Gina IMMEDIATELY pipes up, ""I think we need to do this! C'mon, strambo!"" Like, thanks Gina, I guess I'll just fuck off and let you play the game, you obviously don't need me here. 

Then there are other parts where you're stuck in a situation where there is no way to figure out what you're supposed to do next, you just have to die a bunch of times and figure out the next step through trial and error, otherwise you're not going to progress. Does Gina help then? Of course not, she just mutely bumbles around, getting in your way constantly. If she says anything it's going to be some snarky comment like ""Watch out for snakes!"" Fuck you, I know about the snake, I've been eaten by it 19 times. 

The stealth is a disaster, it's either completely impossible until you figure out the ONE correct route you can take, and there's no way to find that except through more trial and error; or in other parts you can just cheese it, and walk right in front of every guard as long as you stay crouched and don't stop moving. 

The combat is clunky, it feels like a beta version of Morrowind. There's no compass, if you want to see your objective you have to walk around with your map open like a tourist, or you have to pull it out every 20 steps so you don't pass it because there's no way to tell if the objective is ten feet away or two miles. 

The game feels rushed and like they didn't do any play-testing. It's a game for Indy fans and no one else. I'd say it's a game for people who don't play many video games, but those people are probably going to get frustrated and quit before they finish the second location.

Edit: I don't hate the game or think it's bad. I think it's just mediocre, with a lot of elements that detract from the experience. I'd give it a weak 3/5, and it seems like most people would say 4 or 4.5/5."
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I am down for a sequel. 

Not sure what else you could do with the IP.  A games like this take years to make. So a new game every 4-5 years would be pretty cool."

I remember playing Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine as a kid (loved it) and either he was already in the OSS in that game, or the female character you meet and work with was.

Anywho, I thought damn that would be so interesting to play an Indiana Jones game where you are in the OSS and sanctioned by the US Gov and actually fighting Nazis during WW2 (While also hopefully doing a cool archeological adventure). I hope they explore that part of his life.

1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-31,"I legit don’t understand the unanimous critical and public praise. I had to force myself to finish it in the hopes that I’d finally understand. It’s got very high highs but too many lows. Outside of brilliant cutscenes, the open zone gameplay was so inconsistent. The stealth genre is one of my favorites, so my biggest complaint is how heavily it relies on a stealth system that, between daft AI and terrible combat encounters simply doesn’t work. If it were primarily linear sequences followed by treasure hunts, it’d worked better for me. It’s also being praised for its visuals, but on XSX the lighting issues and pop-in frequently break immersion.

Help me understand!"

1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"This would be a bad move.

This is a fantastic game as a one off to a franchise that is done growing and its fans are older and less inclined to engage. 

This is the same shit that leads to fatigue, sloppy releases, and then job cuts. 
 

 Shareholders are greedy and the boards are really stupid. In a world where we get so many sequels, remakes, prequels, etc, this would be very stupid."

Personally I'd love to see Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine back from 1999 on this engine."
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"My personal conspiracy is that they are going to make the trilogy, think about it:

\* There is a modeled plane from the fight scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark when Indy arrives to Egypt in the Zeppelin.

\* The trials chambers in Rome where there is fire has the same lighting than Temple of Doom.

\* There is even a boat scene chase

\* There is also a whole plane sequence in Shanghai out of all places, you even fly through Lao Che's Obi Wan Club

\* Also: Plane chase, like the one in the Last Crusade.

\* All the assets used for Rome can perfectly be used for Venice.

\* A big ass Zeppelin like in the Last Crusade.

\* And if I noticed it well, I think there is some dude who looks exactly like the last guy who gets thrown out of the truck in Egypt when Indy steals the Ark back.

  
I know this could all just be conjecture mixed with easter eggs, but hey, I wouldn't be surprised if all of this is modeled precisely so they could reuse the assets to make the trilogy as games."
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Also, what is the metric for success here? That Game pass subscribers played a game available to them ? The steam numbers suggest very few people want to pay full price for this game"

I don't know who ""Daniel Richtman"" is, but if he has a good track record and does actually work for movie studios, it's fair to report this as ""according to insider"". It's more than a nothingburger.

1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"I'ma get flack for saying it but, to me, that describes _Temple of Doom_ handily.  Compared to the first and third movies, the second one felt like one of those subcontracted entries you get in gaming.  (Then again, the fifth movie ruined any thought that maybe it was specifically the even-numbered Indiana Jones movies that were cursed.)

Perhaps the next game could be based specifically on _Last Crusade_ and then, if they do another one, they can straight up remake _Fate of Atlantis._  I don't think anyone would mind that—there was a time when they were thinking about making it into a movie."
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,I worry they rush the games trying to make immediate cash and ruin what could be a great series if given the time
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-25,"I think it helps a lot that the game devs don't have to write for an old Indy. The modern movies did, and I think it introduced way more problems."
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-25,I love TGC so much it feels like a legit Indy movie. I’m just afraid they’ll run the franchise into the ground like with SW. Rinse repeat until the formula is stale. I don’t need a game every year.
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I hope they learn more towards Fate of Atlantis aka more puzzle less fighting. Like 99% puzzle. They sadly copied tomb raider in how tr originally was more puzzle focused but the modern games is uncharted like

1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-25,If you think Indiana Jones did not bombed incredibly you are naive. It was a great game but we ain’t getting another one. Indiana Jones as an IP is not that strong anymore. It’s not the 80s anymore

We love Indy"
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Yeah, publishers are going to make the same mistake they always have, not seeing the real reason games are successful."
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Part of the incentive of doing sequels sooner rather than later is you can use the already existing assets as well as game engine. It reduces overall development time and for that few year window, allows a developer to push out more content.

While I don't think they should Assassins Creed it, it makes sense to attempt, 2 or maybe 3 games in a series if the first did well."
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"We accepted umpteen Tomb Raider games and it's Lara Croft every time.  It just happens we have Indy associated with the movie character and actor, but he can be a general video game protagonist.

I'd be happier seeing them keep him alive in video game form than ever pass the role on and reboot/remake/prequelize it.  I hope they retire the movie character with Ford."
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"How does deciding to make sequels to a successful game equal opening the floodgates? I miss having a fairly regular entry in a series like Uncharted or Tomb Raider, I'm totally down for an Indy game ever few years, so long as they keep up this quality."

1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"The ""success"" part is still to be determined. It doesn't look like it sold well, and the PS5/Switch 2 release is yet to come."

1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"funny thing it did not sell, atleast not on steam. Mostly reached the audience being part of game pass offering. So this article is pretty much a nothingburger based on various assumptions rumors etc

My understanding is they still have Wolfenstein 3 in their pipeline, they just really wanted to get this one first."
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I mean you might still get one. The rumor comes from the movie industry so presumably this is about the IP getting licensed to more studios vs. MachineGames actually making a sequel.

1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"Most of the work (in terms of cost) isn't in the engine and the knickknacks, all the location based art will need to be done from scratch. I expect the license holder (Disney) will want better terms too so that all needs to be negotiated again if they hadn't already agreed a multigame deal."

1hkpype,2024-12-23,2025-01-04,Infernal Machine be would be cool but nah I need Emperor's Tomb before anything else. I need the ability to holster guns and 2 handed weapons like you could in that game.
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,I'd prefer Bethesda gives us Elder Scrolls and Fallout before another Indiana Jones game.

1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,The weird chemistry between Indy and Voss was so intruiging. I will not spoil everything but you can feel that even though they hate each other they are bound together by this occult fascination.
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I know the plot of ""nazis hunting what turns out to be Christian artifacts and they are killed by their own hubris while Indy is also there"" has been used 3 times now, but yeah I'm not tired of it yet."
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"There were cutscenes in the game that were reminiscent of the movies that it hits every bit of nostalgia almost >!The cutscene where Indy and Gina fall through the ceiling and the ensuring scene where Voss and Indy have an awkward moment as they stand up!< and while I and others may have reach saturation with Troy Baker, I’ll give him this, he did replicate Harrison’s gruff tone."
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Seriously. Even I was like “this is way better than the last two movies and even the temple of doom!  Why didn’t they make this into a movie!”

1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"It’s an absolutely amazing game. It looks good, runs well and the story plus its characters are top notch. Actually feels like watching one of the movies."

Todd was executive producer followed by John Jennings as senior producer and old BGS producer."
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Eh the end wasn't the best. But how we got there was better than most of the movies.
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Not entirely related to this post but there’s no third person option right? I’d love to play this but I get pukey with first person…
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I don't remember any of the classics having a scene as dumb as Voss and company completely ignoring the giant while he slowly picks up a stone slab to create cover for Indy to get the stones. It was pretty good up to that point though.
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I'm a busy Dad and managed to lose an entire weekend when it first came out.  I'm in the third section of the game and haven't touched it in a week and it is KILLING ME.  Hopefully with the holidays I can find time to get back to it.
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"That's surprising. The main story is really good, but the side content is almost entirely awful and very slow to work through."

1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,The Indiana Jones movies include lots of fighting. The reason it might resemble Uncharted is because Uncharted took a lot of inspiration from Indiana Jones. Seems like they nailed the balance for an Indy game.

1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"The article just says more games, nothing about direct sequel or even the same studio, just that they expect to pump the IP."
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Anything that goes direct to game pass is so much harder to judge because it does not get regular sales numbers.
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"True I should, but I feel like leaving stuff unexplored in an Indiana Jones game is sacrilege"
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I agree with this 100%. I love to do everything, but Sukhotai sucked the fun out of the game. Constant backtracking and by far the buggiest map of the 3 to boot.

I still thought it was a great game, best of the year for me, but I too STRONGLY advise not trying to 100% this game. Especially in the 3rd map. 

I will play again, and ignore most collectibles except books for upgrades"
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,Sadly no :( the camera's only purpose is to progress the story and to gain extra points from taking pics of points of interest/artifacts/etc.

1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Right? I see it as the only natural progression really.
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I wouldn't mind that but ffs they ended Wolf2 on a cliffhanger. Wolfenstein YoungBlood teased Wolfenstein 3 so they have to finish it. I even got an Xbox because Microsoft purchased bethesda who owns Machinegames.
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I wish they’d alternate. I enjoyed Indy, but it was all puzzles and not enough Nazi bashing."

1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"It reminds me a lot of the licensed games from the 80s and 90s like Fester's Quest, Bart vs. The Space Mutants, or Back to the Future on NES, with the difference being those games were mostly trash. This one isn't trash, it's just mediocre."
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-25,Haha fair enough
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"No, they will purposely make the game bad"
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Yeah but probably won't get another for even more of a while now since machine games did the previous ones
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Imo wolfenstein 2 was terrible. TNO was amazing.

1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-25,"I don’t get why this keeps happening. Why do people think Bethesda Games Studio has anything to do with this game? Todd Howard produced it, and that’s it. It doesn’t affect BGS output at all."
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Oh yeah. I'm most of the way through the game and they do a great job of instilling this vibe that indy has had a LOT of weird arguments with Voss years before shit got violent.
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"It definitely reminds me of Belloq in a good way. Rather than just a mustache twirler villain, it’s someone similar to Indy, like a dark reflection."
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"Finished the game. They're both fascinated with history, but voss wants it for a sense of control while indie wants to learn it for sense of freedom. Indiana is fine not getting credit for a discovery especially to protect the world. Voss is obsessed with getting credit because he has to feel as if he's in control. Which ironically gets him killed because he doesn't want anyone else taking the steering wheel."

1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Not to hop on the endless Todd Howard bashing train but concept and execution are very different. Tommy Tordsson Björk is credited as the actual writer.

Still, kara-teh! Sealed the deal for me on loving the ending sequence."
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,there are some comfort settings to make it a bit more palatable for those prone to motion sickness
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"No, sorry but it's first person only. Except when indy is climbing it pulls out to third person. It works very well in my opinion. If you think you can stomach some shaky cam during action sequences I'd recommend trying it and seeing if you can handle it. And refunding back to steam if you can't. I belive it's also part of Xbox game pass"
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Have you tried a significantly smaller screen? The only way I can play most heavier first person games like this is via local streaming to my Steam Deck. The smaller screen leaves more space in my peripheral vision and helps prevent the motion sickness.

I even have issues with some third-person games if the FOV is low, like the newer God of War games."

1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,Metacritic pegs it at 4.5.  Though maybe viewers will soften on the movie in 40 years like they did with _Temple of Doom._
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"There's a surprising amount of just walking around exploring, doing puzzles, and avoiding trouble through stealth. Nails the feel of being indiana jones imo. And guns tend to make things worse and are a last resort. So just bash them over the head with one instead lol. 

Loved the improvised fighting vibe they went with. And whipping nazis for crowd control is so fun."
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Ive seen all Indy movies many many times over. And honestly there isn't that much fighting. Usually one or two larger sequences. Indiana Jones and the fate of atlantis is one of the best point n click games ever made and is superior to all the tomb raider and uncharted games. And though i love uncharted its obvious its deeply inspired by Indy and would also be superior games with less fighting and more puzzles.
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"Given Machinegames' generally excellent track record and Bethesda's history of publishing pretty unique games, I'm sure Bethesda will handle it well.

Indiana Jones works because it's a well-designed adventure game taking influence from several others without directly copying any. It's Dishonored-ish, it's Uncharted-ish, it's Tomb Raider-ish, but it's not exactly any of those gameplay-wise with an excellently written story to boot. It's genuinely a pretty unique title from a design stand point. I don't see how they could screw up with a fundamental design that solid, the only thing I think it needs is more content. Fingers crossed, anyway!"
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I mean, yeah, The Great Circle has done well, but put it's sales up against the regurgitated ""AAA"" microtransaction riddled bloated slopfests out there and you'll see why this isn't going to change anything in the industry."

they'll do a FAR worse job than what they did with Ian Holm"
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Because it's based on a really vague tweet. The entire article is based on this one sentence: ""Looks like we're getting more Indy games"" and another leaker responding to it with a gif."
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"STALKER 2 was also on gamepass and had a peak 10 times higher.
What this shows is people just arent willing to pay $70 for an Indiana game."
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,You can go back to any at the end. Don't let the tacked on content grind like finding meds and ancient artifacts stop the fun.
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Yes, at least the major chunk of this game was made under MS owning it, its a Microsoft game."
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Wasn't the license for this acquired prior to the buyout? There were a few articles recently that Microsoft intended to keep this exclusive, but Disney pushed back because of prior agreements. Again, this is not a console exclusive game. It's a timed exclusive. It's a Microsoft game in name only.

I get it's all semantics at this point, and I love the game and Microsoft, it's just not a full-fledged Microsoft game, similar to the Outer Worlds situation imo."
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Youngblood kind of sucked, which hurt the potential to cap it off"
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Why would they possibly do that? Just to spite you?
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"yes, game developers purposefully try to make bad games. because obviously.

you're an idiot."
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I was talking MG already expanded a little, if MS wanted they could grow to where they needed and make two series at once. But I doubt MS thinks wolfenstein would make enough money or be a game pass seller"
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Cool, that doesn't mean it's a bad game."
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"What is your angle here?  What do you get out of arguing against actual reality.  

Also what's next?  Are you going to rant about how GT6 will be a financial flop.

Are video game conspiracy theory loons a thing now?

Edit:  NVM I spied you post history and when I see that you already think Intergalactic, a game by famed games developer Naughty Dog, is going to be a flop because of ""main character design"" I realized you're just a hateful idiot.

Everyone knows what you mean by that."

1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-30,Todd Howard is ALSO the a writer on it and it's basically like a passion project to him
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-25,"Because Bethesda is the publisher. I didn't say Bethesda Games Studio, I said Bethesda. They are one big brand. I don't want parent company to decide to push forward a sequel to this game when other IPs under the same publisher have already teased a sequel. Further to that, nothing in my comments said or implied the team that made Indiana Jones made Fallout or Elder Scrolls. Bethesda owns the rights to the sequel, they are the ones who will fund further development, and I would prefer the people funding and publishing these games wait to release another Indiana Jones game."

1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Yes but it was a spinoff. Not a mainline game. It was shit (nice ost though) but that doesn't mean I wouldn't want to play Wolfenstein 3.

Indiana Jones was made by Moar and probably another studio who will never touch fallout and Skyrim as the main production studio. Bethesda is a much bigger co.apny than most people realize

1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"RT both curates their critics and stifles (discards) user ratings when things aren't fitting the ideal that RT's owner prefers.  Haven't taken them seriously in over five years.  Their ""Top Critic"" system retains the vestiges of the RT before their curating initiative, though since it is also entirely arbitrary, they've been steadily eating away at that legitimacy as well.

Should Metacritic begin making overtures to some kind of system that dispenses with unfiltered merit, I frankly won't know where to turn.  IMDB is a slow burn and isn't useful for any movie that's not at least a year old."
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"There will be ones for this game now also lol

I don't care about that game so I'm sure at this point they have everything"
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"The games been out for 2 weeks. It's getting rave reviews across the board from the industry and gamers.  By your logic just about every single movie is a flop then.

Well have fun being an angry idiot."

1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I don't think it's a stretch to associate Noah's ark with christianity/Bible stories
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Just keep living in your bubble. Reviews dont matter and most sales are at launch especially for a story heavy single player game. It might not be a flop from a pure quality standpoint, i never argued about quality anyway. But its sales are lackluster for its budget. And many movies this year were massive financial flops lmao"
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,We have player numbers which arent just random but good indications of performance. But sure if you need this soo bad believe it made a billion profit
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,[deleted]
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"The Noah's Ark story detailed here is not from the Bible, though. There is no mention of Metatron or anything like that. And the use of the ark and it's abilities are not from the Bible. The Nephilim were not fallen angels but instead were the offspring of fallen angels and human women. And Noah's story is even found in the Quran. If anything, most of the story is based more on Jewish mythology than anything Christian, as there is nothing particularly Christian about the story outside of parts of the Vatican location. But then the game does similar things with Egyptian and Siamese mythologies and religious historicity.

So, I stand by my comment. Raiders is Jewish mythology, ToD Hindu, Last Crusade Christian, Crystal Skull Aztec/Mayan, DoD ... something."
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I don't care the slightest about any numbers out there or whatever the fuck the so-colled gamers of today cry about. I love the game and for me it's the GOTY even though I only watched the first Indiana movie this year. This game is incredibly fun and it deserves all the praise it gets. I'm simply replying to the you because you clearly just talking out of your ass without even playing the game because probably it doesn't have Eve's big jiggly ass or a lot of gunfights.
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,The frustum of frustration
1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"The bible includes the Torah yeah half of the bible is the Torah. Their is also bible stories about megatron theirs essentially early Christian fan fiction about the fallen angels and Jewish prophets. That's why theirs the term abrahamic religions they all have Abraham. Which includes Christianity, Judaism, islam, and Rastafarianism."

1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"Yes, all of those religions tie back to Abraham. Noah and the flood predate Abraham by nearly 400 years, though, and even MORE religions and ancient civilizations have a flood account (as the game even acknowledges), with several naming him. So that's why I say labeling this singularly as Christian mythology is a stretch."

1hkpype,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"Voss calls it noah's arc the great circle is about mythologies being connected. The tower of Babylon is referenced where all human civilisation was connected. In terms of the great flood myths which are throughout the Levant and middle east. The hypothesis is it's about the creation of the black sea. Essentially when the ice caps melted in North America it caused rapid see level rise. Which flooded the area of the black sea to the people their it would have been as if the world flooded. Early Judaism was influenced by outside religions Egyptian, greek, persian, and Mesopotamian. It's a myth that is in Christianity as well as lots of other religions."
1heqz2v,2024-12-15,2024-12-15,"""New original IP""


""Perfect Dark""


Robin williams WHAT YEAR IS IT meme"
1heqz2v,2024-12-15,2024-12-15,"Un, perfect dark it's not an original IP, in fact, it's a old rare IP that microsoft bought in fact 2002 and now revived."
1heqz2v,2024-12-15,2024-12-15,"As an Xbox owner, I don't mind if exclusives go wherever. I want these great games played by more people. If Sony don't wanna do the same, that's on them. But so far as an Xbox customer, I've lost nothing so far. Giving other people access to these games hasn't taken them away from me."
1heqz2v,2024-12-15,2024-12-15,"Nah. Phil Spencer was very clear the other day, there is no redlines, meaning everything will be eventually coming everywhere and that’s the only declaration I’m inclined to believe. 

Their messaging just can’t be trusted, remember in January when they pinky promised there was only 4 games and they even specifically denied Indiana Jones being ported? Only to announce the port a few months later. Then last month after Phil Spencer said “no redlines”, Matt Booty said again it’s a “case by case basis” but the truth is Xbox is no longer calling the shots, Microsoft is and they don’t care at all about the Xbox platform, they want money and they will get more of it selling software on competing consoles as they have a much bigger user base (cause MS was incompetent to build a solid one as well since last generation and will only keep shrinking)."
1heqz2v,2024-12-15,2024-12-15,"Perfect Dark is not a new IP. They got the IP after acquiring Rare from Nintendo in 2002.

The original Perfect Dark came out on the N64 in 2000.

You then have Perfect Dark Zero (2005) and Perfect Dark (2010) that came out on the XBox 360."
1heqz2v,2024-12-15,2024-12-15,"If they stay xbox exclusive, they're stupid. Sales number of xbox is eclipsed by ps.

None of them actually interest me except for Doom and Blade but if doom stayed on xbox, I wouldn't really care. Microsoft is already pushing their cloud gaming services so it will probably go on PC too"
1heqz2v,2024-12-15,2024-12-15,"Seems logical, but a lot of depends on the stupidity of Microsoft management. 

If you put Halo on the  PS that’s the end of the entire Xbox brand and by extension gamepass. At best you can put the really old games on PlayStation and make it really expensive (so no bundles) but even that will fuel speculation.

COD and Diablo are money printing games so that’s almost the entire value of AB. You need to make those multi platform. 

And license games like Blade and Indiana Jones are probably too expensive to keep it on Xbox."
1heqz2v,2024-12-15,2024-12-15,"Yeah nah, they are being wishy washy AF about it so I legit believe anything is on the table"
1heqz2v,2024-12-15,2024-12-15,"> if non-PS games really become attractive to me.

that non-PS game will be Elder Scrolls 6"
1heqz2v,2024-12-15,2024-12-15,I don’t care.
1heqz2v,2024-12-15,2024-12-15,I played OG Perfect Dark on N64. Definitely not new or original. Pretty sure that Xbox had a game as well.
1heqz2v,2024-12-15,2024-12-15,"Finally someone else who isn't all wrapped up on this exclusive nonsense. As an XB owner from the beginning, I completely agree with you. There's absolutely nothing that has made my experience worse."
1heqz2v,2024-12-15,2024-12-15,Sales don't matter for Xbox. They make the majority of their money from gamepass.
1heqz2v,2024-12-15,2024-12-15,The real question will be if Xbox is still in the console market whenever ES6 releases
1heqz2v,2024-12-15,2024-12-15,Good for you.
1heqz2v,2024-12-15,2024-12-15,"If sales didn’t matter, they wouldn’t be releasing their games on PS5."
1heqz2v,2024-12-15,2024-12-16,It doesn't. Non of their financial results even remotely suggest that. Gamepass accounts for less than 30% of their gaming revenue.
1heqz2v,2024-12-15,2024-12-15,"This isn't true factually. It's still the majority made through their cut on sales. The actual data is opaque, but we do know that the average Xbox owner spends more than the avwrage PS owner. Which is why Xbox revenue is so high despite only having half the number of consoles. And since we know more or less how many game pass subscribers there are, so we know that's not where they making all that revenue. It's obviously an important part of the pie, but it's not the majority. So yeah, sales do matter to Xbox."
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"This is one of the pinnacles of point and click adventures.

It should be Freeware by now, download Scumm and the game from their site, it's legal, and play this masterpiece."

1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"This was the first Lucasarts game to use the line ""I'm selling these fine leather jackets."" It's been in at least half a dozen others since."
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Played this as a 5yr old. Booting up the game with the rotary disk copy protection thingie... good times
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I didn't know Obi Wan was in this game
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Salaam effendi!
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Is this the one with Atlantis AND orichalcum? Damn...I played that so long ago...and it wasn't even my first game ..
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,One of my fondest memories of the DOS era - those beautiful pixel point and click games and that humour that can’t be matched. 
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Is that Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis?
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I remember how long it took me to understand you need to gift a red fez to a person, so you can track them in the bazaar. No internet back then in the 90ies lol"
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Probably gonna get buried. But this game was so important to me. My dad was a huge nerd, but grew up super poor.

Ended up in a good job and provided for us all. But never had luxurious things, his friend gives him an old pc and I've never seen him so happy.

This pc suuucked, the graphics couldn't run diablo 1. I could see he was a little gutted but hey that's all we had. We played low spec games and me and my brother also grew to love it.

I thought the world has forgotten about these point and clicks, or couldn't look past monkey island. Seeing this one screenshot just gave me emotional whiplash getting thrown back 29 years to when I was 5.

Lost my dad 2 years later. Just became a dad myself last year and fuck me I miss him like crazy. Thanks for unlocking some memories"
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Hey my machine can actually run this one!

1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"It was good i remember playing it on Amiga 500. I didn't  understand much (I was like 9 years back then and my english skill were almost non existent), but he guy on a screen was doing a lot of fun things."
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,What is this? Looks fantastic!
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,It’s one of my most played games. Masterpiece.
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Absolutely one of the best adventure game ever created.
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,One of my favourites. Multiple endings and nonlinear story before it was hip.
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"This game…. I was 7-8 years old when we got this and I played it for hours and hours. Played through the three paths, completed the different endings. The first time through I had to have my older brother or sister sit with me because I was so spooked entering the labyrinth then Atlantis shortly after. The music and sound effects were perfect for each location. 
This is the first game that left an impression on me. I found some courage making it through the scary parts and fighting nazis, the puzzles and dialogue options helped me develop some early critical thinking skills, and I thought about this game non stop when I wasn’t playing. Good times. Thanks for the nostalgia trip."
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,The first game I learned of Oricalcum from.

1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I loved that game as a kid,  but hate it for being one of those borderline impossible games without a guide or assume sort of decent into madness."
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Excellent choice! A true connoisseur of the fine arts
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Fate of Atlantis is one of my favorite games of all time.  Remember playing it on Amiga and having to swap discs 3 times every time a fight started.  

Blew me away when I got my first pc and I bought it on  CD Rom with full voice acting and no disc swapping.

Showing my age now."

1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Looks like that one should run on Steam Deck at least.
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,It took me and my friend 2 Weeks every day after school finding the entrance to Atlantis back in the day.
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I also recommend Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb which I recently rediscovered after it being hidden deep in my memory banks. It's more Tomb Raider/Uncharted-esque but was super fun back in the day.
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,This was pretty magical as a kid in the 90s.

1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,More people should give the one they released on Xbox (and probably other formats) years ago a try - it was an alright Tomb-Raider-em-up.
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Fate of Atlantis! I still play through this game to this day. One of the best of the point and clicks.

1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,If you like this I recommend the quest for glory series. It’s a similar point and click adventure but crossed with an RPG. The collection is often on sale over at GOG and I recommend picking up the fan vga remake of the 2nd game (part 1 has an official vga release).
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"My fondest memory of gaming - I still have the old style box and manuals in my loft.

The puzzle where you had to stack the stone disks and rotate them to match what the journal said to get into the maze towards the end. Yeah, that never worked for me despite reading and rereading the way they were supposed to be aligned."
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I hope it is better than the old Atari one...

1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,"Wait, I'm getting something from Nur-Ab-Sal..."
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,"Yes, of course! Monsieur Trottier!"
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,I.  Love.  This.  Game.
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,"There was one point where you had to use a surveying tool to figure out where to dig and for the life of me I could never figure it out, it stinks because it's early in the game"
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,"I had a lot fun with this kind of adv games back in 80s and 90s, the first one was Maniac mansion, then monkey island, the day of the tentacle, Leisure Suit Larry and finally this fate of Atlanta is my favourite."
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,"You're that spy, Indiana Jones. Any last request before I utterly pulverize you?

I'd like one last pastrami sandwich.

Request denied."
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,"I remember we used to have a physical copy of these, but it had floppy number 2 TWICE and no floppy number 3, so it was a short experience...  
Played it through 20 years later though. These games are absolute classics and I'm gonna go play Fate of the Atlantis right now!"
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,Man I loved this game so much when I was a kid. I'm terrible at the combat though
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,"I miss this era of gaming, I remember thinking surely it can’t get any better than this 😂"
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-08,push him
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-08,Looks like PS2 graphics LMAO
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-08,!Remindme 3days
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-08,I hope the ships rib makes a comeback
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-13,Salam effendi
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Uh that's the wrong one. The one everyone's talking about is the one from Atari?
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,That game was a gem.
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Classic LucasArts point-and-click vibes! The art style is super charming too. How are you liking the puzzles so far?
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Use the mayonnaise
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"This game is absolutely awesome!

I remember ordering it from the LucasArts Store waaaaaaay back when I was a kid!"
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,🤡
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,the graphics are ugly and low quality but the UI is trash. Probably a boring ass game.
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Can we slap people through the Internet? Asking for a friend.
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"It is in steam also, deefinetly worth the price"
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,"It is NOT freeware, it's still being actively sold in stores.

That said, most versions for sale use ScummVM as the engine, haha."
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"It definitely beats the pants off of the other Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis game for PC that a very young me bought, thinking it was this one."
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,"Are there any point and click adventure games these days, feels like it mainly translated to manually moving the character within a space and interacting with objects"
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,What is legal?  The vm or stealing the game to play it on the vm?
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,The Dig is the best followed by Call of Duty.
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,You got to check out day of the tentacle as well!
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I never figured out how to progress in Simon the Sorcerer when I played it as a kid, but it did not stop me from playing it every day."
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,The Good ol Days !?!?! I remember TRYING to play King's Quest 3. That game gave me anger issues. I have often preferred LucasArt's Adventure games.
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,That was Last Crusade I believe
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I've only ever played Full Throttle. And I definitely remember knocking on the door of the guy in the trailer home, voiced by Hamill, over and over again, and Ben coming up with all kinds of weird lines. Including that one. Didn't know that was a kind of Easter egg!"
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"I believe Peter Botwright came up with that line.  It was very persuasive, and I ended up getting one myself."
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,I remember this and Carmen sandiego where pretty great point and click games
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"good one, general kenobi"
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Don’t be afraid…
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,You are a bold one!
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,What do you make of this map?
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,How about this little red wagon?  It once belonged to Rudyard Kipling!
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Yep! I played the crap out of this game back in the day.
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,Don’t forget psychic love interest Sophia Hapgood.
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Yes indeed! The one and only...
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,So that’s how Bubbles came up with the idea
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"This came out in 1992; not only was the internet around, we had the WEB back then- no need to comb through BBSes.  GameFAQs was just three years away."
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Is it an infernal machine?
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"A500, me too, didn't it come across about a dozen floppy disks?"
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Indiana Jones and the fate of Atlantis
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,Because it is.
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,"""Good ol' Nur-Ab-Sal...I'm starting to like him!"""
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Those pixels are thick as fuck no wonder
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,More like 16mb. It came out in the 90s.
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I can see it being tough if you were young. I was in college and had very little trouble figuring most of it out. I remember one conversation where you make a choice that determines one of three paths for the remainder of the game. I played it so much that I eventually had all 3 paths memorized and would reload from a save right at that point just to change back and forth.
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-08,"This game was actually not that bad. I beat the majority of it without a guide or help and in fact I don’t even think I had a guide as a kid. I think the hardest part for me was figuring out how to drive the submarine lol

Monkey island 2, on the other hand…. Fuck that stupid “monkey wrench”"
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,You fight like a dairy farmer!
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,Atlantis is a real bastard of a final level.
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,The 20th Anniversary version of Simon the Sorcerer 1&2 for Android have the same filter on by default. Luckily you can turn them off.
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,It takes some finagling but it does work like a champ once you get it set up
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,And how it feels to be right?
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,So I'm also playing through this game for the first time and I got past the part with the mayo but I never found anything to use it on.  What does it actually do?
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Oh you see nothing there, mate.  
Back then UI was a free4all wildness without rules.

You had games with 16 verbs, you had games with 3. Some had none and went full context based mouse over. If you go back a bit more you had **all** the verbs, because you had to actually type what you wanted to do. It was wild.

That game had *real time combat*, mate. Real time combat. Mate, *real time* combat."
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,It’s probably better for you that we can’t.
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,When it comes to classic games its usually a safer bet to buy from GOG which also does have these
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,They made a remastered or it is the original?
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Worth the price? I'll be damned if I pay $6 for a got danged vidjagaem!
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Oh i have, Chewy: Esc from F5 as well. Oh and Beneath a Steel Sky, too. 

I played a lot of them ... except for the Indy ones. Don't really know why, they just weren't popular in my area back then it seems ... and they needed a bit of popularity to ""go around"" back then ;-)"
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Whats his name and who's her face
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,"Interesting, i never liked kings quest and space quest as well. Only tried them briefly."
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"It was in Last Crusade. It's a dialog option when meeting most of the patrolling soldiers in Schloss Brunwald with varying outcomes.

1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Which is a reference to Monkey Island
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,It appears in a few of the Monkey Island games as well. It's even funnier there because the character isn't even wearing a leather jacket.
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Hmmm... 

this ""X"" is... 

to the south... 

and...

to the east."
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,"""Are you Alain Trottier?"""
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"oh, for u - maybe. for me? first time saw it circa 1998 or so.
And we got adsl in central asia only in 2000s"
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,I remember going to the library to look up cheat codes in books
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Probably, maybe less than a dozen, but I can't really remember."
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Somewhere around this. Monkey Island 2 was 12 disks on Amiga 500 so this should be the same most likely
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"When this game came out, I was so hoping they'd use the story for (what would have then been) a 4th Indy movie."
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-08,CHURL
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I mean there’s a lot of colors in there. I counted at least five.
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,the joke....it cries....
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,Wasn’t the submarine level kinda hard? I may be remembering wrong though. 
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-08,"The parts that bothered me weren't even about being ""hard"", per se, just ridiculous.  Do you remember the opening puzzle while the credits rolled?  Indy wants to get in a chest, but some strange gunk is jamming the lock.  So, *obviously*, you need to get an arrowhead and combine it with a piece of cloth to make it into a ""screwdriver"", so that when you knock over a book shelf, you can undo the back of it for a secret jar of mayonnaise that you need to throw on the gunk to dissolve it!

I loved scenes like the 'seance' where you're feeding answers through the vents, or figuring it how to make the giant snake eat the pig so you can move on, but every now and then they'd put up bullshit like the above."
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-08,It’s just tedious lol. The biggest problem is that if you have an idea on what to try you have to spend like 5 mins walking back and forth just to try something. Also the ships rib
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"So I might dox myself to a guy I was friend with a lifetime ago but here goes. Back when I was in elementary school he had a computer (like, in his house!) with this game. I wasn't much of a puzzle gamer but I was hooked as it is and was very very well made and intriguing. I think we were both around 11 years old and thus missed a thing or two during the play through of this game. But the thing that always bugged me was the damn mayonnaise...it just sat there in the inventory...mocking us.

I believe my friend was more than halfway through the game with this jar of mayo just hanging out while every other item came and went with obvious uses and meaning. We tried the mayo everywhere with 11 year old's logic ""throw it in the fire, it will surely burn through a hidden wall."" Must have watched my friend plays this thing every other weekend for over 2 months. Turns out it is used to reduce the friction on a floor allowing you to move a statue (I think withing on of the first 2 rooms of the game?). 

I never got to play the game when I was with my friend nor have I ever purchased it myself but...OVER 30 YEARS LATER THE MAYONNAISE STILL HAUNTS ME!!!!!!"
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Interesting. The oldest game I could enjoy was Halo: Combat Evolved and Grand Theft Auto Vice City from start to finish. It started getting good only from 2004 titles for me (GTA_SA.exe, Splinter Cell Chaos Theory, HL2, Doom3) to name a few. Pre Halo real time combat was weird af."
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Safer? ScummVM is the emulator for all of these old LucasArts and Sierrasoft Point and Click games.

I played Full Throttle on my phone a couple years ago. It works great."
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,What’s GOG?
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"If you're running through ScummVM, which you should, either source works fine. It provides a much better experience than GOG's vanilla version: basically no technical issues with DOSbox, proper emulation of the SC-55 soundcards the music was designed for is easy enough, support for upscaling filters, and enhanced UI features to make it easier to save/load etc."
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,"Do you have any examples where this is the case? In my experience buying games on GOG and Steam they are exactly the same version of the game which means I end up needing a community patch anyway, despite reviewers saying GOG ""made their own version"""
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,There's a version with voices.
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,It was $1 last time I checked :) just wish list it and buy in a sale
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,"Yeah, they were more frustrating than fun. Moon logic is always a thing in those adventure games but some of it is almost impossible to figure out without a guide."
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Oh my god thank you for putting this link here. Somewhere in the fog of my memory I remember playing this game for hours and hours and finding it really tough! Watching this brought back a lot of memories. Awesome.
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Monkey Island was released after Last Crusade
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,"Monkey Island was big on pulling references from other Lucasarts IPs.  Curse gives you the option to attempt a Jedi mind trick to get by the guy at the private beach.  Also this line: ""Have you ever heard of Bobbin Threadbare?"" ""Who?"" ""Exactly."""
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Thanks for the information
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,OoOOoooOOOoooooo
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-08,I’m starting to like this Nur ab sal guy
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"honestly love when people claim ""hey we had the WWW in 91!"" and it's like...no...no not everyone did....in fact a very very VERY very small portion of the population did."
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-08,It is the 4th Indy movie in my mind. Honestly I rate it higher than temple of doom. The story is fantastic
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-08,Parts of it were tough. I just ended up playing it so much that I had it all memorized. The first time through each of the 3 paths was difficult at times.
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Lol I knew it had to be for something very early on because it eventually just disappeared from my inventory.  I think there are multiple ways to get the book but I ended up using the rag and the arrowhead.

Maybe the statue has something that helps you get into the old trunk? I couldn't get it open."
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Wait, scumm is for phones? My man, the impact you may just have made on my day...."
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"GOG works to make their game work on modern OSes, and i think GOG do use ScummVM to do that."
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,Gog usually works harder to make older games reliable and run on newer computers. Some older games on steam cannot be played.
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,https://www.gog.com/about_gog
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,GOG does good work.
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,"One of the better game buying services/launchers on PC. I like Steam (mainly cause I've been using it for 20 years or more) but GoG is great, It's better than the Epic launcher or ones like ubisoft's"
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Games over Girls
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"The original CD version had voices, there was also a disk version that didn't."
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Oh ok, There are many fanmade versions with the updated audio, I hope they used one of those because they were excellent."
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I had this version way back in the day that came on this new fangled thing called a cd rom
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Well, I may be able to swing it, i guess.

I'm in Canada, so it's actually $7.80 for me."
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,Probably in part because they used to sell physical hint books for the games.
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Monkey island released in 1990 Indiana Jones and fate of Atlantis was in 1992
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,"Like even in 98, computers were still not a household item for most households."
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Scumm is one of those things that gets ported to everything. I had it on my Nintendo DS in 2002.
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Would now be a bad time for whatever productivity you have left to let you know that there's also a choose-your-own-adventure/fighting fantasy books app...?
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,I was watching a streamer play King’s Quest IV and it made me really want to find a way to play those old point and click games.  Now I may have a way to do so!  I really want to play Laura Bow: The Colonel’s Bequest right now.  Gonna look into this.
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,"ONly way I play morrowind, oblivion and fo3 and foNV"
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-07,"Yeah, GoG isn't an inferior Steam like EGS is. Lots of DRM free games and also maintains classic games."
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-08,I had the disk version back in the day.  Actually prefer it to the voiced version because the voices aren't really super high quality from that time anyway.  Also helps in an adventure game to have the text on anyway if available as it helps with any clues that maybe you would miss via audio.
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Aye, Last Crusade was released 1989"
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Jeez. I'm totally out of the loop.... thanks for the info, I'll be looking it up tonight."
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-08,"Having the subtitles on is definitely way to go but man the voices in this game are iconic for me. I was so blown away as a kid hearing all the voices and tbh they are really well done, even if they are very low quality lol. The German scientist voice cracks me up every time."
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Oh right. The movie. Forgot about that. Oh yeah that's likely where Guybrush threepwood got it from ( no wonder either really. Both are from Lucas)
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"No, the game. Fate wasn't the first Indiana Jones point-and-click adventure Lucas Arts made.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Last_Crusade:_The_Graphic_Adventure"
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,Ah. Does he use that jacket line in that game?
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Holy shitcrapfuck. 

I would have sworn, on your mum, that Atlantis came out before Crusade.

Amazing."

Doesn't work with every soldier. Others attack you when choosing the line."
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,"Yes, IIRC it's a dialogue option when Indy gets caught by the guards in Castle Brunwald."
1h7y86n,2024-12-06,2024-12-06,That's what Guybrush is referencing
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"It blows my mind how much he sounds like the Indiana Jones from the movies, you would think Harrison Ford was voicing the character."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,You might even say that it's Great
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Great game, still suffered from people yelling “hey what if you pull this lever” before I’ve even started looking at the puzzle."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Not just kinda. It's straight up a great game. Loved the light immersive sim approach. Would love to have more depth in the next one
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Good story,fun gameplay and actually runs perfectly on release unlike a lot of new games"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I had a lot of fun playing it on PC. Favorite thing about it is it was like watching a movie, a globe trotting adventure. Surprised how it offers a fresh experience different from Uncharted/Tomb Raider.

Only complaint is the AI is dumb as rocks and I just cheesed stealth the whole game through because I couldn't take it seriously, it was so full of holes. Prime example being how you can knock out an enemy right behind another one and they won't notice."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Starting with Raiders of the Lost Ark was such a smart move. 

It got me invested from the very beginning and the rest has been amazing."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I heard it runs well on Series S. Looks like I'm up for a month of gamepass.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"One of the few games this year where I honestly hoped it would not stop and was a little sad with each new location, because I know it was one less left.
Amazing game. Loved it. Hope they make a sequel."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I like the little to no hand holding the game does. Wish more games did that
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Game of the year material. Weirdly low Metacrirics score for a game that feels like a 9 or a 10
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I've been really enjoying it. I just kinda wish I'd realized I was about to get swooped out of the vatican when I did, since I had some side stuff still to turn in. Alas."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"It’s the third best Indiana Jones story/thing that has ever been, across all mediums."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Yeah I couldn't wrap my head around it being first person in previews. But its Butcher Bay instant classic.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Yeah I’m really enjoying The Great Circle. Really captures the feel of the movies. The puzzles so far are good, not insanely abstract to where you need a guide or spend hours trying to figure them out. I’m not the best at the fighting but it’s not really hampering my gameplay much."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Golden Circle is the name of the second Kingsman movie lol, Indy is the Great Circle"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I'm playing it now. At first I thought it was going to be more linear but once i realised it was semi-open world i was hooked. Crawling around the Vatican has been great.

It's a little easy. Sneaking is OP and the grace period for being spotted on ""normal"" difficulty is massive. Getting into a dust-up with one guy can easily turn into six or seven dudes piled up together. And although the facial movements are amazing during cutscenes, a few seconds before the transition back to gameplay, Indy's expressive face goes doll-like, creating a very weird uncanny valley feeling that weirds me out every time. But everything else is amazing.

Annoying that the current graphic drivers make the game crash on launch for me. But rolling them back fixed that issue and the game runs flawlessly for me. It crashes to desktop occasionally but it's checkpoint system is good."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"The problem with all the ""it's amazing"" posts and ""it's going to be GOTY"" posts I see is that only a hair above 20% of people playing even got past the first chapter (I'm counting Rome as first chapter) and less than 4% even made it to the end. I'm getting these percentages based on achievements. So how can we believe the hype around a game when almost 80% of people playing never got out of what is essentially a tutorial level. Isn't this a bit like thinking Spectre is an amazing movie because it has a good begining? I actually beat the game and I can tell you that the combat and stealth gets worse and worse over time. It starts to feel like an instant fail stealth mission straight out of Star Wars Outlaws when you accidentally alert one bad guy, and you see an entire screen full of those red alert icons letting you know every bad guy now knows where you're at. The puzzles and story at least are amazing."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,It feels like whole world slept on this one. Amazing game and the first in about a decade to give me the constant feeling of ‘this is brilliant’ while playing.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Ill be the first to admit I was wrong. I said the game looked awful based on trailers. 

Having heard the positive reception, and knowing how good the studio is at giving a middle finger to nazis, I checked it.

It might be my game of the year."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I had a really good time playing it.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,This game is easily my GOTY 2024
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Not just kinda. It is amazing
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"1 year old gamer dad here. Similarly never really get to play games anymore, or am just to exhausted. This game is perfect for fans of Indiana jones, and puzzle adventure games. 100% recommend."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"The only issue I have with the game is that the stealth aspect doesn’t work… cuz like, why would I sneak past a Nazi when there’s a perfectly good sledgehammer nearby? 🤣

Fantastic game."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"The game is indeed amazing but I'm surprised how nobody mentions how blind, deaf and stupid all the enemies are. Also Gina walking in front of them all the time gets old quick."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Love it, its feels like such a classic game beeing just a solid adventure, great astethics and some light RPG elements as well. They did a great job with it really.

I can see they have a fundation to bring more Indy stories to life."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"You don’t have to say kinda amazing.

It’s okay to like Xbox games lmao"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Who's scruffy looking?
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,youre amazing
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Like others have said, there desperately needs to be a toggle to silence NPCs. The single most obnoxious thing you can have happen to you while you're exploring is to have some robot constantly shrieking at you the very simple and obvious thing you need to do next. It kills the immersion and the pacing. Shut the actual fuck up and let me enjoy your game."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I hated the slowness of some of the movements and how it forced you to do so many minute things that are just done automatically in other games (after pressing the interact button on something you have to then press a direction on the joystick to actual is it)
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"It really excels in the more linear areas. Otherwise, the open segments are a bit repetitive and exhausting. The repeat of the fight dens, for example, just seems like lazy copy/paste"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"It's solid. Combat is an unrewarding chore. If it had some sort of xp system to mitigate the tedium, I'd like it a whole lot more.

And then there's the first person perspective. You're playing indy but you don't see indy. Every time they wanna have a cool scene they take control away and play a 3rd person cutscene. There's cutscenes lasting for multiple minutes because of that decision. What's the point even todd."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,What’s with the posts that are just obvious marketing for this game? This is the second one I’ve seen now.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"This game surprised me big time. It’s amazing. It’s not *perfect*, but it’s getting pretty close.

We don’t have an Xbox so this is the first time I’ve moved my PC to the living room so my wife and I can play."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,its not the thief/tombraider crossover i wanted but its a very actiony point and click adventure game with a fun story
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I have yet to really get into it, I'm at the Vatican currently"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"""actually kinda amazing""- the epitome of millennial writing"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I game that looks amazing and plays good on an average PC?! Put most UE5 games to shame!
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Great circle. Indiana Jones and The Great Circle. It's so amazing that nobody even knows the title.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I’m about half way through and it’s such a solid game. The story feels like it really is a movie to video game adaptation. The sounds and VA are just absolutely phenomenal, that alone deserves a reward. 

This game belongs in a museum!"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Only gripe I have are the NPCs that constantly are like ""Hey come look at this"" every 2 seconds while I'm searching for artifacts."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Tried so hard to get into it. Game felt clunky as hell,  with huge portions of down-time in between cool stuff where I'm doing extremely tedious stuff just to pad time. Wasn't for me."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,My only gripe with it is the low quality stealth system. Not having any way to take someone down at range quietly is a drag and fp games aren't good for multiple enemy melee combat the story themes and exploration/ puzzles where very good tho
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I’m in the middle of it, the graphics are great but the storyline is what keeps me playing. The Indy voice actor did an amazing job."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"No shade but the game is called great circle, i know cause every time i say golden circle i have to double back and correct myself. Golden circle is better if you ask me. End my suffering"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Most fun I’ve had in a game in a long time.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,It consistently blows me away so often that it reminds me of my first time playing Bioshock.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I am blown away at how fun it is. Typically games like this don't do it for me, but this is just so much fun. The graphics are unreal as well."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"This is a lesson in how to release a modern game: generally on time, without huge bugs and and incredible player experience"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"It makes me feel like how old Indiana Jones games did. I know Bethesda gets a lot of hate, but the games they’ve been publishing have been so good"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"It's honestly fantastic. Highly recommended. Good optimization, very stable about 30 hours in - 9/10 so far."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Punching nazis and swinging in whips will never get old. Better Indy experience than the last two movies.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I love it and being a game pass PC user here Im totally delighted, but Im in the part that you have to check those pictures and then check another building and is kinda slow boring actually."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I'm straight but I would sleep with Troy Baker
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Finished it yesterday. Didn't 100% it. But I did love it.

Honestly I think once you beat it a wayfinding system should unlock to lead you to notes and shit you missed as opposed to just the location. I loved the exploration of the game without the pathing or wayfinding help, but it'd be nice to get one at the end so you could mop up easier."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,The voice acting and music is what it does for me and lifted the whole experience.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Probably would have been a GOTY contender if it had come out a month or 2 early, but I'm glad they took the time to polish it before release."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Fantastic ambientation, crazy graphics, good atmosphere and puzzles... Really poor AI, weak stealth mechanics and plain bad combat. 

I have enjoyed it, it has more pros than cons, but I find hard to put it between the top games of this year."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I stopped thinking Troy Baker and started believing Harrison Ford about 30 min into the game. Give the man all the awards now.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,[deleted]
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I watched the 'movie' on YouTube because I don't have the means to play it right now. I kept forgetting that, not only was it a game, but that it wasn't live action. Troy Baker is the most convincing male voice actor ever. The story is grade A. The articles before it came out were ""oooooh I don't know. Just a stealth brawler with no substance"". This is the game that made me finally stop reading games journalism. You are less than a show of your former self, PC Gamer..."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"Loving the story, not loving all the collectables."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"This is the game I ended up enjoying most this year. There are so many things about it that are refreshing, but perhaps the biggest thing for me was that it set out to tell a simple story without trying to make it ""deep"" or ""profound"" where that tone wouldn't really fit (looking at you, God of War). Just good acting, magnetic characters, humor, mistery, and some romance. The environments imo are brilliantly designed, and it manages to make both layered and tightly-packed maps and wide-open ones work equally. However, the moment I knew I would never forget this game was when a certain villain reveals his affinity for the lethal Japanese martial art of Kara-Te and starts screaming and doing crane kicks. That's when I knew it was love. Btw, the combat gets way easier to enjoy if you remap the parry and push buttons to a side-button in your mouse. The key binding is not very intuitive."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,They did a great job. Hopefully the same team makes a 007 game
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,Best thing to come out of Bethesda in a very long time. Not to mention the best Indy story this millennium…the opening was like living a child’s dream of being Indy. And Troy Baker  was unbelievable. There’s so many times where I thought it was Ford speaking. I honestly hope this series can continue and in the right direction. There’s a ton of potential here
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"As someone hasn't seen the first three movies in 20 years and no real memories, and not having seen any of the franchise after the original three, would I be able to follow the game?"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,The way some of y’all are talking about it makes it seem like an Assassin’s Creed clone and maybe not actually a great game. I have negative interest in a bunch of copy-and-paste enemy restricted areas and tombs 
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"Great Indiana Jones experience, pretty average and standard gameplay. Don't get me wrong, it's serviceable but behind the Indiana Jones facade there's not much there."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,So would it be worth it downloading from game pass?
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I'm happy you are enjoying it! 


Unfortunately it didn't work for me  :(


The game is very repetitive and gets boring after some time "
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Meh, I just ok to me.

It is fun but not that amazing."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Just finished it. There is no kinda, it is a fantastic game from start to finish. The puzzles are fun without being crazy hard, the exploration is wonderful, and the acting is top notch. The lighting really sells the world too. The only gripe I have is the combat is a bit clunky. But let's be honest, the aim of this game is to avoid combat."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I didn't like the Vatican. The millions of collectibles. Stealing money and photographing shit. It's a collectible game! It felt like work sneaking around. I just kinda wanted an adventure like an uncharted game. Instead it feels like old school Thief. It's just not what I wanted or expected, which I guess isn't the games fault. Other people seem to be loving it."

1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Meh
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,It really is. Honestly has no right being this good.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"The game looks absolutely amazing, but it's boring as fuck."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Prob one of the lamest games ever made and yall are even more lame for lapping it up 😭😭😭 you go up to someone and throw hands with them even though they have a god damn magnum on their hip… like yea, this makes sense"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I bought my wife a new laptop for xmas and it came with a free digital download of this game. May have to check it out.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I love it, too. If only they could provide a third-person view, the nostalgia would be super real."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23, If you have game pass  it’s ok but I couldn’t imagine paying anything close to retail for this on rails extended cutscene
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Apart from the braindead and one of the worst enemy AI in recent videogames, I would agree"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Honestly, I don't really care for it. It was fun for a few hours but once you get to the second huge open bit it really lost me. Wide open spaces with very unintuitive fast travel system that I eneded up barely using. Indy is pretty slow and his climbing even more so. 

Combat is incredibly repetitive, and guns are kind of pointless because as soon as you fire a shot all the Nazis who were previously trying to fist fight you (for some reason?) All take out their guns an kill you immediately because their aim is incredible and it takes like 2 shots to kill you. 

Far too many cutscenes that are unskippable and go on for a good few minutes each. And in all honestly indy was the only interesting character for me. Everyone I met along the way, maybe aside from Voss, was incredibly dull. 

I'm focussing on the negatives because of the nature of the post, it had some good moments. It looks great and Troy Baker did an insanely good job. But other than that its a bit mid, 5.5 out 10."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Meh, if you are not an Indy fun it looks pretty mid aside from the graphics. Gameplay wise it doesnt bring nothing new to the table."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,For anyone jaded by the last couple years of shitty aaa games I really recommend you try it. Great game. Good puzzles. Has very modern graphics but has a classic feel to the gameplay. Favorite game of 2024.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Awful combat gameplay. Boring story. Not great at all
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,[deleted]
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I mean, it is pretty GREAT"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,We've come a long way since the Atari version with a slash / for a whip. I'm watching Mojave D's playthrough and it feels like I'm watching my parents play. I wish my mom were still up for games like this one (she's in her 60s and introduced me to pc gaming way back) especially since we're all big Indie fans.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Also parry is KEY. With parry, you become invincible in fisticuffs."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I am having a lot of fun with it.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Agreed
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,It was fun for the first 20 hours until I got softlocked by a glitched animation.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,This game had me at the opening tutorial..  I am enjoying it in bite sized pieces to make it last.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,It really fucking is.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I'm debating getting this game for my dad (61), does it have a lot of fast-paced sequences? He says first-person games make him dizzy"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I just wish I could play it. Installed it today, played through seemingly the first mission or at least the first objective (other than >!the movie scene/dream and museum break-in)!<, at which point I found out that my GPU isn't enough for the game and I can't proceed any further without crashing :("
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"There was one bad mission in the game, apart from that it really was brilliant - insanely detailed objects, lighting and textures, the writing and plot is spot-on classic Indy, the voice acting is terrific, the locations are a best-of of Indy and fun to traverse and explore and the gameplay loop is satisfying, especially when you get disguises ^^ Heck, even the music was there. 
Machinegames finest game I've played and now I have a hard time finding a similarity great one, settled on replaying Wolfenstein II for now after playing around with some past Indy and Machinegames titles ^^"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"My whip glitched in a mission. It stopped working. In my head I was thinking “it’ll come back on the next load scene.” I finessed my way around a few obstacles I was supposed to need the whip for. Next thing I know, I’m 7 hours into this game, having fun, and I finally reach a part where there is no option other than the whip. I google a quick solution, there isn’t one. “Reload a save where the whip worked or start the game over.”

It was fun, not that fun."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Todd needed a win
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Just finished it last night, a nice game and the first game pass game I played on day one"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Devs of wolfenstein, they don't miss"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I'm hearing so much great things about this game, I might consider buying it when it releases on ps5 next year"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"For the first time, as a PS owner, I'm a little jealous of XBOX owners :)"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,It feels like an Indiana Jones movie. The comedic bits and little musical flares while playing are so good
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I absolutely love this game! Might even be my favourite from this year.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Even though my friends who had AMD cards said it wouldn’t work, etc etc, it’s great! Runs at 140+ fps and without issue so far. Great game"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I keep hearing that but NGL I have too big a backlog to buy it for now, at least at full price"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I have 4 kids and never struggled to find time to play games, the toddlers were all in bed by 6pm so I had plenty of time in the evening. Never quite sure what the hell everyone is doing to have no time lol."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Yes, I was waiting for almost 30 years of my life to have a good indiana jones games besides lego version"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Machine games are a great studio.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,👍
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I'd love to play it but the devs left in a glitch where the shadows don't work on RTX 4050 laptops
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,It's an amazing game. Maybe because I'm old but the end made me tear up
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I find some of the decoding puzzles actually very challenging which I really like.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"The Voss fight was so bad. Should have called him accordion legs. 

Overall, the game was good.  It captured the feel of the movies and brought back nostalgia. 

It won't be GOTY, but it's definitely a game to pick up and play. It's extremely satisfying to hit Nazis with shovels."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"The only thing I felt was missing in this game, were some action set pieces like the mine carts in Temple, or the plane fight in raiders. There were some throughout the game but nothing where I went, “wow that really just happened”. The game is exploration first and as I’m looking for books/notes the game gets kinda quiet. I just chalk that last bit to how I played the game though. 8.5 outta 10. Debating giving it a 9 after that stellar ending."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I found myself reading the texts scattered around. I never do this in games. It was quire fun. 

Overall great gameplay, story, writing, acting, score. Chef's kiss."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"B-b-b-but woke....it's woke!!!

Iirc it's on the game pass, if y'all have it, it's great! c:"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Incredible game and the best use of ray/path tracing I've seen yet
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Waiting for my 7900xt to come in before playing!
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"It isn’t perfect in terms of polish but surprisingly an extremely enjoyable well cast game. Easy pick up on Xbox game pass, don’t know if I’d recommend it at full price unless you really love Indiana jones."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,The stealth and cool stuff you can pull off still blows my mind despite 2 playthroughs already!!
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"If this had been third person, with some sweet Harrison Ford animations, I'd be all over it."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Dumb title aside, it is scratching that Indy itch the recent movies haven’t been able to lately. The gameplay is simple but effective and surprisingly smooth. I’ve only gotten to the Vatican but I really like the way it handles semi-open environments and the manner in which side-quests are uniquely tied into the main quest. 

But yeah, every time I boot it up I want to call it Indiana Jones vs. The Circle K or something, lmao"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"It's like the one recent Bethesda game that's actually good and it flew under the radar.

It's like I'm playing a classic, good Indiana Jones movie. And I enjoyed the gameplay more than I thought I would."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Damn son, that's great"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I just started it this morning and the voice acting is so great. Like I was talking to Antonio and the one Vatican dude came in and gave us shit and left than Antonio raspberried like ""man this guy's a cunt but I'm a priest so I can't say anything"". It was such a great little scene."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Had a blast playing. Wish I played it in stealth, but I just love the knuckle brawling."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,It’s very unfortunate but I can’t play this due to motion sickness from first person games. It looks great and I’m a big Indy fan. Glad that others are digging it though. 
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I saw it and thought oh this looks like a weird cash grab kind of deal for a game, It’s great to hear people are enjoying it might have to take a closer look."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Once I leave my trusty 1080ti I can’t wait to play it!!
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Best game I’ve played this year by a mile. Cannot wait for more like this.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"This game is the most enjoyment I've had from a game in a long time. It's like playing in an Indiana Jones movie. I tell everyone I know with a console, they need to get this."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Waiting to get it and glad to see it's actually good
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Was too short imho. Still loved it.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I haven't finished it yet, but it's insane how much this game has just blown through my expectations. I set the bar real low, only reason I even started playing it right away was because it was on game pass. But Hot diggity, this was the addition to the Indiana Jones franchise I had been waiting for. I honestly hope that they are not done and that they are cooking up another great adventure for us."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Finished it couple of nights ago 35 hours to complete, way more fun than I ever expected. Didn’t even know it was light immersive sim when going in, nor the semi open world maps.

Easy 9/10 and one of the best game I played this year. 

Troy Baker deserves the voice acting award for the game awards 2025 100%.

Voss is one of the best villain in a long time. « I know KARA-TE! » 

The fighting system once it clicks is actually quite good. The fighting arena showed it to me. On hard difficulty.

Path tracing in this game is one of the best running performance one I’ve seen. Thank god for ID tech."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"When I was a kid I played Indiana Jones and the fate of Atlantis. It was one of my first introductions to video games and my first point and click adventure (along with ""Day of the Tentacle"")

I used to revisit that game every few years for nostalgia and then my brothers got me this game for my birthday. As a new father to a 8 week old baby I also don't get a ton of game time but I have been actively sacrificing the little sleep I get to play this. 

The game is amazing"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,So good. Despite how many artifacts there in this game I’m surprised I haven’t found a SINGLE Bethesda Easter egg.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I’m just bummed it’s not on Xbox one
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Except for the game breaking bug after the >!snake fight!<
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Surprised at the compliments here. My friends said it was boring due to all of the stealth bits and very poor AI. I'll have to download it.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I loved the ending too it hit real hard when the music hit
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Kinda? It's absolutely amazing. The most fun I've had on a new game in ages. It's very true to the franchise and just an awesome game overall. Loved every second of it and my only issue is that I've got no more story to do until the dlc. Really hope they make more Indiana Jones games in this style.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Is this a screenshot from screenshot mode or whatever, or a screenshot from the actual gameplay? Or a prerendered cutscene?"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I got this game . And holy smokes the biggest surprise of the year … game is a solid 8.5/10
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"The game is genuinely a phenomenally crafted experience. I admittedly thought it was going to be bad, just based on Lucasfilm’s current track record for games, and Machine Games’ last few entries have been spotty.

I cannot be more thrilled to be so fundamentally wrong. The game is an absolute *blast!* It’s charming, heartfelt, funny, looks and sounds astounding, while having genuinely outstanding gameplay design.

There will be *a lot* of competition, but this is definitely 2025’s first GOTY contender. It is such a great game. Even Phenomenal - I argue."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,My only knock is that the combat is kinda clunky. But it plays like I'm watching an Indiana Jones movie. 
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I want an Alabama Jones skin so bad now.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I'm a toddler of two dads and I work 97 hours a week...  can we ban posts that start like that?
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Except that you can't play this game without a ray tracing card.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Is the gameplay any good really or is it just, OH MA GAWD path tracing?"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Started last night and have been having a blast. Blown away
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Agreed, it's incredible.

I thought it looked terrible from the trailers and promotional materials. It's suffered from what the old Batman Arkham games did in that the game is so good because it makes you actually feel like Indy. Getting that message across in trailers and demos is impossible.

Love the first person perspective too, and I was criticising that during the reveal. It feels like one of those old 90s/00s movie tie ins that's first person and just focuses on being an amazing game rather than showcasing a licenced character model.

I'm still early on in the game but feels like it could be the best movie tie in since Alien Isolation."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,It’s like playing a movie. The coolest gaming experience I’ve had in a long time. The nostalgia is a big part of it.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"i really wanted to play it but after an hour because of the pov my head was spining and hurled actually. no matter how i changed it didnt help me so, i probably watch it from youtube"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,This is the first game I’ve achieved 100% completion on in a long time. Very few bugs throughout the whole game.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Is it as good as Fate of Atlantis?  That's still my all-time favorite Indiana Jones story, movies included."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"It’s my GOTY. Perfectly paced. Funny, scary, and exhilarating. It makes me feel like we finally got a fourth Indy movie (that I’d place 2nd or 3rd best in the series— def better than Temple)"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Oh! It immediately made me feel like I'm watching an Indy movie again!!!
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,It’s kind of boring ngl it’s not a bad game but I find myself losing interests after playing for an hour
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,It's fantastic. I'm having a blast with it.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I was skeptical when I saw the gameplay trailer for this game but wow has it blown me away. So immersive and the puzzles are fun.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Dude, I can't get enough of this game, I spent about 30 hours alone just exploring and collecting absolutely everything in the Vatican was so much fun :D.
From what I can tell I only have one thing left to find (it shows on my map, but my stats say I have everything so who knows lol"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,It’s amazing I’m also a dad with limited time. This is the first game in a couple years I’ve thoroughly enjoyed playing for 30 minute instances without feeling overwhelmed yet I’m really engaged
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Do you mean Great Circle?
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Who said something different?
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I’m bloody loving it. Playing it handheld on a ROg Ally X
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I love it I am unfortunately stuck at an area where you have to shimmy in a tight space and can’t advance the game.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I love Indiana Jones, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis was my favorite game as a kid. I'm building a new computer that will actually be able to run this soon... So onto my wishlist it goes!"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I stopped playing after a glitch kept taking me back to an excavation site. Was having a great time so I was pretty annoyed.

Just too many games in the playlist to spend time working around a bug 🤷🏻‍♂️"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,It's very good. I wasn't expecting it to be like Thief. Not very Indy-like but I had fun sneaking around Rome hitting fascists with a shovel.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Game is amazing. Takes everything it inspired in games like Tomb Raider and Uncharted and delivers a very polished cinematic experience. I cant wait for the next indie game.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Is it truly an open world game?
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"It's definitely designed with fun in mind, too. So many fun things to brain Nazis with, and just looking around and interacting with the environment is such a joy."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Glad to keep hearing good things. I honestly thought this game would be a complete disaster.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,It’s the best Indiana Jones product in years. After the snooze fest Dial of Destiny was I thought the franchise would be done forever.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Kinda amazing? This game is fucking awesome
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"It's fucking fantastic, so impressed."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"It's a game that could have easily been not worth mentioning that came and went, but it was surprisingly fun as well with a lot of polish. It's just a solid adventure game moreso than an action game. Like most of the time it just plays as a first person Legend of Zelda, it's just fun.

But the graphics for what it offers is fantastic. The art design is also incredible, like I was taking in all of the sets and little background things because it never feels like they repeated a single thing."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Best game in 10 years
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Bro yessss. It’s so good. I’ve been telling everyone. I’m kind of sad for the game that it came out at the very last minute of 2024 to even be considered for game of the year. Not that it is, but it should be talked about."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,It perfectly captures everything great about Indiana Jones and puts you in his shoes. I’m loving it.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,My wife and I are having a blast. Not really anything new but all parts are really well done. It's also gorgeous
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I haven't tried it yet... per-say. I feel like I've been holding back due to the lack of an open-world feel. Can anybody give their take?
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Wish i could finish it, the damn ladder/vine bug broke the game.

I WANT TO FINISH THE GAME"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Never seen a more detailed face in a PC game than this one.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,It’s a pretty good game. I love Jonesing in Indiana 
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Yeah. Whoever was in charge of marketing this game should be fired.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Indiana Jones and the Golden Corral is one of my favorite games in a long time
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I’ve only played the first mission, and about halfway through the second, and it’s incredible. So much attention to detail, The entire first mission had me grinning ear to ear the whole way through, and even found a reference to the ride at Disneyland, which I was not expecting."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"The story is great, and it's mostly pretty fun, but damn does it have some of the worst enemy AI I've ever seen in a video game. It's a really good game but it is not a great game."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I love the Father Gallagher Adventures!
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Yeah, download this on gamepass with knowing nothing about it. Didn't expect much from a movie license game, but it's really great."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Is the game ready to play or wait for more patches ? Rally wanted to try this one but was waiting for some updates to the game so it wont run like shit
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Why actually?
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I wish I got into this one more. I love Indiana Jones and the game has great presentation. I just find it so boring I can’t get into it.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Yup MachineGames killed it again. The gameplay loop is super fun picking up items and bashing baddies. It made me think they could make a great Fallout game if given the reigns. Also it made me think how cool a first person MGS could have been (I enjoy sneaking)
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I’ve been trying to play this on Xbox series X and I’m not even an hour into it and I’ve had the game freeze three times and also a key item got stuck in the floor. Think I’m gonna play something else for a while and circle back after it gets patched
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Is the “bad ai” not too distracting?
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,RTX3060 here…. Better luck next time
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Similar situation. I like it and I'm just playing on game pass.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"This and animation are honestly the best way for Disney and Lucasfilm to continue the franchise. I just don’t think you can pull off a James Bond and recast Indy. So much of Indiana Jones’s mannerisms are Harrison Ford. And it’s been too long since the movies debuted. He’s so much a part of popular culture for them to recast without a huge backlash. Look no further than the hassle that was Solo.

At least for as long as Ford is alive, they shouldn’t recast in live action. Animation and Video Games should be the way forward for this iconic character."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I love kingsman 2 as well
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"I need few add-ons with 3 different hubs per add-on. I need more difficult decoding/puzzles. I need more fighting and longer dungeons. I’d love to see another one with larger maps and the possibility to travel anytime. Maybe coming back to the university to do research, maybe more prolonged side-quest ( other enemy’s mad scientist/archeologist, other artifacts to bring to the museum) and please more intense PvE scenes. I do wanna shoot about 100 nazis throwing grenades at me mag dumping MG-42 at me to get out of a stage."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,Hands down Troy Baker's best performance.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,I am hoping for a sequel or a series of games because this was so amazing. I’m already on a second play through.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,I’m quite enjoying it
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,One of the few games i've 100% just because it's fun.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,This game does a good job of making me feel dumb. I think I've over thought every single puzzle they've given me.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"There's no Golden Circle, it's Great Circle"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,Well I'm on Ps5 so..
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"So it's a solid 7? (This is high praise, I swear)"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,Great Circle too
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,Can't wait for the PS5 release! Luckily it's not that long of a wait. Hope y'all keep enjoying it.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,I’m glad this turned out. Indie deserves a great triple A release
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,It’s the kind of games we need but don’t get
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"Im not hugely familiar with Indiana jones, do you think I’d like it? I like adventure games like fallen order so I’m interested"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,Great Circle is amazing and fun
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,Great game when you don't get hit with game breaking bugs
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,When see post that calls the game The Golden Circle it reminds of Fucking DSPgaming he calls it golden circle when its The Great Circle
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"Was in the same boat, was amazing"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"The only thing I really disliked about the game so far is the dog shit detection AI.  

These enemies are absolutely brain dead sometimes."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"Agreed, One of the best games of this generation. I hope it gets its due with fandom and good sales. Xbox did an absolutely poor job in promoting this game and I fear the game will pay the price for it. What they showed was a clunky, stealth game with awkward hand to hand combat and no guns. The game is anything but! It's a smooth, well-made and tightly woven immersive sim - for an Indy game, who would have thunk?! - and it nails almost everything it sets out to do gameplay wise while telling an awesome story that fits the series as a whole.

I hope everyone gives this game a shot. You won't be disappointed. Machine Games has once again delivered a classic!"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,Now if they just fix that one Gina bug with the missing kid so I can play the rest of the game.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"It's such a fun game, I'm loving all the puzzles and little secrets to find, keeps my brain guessing. I love ancient history so this game was a must to play."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,Is game of the year worthy and needs a sequel
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"I haven't finished it yet, but hope to over the Xmas break.  But geez the first few hours in have been incredible.  It just like pure Indy from the start.  Much better than the last two movies.  I would have loved Ford to have voiced him, but he probably didn't think it would be this good.  It made me smile within minutes, it just feels so epically Indy.  This isn't just a Star Wars: Outlaws IP cash in (not shading on that game, just pointing out that it felt more formulaic and IP cash in), it's a labour of love from devs who clearly love Indy.  If you are a fan of Indy or adventure, please give it a try!"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,Cant wait to play it on PS5. Id tech is something else...
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"I’m still hunting for ideal settings for a 4K monitor and a 4090. Path Tracing really kills performance, DLSS with HDR on is buggy."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,Those cut scenes are like whole other film!
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"The details in this game is amazing. I spent time going around Marshall College, looking around the displays in the exhibition and bulletin boards. The game really captures the 1930’s atmosphere really well."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,It won game of the year right?
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,it is indeed! agreed!
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"Like, uncharted tier? Because if so I might give it a buy"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,I just left the second location after a couple hours and it really is a great game. Feels like uncharted.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,Surprised at how (so far) there have been no QTE sections like in most cutscene heavy story games
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,Anyone know if/when this will come out for PS5?
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"Such a fun game, love the puzzles and mysteries. The setting is also incredible, different maps and all. Would love some more of this!"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,God I've been wanting to play this game more than I want to be alive
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"I just wish I had a Ray Tracing GPU to be able to play it… Don’t get me wrong, it looks good, but having to drop $400+ on a new GPU to run 1 game just isn’t in the cards."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,Are people saying it’s not?
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"Was enjoying it till I got to the Vatican and all the shadows are messed up for me. Hopefully it's fixed, but if not. Oh well"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,Is it better than uncharted?
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,I've noticed people keep calling it golden circle. I guess that kingsman movie is stuck in everyone's head.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,Everything one would want... Minus a third person perspective.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"aCsHuAlLiY aMäZiNg
I haven't seen anyone, who really dislikes the game, so yeah what a take."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"I have heard so many good things about this game and this type of adventure game is right up my alley, have no means to play for the next year or so unless it comes to cloud streaming, but excites regardless.  Glad you get to have fun! :)"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,I heard the words modern audience and noped out.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"someone please help me on this game, im trying to post and it wont let me"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,Bethesda after realizing they should stick to passion over profit: 😯
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,kinda amazing enough to have me sink 16 hours into it first time i played it
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"Some janky character models in the cutscenes, but it's a fun game."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-25,Great face scans and visuals
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-25,"Is 'Golden' Circle just a typo/auto-correct, or is it actually called the Golden Circle in some countries? For me it says 'Great' Circle."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-25,I never realized just how many people Indy beats to death in the movies... like you know how hard you have to hit someone for their rifle stock to break over their heads?
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-25,Waiting for ps5 version… can’t wait.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-25,"I wanted to try out, but the first-person aspect couldn't convince me."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-25,Just finished it. God. I hope it's not years before another game like this shows up.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-25,"doesn't suck = amazing /s .

God I hate absolutist black and white takes. 

You know you can just say it's ""good"". You don't have to be that desperate to justify your purchase by lying about how good the thing you like really is."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-26,Golden Circle is a good brand of juice.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-26,Was wondering if this is any good
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-26,You can also throw people around which is fun
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-27,Graphics looks insane
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-31,"I legit don’t understand the unanimous critical and public praise. I had to force myself to finish it in the hopes that I’d finally understand. It’s got very high highs but too many lows. Outside of brilliant cutscenes, the open zone gameplay was so inconsistent. The stealth genre is one of my favorites, so my biggest complaint is how heavily it relies on a stealth system that, between daft AI and terrible combat encounters simply doesn’t work. If it were primarily linear sequences followed by treasure hunts, it’d worked better for me. It’s also being praised for its visuals, but on XSX the lighting issues and pop-in frequently break immersion."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Le hidden gem
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I have not seen 1 advertisement for this game. Whichever studio is behind this has the most abysmal marketing I’ve ever seen for such a highly praised game
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Does it belong in a museum?
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Good fun game and a a very decent Indiana Jones story to go along with it; I’d definitely enjoy a movie of the same plot. 
The characters are fun and well played by the actors. The story/plot is classic IJ with all the deep dives into ancient history, lost treasures, and hidden temples. Plus there’s just enough silliness mixed into the cutscenes it to fit nicely into an IJ movie and break up the serious tone every so often. 

Combat is a bit meh I found and it’s either too easy or the enemies just dogpile you and make it no fun. Kinda reminds me of Dishonoured without the magic side. 
The bullwhip is excellent fun though and the sound of it is perfect. 

Best part for me was the level designs though. The open worlds are quite good and full of things to do. The tombs, temples etc are amazing though; especially the scale/aesthetics of some of them and the imagery it gives off."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Cool bot accounts spamming this game over and over all across Reddit
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,If it wasn't for the constant bugs I had in the final level it would have been my GOTY
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Alabama Jones
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,very good but they decided to exclude 60% of the world by not allowing non ray tracing gpu's ... bad mistake tbh.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Far too many unskippable cutscenes for me. Also a dad of two who will turn on for an hour every few days.

Press ‘X’ on object, 2 minute cutscene. Walk across room, press ‘X’ on another object, 5 minute cutscene. Turn around, press ‘X’ to speak to someone, another 5 minute cutscene."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"Animations are clunky as hell, gameplay involves loads of QTE, visually not impressive. Let's hope plot is interesting because first impression isn't good.

I think visually even uncharted 4 from 2016 is superior."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Game of the year.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I’m not super far into it due to a mix of the holidays, playing other games, and just taking my time exploring everywhere I can. This game does a really good job of getting you sidetracked and going off on other adventures. I’ve put at least four hours into just exploring the Vatican, and now I’m in Giza and who knows how long I’ll be in there, it’s a *huge* area to explore!"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I really enjoyed it, it did feel incredibly long though. I was honestly ready to finish the game around 2/3 of the way through, but it just kept going.

I usually enjoy longer gones and this was great, but felt a little strung out."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I maybe only completed 2-3 games this year. Started a bunch but nothing really hooked me. I couldnt put this game down. My personal GOTY for sure. So much fun.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Most of these ""woke games"" are."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,What the heck is Golden Circle?  Haven't heard about it.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I was so excited to finally get a good successor to emperor’s tomb but they just had to ruin it by making it first person
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Yeah… must be nice. *turns back to ps5*
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I’m looking forward to the PS Drop
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Should’ve been 3rd person.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,PS5 doesn't have it yet.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,As a card carrying member of r/patientgamers I will be sure to check it out in 2030
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,It's an amazing game. But it has horrible ending tho
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,*Great Circle.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Now how much it cost to get it to look like that while playing?
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Unskippable cut scenes killed it for me, turned off after half an hour. I want to game. If I wanted to watch a movie, I would have put on a movie."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"I lost my enthusiasm when I read it was first-person.  Noooooooooooooooooo

So not everything a fan would want."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Its a piece of shit, and should not be supported by any real pc gamer.

This game has hard gates in place that have never been seen before, ever. All signs of this point toward tiered performance like consoles coming to pc.

Disgusting. Worst ""pc game"" ever released, and a sign that this hobby is truly over."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I finished it yesterday, easily one of the great games of the year. Would gladly preorder a sequel"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"A friend described it as ""The surprise Immersive sim of the year."" Which made me really want to check it out."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,too bad no one cares  about it lol
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,100% - it’s a really immersive experience! One of the better pop culture games ever for me.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Troy Baker however, is a terrible Indiana Jones. Idk why devs have this obsession with him. Hes played everyone in the Batman universe and has sounded nothing like them."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"The so-called gaming experts on Reddit were quick to criticize this game when the gameplay trailer dropped, but I’m glad these pseudos are being proven wrong. The game is doing really well.

Edit: Lmao getting downvoted for telling the truth."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Honestly can't wait to play it in like 2 years after buying it for like $10
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Wouldn’t know. fucking ray tracing requirements on my pc….
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Can’t wait to play it on PS5.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,The graphics look very underwhelming for 2024
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"It’s a great game but not worth $70 imo. Got it for free with a new laptop but if I hadn’t, I’d wait for it to go on sale."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Probably the most boring game ever made but okay.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,Movie Game zzzzzzzzzzz
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,It’s my game of the year holy shit I can’t stop thinking about it. I’m not done and I’ll want to do is explore everything
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"gamepass version is an absolute disaster though. lots of features don't work, crashes constantly. for me its unplayable as of now."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Lol. You must only play Xbox huh!? 

Try some other games it's good but definitely not an amazing experience lol"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,“Great” circle. Only thing holding me back from playing the game is the title. Just couldn’t come up with a grabber of a title eh?
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I've been watching the cutscenes on YouTube. Honestly it's great how similar it feels to just straight watching a new Indiana Jones movie. I can confidently say, it beats Temple of Doom, Crystal Skull, and Dial of Destiny. It does sit below Last Crusade and Raiders, but I'd put it closer to those two than against the ones that sucked.

Couple of gripes:

* Face animations look weird sometimes

* Dialogue is occasionally awkward or poorly written 

But all totally forgivable in remembering this was made as a game not as a movie"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"It's actually ""great""."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,Never watched the movies and I gotta say the game doesn't look interesting to me. Mostly because it's another game that doesn't understand first person. When they make fov +100 everytime it's just annoying.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,You don't even know the name of it lol.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Personally I’ve wrote off most of MS games save for Flightsim. This game totally surprised me. I’ve become that kind of gamer that keeps adding to my backlog but realistically puts 30mins to an hour into a game and never touches it again. 

Indiana Jones really surprised me. Playing it on a high end PC for one, the game looks shockingly good. If not for the 60 fps cap in the cinematics you would think you’re watching an actual Indiana Jones flick. The set pieces the story the sheer immersion of it all - is just insane. I did not expect to like this game as much as I do"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"because it's based on a boomer IP  
with horrible dialogue and story  
every ressitance leader is a either a rich boss woman or a 1 woman army type of boss woman  
the only intresting character randomly turns gay  
super high GPU requirement  
high price tag  
all the ""intense cut scenes"" play out like a cartoon  
punching does more damage than guns...  
horrible annual timing  
  
yeah man gee I wonder why it was such a flop, it will forever be a mystery to us all. Surely this is the 9/10 game of the century we've all been needing."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Idk man, even xqc didn't like the game. It looked way too boring and slow"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23, On principle I refuse to pay 70$ for any title no matter how cool it is.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Something can’t be “kinda” amazing. It’s either amazing or it’s not.

1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Last time I checked Bethesda also worked on the new Wolfenstein series. This games were fun to play and had a fantastic story. I’m not surprised this is doing so well.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Damn exclusives 😭

1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Ff7 rebirth was my game of the year, played this as I seen the good feed back but honestly I didn't have any hope for it. It is totally after taking my game if the year, the level of detail humour and just all around fun this game has is fantastic. Some jaw dropping moments as well. Also Troy Baker should definitely get an a award"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"i want to play but i put a limit for games to be max 80gb & it is 120gb

i have 2 exeption in game baldur's gate 3 thers is a lot to do there & halo the master chief collection 5 game together is big"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Games journalists have been saying this game is great. It’s people on Twitter and YouTube that have been trying to crap on it for no reason. Maybe listen to the pros
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Im trying to upload THE funniest picture of G-man, ever, but my comment karma is too low to post.

1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Im having a lot of fun playing this game. But man, this has to be worst optimized game I played in my life. Graphics does not justify huge performance problems. Many times it just looks mediocre but still runs like stutter fest."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Wokege
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Nah
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Indiana Jones had 12 too many movies.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I’m one of the seemingly rare Star Wars fans that don’t really care much at all about Indiana Jones. I’ve seen all of them and feel like my favorite is the Indiana Jones ride at Disneyland. Do you suppose it’s a good enough game that a *very casual Indiana Jones enjoyer would still like it?

I only ask because: I love Star Wars more than anything. Star Wars Outlaws comes out and I am in love. No game has felt more like I’m in Star Wars than that one. I’m thinking easy hit, easy sequel. 

Turns out I’m way off. People complain about it, suck at the stealth missions and it doesn’t sell well. I’m thinking I’m in love with it just because I’m a huge Star Wars fan and they really nailed that part of the game.

Edit: downvotes? really? It’s an honest question. I’m curious if it’s a good game in its own right or if it’s a good game just for Indiana Jones fans."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Troy Baker deserves an award honestly
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I kinda groaned when they revealed it was gonna be Troy Baker but fuck me, I totally get it after hearing him in it. I probably would've picked him out of a blind audition as well lmao."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Harrison Ford guest starred on the Game Awards the other week and joked ""If I knew he (Troy) was gonna do that good of a job, I would have done the voice myself!"".

The funny thing is Todd Howard didn't want Troy for the role and admitted he only picked him as test audiences liked him the most...which is exactly what happened with Harrison Ford and George Lucas 😂"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I honestly thought it was some AI enhanced impersonator or something. Blew my mind that it's Troy Baker
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Equally impressive is David Shaughnessy as Marcus Brody (who was played by the late Denholm Elliott).
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Honestly they should hire voice actors to replicate those roles instead of dragging the originals out.  It's not like harrison ford sounds the same decades later
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"There's some parts of it that could be better, but overall it's pretty damn amazing."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I couldn’t believe it wasn’t. I was convinced that Ford did it himself and maybe they de-aged it with AI. I think I audibly gasped when I saw it was Baker. I have always thought he did phenomenal work but this was above and beyond. I agree he deserves all the recognition here
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"> you would think Harrison Ford was voicing the character.

I *wouldn't* think that, because Troy Baker actually manages to sound *more* like Indiana Jones than elderly Harrison Ford does. If you don't believe me, compare [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTmBAbUl4vI) of current day Harrison Ford voicing a young Indiana Jones to Troy Baker's performance."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I must be in the minority here and maybe I've just played too many games with Troy Baker in them but I knew almost immediately it was him and can't not hear him in the voice.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I’ve not played through it yet (my backlog is too big) but I feel that it could be made into a (very long) proper film with the quality it’s at. Maybe Hollywood will take something from this and continue franchises through games and animation when the actors get too old or die.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,That’s why Troy’s the best.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I legit thought is was Ford.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"yeah now we have the face and the voice, pretty please can we get a blade runner 1982 prequel and get Deckard (harrison ford) the recognition he deserves in a video game. Thanks!"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,My jaw dropped when I paused to check if it was Harrison
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,People keep saying this but all I hear is Troy baker lol
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Yea he killed it spot on performance
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Indiana Jones is easily game of the year IMO

I’m rarely this impressed about how much spot on details and love went into a game. It’s easy to tell that those who made this game love the Indiana Jones franchise and actually created one of its best stories so far. 10/10"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Really? I’m constantly disappointed with the voice
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I thought it was Harrison Ford
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"The inflection points and excitement in his voice when he has his ""eureka"" moments are amazing, they nail the feeling of the old movies perfectly."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,I think Ford has a pretty easy voice to imitate for deep voiced actors
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"Yeah, Baker did an incredible job. There were times when you could tell, but you have to concentrate hard and do mind gymnastics to differentiate. He is a terrific VO."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,It’s the same for the German version; really great voice acting by Florian Clyde (who already voiced young Han Solo) who perfectly captures the tone of the movies.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"Wait, it isn't? Totally had me fooled."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-25,I don’t know how to describe it. I knew it was Troy Baker as soon as I heard the voice in some of the review videos but it’s still a very respectable and convincing sounding Harrison Ford.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Old Harrison Ford voicing young Indy in The movie was very cringe
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Too bad the writing is shit (avengers writing syndrome) and everyone acts like a smartass and make jokes at everyone else's expense. Doesn't feel Indiana johnesy.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"We have ai that can clone voices now. This should be trivial. They don’t even need to be paying a voice actor at all. They could have just cloned Harrison Ford’s voice from all of his numerous movies.

Edit: You can downvote me all you want, but it won’t change the fact that what I’m saying is true. Go over the eleven labs web site and clone your own voice if you don’t believe me."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Looks like we’ve come full Circle
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I am so happy that Indiana Jones Golden Circle has positive reviews. I been a fan of Indiana Jones as a kid it seems it captures the magic of the movies I'm glad for Troy Baker
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,The dogs name was great
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"This is the one issue I had with the game. I enter a new room, and I want to check for collectibles and just look around the carefully crafted environment.

The NPC rushing me every 5 seconds to check out this lever or switch they found... fucking shut up already."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Lol a few hours earlier someone commented about how little handholding there is in this game.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Just like in GoW Ragnarok. I enter a room and decide to look around and all of a sudden Atreus says ""What if you threw your axe over there? That might work."" It's petty and pretty minor but it constantly pulled me out of the game."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Havent tried this game but I had that issue with Hogwarts Legacy. It annoyed the crap out of me so that's a little disappointing to hear.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"Damn

I hate handholding 

There should be an option to ask an NPCs opinion as a trigger to get a hint"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I think this game will really benefit from sequels - tweaking the mechanics, Troy getting more into Indy - I loved it and I want a whole trilogy. I just finished it and the only thing that got me were some of the fighting sequences felt a bit clunky, but honestly what a great game! First game in ages I've completed, I wish every licensed game was this much fun. 

I loved that you could largely just explore and didn't have to end up killing a million people if you didn't want to, and I loved the little nods to the movies from the lighting to the lens flair being accurate.. loved it! Would love a kinda dark occult one next, a nod to Temple would be great.."

1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I think it’s the best licensed game I remember since way back when Butcher Bay came out and blew my little mind on Xbox.  Just so high effort on every level, you can feel it"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,The one liners while he’s beating people up are absolutely hilarious.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,The latter half of what you mention rings so true and it’s so lame
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Id tech engine game! 
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I remember how people were freaking out over the recommended system specs before launch, and it mostly ended up being completely overblown concern."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Runs perfectly? That’s not the case for many of us. I experienced a crash every 20 minutes before the last patch. Huge FPS drops that require toggling DLSS on and off.

Forums are full of these complains."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"My buns are bakin, who’s got the butter? A game that runs as intended on release???"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,60fps and looking great on series s - pretty magical!
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Yeah this is one of the true 4k60fps games we were promised when the Series X launched. The game performs so damn well on Xbox.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"The polish is very noticeable, had pretty much zero issues and it’s been a blast!"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"But the ""ai"" of the enemies in the movies is exactly the same, it just contributes even more to the feeling that you're in and Indy movie"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"You can knock out the back enemy of two enemies who are *having a conversation* and the front one won’t notice 🤣

I’m having a blast with this game."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"The AI being dumb is a feature to me. Makes the game hilarious at times. Gotta go in fists blazing if you want to take on the AI in a ""fair"" fight. Stealth Indy has plot armor."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"I read a review, I think it was wired, which criticised the raiders opening tutorial, and I just couldn’t believe there would be any legitimate criticism of that, it was just what the game needed to settle me into it."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Nice thought, otherwise a game you could potentially get bored by in the opening sequence and not give it a proper chance. Grips the player from the start"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,Runs great on mine
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,It runs fine on mine
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I solved all the puzzles and found everything without looking anything up - that's good for me, I tend to find the puzzles in games to be the thing I struggle with the most lol - it feels like uncharted often has needlessly complex puzzles (maybe that's just me) but these felt logical"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Look, I love God of War. I'm a Playstation fan.

But when I was playing this game I couldn't stop thinking that the way they went about puzzles in this game was to go, ""lets do the opposite of what God of War did"" 😂"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"When I think about what games I’ve played this year, I don’t feel like any of them really did any hand holding honestly"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Its almost a dishonoured type immersive sim. 

So that means it will have low sales, good but not great critic scores and 2 years from now it will be a ""underrated masterpiece"" on reddit and other forums."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Metacritic score is actually pretty high, isn’t it? It’s at 86 right now."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I mean it basically has a 9/10 average across the board, but yeah, probably should be even higher"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,It scored pretty well considering. Give or take a few points for the Microsoft tax and that'll be the accurate score
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Because it doesnt say Sony at the beginning
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,[deleted]
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"The weirdest thing about this game is how polarizing it was. 

Granted i havent played it yet, seeing the review across the media is somewhat weirder, at gamer centric media they praised it and so does the social media with a larger demographic of gamers, but when the normies media review it it became.... Meh. 


I just got some tweet review of great circle and most of them bashed this game for no clear reason, one says it was the DEI thing, others say it was too slow, etc. 

But i think the most problematic problem with this title is how ungodly the specs are on the pc, that is one hell of a spec that you need to run when you demand rtx40 series as minimum."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Anything to do with Xbox is gonna get a point or 2 shaved, gamers are brutal about weird shit like that for some reason"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"86-87 is low? what the fuck are you on about?

Triple A devs these days would KILL for that kind of score"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Nah, it's not a 9/10 game. 86 is a fair score"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Everything about the game is really really great except …..it’s just not that fun to play and I can’t figure out why .
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I think ir won't touch such a wide audience, huge chunk of modern gamers (usually the younger ones) is aimed at flashy action games with almost no brain usage (with no offence at all, just easiest way of description). If it were up to me this game would be contender no doubt about it. They really caught the charm and atmosphere of Indy really well."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,86 is good score tho
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"86 is usually for games that are competent without being exceptional. A goty from 5-10 years ago would probably lose 10 points if released this year and the hype diff between breath of the wild and tears of the kingdom (despite barely a change on the metacritic score) should be an indication of that.

From what I can tell the game is good and fun, but maybe kind of not very innovative. 9 or 10 should be Elden ring or Baldur's gates imo. The 9 or 10 feels more an indictment on the games industry unable to even produce 7 and 8s"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,You can return at any point. Just go to the 'Travel' tab in the menu.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Doesn't he say maybe I should wrap things up before going to the fountain?
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I know you are referring to opinion and preference, but the funny thing is if you go by current critic and audience ratings across all pieces of Indiana Jones media, its actually tied for first with Raiders of The Lost Ark, ratings wise, as both have mostly 9's!

The Last Crusade got quite a few 8's (somehow?!) which just nudges The Great Circle above it by that measurement.

Which is mental to consider as a lot of people wrote the game off before it even came out."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Fully agree!
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Personally, I would rank Fate of Atlantis as no 3, ahead of the great Circle. But in general, I agree."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I love it has side-quests...You can feel parts of there previous games in this one while still being its own thing, its great."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"BG3 humorously had called this same phenomenon out in their gameplay statistics they release occasionally 

Seems players now a days when it comes to story-enriched games genuinely can’t be bothered after 2-6 hours is essentially your tutorial (Cyberpunk) or 5% mark. Maybe it just feels daunting or maybe its decision paralysis on what to do with large options - who knows"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I'm in your ""hasn't made it out of Rome"" category, but I don't think you should consider that a failure on the game's part this soon after release. For fans of Arkane-style immersive sims like me who've been starving since 2017, this is not a game to be rushed through."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,The deeper you get into the game the more bugs you encounter. Especially ones that softlock you. Gina is horrific in the third map. I personally got softlocked in the fourth map (I could not use any equipment) and had to wait for the devs to fix it. But I did finally manage to finish it this weekend. Going to go back and 100% it later.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I had to force myself to keep playing past the 1st chapter. Mainly out of principle for having paid full price.

Reddit is a very vocal minority. With a shit ton of astroturfing."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"You know what's fucked me up about this game? I kind of realised that as an Indiana Jones fan I live in a sort of bubble.

I thought it was a waaaay more popular franchise, but the amount of streamers and people my age I'm seeing say they've never seen any of the films is way higher than I expected.

A lot are playing the opening sequence having no idea of its significance."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,really? I feel like literally everyone is talking about it
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I'm a life long Indy fan, I was hyped for the first announcement"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"It's easily in my top 10 of all time and potentially vying for the number 1 spot depending on replayability and dlc. 

I never would've expected"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"How do you even hold the controller, do you have a little baby one"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Every time I pick up a hammer and wail on a fascist I quote Abe Lincoln ""Don't break my butt!  He's breaking my butt!"""
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Let's be honest though, the alternative to having enemies not react to Gina is having to babysit an AI companion during sneaking. I much rather have what we have now. 

Though it was incredibly funny when I was sneaking through a Nazi camp and Gina was like ""We will be killed if they spot us"" only to then stand up and run right into the line of sight of every Nazi in the camp."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I'm fine with it, its a game more about the story, I dont need hard games all the time"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I’m surprised people are calling it polished. Yeah, it keeps a steady framerate, but it’s pretty buggy and unpolished otherwise."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,">The repeat of the fight dens, for example, just seems like lazy copy/paste

There's only like 3 fights in each of them, no? I wouldn't really call that repetitive or exhausting. You can also skip them without any major loss. The only thing I'd always do is buy the book that merges the health bars.

I do think that some people will get very worn out trying to get every note, mystery, artifact, etc. But the thing is, you don't have to do that unless you want to. 

Any game can feel repetitive if you're not doing content you're interested in but I have to say that I haven't really found the game content itself to be repetitive at all."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Everything you just said is true. I don’t understand why you are getting downvoted
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"People have such low expectations for games, especially triple-a IP tie-in's, that when someone does it well it is surprising...  The game is really good though.  Making me very happy seeing another great Indiana Jones story :)"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I played the game, didn’t really like it. I don’t get the hype."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Is it possible, that instead of a grand conspiracy, people just like the game"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I was 50/50 at the Vatican, really got into it after that, haven't put it down - just finished it yesterday"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,Yes.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,If you have game pass for sure! Otherwise it’s really just a 6.5 for gameplay. Story is a 9
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I personally wouldn’t pay full price for it but on gamepass it’s completely worth it
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,If you don't obsessively try and collect everything all of those issues go away
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Luckily I was able to get through it, but I did a second play through and holy hell is it bugged bad late game in Suhkothai"

1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,An indiana Jones game wouldn't be very fun if you just got shot like that sword guy in Raiders of the lost ark.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Go watch an Indiana Jones movie and count how many people he shoots
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I’m sorry, you’re not allowed to post criticism in here, you’re only allowed to say “zomg this is goty its so amazing!”"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,The game is a great display of what the idEngine can do. Shame it's not used more.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,Spring 2025 I believe.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-25,You can stream it on Xbox cloud gaming
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-25,"Nope, it’s great circle. I’m just dumb af."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-28,"thats how you get people to reply, you either gotta love it or hate it."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-28,"its a bethesda game, so if you know their style, thats pretty much what youll get with the glamour of an indiana jones IP thrown in. theres no groundbreaking gameplay, but its good for a playthrough for the story"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,It’s true though
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"There isn't really any QTE outside of the occasional one during cinematic sequences, which only compose a small amount of the game. The game starts with a lot of them but it's mostly a stealth tutorial, teaching you what buttons to press."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Agreed so far
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"No, it shouldn't."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-24,"I want it too, but I just can't do 1st person."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I'm surprised how many people are calling it ""amazing"" and ""goty"". It's pretty dang cool, but so far from being in the 9/10 zone. Glad so many folks are having fun with it though."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Huge swing and a miss on this take
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Eh. The minute to minute gameplay is still pretty mediocre. The game makes up for it with its exploration, but that was not shown in the trailers.

I’ll stick with saying it didn’t look good in the trailers."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"""can't wait""

The fact that you seem perfectly content to wait determined that was a lie"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I have lots of issues with hardware crashes. Power cycle the console, unplug it for a couple minutes and press the power button while it's unplugged, then plug it all back it and restart. I went from a crash every 10 minutes to getting an hour or so of play. It's really annoying, I think i saw it was due to a bad save"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Works fine for me
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Look man I can’t speak for much here but above temple of doom? Nah man temple of doom was amazing. You could be completely right I have no clue but so far everything I’ve seen for Indy outside the og trilogy still falls under the original trilogy.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Yeah I loved it too! (Kidding, I’m a dummy)"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I could definitely see younger generations struggling in terms of their attention span but it doesn't make it a bad game. I watched Indiana Jones a lot as a kid and this game completely captures the feel of it. It's awesome
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"You are speaking as if xqc is some gaming journalist expert with a wide taste in games. 
Just because a big streamer doesn’t like a game doesn’t mean it’s bad or boring. That’s just, like, his opinion, man 😋"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Actually it can. “Kind of” means to some extent.  So to some extent the game is awesome but in other ways it isn’t.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"On Xbox I’ve clipped a single wall, and had bandages selected but was holding a lemon, otherwise 0 issues/bugs.

1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Thats odd. I had barely any problems
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"To be honest, I haven’t got any of the bugs you mentioned"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Bethesda is both the name of a studio and a publisher (Zenimax.) People often mistake the publisher as the studio working on a game. 

Bethesda the publisher owned Id, Machine Games, etc but they are now owned by MS. MachineGames made the game, so technically Bethesda did not work on the game at all.

As far as I know this was all Machine Games, the same developer as the Wolfenstein games."

1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,It's so funny that Todd Howard so badly didn't want to hire Troy Baker but blind tests had people picking him every time.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,That wasn't Harrison Ford?
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"He genuinely is one of the best in the industry, and while the games release came out too late in the year to fit in for most of this year‘s award season, I expect him to get a few next year."

1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,The fact he's one of the most prolific VAs ever and never won at TGA for performance is pretty crazy. He has so many big roles over the years.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Has he even done anything bad?
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"also remember how good his Joker was in Arkham Origins. This year he deserved to win an award for it. The Game Awards are dumb anyway, but the fact that they nominated the voice actor from Starwars Outlaw and not Troy Baker is astonishing to me."

1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I would be shocked if he didn't win at The Game Awards next year. The game came out a little too late to be considered this year.

1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I think it's very important to break up what you focus on in games like this. Don't tackle all of the main missions and side missions together then checklist the collectibles. Instead, do maybe one main mission, explore the area and grab whatever you find, once you find or buy a book that locates certain things on or map, find the nearest side content or collectibles, do a few of those then go back to a main or side mission. Rinse and repeat."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Not sure about the downvotes but I can't agree at all. The game is about wonder and romatntacism of exploration which is ultimately where you get your 'XP' and world interaction (not just the easy combat route). It's reminiscent of point and click inspection mechanics. Combat is a means to an end and only a small part of the experience which perfectly captures the IP as a result.

As someone who didn't get the first-person aspect either (in previews), it is 100% the right choice. The detail in the world is one thing, but small things like seeing your Indy silhouette in shadow; it's just so iconic.

The idea of skipping cutscenes is valid, but to me that means your not getting into the world either and will bounce off it anyway."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Based on the rest of the comments here not having issue with any of the many shortcomings, it makes perfect sense why they aren't getting the upvotes they deserve.

The ai is really bad. The 4 character models getting recycled over and over is immersion crushing. The dated stealth mechanics are tedious. Open world feels really 2015 too. So many devs opt for an open world experience when a more linear style would have given them way more granular and meaningful control over the experience (a la naughty dog).

The story is fucking awesome. The acting is incredible. Mocap very good. Visually looks pretty solid. Runs acceptably. Puzzles are rewarding and clever.

It's an upper mid tier or lower high tier game for sure."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,It’s possible. It’s slightly suspicious that these posts keep appearing though.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I disagree. While it doesn't do anything in particular better than any other game, it has a very unique play style that doesn't feel like anything else I've ever played. And it really feels like an Indiana Jones movie in that sense (yeah a single guy can punch his way out of a fight with extremely dumb Nazis)."

But when the community revolted against his endorsement, he walked it all back and tried to say he was just trying to help smaller developers. But for the record, I think he is a phenomenal voice actor."

1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I’m just now finding this out and have somewhere around 30-40 hours in game. I never had any idea whatsoever.

1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,It came out too late to be nominated. It can be next year.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"It wasn’t that he wasn’t nominated. The nominations needed to be in by November 16th I believe. If not that date it was around that date. 

Because Indiana Jones came out in December it was ineligible and not up for awards on any category. It’s technically eligible for next year but will be forgotten because of how many games come out every year."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,My personal favorite is Higgs in Deathstranding. He was given pretty much free rein to make the personality of Higgs and he nailed it.

1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"and he did a perfect, 100% all in, job in all of them.  Hes just good at what he does."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Yeah apparently they actually fully cast **Tom Selleck** in the role and were ready to go, but then CBS ordered Magnum P.I. and told Selleck he couldn't do both.

Lucas legit didn't think Ford would be interested after the business with Ford finding Han Solo ""uninteresting"" and Ford had been in nearly all of Lucas's films. He was afraid he and Ford were gonna be typecast together like De Niro and Scorcese and he didn't want that. 

Spielberg and the rest didn't really get this as they thought Ford was a great shout.

But alas Ford didn't care about any of what Lucas was worrying about and loves Indy dearly haha"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"George Lucas didn't want to have actors and actresses he had worked with before for Star Wars, he wanted completely fresh new faces and Harrison Ford was just in American Graffiti. He bought him in to read lines during the casting of Luke and Leia, and the more George watched the rehearsals the more he felt Ford really understood and embodied the role, so they gave him the part.


Funnily enough, when Spielberg went to cast Indy, he wanted Ford but Lucas said no. He didn't want it to seem like he was typecasting roles specifically for Ford, and he still wanted a cast of fresh faces. They hired Tom Selleck, but he couldn't get out of his Magnum P.I. contract, so he couldn't do it. Spielberg circled around to Ford again and the rest is history."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-25,"I thought the same thing. I was trying to figure out how they lifted his voice from the films. Especially Raiders. Brody in Raiders is way different than Brody in Last Crusade. In Raiders he's calmer, more put together, and a near equal to Indiana, just older. By Last Crusade he's the comic relief. He's the bumbling academic who has never been out of the museum and has no idea how to act in the action set pieces. I like that in Geat Circle it's the earlier Brody that knows just as much about history as Indiana and actually helps him"
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Just because you don’t like something doesn’t mean it’s not the truth.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"No I mean Harrison Ford could have just licensed his voice to be cloned, and gotten paid the royalties for it. No need for a voice actor to fake it. The original voice still gets paid."

1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Same! In the Vatican, I was looking for possible easter eggs, maybe some stuff from the Elder Scrolls universe tucked away in some corner. The room had hundreds of little trinkets and looking around felt like the wrong thing to do because of how she was calling me over non stop."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"An adjustable hint system would benefit a lot of games. And I don't mean 'Hold left trigger to aim' hints.

This Indiana Jones game did it right when it comes to puzzles, I think. A lot of them, you can take a picture of the puzzle to get a hint. Keep taking pictures until it basically just tells you what to do, but it keeps the control in your hands."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"It could be that I didn't upgrade him enough? Honestly I'm pretty new to RPG type stuff and maybe I just didn't develop his skill tree or whatever it was enough? I felt like by the end I was getting the hang of it, but because I tried to avoid fights most of the time, those boss fights almost made me rage quit the entire game - they just went on for *ages* - and it's probably because I was underpowered? Like watching video play through's they had way more health than I did by the end lol"

1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Yeah, and all of them had plenty of combat and were kinda revolutionary in some way, and as much as I like this game, this has not any of this. Also, Elden Ring IS one of those games focused mainly on combat without need of thinking too hard about it. Most ppl do not have time to play games where you have to think, remember many things etc, nothing wrong with that, usual gamer has to work/goes to school, has family etc. Fortnite, Minecraft, Roblox, CoD, souls games, Diablo-like games,GTA, and many more games like this will draw wider audience, because these games you just can turn off anytime and not think about them, and you dont hae to invest too much continuous time into them."

1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I can relate to this. That's why I've tried RDR2 like 4 times and always stopped playing it. The insanely linear mission design kills the enjoyment every time. Can't even go back to my horse for my rifle without it failing the mission. I'll go play better games with good mission design.

I wouldn’t say it’s next gen or anything, but it is nice to get a AAA that feels pretty darn close to complete. Story is nice. I like the combat and puzzles.

This is a gaming subreddit, and people post things that they like, and this is a new game that is actually good, and better than expected. Doesn’t seem overly suspicious to me.

I would assume that those people that played it and didn’t like it, feel as if it’s marketing. Whereas if you played the game and liked it, it feels less suspicious.

I’m not totally sure either way, but I’m actually liking it so it doesn’t seem as strange to me to see other people enjoying and posting about it"

Since these doors also tend to lead to areas that require a costume change, they signpost that also.

The alternative is that you walk up to a door and press the ""use"" key and it says ""door unlocked"", becoming a typical Video Game Door. Which none of the doors in the game are for that matter, door interactions are super slick and non-modal, it's one of the best implementations I've seen outside of VR games."

1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,He’s up there along with Andy Serkis as a voice actor and motion capture artist.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,No doubt he is all in on himself and if it helps other so be it...but he has talent.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,But someone said it on the internet. That’s how you know it’s true.

It's obviously in the context of Howard not wanting to just immediately grant the role to the biggest VA name automatically, but that is what happened."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I think he just didn’t want a big, famous actor. Troy Baker is in everything and most of the time he just sounds like Troy Baker. It can be hard to hear actors you’re familiar with as anyone other than the characters you most associate with them."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Because he was worried it would become ""Troy Baker and the golden circle"" because Troy is a household name.

Though outside of nerds and weird stalkers no one actually knows who the fuck the voice actors are, Todd's probably showing he's in a little too deep."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Ah, good point."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Whats funny about that is DeNiro did his best work with Scorsese. His roles also varied greatly Raging Bull and Taxi Driver are both radically different.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"> Yeah apparently they actually fully cast Tom Selleck in the role and were ready to go, but then CBS ordered Magnum P.I. and told Selleck he couldn't do both.

I saw a special on Disney+ about Indiana Jones and they included some older footage of Selleck talking about this role. It was his choice to do either, and he felt like the show had more potential for long term work than the movie did.

As huge as Indiana Jones has been, he ended up making a LOT more money on Magnum P.I. and had steady income for years.

I think he made the right choice for him."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-25,"Correct, however, its fair to point out that Brody in Raiders and Circle is only seen at the University where he's comfortable and his skills are suited. He's an academic, not an adventurer.

I dont see him as comic relief in Crusade. I see him as someone who has very little field training/experience, and approaches it with the exuberance and excitement of a child."

1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Upgrades make a lot of difference, but you have to explore to find the books to upgrade and improve various traits. Or buy/find the pamphlets that show you the location of all the books on the map. The perks they give are probably the most important side collectables in the game.

One of them found later in the game lets you finally do a one-punch knockout from stealth, that alone is huge, wish that came a little earlier. But a lot of them just increase damage of punches and melee weps and such. Trading medicine in to doctors/vendors will get you health and stamina upgrades, so I suppose those are important collectables if you're struggling to survive as well. 

Doing the boxing ring side missions are very important as well. The do three crucial things if you find and do them early on: 1. give you guidance on where to find an enemy disguise (which dramatically alters your approach being in restricted enemy territory) 2. teach you how to properly fight with your bare hands (they get progressively harder and you have to learn how to parry+counter to make it through them all) - 3. access to extra cash and specific book upgrades."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Oh there was a bossfight that was kinda too long and boring. This fight mechanic isn't really suited for bossfights I think. But I loved punching out random enemies.

I find it funny how you included Souls games in your list next to Fortnite/GTA.

Elden Ring and Souls games in general is neither solely combat focused nor is it a ""flashy action game with no brain usage"". Exploration is just as big a part of the game as combat. And even within the combat system, you have to carefully plan your build to make it work, it's not fortnite."

1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Don't know about this guy but I saw an interview with Troy where he said he got picked because of the blind tests and Todd didn't want to hire Troy before that.
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"There are definitely moments when he sounds like Troy in this game, too. 

Don't get me wrong, overall he does an incredibly job here, especially when doing louder and sarcastic Indy. Basically whenever there's some stank on it, he sounds very close to Ford, if not identical at times, but the quieter line deliveries are more hit or miss.

I doubt anyone out there could have done better, though. Even Harrison himself would sound out of place with his current voice like he did in the de-aged opening of Dial of Destiny."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Most gamers/viewers may not know a VA by name but they ABSOLUTELY know their voice. Todd was worried people would just hear Troy Baker and it'd pull them out of it being an Indiana Jones experience, exactly how many viewers/gamers say ""OMG IS THAT SPIKE SPIEGEL/WOLVERINE?"" any time they hear Steve Blum.

That isn't a ridiculous concern, it's just that Troy does a much better Harrison Ford impression than Todd thought he would.

1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-25,"Oh I agree, but he does say in Raiders if he was younger he'd go with Indy, implying that he at least had interest in being in the field. It's more the scenes towards the end with the tank chase where he has to stop Henry to make the joke about the pen being mightier than the sword. Or how he acts surprised when Henry shoots the one guy and Henry has to admonish him that they're at war for their lives. It just always struck me as being like he was an entirely different character compared to the more collected version that was willing to talk aggressively to the US military officers. 

It's still very entertaining, but I always had a hard time reconciling these two versions of the character when I watch the movies back to back."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Sadly true.

1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Ha! I guess I just beelined the narrative - I always get a bit daunted with open/semi open world games (one of the reasons I haven't tackled the Witcher yet) I'm always driving the narrative forward, so I obviously missed a few/a lot of these side missions and it obviously made gameplay later  on a little more tricky than it needed to be."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"My only advice to give is SAVE your money from the vatican and don't get the books from the guy you get your camera from. I had to skip one of the books from the boxing ring because I simply didn't have enough money, and had spent it elsewhere. I will go back though because I didn't figure out you can smash the little lockboxes that give you lots of cash until the Pyramids, hopefully there's more of those at the Vatican I simply didn't see."

1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I love souls game I fail to see puzzle in it. I think Elden ring with puzzle would be very cool but for now it’s 80% combat in terms of time played, and most combats are mainly muscle memory so you just have to repeat the same combat until it passes. I loved it a lot really it’s the only game I played more than 100 hours for years  but I didn’t use my brain playing Eden ring.

Can’t talk about DS2 though, maybe it’s better in this regards."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I feel like on certain DAV subreddit, where if you do not praise the game as the best you get attacked immedietaly. Main focus of souls games is combat and its mechanics. Does it have great exploration? Yes. Still, main focus is combat. Also, most puzzles in Dark Souls and Elden Ring are just secrets or observation tests, not really puzzles. 

And again, cherrypicking. By ""brain off""(more like single focus) I mean you do not have to pay attention to story, storytelling, characters etc (its main focus is combat and having to think about what gear, what mechanics, what set of moves boss has is something completely different, its all part of combat), you can turn off this game, play it after a year, and all you have to do is get again in those mechanics.

 My MAIN point, which all of you gloriously ignore, is these games don't require too much of players continuous time involvement, which is suitable and perfect for ppl who cannot invest too much time in gaming. It also correlates with younger player base, where many young gamers have problem with attention."
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,Someone is insecure here
1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Ok, cherrypicking and not getting the point. How refreshing. You do realise i do not shame these games since they are one of my most  favorites? No need to feel attacked or offended. Also main article of soul games is the combat no matter how you feel about it. Also yeah, in this context it is fitting to place souls games next to fortnite etc, since my point was specifically written, you just chose to ignore it."

1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Interesting. I really like hard games like that, I even beat aeterna noctis, which if you havent played and like hard games, you should! Really challenging but so satisfying.

But Ive actually been playing this on normal difficulty. It’s weird, I like a good hard game if that’s what I’m expecting going in. But a game like this, I feel like when they just make enemies bullet (or punch) sponges and make the stealth really annoying, I don’t like it as much. So for story games like this, I usually go on normal. 

But I will keep that in mind if I get unreasonably stuck. Thanks!"

1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Oh whoops I wrote out ""currently the best"" at first and decided to go with different phrasing. I guess I didn't delete everything lol

Keeping it though under the argument that it's a budding industry (relative to other entertainment mediums) and the talent pool for VA's isn't super developed yet. I don't think it will be long necessarily for someone to come along in gaming and do exactly what Troy has done i.e. be in everything and be really good 

GOAT will be way more meaningful when there are multiple people in the discussion and all that, so ""current GOAT"" kinda cheapens it a bit and insinuates someone else should be able to get the title one day.

1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"I thought this one struck a good balance of being open but not too open, the overworld / hub areas may seem big because of the character's slow movement speed and how they are laid out, but are still relatively small. Would say most of the side ""field work"" missions in Great Circle are worth doing because they generally have additional story & dialogue attached, and even some puzzles and smaller tomb jaunts. If you skipped all those, might be worth going back to check them out. 

With something like Witcher 3, which is way more open and larger scale than this game or Witcher 1+2, I would suggest definitely suggest sticking mostly the the main story there, those stories and choices are the real draw. Some of the actual side quests are very good, however. 

If you do ever get around to it, will say my enjoyment of Witcher 3 went way up after disabling all the POI ? markers on the maps - most of that stuff is just an overwhelming distraction and pure filler, there becomes hundreds of those littered about as you progress - it's better to just find and do whatever minor side content you come across naturally in that world when getting from point to point for the main story, if you're off the beaten path or when you see something in the actual world that looks intriguing and want to get a closer look, or find a bounty for a big monster and want to help take it down, that sort of thing."

AI is still going to be a massive net positive for humanity, especially if we use it to cure cancer and other diseases."

Im not shiting on anyone, I like these games too, but you would have to turn your inner Karen and try not to search for things to get mad about, moreso if you do not understand a bit.

1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,"Same here.  It was actually my first JRPG, having only played western RPGS up to that point.  I remember being completely turned off by it expecting something like Dragon Age, but anime... But after about 3 hours it just clicked, and I ended up staying up all night and most of the next day playing it.  I adore JRPGs now and have played most of what's available from SNES and onwards."

1hkh3xe,2024-12-23,2024-12-23,I'm not reading that. I'm too busy with my active life to appreciate the game you're playing.

When cars were invented, a whole lot of horses and blacksmiths lost their jobs and had to find new things to do.

12g95k,2012-11-01,2012-11-01,im sure this got forwarded right to the guy in charge...
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Age of Mythology is going to bring back memories.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Man, I wish they'd do a Master Chief Collection style package for Gears Of War. Seems like a no-brainer with a prequel coming out."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,that albion music did take me back to a better time in gaming.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Expedition 33 looks phenomenal
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Looks like a heavy metal concert poster
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Stalker 2 and Doom are the standouts for me.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,NEW DOOM?? NEW DOOM! Looks fucking great.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Silksong will never come out…
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Perfect Dark looks so good but so many games lack an actual release date. Why are we seeing ""Coming 2024"". We're in June already"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I really hope state of decay is a true co-op that was such a cool game but was deterred when our progress didn’t carry together playing with friends
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I am very excited to see Marcus and locusts again in gears of war e day.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,If perfect dark is getting rebooted I’m still rooting for a banjo Kazooie return
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I wanted a Fenix collection but a prequel is the next best thing
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,That Dragon Age Trailer dissappointed me so hard…I am a huge fan. Waiting for the Gameplay Trailer bc that Trailer was not good. What in the Suicide Squad was that. Really.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Atomfall does not look bad at all.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Wow they sure are chasing a new demographic with that Dragon Age trailer.  I feel bad for the fans who have been waiting so long.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,RIP bioware most likely
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I am so pumped for MGS:D.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"I will say they had a ton of stuff to show, tons of games and a lot looking really great. Not a lot of fluff in between, totally solid show!

Special shoutout to Expedition 33 showing turn based games on the Xbox stage!"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,That Diablo cinematic was great.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Age Of Mythology lets fucking go
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"I'll have to look up the Stalker 2 trailer (if one), but man... Dragon Age... wtf?  Can't tell if it's EA exec's or Bioware, but I don't know how that studio is going to keep its doors open after this.  Apparently, Anthem chapter two is their desire."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Is it me or is the name of the Indiana Jones game really silly?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Machinegames: ""We make games about killing nazis. That's all we do."""
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,So excited for the new Life is strange! Max is back.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"That was a great showcase, with very little filler. I'm also hyped as fuck for E Day."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Presently surprised by Gears Of War trailer, it seems the majority of games are targeting 2025."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Still no release date for Avowed, Fable, and Indy."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Looking forward to Fable, Age of Mythology and Stalker"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Dragon Age in particular looked bad enough to draw parallels to a F2P game
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Better showcase than summer game fest tbh
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I was hoping for metro 4 but im happy for doom
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"All in all, a pretty damn good showcase imo."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Honestly really liked most of it. Disappointed by the style and tone Dragon Age seems to be going for, but shoot, I dug a lot of everything else."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I’m probably out of the loop but why is WoW at the Xbox showcase? Is it just because they’re a Microsoft product?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I guess this means the Fallout 3 and Oblivion remake/remaster that's long been rumoured isn't happening then? 😞
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,when is MSFS 2024 coming out?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,This was the most impressive showcase I've seen in a very long time.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,That Doom one intrigues me
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Such an amazing line up of games
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Pretty damn good showcase, if I have to say so myself. Certainly a lot more interesting stuff shown off here than on Friday's Summer Games Fest, that was a big nothing-burger."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"They’ve given up on Dragons Age. That trailer looks like a launch trailer you’d see the week before the game drops, just to remind you it’s coming out. No care shown to build up the story, art style looks last minute and rushed. Unfortunate."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Haven’t they been teasing Fable for like 4 years now?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Was praying for updates on Wolf Among Us 2 and Outerworlds 2 but welp
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,[removed]
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I'd like to play the Indiana Jones game.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Dragon Age is going to be so disappointing
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"I think the reason they didn't give a release fate yet for Indiana and Awowed is too place it perfectly so they don't release close to other big games. Easier to do it after this Showcsse frenzo with all the different devs. It is my opinion, but I could totally be wro g."

1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Mixtape looks exceptional
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"so much hitting game pass day 1, we are spoiled"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Still no release date for state of decay 3..... that's pretty lame. TBH it was the only game I was excited for, maybe expedition 33."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Dragon age veilguard huge disappointment. I think BioWare is finished after this title. Not even sure if they’ll even make the next mass effect. In all honesty that might be a good thing
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,We're never getting a new Banjo game
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"This showcase was a slam dunk; game after game, genre after genre. Xbox really needed this to hit a home-run and they did. Not sure if it will save them from their death spiral, but it was a good game show at least."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,State of Decay 3 is interesting
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,To be fair. That is a pretty fucking awesome lineup of IP’s from one parent company…. The amount of money they have spent buying up studios and IP’s over the last few years are insane.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Will all of these be available on the xbox gamepass ?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Is that a Fable remake or sequel?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Great showcase, very little “Developers talking at me” and continued trend of just showing gameplay.



Expedition 33 and South of Midnight both looked awesome, nothing really looked bad. GamePass continues to be the best service out there with all of these Day 1 launches.



Only real negative was the lack of hard release dates. But if that means we get more finished games and less rushed production, then I’m here for it."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Lots of great reveals, Expedition 33 definitely caught my attention. 

For some reason though I really want Flight Simulator 2024. Never played one before or was all that interested but this one makes me want to go dust some crops and fly a hot air balloon."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I am *begging* that Xbox remembers that couples exist and make a few couch co-op games
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"This showcase was fine, but Mixtape, Expedition 33, and South of Midnight are the only things that really caught my eye. It didn't feel like anything was filler though, which I find a lot of showcases like these are full of, so that's nice."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,We're never getting a new Banjo game
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I thought it was a pretty good showcase. I really want to get my hands on the new Fable
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Expedition 33 coming out of nowhere for me. Looks cool as he'll. Looking forward to more Ben Starr.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Is South of Midnight an exclusive?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"They had a great showing. Stalker 2, Expedition 33, Flintlock, and Doom are definitely are on my radar. Stalker 2 made me remember that I preordered the collector's edition."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09, Fable?!
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Holy shit that showcase was awesome!!
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"That Dragon Age trailer. My god, I was prepared for something bad, but not something like that."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Very strong showing this year by Microsoft, damn.


All the Sony showcase was good for was a light nap "
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I was hoping for gears of war 1 - 3 remastered
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Fantastic (hopefully) batch of games. A handful I’m super excited for.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Without doing any research, based entirely off the title Doom the Dark Ages sounds odd.

Like Skyrim Doom, or some medieval doom. 

Are we even on Mars anymore."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Indy, Perfect Dark, Fable, MGSDelta3SnakeEaterYee and Wuchong Feather falls Twice are absolutely on my radar."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"So, Fable."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,wow on xbox?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"after so many years i finnaly get to see how gears of war started, that moment was hyped up so many times in the fenix trilogy and i actually get to see it now."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"State of decay could be the winner Xbox has been looking for if they actually put a budget behind it this time, the first one was good, the second one was even better, and they could achieve perfection with this one"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Summer Games Fest looked mediocre by comparison. Today, I got DOOM, Gears of War, Indiana Jones, Perfect Dark and Snake Eater trailers. Mine and a lot of others' childhoods coming back.

Let's hope Microsoft do not fumble the bag with any of these releases."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,State of decay 3!?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Just about shat a brink until i saw the tiny little online under elder scrolls...
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,This was one of the best Xbox showcases in quite some time
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Man i have been waiting for an Age of Mythology remaster for so long now, i played it so much as a kid and really cant wait to play the new one."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"State of Decay 3 \o/ 


I wish I could fast forward life 3 years when it's available in early access."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Looking at the comments, Guess I'm in the minority but I'm hyped for a new Life Is Strange"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Holy fuck State of Decay 3?? I missed that one!
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Dragon Age: Failguard will hopefully end the studios suffering. 

Its okay...they can't hurt you any more"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"I’m a PlayStation gamer, but this show blew me away. First time in a long time I’ve been tempted to get an Xbox. The real question is which games are exclusives and which are multiplat"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Here's a fun drinking game

Go in to a streamers chat while they're streaming the show and take a shot every time someone complains about DEI"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"10/10 showcase, would watch again.    
NEW GEARS OF WAR BABY!!!!!"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Age of Mythology, Fable, Perfect Dark. What year is it? Lol Not me complaining about my favorite games making a comeback!"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Diablo: Monster Energy Edition looking pretty fun
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,That was legitimately goat tier. Made up for the lukewarm summer games fest and Sony showing.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I've had fun laughing at XBox over the years. I can't deny this game show was full of bangers. I'm excited for a lot of these!
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Probably the best showcase from any of the 3 in the past 5 years, if not more."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Perfect Dark looks neat! Don't look in the comment section!
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,They cooked 🔥
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I refuse to accept cold war as bo5
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Actually a great presentation. Indiana Jones has me hyped and overall pretty nice announcements. Way to go!
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,No silksong!
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"I'm interested in these games: LiS, Gears, Indiana Jones, Avowed, Fable, Mixtape, South of Midnight.

  
This new Dragon age looks so f\*cking bad. As a fan of Origins this makes me very sad and angry."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,It felt longer
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"How many of these games are exclusive to Xbox and PC? Most looked ""exclusive"" bit it seems half are coming to PS?


Anyways, PC gamers are eating good."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Can someone tell me what Mixtape is?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Any idea when MGS🔼 is coming?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Mixtape looks amazing
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Not bad. But let's see how the games are at release
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,What..year..is..it
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I hope Perfect Dark stays true to the original. Give me a level to explore with objectives to complete. Not some linear cod campaign etc
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Some of these look okay.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,I didn’t know they were making another Doom
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,We eating gooood
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Doom, Stalker 2 (I've never played any but this looks awesome and I played all the Metro games), Perfect Dark (I was 1 year old when the last one came out apparently), Atomfall (Fallout but different?), FragPunk (kinda intriguing), Indiana Jones (idk anything about this but Wolfenstein is awesome), Gears of War E-Day (only played Gears 5 because PC), Fallout 76's new update and Starfield's DLC.

Never saw a showcase where I wanted to play so many games. Incredible."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Biggest standouts to me, just in terms of ""this looks new and different, I really want to check it out"":


South of Midnight

Expedition 33

Mixtape

Perfect Dark

Mecha Break (new trailer absolutely saved this game)

Flintlock

Doom


Avowed and Indiana Jones are also up there."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Insane that MS finally had a killer showcase and it comes right as they've given up on being a first party.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Massively hyped for state of decay 3, always thought the series was slept on and really enjoyed playing it with friends"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,This lineup is fantastic
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,I’m so excited for fable omg
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Fable, perfect dark, doom, gears, all look great, but even the tear two games like expedition 33, flintlock, wuchang, stalker 2, and avowed all look really good. Best xbox showcase.... maybe ever."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Doom Dark Ages, Gears of War E day and MGS3R look really good. I'm very excited."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Best Microsoft show bar none ever. Every game damn near looked incredible…except I know as a fact it was all mega powerful PC footage. It would be nice if those game end up looking like that on my Series X
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Everything was really good! I was just hoping for an ES Oblivion remake
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,That was everything? Felt like a whole lot more lol
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Looking forward for Dragon Age TV and Life Is Strange :D

1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,It was a nice Livestream. Really good one.

1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"This Xbox showcase was straight up amazing and gave me nostalgic E3 feels finally.

I’d rate it a 9.5/10. Perhaps even 10/10 tbh.

Honestly one of the best gaming showcases I’ve seen in recent memory, with back to back heavy hitter games and no fillers. Brilliant.

My personal thoughts:

Fable looks absolutely incredible, combat looks really great and I love the british humor. The whole vibe gave me a nostalgic feel of why I love gaming. Playground Games are known for being one of the best studios around, and it clearly shows here. One of my most anticipated games now, easily.

Doom: The Dark Ages looks absolutely insane. Looks like Doom on steroids in Skyrim. Can’t wait to play it!

Perfect Dark looks like the spy-thriller FPS that I hoped they would make. Looks absolutely amazing from the gameplay. They have clearly been cooking.

Starfield Shattered Space looks really cool, with a more dark/horror scifi vibe and really nice environments, and definately what the game needs more of. The release of Creation Kit for modding (both PC and Xbox support mods) with new mods made by some of the best known modders, and a new Starfield update with *free* DLC story content & new features releasing tonight is awesome.

Indiana Jones: *really* excited for this and can’t wait to shoot nazis, and I already think this game looks better than the latest movies. AAA blockbuster feel, and you can see they have also improved a lot of stuff further (like visuals) from the previous footage. This game is my personal most anticipated game releasing in 2024 now. 

STALKER 2: looks like the shooting mechanics are much improved, and the game looks photorealistic at times. Very excited for release soon.

Gears of War: E-Day made me hyped af. We already know what The Coalition is capable of, and they are absolute peak when it comes to Unreal Engine 5, very excited for this.

Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 looks *really* good. Definately a game I want to see more of. 

Avowed showed us more of the story, and they have clearly improved a lot of stuff in the game since previously shown footage. I hoped for a set release date, but I think they should take the time they need. I hope I get to play it this year!

Assassins Creed: Shadows: looks good — definately looks like an AC game, but I noticed several new things. I also like the new visual upgrade and the new location. So far I’m optimistic.

Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater. I think it looks good, and I honestly can’t wait to feel the nostalgia.

Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024: looks photorealistic and like any aviator fan’s dream game tbh. I can already see the roleplay potential of this game on Twitch. Very impressive!

State of Decay 3: Glad to see it’s looking good, and I can’t wait to play this in co-op.

Dragon Age: Veilguard: What is going on with the cartoonish look? I need to see more of the actual gameplay before I judge, but I really hope they are not making this game feel like Fortnite. I pray this was just a design choice for the trailer.

South of Midnight: looks like a cool new game, and I like how they pulled off the art design. Looks well made and handcrafted.

Call of Duty: Black OPS 6: Treyarch cooked here. Actually very excited for this one, looks like it could be the best COD in a long time for me personally. The campaign looks like a AAA blockbuster action mission impossible movie with multiple ways to do missions, and the new omni-movement looks pretty sick. Can’t wait to play zombies with the new omni controls"

1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Wasn't Gears of War supposed to be just ""*Gears*"" now? ... I through they had change the franchise's name 🤔"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,It is an awesome time to be a PC gamer with Game Pass.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Hold up...do I see a Fable title??
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"State of decay 3 ,Gears of war and Doom..."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"I’m surprised they didn’t it “Fable One: The Original”.

The gaming industry loves reusing names and just attaching a date at the end (it’s gonna be known as Fable (2024-25)” or whatever because Fable 5 or Call of Duty 18 doesn’t sit well with some out of touch exec. 🤷🏻‍♂️)"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,So hyped for fable
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,tfw Xbox had a better showcase than Sony
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Games aside, Xbox has the best format for their shows. Straight and simple to the point, basically no filler."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Meanwhile PlayStation had the God of War PC port.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Arnt most coming to PS5 and PC?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,this was an amazing showcase can’t wait to play the new life is strange
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,T'was a good day for us gamers
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Banger show
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I want Fable … now!
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,God damn Xbox went off
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Put the Sony show to shame
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,ngl that is a pretty sick lineup.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Fun stuff
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Super excited for MSFS 2024!
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Pretty solid showing tbh
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"It's crazy that the two things I'm more excited about (Doom and Life is Strange) are both coming to PS5 cause that means I can actually play them day 1 I'm kinda wondering if they'll do this with something like Elder Scrolls 6 and have it release on both platforms seeing how things went with Starfield they might want to put it on both so they can get the most money possible from one of their studios game being on PlayStation 

Also I'm kinda starting to wonder if those rumors were true and they are actually planning on just becoming game developers and stopping making Xbox consoles"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I'm actually excited about some of these games
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Fable bros eating good
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"And yet less than 5 minutes of actual gameplay spread across the lot while we got teaser trailers from some of these games 2-4 years ago.

These showcase things mean nothing these days, just hype it up when it’s within 4 months of being released."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Much better line up than playstation one
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"All of those games looked amazing. 

None of them looked fun."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Psyched for Shattered Space. Starfield is a great game (despite what Reddit would have you believe) and this update seems like the biggest BGS has ever done. 
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,no silksong guys. take off the makeup. we're not coming.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"This isn't interesting for me at all. 

I don't see much."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,For me the most  dissaponting game  was the new dragon age .what the fuck was that..a game  that was suposed to be dark  looks like  fortnite. And miles away from a triple A game.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Mixtape looked super cool. Fingers crossed it’s good
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,What have they done with dragon age..?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"It's cool that they're bringing back some older IP's, but I am definitely getting to the point where none of the titles alone excite me. I need some real substance to go with the title. It cannot be a shitty cash grab, full of mtx, bugs, and half baked ideas. It needs to be FEATURE COMPLETE at launch. I have zero faith that Microsoft will allow any of these titles to release in that condition. Investor pressure always leads to half baked releases."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,No Killer Instinct. I return to not giving a damn 🙏
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Cant wait for gearss
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,So hyped for Doom and Metal Gear
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Seeing Dom made me cry.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Still no oblivion remastered...
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Not seeing anything that enticing.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,The voice acting in the Indiana Jones Game are fantastic. The German Guy spoken by Fluala Borg was such a great idea. I can’t wait for that.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Let’s hope for a new OG Perfect Dark and not the 360 perfect dark
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"I'm actually excited for perfect dark and state of decay 3, been a long time since.ive been excited for games on xbox."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Perfect Dark and Fable. My old ass weeps with joy.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,No Wolf Among Us 2? FUCK

1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Is the new fallout a new game or just an extension (DLC) ? I’ve missed that part.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Why was WOW there? It felt so out of place lol
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Still no rare game though? Or is it on here?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Mixtape and winter burrow look like great indies. Gears and doom look dope.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"No Killer Instinct.  I know it was a long shot, but damn why do they not care about that franchise"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I NEED THAT GUNDAM GAME IN MY VEINS NOW
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Is WoW coming to consol? I would love that!
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"It's happening lads. For those of us who have been waiting for STALKER 2 since they ORIGINALLY originally announced it, its happening."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Not as many people are talking about it, but both Mecha Break and STALKER 2 look awesome!"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Ya

1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"How is avowed still coming this year, but we still dont have a release date in June?"

1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,I’m surprised that there was no info on the next Forza
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"It pisses me off that Microsoft literally owns the MechWarrior franchise rights and lets Pirahna Games make the games with little support, and despite Clans releasing this fall, they choose not to let the franchise have a chance to gain more steam on the Showcase.  

Guess this is why the release trailer came out the day before on IGN.  Smh"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Lot of trash but excited for E Day. I hate what they did to Dragon Age. At least Expedition 33 looks interesting
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"I kinda love Winter Burrow. Like, ""we're also here. You're a little mouse. You build a home. Search for your family. No skull-crushing gun here. Thank you for your attention."""

1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Out of all these there’s only 3 that interest me
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"This could easily have been a list for xbox360. A couple of newcomers but mostly more of the same familiar franchises. 

Not meant to be a criticism. Just an observation."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Surprising that they decided to release WoW for consoles and a bigger surprise if it's gonna be on the game pass
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Those poor Hollow Knight fans…
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,PERFECT DARK?! fuck yeah!
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Damn barely any love for MGS remake and it’s the only one I’m overly hyped for
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"I'd rather have gears 3 on pc than a new game. 

That being said, E Day looks great"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"I wish all gaming shows nowadays were like this. It's hard not to like this lineup. I mean there's something for everyone. 

Personally, I'm excited for LiS:DE, Doom, Avowed, BO6, and E-Day (now i need to play the gears games)"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Looks like a PC games showcase
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Holy sequels of games I'm burnt out on, Batman"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,I’m all about a snake eater remake
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Just want to say that as a DAO fan, that dragon age trailer was one of the worst trailers ever created."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Age of Mythology retold? Fuck yeah baby!!!
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,And I’m not interested in any of them. Guess I’m just old and like my old games too much
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Elden Ring isn't even there and I know it's gonna blow up soon.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"I think I'm gonna try most of these games and I'm pretty hyped for some of the new releases like doom, life is strange, fable, mythology etc."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Still no release date for state of Decay 3… this game better be good because I heard undead Labs is working with coalition, Wushu, and another game dev to bring us SOD3"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"I have a really bad feeling about Indiana Jones; they've shown nothing but cinematic videos for it (unless I am missing something?). Almost no gameplay.  I feel that, anecdotally and historically, this is usually a bad sign.  I hope I am wrong."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,A good showcase
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Stalker 2 is my GOTY. I have wated over a decade for it, and that game went through absolute HELL even before the invasion of Ukraine.

I am very excited for Gears E-Day, I never cared about gears after the first game or 2, I fell off the wagon since I stopped playing on console, and couldn't follow the story.  but a game set at the start of the war, Im down for that absolutely.

lastly, Perfect Dark looks really good, I am obliged to get it anyway, a friend of mine is a narrative team member on that game.

Funnily enough, both my friend and his brother worked on Gears 5, and his brother on E-day in it's earliest form before they both left the studio.  Its a weird feeling seeing and talking about all of these games we grew up on, and some of our friends went to work in the industry.  all of us were stimming out at the Stalker and Gears sections. Gears was less important to me, but  they were both franchises of the 2000s that we and a bunch of other friends in our group shared a common interest in."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Metal Gear Solid Snake Eater!!! LET'S GOOO
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,I thought a new Civ was revealed?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Can we organize this by release date
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Starfield DLC trailer looked like a No Man's Sky update. And not a good one.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Don't know where the Contraband was... (Avalanche).
Tomb Raider 4... 007 game or new Metro.
I also missed Towerborn, Clockwork Revolution and updates for Forza. 
The presentation was awesome, yet I still love when it's a little bit more interactive and they also talk or ahow more from the game, through playing gameplay etc."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Frag punk could just fall off the bottom of this picture and no one would notice.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Why is wow showing at an Xbox showcase??
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Not bad
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Finally, we asked for games. After years of waiting they brought the games!"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Still no Elder Scrolls 6 updates then.  
State Of Decay 3 makes me happy along with Fable."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Are these all Microsoft Exclusive? is yes then i should get an Xbox
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Crash bandicoot on game pass? 🥹 When?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Yeah, not hyped for any of these, but the Doom one looks cool"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Subscription services for games kinda scares me. 

So hear me out. Watching the 2024 Xbox showcase has got me thinking. The showcase was great and every game was available day 1 on game pass. Sounds cool. But where does this go in 5 or 10 years?
At what point does day one on game pass become GAME PASS exclusive and not just Xbox exclusive?
And then what stops every other developer following?
Ubisoft subscription exclusive, Rockstar subscription exclusive, Sony subscription exclusive, C.D.P.R subscription exclusive, ECT. 
Suddenly every single game is locked behind some sort of subscription service and you no longer own anything. Then just like Netflix the subscription goes from $15 a month to $20, the. $30 a month and you need 6 different subscription services to play the games you wanna play. 

Netflix, Disney, paramount and Prime have already kinda done this to the movie industry. Is gaming next?"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Which ones are exclusive?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Expedition 33 looks the most original idea (also I love turn based games) But definitely Indiana and AoM hits the nostalgic spot
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,OMG age of mythologie a pure masterpiece
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,is it game pass or what? i dont understand
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Y
9"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,The showcase was great! First time in years I’ve actually been excited about the future of Xbox. May have to pick up a used Series S for cheap once Doom comes out!
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,I'm really excited for Fable and Age of Mythology!
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Is State of Decay 3 real?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,When the thing I think had the most promise was Flight simulator.. they have a problem lmfao.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10," Damn, no Blight :("
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,What day is this?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Microsoft needed this. I was completely taken aback. Unexpected but appreciated!
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Why is sea of thieves there? Came out in 2018 six years ago. Also weird seeing metal gear solid in an xbox showcase
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,What's the world of Warcraft game gonna be?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,So another year of no gears of war. Xbox on trash
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Mixtape looks excellent
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Honestly the Gears of war Trailer inspired a reaction that I haven't really had to any non resident evil game in a while. I know it's just cinematic, but it made me so excited and nostalgic about the original trilogy. Rip dom."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"So many games look great.  Stalker 2, Atomfall, Avowed, Doom, Metal Gear, and some others all look really fun.  And most will be on Gamepass.    So I’m a happy gamer after the showcase."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"This was honestly a great showcase. I'm a bit concerned about the high number of 3D-open-world-adventure-type games, because they often tend to be a bit bland. But there were a lot of good games.  
Expedition 33 looks amazing. The artstyle, music, story, everything about that trailer was perfect"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,A new fable without lionhead studios??
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-11,"State of Decay 3, LET'S GOOOOO ♥"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-11,"18 of those are existing IPs with an update or the next instalment of the series. Excluding Indiana Jones, there hasn’t been a major Indiana Jones game in a while. The last significant release was ‘LEGO Indiana Jones 2’ in 2009. Innovation in the triple A space is dead and its all left to the indie developers to innovate to only later get swallowed by the machine to be forced to make 3-6 installments of the same game and the cycle repeats itself draining them of that innovation. Great example is Undead Labs."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-11,It felt for me like Xbox 360 game releases again. The time when Xbox was most conpetitive.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-11,Avowed: The Way of Water
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-11,"Aww yiss, State of Decay 3! Gears prequel is interesting, those notes of 'Mad World' were perfectly chosen and placed. Medieval Doom, hell yeah, except for one thing. NO CAPES! Otherwise, again, hell yeah."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-11,"I scrolled for a solid two minutes and didn’t see a single comment about NEW PERFECT DARK(!?)

Am I just old now?  Was the trailer bad, or something?  Why isn’t anyone else excited?"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-11,I hope the new gears is good
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-11,What a showcase
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-11,"When people starting thinking gamepass isn't worth it, well I think it will be."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-11,It was a phenomenal showcase! So many fantastic new games and all current gen only apart from COD and maybe one other?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-11,Can’t believe it’s going on near 7yrs since SOD 2  released
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-11,"Will State of Decay 3 come to Play Station? I don't have an X box, played State of decay 1 on PC was cool but my Pc can handle modern games now. :("
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-12,"Am very keen to see how they evolve( state of decay) the
Others have been very entertaining"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-13,"Calling it now, quarter of these are gonna be forgotten after a year due to terrible gameplay or poor optimization causing game breaking bugs & crashes. Half will only be remembered by their own die hard communities, & the other quarter will be remembered for all time. 

But which will be which? Only time will tell."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-13,"Been a long time since Xbox had this strong a lineup… though I can’t help but realize how much of it is just due to buyouts and not their own original work.

Still, I’m hyped as hell, especially for DOOM and WoW"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-14,Is Indy still gonna be an Xbox exclusive? I remember hearing somewhere it was gonna be cross-platform?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-15,Life is Strange in game pass ? Or it is just showcase of games coming to Xbox but it needs to be purchased anyway?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-08-07,A positive post about xbox? What subreddit am I on lol
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"It was a really decent presentation! In fact, it even puts PlayStation's State of Play to shame."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,How many of these games are exclusives?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Decent list. How they turns out is a different question because Microsoft has mixed tracking record when it comes to quality.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"And Xbox continues its 10 year long streak of not having an exclusive game I care about. Perfect dark was super fun…back on N64 25 years ago when Rare could make good games. 

Well, other than flight simulator but obviously I’ll be playing that on PC. That’s always been a PC centric game, surprised they even bothered porting it to Xbox."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Very good showcase. I’ve been dissatisfied with Xbox this generation, hopefully this is the beginning of turning it around. Xbox being competent is vital for competition in the console space"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I can't  believe I'm actually excited about Gears again... After 4 and especially 5 I thought id never be excited about it again.. those just lacked all the character and atmosphere of original trilogy and this is exactly what I hoped they would do and forget about continuing 4&5. Now gears collection remaster/remake would be awesome
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"WTF is that Dragon Age???????

South of Midnight sounds and looks cool AF, but the animation is like claymation. Hope it is not an art direction because otherwise HARD PASS.

Rest was between Good+ to Perfect."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"I liked it

- Black Ops 6

- Doom Dark Ages

- Expedition 33

- South Midnight

- State of Decay 3

Were the highlights for me"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Looks like WoW has ran out of Expansion title ideas. Tf is that??? What's next? 

World of Warcraft: One For The History Books. World of Warcraft: You Are The Wheelman."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Alright showcase. Expected more for THE showcase, but oh well. Cool third party stuff, hyped for gears of war. Call of duty took up way too much screentime."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"The stand outs for me:
Perfect Dark, E-Day, Stalker and Indiana Jones. 

Maybe check out:
Avowed
Doom: Dark Age
South of Midnight

Surprise:
FragPunk.  Game looks pretty cool

Overall the showcase is super promising. Good work Xbox"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,South of midnight gave me heavy forespoken vibes cringe city
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Consider me whelmed
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Honestly I thought MS was buying up studios being their MO was ridiculous, but games take so long now, that having so many studios is a good thing. They can have a banger of a showcase.

I’m a PS player through and through. Sony has me worried. They don’t have the studios to compete with this."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"I know to not put any stock in it, but man the twitch comments during the stream were so negative you would’ve thought Microsoft would be legally required to declare bankruptcy after this event they hated the games shown off so much. "
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Look, son, a wall of shite 😂 dame. I don't want to sound like an old man, but I have a feeling the golden age of gaming has passed us, lads."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I’m so hyped for expedition 33 and I liked wuchang as well. Very good showcase
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Life is Strange, Mixtape, Perfect Dark, Indiana Jones all look very cool. I’m a COD fan but it does look like 3arc really went all out this year so I’m excited, especially it being day one GamePass."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,They've done Avowed so dirty 😭
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Didn’t Gears already do the E-Day prequel?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,They severely need a “happy” game. Bring back Banjo Kazooie
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Everything looked fantastic. This was a really good showcase. I feel like they really needed to deliver after the past month of stuff going on. Might have to get an Xbox again or a PC.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Jezus Christ what happened to black ops 3-5? When did that happen
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Are we getting WoW on Xbox?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Out of all these games, im just over here waiting for Elden Ring DLC"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,lots to play late 2024 good stuff teased for 2025
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Fuck yah new flight sim! Hopefully Phenom 300 is on there
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,So many great looking games! Can’t wait to play them!
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Well, there goes the last hope that silksong would not suffer the same fate as duke nukem forever. Now it is just a matter of waiting for it to come out in 2025+ and tank the metroidvania genre with the inevitable disappointment and disillusionment it will bring. Hollow Knight truly is the worst thing that ever happened to the MV genre."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I cannot wait for Stalker 2 and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Doom got me hyped. I just hope that isn’t the music. Shit was way generic
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Microsoft showed the fuck up today.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"HELL YEAH STALKER, WE'VE BEEN WAITING 15 YEARS FOR THIS."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Nice to actually see something about State of Decay 3, it's been crickets since the last teaser 4 years ago. BUT, 2 teaser trailers in 4 years is kinda whatever. We want the release date. I get companies don't want to box themselves in. But unless they had to entirely re-do a lot of development. Gotta feel like it's approaching the territory where we can get a release date on it. Most of us don't even care about the trailer. Cause last time we had a trailer we heard nothing about the game for almost half a decade."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Where's fallout 3 remake 😢
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Wow look at all those original properties
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"A lot of those had sick trailers so that's exciting.

Trailer for Dragon Age, though, felt really off and not fitting. 

Perfect Dark looks mad cool."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,WHO actually made the snake eater remake? Konami itself?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Why is sea of thieves on here?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,I hope Sony is taking notes because this showcase absolutely tore their state of play to shreds. First time in a decade I am bummed I do not have an Xbox because most of these games I am actually very interested in. Especially Fable looked GREAT
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Are those the studios they're closing down after banking on the new releases?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"I really like most of those games. But is it only me that's just being disgusted by the sight of countless sequels, prequels, remakes, spinoffs, etc. Like you own basically half of the decent game industry. You canceled the company that made HiFi Rush - basically one of the best single player action games released in recent years. And now we see twentieth installments in the series and almost no new original games... Meh"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Is it me or is nothing really that interesting?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,No elder scrolls VI is disappointing but hardly surprising
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Yes and most of them without release dates.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"I miss when it was more Indy games. The original Xbox and PlayStation 2 had so many good games. 

Now we kinda keep getting the same games over and over with less new stuff. They also make us pay for the game and extras for the game we already bought. 

Just milking the series instead of making something fresh"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,[removed]
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,I'm looking forward to only a few there. I hope perfect dark is just as good as the originals
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Perfect dark?!?! Am I seeing this correctly!
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"No interest in any of these.
Man I'm gettin old."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,😴
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"I am confused, I thought people would scrutinize Xbox for killing 4 studios, atleast expected an apology but I guess I was overthinking, really disappointed with the audience reaction."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,There's like 3 new games on this list... what year is it
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Meh.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Looking forward to Stalker 2,
but I don't give a shit about the rest.
Not impressed."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Best xbox showcase in years
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Looks bad
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"So like 70% of the games shown are 1-4 years away.

Boo . I wanna know what I can play this year , not in the coming years."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,This showcase should have just been called “the call of duty showcase” what a terrible showing for Xbox. They continue to do nothing but disappoint
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Wtf no halo 7
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Only one I'm even remotely interested in is Fable.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Some amazing games are coming out. Wow the roster looks amazing!!!!!
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Fairly mediocre show, but it’s rare Xbox has much I’m interested in.  Expedition 33 looks incredible, best in show for me.  Indy looks neat, going to wait and see if that comes to PS5.  MGS Delta and the new Life is Strange looked neat."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,So rereleases??
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Where are the good ones?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Neat. I got 3 or 4 games out of that event. Better than I've done in recent years.

Looking forward to Perfect Dark, Fable, and Avowed. Nothing new, but at least I still have confidence in them. Metal Great Delta should be pretty solid as well.

Also curious about Mecha Break, but knowing my luck it's just going to end up some competitive shooter and not even have a campaign. Publishers know how to ruin everything. What next? The next Batman Arkham game will end up being a BR exclusive?"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Coming in 2025*

*maybe"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"State of Decay 3? Wow, State of Decay 2 was a whole lot of fun. I can't wait to see what they make with State of Decay 3."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Not saying the show was bad at all, it was leagues better than the PS and SGF combined, but it still fell short in some BIG ways.

No dates. What are we looking forward to? Avowed? No date. Indiana jones? No date. We have third party partnerships coming, but the only first party date that I recall is Blops in October. Just to put that in perspective, they had the last game launched in October/Novemeber of 2023, then an 8 month gap, to Hellblade 2, and now we have another 5 months until the next game to play? What. The. Fuck. Is. Going. On.

Also, this is a sort of personal gripe, but Xbox just sucks with diversity now. Big budget adventure games galore, but shit, what happened to all the cool niche IP that made Xbox great?  No Banjo, no Fusikn Frenzy, no Viva Piñata. I’ve really been begging for a car combat game, especially since PS canceled twisted metal. 

Again, they showed some good games. Gears (I wanted sequel not prequel, but still good), fable, perfect dark, state of decay 3, doom, and plenty more. But, I worry that they are increasingly doubling down on AAA big budget and completely forgetting the smaller, more unique games that got them a ton of support."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"So is World of Warcraft coming to Xbox?

Or did they show to try and get more eyes on it?"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Do we have anything similar to this but with release dates ? Sold my series X 2 years ago and now I’m buying another one. Xbox is cooking !
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"I watched the whole thing, lots of good titles coming towards the end of the year and next year.

Very excited for a few....BLOPS6, Gears E-day, Indianna Jones, Life is Strange.... South of Midnight and Mixtape looks good and a handful of others..."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"The best thing about Xbox showcases is ""Coming to Gamepass.""

You used to go back in the day, watch e3, see a lot of games you liked, and play maybe 2-3 ver the next few years because there is a difference in liking how a game looks and purchasing it.  

Now, it's just included in something I already have.  Even when I watch PS and Nintendo shows, now it's still ""nice, but will I buy?"""
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,The comeback Fallout 76 has had is borderline Cyberpunk esque. I remember paying full price for it when it came out and it was a horrific disaster. But now it's seen a spike in popularity and now seems like its playable.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,So nothing besides doom which is multi platform?  Rip xbox
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Great.. I guess next year is when I might be interested again..
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"""What are we? Some kind of marvel univers phase slate?"""
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Well people that bought a series x for some disturbed reason it took almost 4 years but you finally got some games. At least you got something over PlayStation in the facts that your games are at least made with new consoles in mind and not ports that were thought up last minute.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Can’t believe people are still paying to buy the same game every year with CoD
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,They RUINED DragonAge my fav series. Wtf is that awful artwork!
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Wait people thought the show was good?

Maybe I’m just the wrong demographic but the vast majority of games just looked extremely generic, like it was just “here’s our hyper realistic AAA game” without all that much to separate it from the crowd. 

Perfect Dark looked interesting, Expedition 33 was really cool, even if I don’t usually care too much for turn based RPGs, and I am very excited about Doom the Dark Ages (even if the person playing made it look worryingly boring), but other than those everything just seemed really basic. 

To be fair though, I’ve never been into a lot of the series’ that got new stuff, like Gears of War or Fable. But still, from an outsider perspective a lot of the show just felt the same. 

I am glad to see so many people excited for stuff, and I hope you guys all enjoy the things you’re excited for, but I sadly just didn’t feel it."

1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,What year is it again?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,[deleted]
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I know Xbox just doesn't make games for me when I see overall positive vibes on these shows and the only games I'm interested in are Metal Gear and Assassin's Creed. Maybe I play Indy when it's dirt cheap because I like Machine Games.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Great show, great games, I'm still not forgiving them for Tango"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"My thoughts:

* CoD- Same old, people will buy it no matter what. At least they added one new feature and went back to some old map roots
* Indiana Jones- Needs more time cooking but its about to release.... Bethseda
* Gears- One of the most anticipated by a large amount of people. Though many hope they do better with the storytelling and characters since the last Gears kinda flopped. They've got the numbers, they just need to deliver.
* Doom- Best starter, people are going to eat this up.
* Diablo- No comment (I just liked previous Diablo games so I'm still a bit salty on what we've had good)
* Flight- Not much to say except its a fun simulator
* WoW- Not surprised
* Dragon Age- Interesting revival
* AC: Shadows- Controversial and same old AC, not new
* Stalker 2- Another highly anticipated game that's been delayed given the war going on at the studio's country
* Age- No comment (never played but heard all the good)
* State of Decay 3- Zombie Game that people liked but I'm not all that interested after playing Dying Light
* Wuchang- No comment (don't know this)
* ESO: Gold Road- Same old DLC expansion stuff that I a vet have done a thousand times, gets boring
* Metal Gear Snake Eater Remake- Its Konami and as someone who buys a lot of Konami products, this wasn't necessary to make and this might be a hit or miss delivery
* Fallout 76- They just really want to capitalize on the show's hype it brought
* Life is Strange- Hey I liked the 1st and not the sequels, but I'm still willing to give it a shot
* Sea of Thieves- No comment (don't really have much to say for a game that had a bad launch and made a came back)
* Atom Fall- No comment (don't know this)
* Flintlock- No comment (don't know this)
* Winter Burrow- No comment (don't know this)
* FraGPunk- No comment (don't know this)
* Mechabreak- I like mecha games, though this will be overshadowed by the other big hitters (not my priority)"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Xbox is the best box
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"When you put it like that, it really doesn’t look that impressive. Throwing in Sea of Thieves, FO76, and Elder Scrolls online feels like desperate padding.

How many of these games(not DLCs), are coming this year with confirmed release dates?"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Xbox absolutely killed this showcase. I’m excited for so much of what they showed us
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Such a great show.  One of the best in years.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Incredible showcase.  Xbox might be back.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Personally Life is strange Double exposure is the only exciting thing here
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Avowed is the only thing that even remotely interests me. Maybe Shadows if they go back to the Valhalla style gameplay because the latest AC was not it
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09, Such an amazing lineup! PlayStation needs to learn from XBOX.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I guess this was the best showcase I've seen since 2016
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Not exactly interesting, but still better than Sony’s last presentation."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Ahh Bethesda, releasing nothing new, just dlcs for their online micro transaction machines."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Showcase so good i almost forgive them for Scalebound
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"I’m just here to read the “xbox bad,evil corporation” tin foil hat comments"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,gotta say hands down the best showcase from anyone in years. that was immense
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"It looks like gears of war is getting a reboot considering gears 4 and 5 were not liked 

Which is a good thing start from scratch with OG characters"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"When I was a teen I would have gone nuts for this, now I'm only interested in getting maybe 4 of these when they eventually go on sale."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Gears of War E-Day??? 

That….doesn’t sound horrible. But they can’t have half-ass it"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"I AM SO HAPPY SoD3 GOT AN ACTUAL TRAILER. I’ve been waiting for forever, but by the looks of it, it seems like it took so long because they scrapped the zombie animal idea, but it wasn’t a big trailer so who knows"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Im sad there's no fallout 5 or Forza horizon 6 . Hopefully next year
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Wuchang clan ain't nothin to f wit
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I want Fable to be good but man that trailer didn’t get me that excited. Also at the end of the trailer who is that supposed to be? The red aura reminded me of Jack of Blades but idk.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Banjo will continue to be a dead franchise
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"We are never getting an actual Elder Scrolls game, are we? As long as ESO is making its millions upon millions of revenue, we know where Microsoft is putting its support."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Not sure if its just me but my god it was way to many games. Was so tired after the half point.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Honestly way better than summer game fest
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,W showcase
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,They didn't show it again yet but looking forward to Outerworlds 2 although I might have to get an actual xbox or upgrade my PC because I doubt it'll run it when it eventually comes out.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,No forza? Xbox's lineup is getting worse and worse
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"This was a solid A show, really happy with what Microsoft has shown"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Gaming is shit , hopefully some of these bring happiness to the gaming world"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"No Tomb Raider, no Jurassic Park Survival and no Prince Of Persia :("
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"One thing I can't stand is how unclear what platforms games announced at the Xbox Showcases are.

Despite what the showcase says, additional trailers were released online of Expedition 33 and Doom: The Dark Ages showing that they are also launching on PS5 at the same time. So they are not Xbox / PC exclusive"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Isn’t Fable supposed to be coming out this year? Where’s that?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Fire 🔥
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,let's see if this new fallout 76 update is just another expedition
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,no Forza Horizon 6 😔
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,How many release dates?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Weird to see WoW at an Xbox show
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,black ops 6 is a 300GB download. what the actual fuck
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"The games I'm hyped for coming out of it (Perfect Dark, Age of Mythology) are not the games I came into it excited to hear more about (Dragon Age, Assassin's Creed), just as a note for the trailer teams for those games.

Though nobody did a worse job than BlOps 6, jesus god who greenlit that powerpoint presentation."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Still mad indy is an exclusive. I want to play it too dammit!
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Not exclusive then I see, guess all of these will be cross platform."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Only games I’d play here are maybe Fable (a fan of Playground, know precisely zero about Fable) and the new Life is Strange. Outer Worlds 2 and Forza Horizon 6 were the ones I was really hoping to see though.

How is there such a huge scene for new fantasy games on a platform like Xbox btw? I’m not necessarily discounting those who are into that stuff, but it just seems like an oversaturated market, with Xbox also being the weakest of the platforms for the genre."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"World of Warcraft is on this list? 

Huh?"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,That Diablo cinematic was nar.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"I still cant believe i will play Stalker 2, the russian equivalent of Half life 3 in terms of rumours and leaks, before silksong."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Microsoft bought Activision Blizzard, what are yu guys expecting?"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Doom, Stalker 2. Everything else seems kinda mid."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"I'm sure there is some fan happy about specific game but to me it seen pretty lame. MGS remake is already known game, life is strange not my thing but i know many ppl like it so that's a plus point, DOOM is probably the only best thing they had for now. There rest is just ""ok another expansion, ok another game with the same modern graphic"" Sad that they kill all the studio that will actually make unique game like Tango Gamework."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,I’m glad they decided to call it Gears “of War” again.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,the most interesting game was Expedition 33. Doom looked good. Dragon Age looked more like a co-op or battle   royal game. The rest is mediocre or there is not enough gameplay
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,no forza horizon 6 :(
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,how are you going to play Age of Mythology with a controller?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,i'm so sad that the only game that interest me is Indiana Jones
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"How many of those games are made by studios that won't exist in 6 months.

Free space is Avowed."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"And I only care about 2, maybe 3"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Idk if I can handle 30 more pre-order BS...
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,They finally outdid Sony. Perfect Dark is what I've been waiting for since I bought a XSX.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,10 years of waiting for Fortnite Age from Bioware?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,They really went all in! Took longer than expected for some of the titles but I'm sure they had that all figured out and will reap the rewards soon enough.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,That's pretty underwhelming
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,LETS FUCKING GO METAL GEAR RAHHHHHHH🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-12,"Flintlock- hard pass. I got fooled by good reviews into playing Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, a $60 lecture on how horrible White people, capitalism, and the United States are. We're all evil colonizers (when literally every race on the planet have colonized at one point or another) and we're all racists. I can get that all for free by watching The View, I don't have to pay for it."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Ok, I really don’t believe in having much truck with the whole “western women characters are ugly” debate. It’s a pile of shit designed for click bait and rage arguments that adds nothing to the gaming world and just diminishes us all. 

Saying that the hero of Fable looks like a giant plucked the ugly tree out of the ground and beat her to half to death with it. I mean men are traditionally either handsome heroes, rugged anti-heroes or butt ugly comic relief and I get it; it’s an archetypal visual shorthand that we’ve employed to tell stories for millennia, but to have a hero that looks like Quasimodo blinded himself and tried to make a self portrait of how he’d look after an industrial accident is just bad. She looks terrible.  

Now, I don’t give a shit if she’s all JRPG teen hot or a buxom blonde with boobs bigger than her head, I absolutely applaud games designers for creating characters that look like normal actual human beings instead of just the random perverted doodles of a neck beard with a waifu body pillow. All I do want though is to not have the character that I’m inhabiting for 30 hours or more to have a face like a badly carved Halloween pumpkin in late January."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Doom, Mgs3 and Avowed are looking amazing, AC shadows looks promising but then again Ubisoft doesn't sell great games they sell great premises"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Looks like I’ll be continuing my “basically no new games I’m interested in” for a while longer. 

Last thing I was super into was Forza Horizon 5 and Cyberpunk. Literally haven’t bought anything new since then. Couple old games and that’s it."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Sequel, sequel, sequel sequel, sequel, sequel, se-Sea of Thieves? You can't make a sequel if you don't put a number on the end of it! Get in line like every else. Smh"

1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"A lot of decent looking games, and almost all are coming to Gamepass. 

Seems like Xbox is really trying to leverage GP because it’s hemorrhaging money like crazy.

I bet half these studios won’t turn a profit on their games because of GP."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,This has got to be the worst showcase I've seen in a while.  All stuff that would be discounted by 50% in a year

1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Why is WoW going to be on the XBOX showcase? Surprise xbox port???
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"It was a 7.5 show for me. Could have easily been higher if they shadow dropped a few games on gamepass. Octapath 1 and 2 are good games and I haven’t played 2 yet, but really was hoping for the Final Fantasy Pixel remasters"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,?? Half these games came out like 10 years ago what is this?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Crazy how not a single one of these games are something I look forward too.

Maybe Indiana jones, but I’m so tired of this
“Old game, re done with modern tech” 

I don’t want a re made game. I want a new game."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,…They just don’t have the games on their side.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Like half of these are just DLCs for existing games lol
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Nothing good? :(

1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"HOLY. FUCK. I didn't know a new one was coming out!!! It will be presumably on PC too tho, right??? My family and I used to get all our laptops out to play it together during Thanksgiving and this may have my family getting back together again for round 2!!"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Age of Mythologies has me hyped as fuck. Like age of empires 4 was great and all but i preferred age of mythology cause of the fantasy elements and really wanted a new one on the AoE4 engine. I feel like people are writing off Microsoft too quick and they’re about to have a huge resurgence as millennials who grew up on Xbox and Microsoft games now have kids so they’re going to go with the one they remember from when they were young.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Metalis, etimos."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"This comment really highlights how diverse Xbox is. Like damn 10 years ago you would say they are a shooter only publisher but now a days they do everything. 

A flight simulator, an RPG, a stop motion action game, a zombie survival game, racing games, strategy games, like damn every single game in the showcase looked good even if I wasn’t a fan of the genre.

And most of it is coming to game pass. Thats insane value."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,">Age of Mythology ~~Reforged~~

I've been burned before."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,I had no clue that they were releasing a new one! So excited
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"I've literally never mady anything ecept hydras in this game when I was a kid.

I would find them so cool as a kid (and still now) That I will only pick greek --> dyonisos --> hydras.

Tbh, I don't even know if they are more units ou civs in the game."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,The soundtrack is one of my favorite soundtracks ever. I wonder if they’ll mess with it.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"one of the first game i played on computer. my uncle burned a copy for me, i can still see Dionysos walking around"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Didn’t play the old AOM games but I did play Black and White 2 and lemme tell ya, that trailer gave me nostalgia"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-11,Seeing it made my pants wet
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"The annoying thing is, they KNOW people want it. The Coalition have been shutting down rumours about a Marcus Fenix collection for a few years now.

The fact that the original trilogy is not playable on PC at all (iirc the original gears of war was on PC. But that build hasn’t been publicly available for over a decade and probably wouldn’t work on modern computers anyway) is criminal. I know they are BC on Xbox hardware but they make such a huge push with bringing all their titles to PC, EXCEPT their biggest franchise after Halo :/

I understand why old Forza games don’t come to PC, licensing issues and all that. But they have no excuse when the Gears license is owned by Microsoft 100%. If they can do it with Halo, Why can’t gears get it too? :(

But then again, even with Halo, Halo 5 isn’t playable on PC for some reason. But that games shit so I doubt many even care about that game. The original Gears trilogy can’t really compare to that in terms of being beloved I don’t think."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"I would absolutely play a Marcus Fenix Collection.

If they remaster Gears 2 & 3 as part of that, even better."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,They have to right? There’s no way to play them if you never owned Xbox
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Theres some credible rumors of that being done. I would bet that they could reveal that for 2025 and have GoW E-Day in 2026. Today was more about building hype for the bigger title and showing us it will be basically more of a Gears of War reboot than a Gears 6.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Yeh but it could take 5+ years to fix after release...
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Man I was just thinking that. On a plus side Gears 4 is only $5 on the Microsoft store, think I’m done waiting for it to come to Steam."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"I imagine they're working on it, but wanted to officially reveal the next game before that."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Yes please.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,If I could play gears 2 on pc I’d be so fucking happy man
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,I just bought the original trilogy and played it on my xbox recently. They should just re-release the games on steam though imo. I'd rather them not waste time on a remaster/remake.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,And so it begins
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Yeah this trailer was WAY better than the last one, this trailer gave me some hope that it will be good"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,But no chicken kicking?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Given this showcase I feel like we are entering a new renaissance my brother
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Like a western final fantasy, I’m
Hyped"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,This was the most exciting announcement in the show for me. Couldn’t believe it was a turn based RPG.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,My personal best in show.  I was furiously Googling to see if it was coming to PS5 after the trailer.  (It is!!)
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Yeah it absolutely grabbed me during the showcase. Unexpected but thrilled!
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,And it's coming on GamePass! I am certainly not missing it
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,The UI looks clean as fuck. And the music is sublime. From the same guy that composed Bury The Light in DMCV. Microsoft finally bringing the games!
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Love the concept. Hope it can deliver, will definitely be following it"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Right? Best third party game in the show, atleast from this trailer alone, combat, story and music are all top notch."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Ah yes, my favorite metal band, “Flight Simulator 2024”"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"No, those you wouldn't be able to read. The game titles are too legible🤣"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,It doesn't at all tbh
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,It really doesn't lol
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"So much waiting for stalker 2, it definitely looks promising."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Yes! STALKER 2 was the game of the show for me. The incredible graphics and showing constant gameplay and releasing this year is the triple threat for me for these kind of showcases.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Fr
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Sad it won't have mick gordon working on it cause they did him dirty.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Developer inferno
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,It would be really funny if the developer announced they had been hired by Konami to make a new Castlevania game and they release it before Silksong.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Silksong 🤝 Bloodborne remaster

Never coming out"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I can't wait for Silksong to come out so that people can stop complaining about it
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Silksong is most likely gonna be announced on a nintendo direct I think
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Two years ago, it was due to come out ""within the next 12 months"" when it showed up at that year's Xbox Showcase, then delayed with no new timeframe given in May 2023.

Either they have piss-poor product management at Team Cherry and it's been feature-creeped into oblivion, or the game is waiting for something specific to launch.

It''s been six years since Hollow Knight's last major update shipped, the story of its development will be fascinating to hear in a few years time."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Your next chance might be at Nintendo direct, 70% chance maybe."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Imagine when it finally does though. 

If it’s not bad."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,It’s because they know it will most likely get pushed into 2025. 
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Because they don't want to commit to actual date. Which is fine. Better just say ""2024"" and when you are actually 100% sure of date, you can reveal it. 

Tom Warren from The Verge said that Shattered Space for Starfield is targeting September, Avowed November and Indiana Jones December."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"For years, we all complained about game delays and publishers announcing games too early with unrealistic release dates. Now, xbox is being conservative about dates, and we're still complaining. 

I get the anticipation is there and we want to know the exact date we can play, but I'd rather xbox stay quiet over dates then announce that when they're 99% certain the developers will meet that time frame, instead of announcing a release date 2 years in advance then shift the date every 6 months."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Is perfect dark related at all to the N64 game of the same name?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,We've known that State of Decay was always meant to be an MMO lite thing. And they said SoD3 is the game they always wanted to make sooo... Here's hoping.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Hell yeah. Shit was great. Love seeing Dom again too
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-11,Fuck yes
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I want conkers back!
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Would be nice. But I’d rather than spend the time on a new game especially this. Leave the remaster to another Xbox studio
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Wtf is up with your profile picture???
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"I was thinking that, very surprised, seemed like a fallout esk game to tide everyone over for the long wait."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Somehow from dark fantasy they managed to move into Raid Shadow legens...
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I've been hooked since Origins....i really hope that isnt the art style in game
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Honestly is there much of a crossover between Fortnite players and Bioware RPG players? Idk I'm not one of these people that thinks every game has to push the edge of graphical fidelity but why have they made it look like a cartoon? Weird decision
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I was hoping to see gameplay on it today.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"I'm not even a fan of dragon age and kept thinking ""Is this really dragon age? It looks nothing like what I know about the series"""
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,It’s like Overwatch with swords and boards and I hate it right now.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Alienating a massive audience and chasing a completely new one has always worked in the past, so it will definitely work now. Totally has never killed franchises like Saints Row..."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"I hate when a game ruins any tension or threat by having the characters be one liner spitting smartasses who don't have any reaction to being attacked and instead have a chat while easily defeating their enemies. 

Takes out any tension."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Don't feel bad, the game isn't even out and sure the trailer was different but no reason to assume its a bust due to art style change."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Bioware trailers are notoriously bad and misrepresenting. The first impression sucks, but hopefully the gameplay on tuesday gives a better image."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,For real. That dragon age trailer was awful. 10 years since Inquisition and we get some Fortnite/Overwatch looking garbage
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Yeah that was horrible. Waiting 10 years for that
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Looked like a mobile game trailer. My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined. Thank god for Larian for carrying the torch.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"After Baldur’s Gate 3, BioWare is going to need some SERIOUS face lifts to even come close to competing."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Agreed. If it's coming out soon I'm shocked they didn't show any gameplay. 

And I'm really sick of the same smarmy team of rag-tag characters. Guardians of the Galaxy was 10 years ago. I think people want *some* serious storylines and characters!"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Willing to wait for reviews but its absolutely not looking good
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Lets wait for the gameplay reveal on Tuesday but yeah it looks cartoonish?!
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Looked like some random mobile cash grab not gonna lie. Also, is it just me or is this high fantasy trend with colorful characters and flashy powers really getting old?"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Bioware died over 10 years ago. None of the original team is left.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Don’t you mean, TEAMGS:D SE"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Yeah man, as a lifelong PS gamer, I have to XBox killed it today. Banger after banger."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Expedition 33 looked so cool. I didn't know anything about that game before the showcase and am pretty excited for it now.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,In a sea of action RPGs it certainly was a breath of fresh air. Looking forward to Metaphor: ReFantazio as well.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"As usual, Blizzard is a masterclass at cinematics in both of theirs..."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Made me want to watch a full movie about it
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Her arm splitting open like that was crazy.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"I don't even play RTS games but that trailer looked freaking epic. Definitely buying the premium edition, day -7 for me!"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,They won't. The studio just died there.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Indy Jones and the Big Circle
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Exactly like the movies
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Wait until you play the sequel, “Fantastic Triangle”"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Indiana has always had that campy vibe to them. I’m assuming the title is intentionally quirky.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I like it better than Dial of Destiny lol
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"As it should be. The trailer shown sold me the game, I think the got the essence of the movies there lol"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,No sillier than “Temple of Doom”
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"""Indy, the Nazis have kidnapped Alexander Overwijk, and you have to rescue him.""

""what does Hitler want with him anyways?""

""he can draw a [great circle](https://youtu.be/eAhfZUZiwSE?si=eyPrA-alXt4USaEC&t=60)"""
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"You thought ""Indiana Jones"" should have a serious title?"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,And they do it well. I really hope after Indiana Jones they'll make a Wolfenstein 3
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I couldn't believe it was actually her. Man that game got me hyped! I loved every single LiS but the first one and before the storm have a special place in my heart.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Same here, I go one of the games from a free thing and after I played it I loved the deep story, went back and played every single one of them. Big fan, and no question on release day I will be playing this one...

Coming to GamePass.... awesome.."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"It is funny cuz I the Mixtape trailer was on and I was like, they really wanted to make a Life is Strange game, then the new Life is Strange trailer came on"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I know! And it looks like they're pushing the boundaries of her powers in new and interesting ways. Very exciting
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Really happy for a proper sequel with Max as the main character.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Not even a ""2025"" on that one tho. It's going to be a while"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"You have basically Black Ops 6, Indy, Avowed, Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred, Flight Sim 2024, Warcraft The War Within, Dragon Age Veilguard, AC: Shadows, Stalker 2, Age of Mythology Retold, Starfield Shattered Space, Fallout 76 Skyline Valley, Sea of Thieves Season 13 and Flintlock for 2024

Doom The Dark Ages, Fable and South of Midnight and rest of third-party reveals for 2025

Only games without date/year were Perfect Dark, Gears of War and State of Decay 3"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Same, i haven’t played since Gears 2 and that trailer kinda has me wanting to go back in to the series"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Indy is fall time, isn't it?"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Maybe they’ll drop Avowed onto our heads out of nowhere. I’m excited to see the world of pillars in first person. They’re such good games.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Looks like a Trailer for a mobile game. BioWare is dead
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,I absolutely hate the trailer being a meet the companions trailer. That’s something to do coming up on release. Not the official reveal trailer. Should have been more story based and grounded but whatever.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,hey hey hey hey. that's an insult to f2p. Most of them look better than that disney abortion.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,That's a low bar tbf.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"For the first half of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. trailer I thought it might be a new Metro game, lol"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,I thought they wrapped stuff up in Exodus?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Dragon Age looked like a cinematic announcing a new season of a cheap F2P MOBA. Do we know anything about it yet? Is it a real RPG?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Been disappointed with the direction dragon age is taking for the last 13 years.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Correct, they own blizzard Activision"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,The same reason Call of Duty and Diablo are at the Xbox showcase. Because Microsoft owns activision blizzard.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"> I guess this means the Fallout 3 and Oblivion remake/remaster that's long been rumoured isn't happening then? 😞

I wouldn't count them out, Elder Scrolls 6 is at least four or five years away and Fallout 5 is even further. Microsoft probably recognizes the need to release something single-player from both franchises in the interim."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Maybe, maybe not. But probably not"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,I was on the edge of my seat when I seen fallout but just to see 76.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,November 19th. That trailer looked amazing!
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,[deleted]
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,No gameplay shown is concerning.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"More or less yes. But given that games take 5+ years to make these days and we know that playground basically just started working on this right before the pandemic that adds up. 

I say let them take all the time they need to get this one right. A new Fable after so long from and entirely new dev team needs to stick the landing."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,It looks fucking fun straight up. We will see.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Most new games take that long to make. Cyberpunk was teased like 8 years before coming out. Elder scrolls 6 will be like 10
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Yeah I’m def hungry for Wolf Among Us 2. I really hope that comes to fruition
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Not sure Mixtape is for me personally but man did it LOOK cool as hell
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,It's not Gears 6
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Looks so fun! Can't wait!
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Yeah I was really hoping to hear something about it today. The merger closed like 8 months ago. It's taking ages.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Never, because Microsoft shareholders would riot over Microsoft spending $80 billion to buy Activision blizzard and then immediately destroying Activision blizzard’s profitability by throwing all their products on a money losing, heavily subsidized gamepass subscription "
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"I love the art style, but that game in general just does not seem like my cup of tea...I feel like it'll be a hollow experience mostly just hanging on to the nostalgia of the music..."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"That's one thing I love about these showcases, before I'd have to determine if a game was worth buying, now I'm spoiled and I'm just nodding my head knowing I'll get to play all of these as soon as they launch. 

Every game they showed was interesting enough for me to at least check out and experience for myself"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"As much as people bitch about Microsoft, gamepass is the best deal in gaming right now, so many games, so many coming, and usually a ton of perks for games (all league of legends champions for free etc).

Easily the best sub I have."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"From company that is still updating their *checks notes* six year old game, I’m ok with them taking the “it’s ready when it’s ready” approach. Keep good devs doing good things."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"I'm happy to wait ""until it's ready"""
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Was pretty disappointing not even getting a release year, especially since the first trailer came out 3 years ago"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Yep, even CoD."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"No way to know because it’s just called “Fable”. As if all the naming schemes in the gaming industry are taken, so you need to name games the EXACT same name over and over, just attach a date to the end: Fable (2004), Fable (2007, Fable (2017), Battlefront (2005), Battlefront 2 (2006), Battlefront (2015), Battlefront 2 (2017)."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Sequel/reboot. Definitely not a remake.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I cant afford it right now but Flight Simulator with a vr headset looks awesome.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Hopefully Gears E Day will be co op
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,100% Expedition 33 was my game of the show
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Assassin’s Creed 35 isn’t filler. Never is.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"I had to scroll down way too far to find a South of Midnight mention. That game looks interesting af. I can't think of anything quite like it on the market now. I just hope the actual combat is more interesting than what was shown. It doesn't look terrible, but it doesn't stand out a whole lot either."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Most of these are likely to end up on PlayStation even if originally exclusive
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Just look on their official video channels. Doom only said Xbox/PC but when u go on the official trailer it also includes steam/PS5. So I'm guessing the majority of games will be the same lol
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I have a feeling a good amount of these will be multiplat but honestly Series S is so cheap at this point you may as well just get one even if it is just a little Gamepass machine lol
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"you can play all of em on a pc aswell, so i suggest you get the gamepass"

1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Dragon age looked like a marvel movie script. I swear I was waiting for the record scratch and someone narrating “well that’s me and this is how I got here”
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Doom and Black Ops 6 are coming to PlayStation from the first party output. Of course games like Assassin's Creed, Dragon Age and other third party are also multiplatform."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,just a story game made by the devs that made stray
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"I know it’s not the same, but I highly recommend looking up the skyblivion mod :) it’s only a little over a year away at this point (expectedly. Might change) and looks phenomenal :)

If that ends up being as good as it looks, we won’t need a Todd Howard remake, because skyblivion will probably end up being better than it."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Oblivion is already kind of a perfect games, PC mods basically remade it already at this point. The only ES games that truly need a remake are Daggerfall and Arena IMO"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but as I understand it: the WoW one is a new expansion but not tied to a console. I haven't heard about WoW coming to consoles (besides that they want to).

As for avvowed, i can speak slightly more confidently. It's a first person action rpg set in the same world as Pillars of Eternity. You do **not** need to have any knowledge of this world but it should help for context. It looks to be *conceptually* the same type of game as skyrim/oblivion with swords, bows, magic, but will be distinctly its own game through and through; starting with how it looks to be brighter (color wise) than a game like skyrim. Unfortunately this xbox showcase showed it looking relatively different than the gameplay trailer from a year ago showed which *could* be a red flag. Hopefully if scratches that Elder Scrolls itch for a lot of us waiting on ES6. Hope this helped :) 

(And p.s. yes, the avatar game came out earlier this year and is called ""Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora"")"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,It is just an official graphic
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Xbox made it lol
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Be that is like 4 years away min man starfield dropped less then a year ago.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"This is a prequel so maybe they’re doing a callback. Tbh, it’s nice seeing the old title. Gotta replay the trilogy on my dying 360."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Shit was announced and shown a while  ago. Looks promising!

1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"No. It's on PC. But Blizzard is part of Xbox now, so it's included in the show."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,What about these 30 games suck?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Nintendo hasn’t done their direct yet. Sony only had a couple new games

- Astro Bot

- Concord

- Dynasty Warriors Origins

- Path of Exile 2

- Infinity Nikki

- Where the Winds Meet"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"It’s literally never been more popular with the TV show, they just hit one million concurrent players a week or two ago"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,It’s just a new expansion
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"It was announced 4 years ago as being developed by Playground, Lionhead was closed in 2016."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Yeah because the sony state of play is not a PlayStation showcase
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Looks like they are trying to emulate the spiderverse style as did that tape deck game.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,I really don't know what some people expect. I can not see how anyone can watch this showcase and not at least have some titles that they are interested in.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"The Golden Age is whenever you grew up. For some it's SNES, others N64 or PS1, others PS2, Xbox, or Xbox 360, PS3. But in reality, there have never been more choice in games ever, and quality is outstanding in most products if you don't look at the past with rose tinted glasses too much."

1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,4 was the one with the blackout BR. 5 was Cold War.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Konami was listed on the trailer but I don’t remember seeing any other studio listed.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Because the new season was shown during the showcase.

1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,this is cringe at this point
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"You didn't like it, that's fine. They spent so much on COD bc they paid a TON for the franchise and the hope is by putting more marketing in combined with a gamepass release, the result will be more active players which leads to higher revenue from battlepass and store microtransactions. And it (COD) only had the opening portion and a quick mention later in the show. After the showcase was a more in depth dive into it, but that didn't conflict with the showcase itself.

I personally enjoyed some of the offerings, but not everyone will. That's the nature of humans is we all have different tastes and we want different things (sometimes from the same games). Some people likely view this showcase a 10/10 while others -- potentially like yourself -- view it closer to a 0/10. Each of us has our reasons and merits for viewing it as such"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I’m guessing you didn’t watch it?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"No, they are all new games outside of Age of Mythology and the expansions of course."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,You really ignoring Doom?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Not coming to Xbox. They also show PC games from their own studios.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Wow, people have broad and varied tastes/opinions"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Who is saying otherwise?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Saying something isn't interesting because you've never heard of it has got to be the dumbest thing I've ever heard of, especially when the majority of the things you listed are brand new reveals."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,You don’t have to spend anything to have a lot of content in ESO and a lot of cosmetic or mounts you can earn in game.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"It's in development. But they made Starfield first, which just came out last year. So that will be at least 2027 I think."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,It was showcased
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,It's not. They've been talking about it for awhile now. It's an actual expansion of the main map. A new region south of the cranberry bog and ash heap.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Just get game pass and ur good.

1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Yes! I haven't dipped my feet into the next Gen Consoles yet. From what I read COD will be be cross-platform and since I don't see Sony making their exclusives anytime soon I think Xbox is the better deal. I could get an Xbox X for $36.99/month instead of shelling out the full cost of a PS5 plus having to pay for a year of PlayStation online and the full cost of the game. Lastly, I have a Mac for my home office and the one thing I miss is computer gaming. Age of Mythologies is going to scratch a big itch for me there. I guess I just have to decide when is the right time. I know Xbox is thinking about a pro model. I'm not sure if that is coming out this year yet."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"What do you mean “most,” what isn’t coming to game pass? Not trying to fight or argue just curious cause all of these games look interesting but I don’t remember seeing them mention something won’t be on gamepass"

1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"I would be down so fast getting a Marcus Fenix Collection of Gears 1-3. Heck throw Judgment in there even if people aren't big fans of it cause I'll still play Judgment. I really would love to replay the Gears Trilogy (including DLC campaigns) in upgraded graphics, 4K 60fps. Microsoft has been so inconsistent the past 2 gaming generations. The one game other than Halo that would give them favour Microsoft just forgets altogether."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,The first one is one Xbox games pass for pc. 2+3 are still missing though

1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"The craziest part of this is calling halo 5 a shit game. Campaign wasn’t exactly what was advertised, but the multiplayer was GREAT. Honestly the most solo playtime in multiplayer I have in a halo game. Every other game was pretty reliant on having friends to play with. War zone was top tier."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,You can play every old title on gamepass iirc
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,If you have Xbox One through Series X all of them are playable
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I might be crazy but I think E-Day might come sooner than 2026. I say this because on the steam page it already had min spec requirements and most games don’t have those till a few months out from launch. I think we’ll see sometime next year.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Coalition ain't 343i. Even though Gears 4 was somewhat divided on release, I played that game with barely any technical issues at all... Though I think I bought it a year or 2 after it's release."

1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"How was it different? Cause I don’t usually remember shit, but I immediately connected that this felt so similar to the first trailer (for me that’s not necessarily a bad thing). "

I do partially agree with them that it's a bit ridiculous the devs haven't said anything in such a long time, like a simple statement saying they're still working on the game would go a long way."

1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"We've had a lot of ""highly anticipated games that sucked major ass"", so the longer the wait, the more stressed-out you can get about Silksong.

At this point all hype has burned into ashes for me and I almost don't even really expect the game to come out anymore. Cherry could wake me up with a personal messenger exclaiming the game's coming and I still wouldn't believe it."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,it’ll be announced r/tomorrow

1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Yeah very worrisome that Avowed or Indy didn't have exact dates for their release. Both look extremely fun though so I hope they come out asap. I would expect Avowed to release from anywhere between August - October and Indy November - December, but again no dates set is sketchy."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,They wouldn't give a date at all if they thought it was likely. They probably have a couple month window to work on bugs and see dates of other games.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"They're reusing all the same names, but it sounds like they're doing weird things with the plot. Here's the description [on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2986410/Perfect_Dark/):

1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"I actually don't mind the art style too much, it could work in a kind of way, a bit like the exaggerated tarot card art from Inquisition, but in game. I'll never disrespect a change in art style, Wind Waker is probably still the most beautiful Zelda game ever made and that got *so much* hate.

However, the *tone* of this trailer was fucking horrific. Characters with nicknames, quips flying around, quick cuts... I thought it was a marvel hero shooter, then I saw the title and then thought it was a spin-off mobile game, then I learnt that they had renamed Dreadwolf and... this was it...

What the fuck...?"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Doesn’t look like it will be. There have been a. Few screenshots and leaked gameplay around and it looks much better.

Not a fan though of how the made the companions seem like a hero shooter intro for them. I’m worried they are all gonna be quipy and goofy without much serious tone."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Why the qunari look so... clean? Its supposed to be a rugged brute kinda race yet it got 0 imperfections. They all look like the sims or telltale characters.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"It really is a shame that they don't just give us an honest-to-God Origins successor. That's all any of us wanted. It was the most successful installment in the series for a reason, and all they've done is copy-cat other genres ever since. Gameplaywise, Origins was a more faithful ode to the old Baldurs Gate games than even Baldurs Gate 3."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,It is. They would not show the game in a different art style than it releases in.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,They mentioned last week that gameplay would come on Tuesday.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"It's so sad, they went from being at the forefront of the industry, experimenting and pushing the boundaries of what an RPG can be to being so insecure they badly copy whatever's popular,  i don't know why they're so scared, especially after BG3 and Elden ring saw crazy critical and commercial success from being confident and uncompromising in their design and offering a unique experiences but bioware is out here like 'uhm, uhm, make it like fortnite'"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Imagine how they must have felt after seeing BG3 doing so well and Dragon Age just keeps pivoting farther and farther away from that model
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Is this dragon age 4? I heard the game was renamed from dread wolf, but don't know what the new game is called, and I thought this was a spin off. It looks nothing like dragon age."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"I was getting MTG vibes - no grittiness, no edge or imagination any more... just computer bang it out as quick as possible, generic, sterile visuals"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"I’ve never played Fortnite or Overwatch so youre gonna have to help me out here with what you mean, it definitely looked like an RPG to me"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,The gameplay is being shown on the 11th. It was confirmed days ago.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,What are they? Some sort of suicide squad?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I hope they show something really good then even though i dunno how good the gameplay can be in rpgs like dragon age where usually the story and lvl design makes all the difference
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Came here to say this. Im with ps for like 8 years but xbox cooked 🔥
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Been a PS gamer since the OG console.

Even I’m happy that Xbox put on a great show.

Competition is good for the industry and I really hope Xbox can get back to its 360 days in terms of respect & influence."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Yeah the Playstation showcase was mid but Xbox buying a lot seems to have worked out at least for this showcase.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Agreed. Happy most of the shown games are multi platform!
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,If only the gameplay was interesting.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Genuinely had to do a double take at that part. Shit was more horrifying than some horror films out atm.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,That was absolutely disgusting.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Indiana Jones and Yo Mom
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Indiana Jones and The Hip Square
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,“Temple of Doom” enters the chat
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Its the music choices for me. The later games kinda lacked the memorable songs of Before the Storm and 1. Hope they go back to that standard. Thats not saying the others had bad music, but it just didnt stick out as much compared to 1 and BTS"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Probably 2026
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I'm just playing with Gear of war 4 right now for the first time. It's good so far.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"I highly recommend you at least go back and play gears 3 if you have access to an Xbox (the entire trilogy is backwards compatible).

Infact, I’d just recommend you replay the trilogy. All 3 are amazing games :) but 3 is a worthy follow up to 2 and caps off the story nicely. Definitely worth playing if you’ve never done so before!"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,CoD and Diablo are available on Xbox. WoW is not which is why I was asking.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"A mostly unknown French studio develops a new flight sim from scratch with one of the most innovative features ever in a video game (real time streaming map textures and 3D transformation of almost the entire world at a 1:1 scale) with full support for an add on marketplace.

What does the set the franchise have to do with it, other than the name? :)

Now the engine is there and working great… seems like it’s exactly the right time for these sorts of new features."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Gameplay is being shown on tuesday.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"It's also way different than what Playground is used to making (Forza Horizon) so I'm cautiously optimistic, but they seem to have at least nailed the British humor (or humour)."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"To be fair, they weren’t even working on ES6 until starfield came out.  BGS announced it to early"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Happy to see others on the lookout for it!
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Yeah.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"It's one I will wait for reviews.... and if it's good, I'll play it..."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Except WOW but yea point still stands.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Gears has to have split screen co op and if it doesn’t they forgot the plot.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,The way I perked up when I heard Jennifer English in that trailer lmao
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Really? Setting wise, I can see, but I immediately thought South of Midnight looked like it’d scratch the God of War itch that I always have now. Just a good ol’ action adventure game."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Grabbed one off of Facebook marketplace for 80 bucks for this exact purpose.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"I believe if one has the chance, to just add 100 bucks and get Series X."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Thanks! Haven’t been paying attention to the gaming scene in a while due to just life, ES6 would be great and can’t wait for it (even though it’ll probably be a hot minute)"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"The dev cycle is way too long for games. It’s too much pressure and studios lose sight as the market evolved. 

Seven years of dev time means the game’s budget has to outperform seven years of stock market gains. 

Take 100 million and put it in the stock market for seven years. That required no work and no decision making. 

Do games make it back? its just not a smart way to invest money anymore. "
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"If you can, grab a series S for cheap and play through the franchise on gamepass. All the games run on 4k60fps"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Thx dude
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"For me 95 to 2019/20 was the golden age. Now I feel its all a money grab with unfinished games. Could be rose tinted glasses, but thats just how I feel."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-11,"Yeah, I guess that's true"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Most of these are just new entries in established IPs or reboots, so ""same old"". At first glance, 10 of those entries don't ring a bell. At least 3 is closer to 10 than 30. 

They need more games like Hi-Fi Rush, it was phenomenal."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I agree that showcase was pretty cringe. Unfortunately that seems to be all Xbox can muster these days. It’s awful to see
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"What about Fable, Flight Simulator? Also, BO needs to stop having new BOs at this point"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Yeah I think I was a lot grumpier when I started writing. I am glad there’s so much stuff for people to love, I just ended up deciding to put my thoughts out there."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Oops I’m silly. I see it right there now.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,oh shit really? hell ya i just bought 76 on my pc a few days ago
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Oh I'm sorry. 12 out of 30 are new titles. Bravo games industry, you're only 60% stale this year at the top"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,In that guys defense he might 12 years old
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,[deleted]
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,That doesn't really mean anything. It ain't an Xbox game lol
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Black ops, first two were good but the rest is like the same shit every year so we can count that
There’s been like 6 Indiana jones games
I’ll skip doom cos it may be smth new
Diablo 4 came out last year or smth
Warcraft has been out since like 2005
Stalker actually could be good
Fable came out in 2004
Perfect dark came out in like 01
Snake eater came out in like 09
Sea of thieves got released in 2016

I said ‘like’ half not exactly half but u seem young so I listed em all out bro"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Awww thanks! I'm sure they'll be fine in our huge ass house that we paid cash for and are both retired a whole back in our 30s, but yeah you go ahead and feel embarrassed. I'll sit here on my pile of money judging crappy video games."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"I don't understand your comment, what does my comment have to do with that?

Normal looking women is porn?"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Don’t forget ATM OF EREBUS
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,At this stage my guess is that it has to be a licensing right issue with Epic to The Coalition. They have to know people are very serious about wanting a Fenix collection.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Ah. I was wondering why gears 1 UE wasn’t on PC. But I only have a steam deck at the moment, so I can only see Steam, and it’s not on steam sadly (same as gears 4. Gears 5 is on Steam though). I knew gears 4 was on steam but I honestly had no idea if UE was on windows as well. So thanks for confirming :)"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Yes you can, however OP means you can only play them on Xbox"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Gears 5 had a rough launch day with bad servers but the Coalitions launches are miles ahead of 343i’s. Crazy how they can’t do anything right lol. Halo Infinite is a good game right now, but only took 2/3 years"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"The first trailer didn’t feel like Fable at all, it felt like an SNL sketch of someone who was just described Fable. This one felt more Fable-y the NPCs are goofy and have attitude, the architecture was right, I do think we need the narrator tho, and I hope the main character doesn’t talk."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Bro got voice acting jobs for fantasy character with a beard who uses a sword on auto accept
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,GARUDA!
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,This comment is fucking brilliant!
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,True true. I guess I'm too accustomed to people thinking Five Finger Death punch is heavy metal. Lol
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"I heard the aiming on this is pretty bad. When I first played it, I was always dying. Turns out it’s really just the guns are inaccurate."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Hollow Knights development went much the same. They're just bad at planning.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"At this point, it won't live up to expectations"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,TC has said that any news will come from them directly. All we need to have is patience.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Silksong was announced before Elden Ring was - That's how bad it is.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"This. Or a screen shot? A 5 second gameplay video. It’s crazy we have no idea what the game even looks like, at all."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Coming exclusively to iPhone? :-o
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,My guess is everything that said 2024 with no set date will be pushed to first half of 2025 and everything that said 2025 will be in the last quarter of 2025 
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Indy has a release date no? I know Avowed one was leaked then they quickly removed it from their website
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,There was a leak in an official Obsidian blog post that was quickly changed stating November 12th as Avowed's release date.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,3 It was announced a couple years ago but it’s good to see he hasn’t been cancelled
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"""Eeeeeasy does it.""

A few months back a buddy was over and out of nostalgia we dusted off my old N64 and threw BFD in and started up some multiplayer with bots, ready to relive our childhood. Holy shit are those controls *awful*, I don't know how we did it back in the day."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Completely agree with you. I was like WTF. I’m assuming it will be nothing like Inquisition. I was looking for something with a more serious and grittier tone unfortunately.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Came here to write the same thing, DA2 already had a different art style, so it's not like the series has been super consistent with how it looks.

The tone is such a wild direction to take, especially for the first new game in 10 years."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,I think a lot of us who loved origins feel the same. Unfortunately I don't believe DA will revisit that style of game again for fear of not expanding its marketability. Those kinds of almost MMO-style single player rpg games seem to be few and far between and especially so for AAA games. DA:O may simply be a moment in time game unless BG3 reverses a lot of opinions in the gaming world.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,That's good to hear. I look forward to it.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Honestly, at this point, I'm wondering if this is some serious ""committee developed"" thing. No real vision, no real plan, just throwing things at the audience in hopes something works."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Most of the original talet has been long gone, which is very sad to see."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,They are a fully owned business. EA is a corporation that wants their studios follow trends and do what appears to be popular. It’s not about making great games. It’s about following a corporate checklist to produce something that will make the shareholders happy
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Wtf do you mean why are they so scared? Because the guys who made dragon age now WORK for Baldurs Gate 3 devs. Who the fuck do you think is left at bioware to make great games? Just because the company name is the same, doesnt mean the people are still there."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I really wish Disney would just hire Larian to do the KotoR remake at this point. Aspire is clearly in over their head.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Yes. They renamed dreadwolf to veilguard
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"The art style and the quirky jump-cuts, avenger style presentation. RIP dark fantasy themes"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"As an Xbox fan, I hope so too haha"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"I mean it is, it’s probably just not your type of game"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Indiana Jones and the Burned Cross


- Sponsored by Sony Playstation"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Completely agree. 

It's hard to beat the 1st game OST, it was top tier!"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,4 and 5 are good games. Just not as good as the first 3.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Time to replay before my xbox 360 bites the dust
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,It was a good question. I was hopeful the only reason they showed it was to announce a console port.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Xbox is not only hardware now, but ecosystem that you can have access via mobile(cloud gaming), PC and consoles."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Xbox isn't just a console now, it's a ✨ experience ✨.

Seriously though, Microsoft considers PC as also a part of the Xbox ecosystem"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"I was so sure WoW on XBOX was going to be the announcement, and also shadow drop on Game Pass."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,That didn't stop them from announcing it
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I was kinda whatever on it until i saw turn based combat and i did the Leo pointing at TV meme
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I got a series x from target for 299
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,New sure but i regularly see Series S on marketplace for like $80-100 which is just incredible amounts of value
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,That’s why so many are jumping on the love service bandwagon because the successful ones like gta online make billions. Of course 99% fail so it’s simply not sustainable either way.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,I remember enough money grab games from those periods as well. You just filter them out easier since it's longer ago.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,lol
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"You can put your thoughts out there. 

I invite you to walk up to someone and say, “wait, people think [something about them] is good?”

Report back about your experience."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Yeah. Been playing since the beginning and really hyped for more land to expand to.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"For games with significant investment behind it, I think that is a pretty good number of unique titles. And also: people have been asking for a Fable, new Gears, Doom, Stalker and more for ages. So it's not like there is no demand from gamers for this."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,[deleted]
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"It does, because it's not ""Xbox"" as in the console, but Xbox Game Studios, which is the whole gaming subdivision at Microsoft. So everything."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Okay so just Sea of Thieves, got it. Just to be clear since you seem confused, all of the other games you listed are new. What about me seems “young”? if anything you sound like someone who was born in 2014 since you seem to think these are all re-releases."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,You’re just further proving the point. 
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"TROJAN HORSE FOR SALE, JUNK FOOD NIGHT, ISIS HEAR MY PLEA, WRATH OF THE GODS, DIVINE INTERVENTION. 

That’s all I remember, besides the ones already mentioned"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Doesn't the Gears of War license belong with Xbox Game Studios? Although, it probably is just the game itself. Could be soundtrack or other licensing issues... But the Gears 1 UE remaster came out on PC years ago under Xbox Game Studios...? So many questions..."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Microsoft bought Gears, the entire thing, years ago. There's no Epic connections left."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,I was able to do this on PC. I just downloaded the Xbox game pass app and have access to them. It’s essentially like using another launcher.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"While don’t agree with some of the story elements in the game, gears 5 release, while bumpy, is miles ahead of the current state of the gaming industry today. Gears 4 released almost with no bugs and a super solid multiplayer player. 

Other than story writing, Coalition is killing it."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"MC was talking in the trailer, and i think it was from in-game cutscene"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"at this point its gonna surpass expectations just because people keep saying it wont live up to expectations, everyone's already afraid of the worst"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,I’ve been developing a new kind of patience for this sequel LOL. All jokes aside I hope it’s going well and the pressure after hollow knight being a renowned success must be immense so hopefully they are handling it and making another banger
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Oh…..
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,well there was the [gameplay trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSfuFlhsxZY) in the xbox showcase in 2022 where they said the game was releasing within 12 months of the the showcase
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,You all have iPhones right?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Apparently it will be a Playdate exclusive
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Nah just on meta quest 4 sold for only a month
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"Its possible. But it's also possible that Microsoft got burned too much giving actual released dates in the past that ended up being delayed that they basically don't feel confident doing so now until they know the games about to go gold. 

If we don't have a solid release date for them by September though then yeah they're definitely being pushed back."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Shit it was? I thought 2 barely came out a couple years ago? 😂😭
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Nice. An N64 copy of conkers bad fur day is worth a fair amount of money if you didn't know. Not that I'm encouraging you to part with it.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Aspyr has been off that project for a while from what I know. 

Which isn’t much of a surprise. Aspyr did a good job with porting games for a while. But I never had much confidence on them building a game from the ground up with no real experience."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,I love ARPGs and absolutely hate d4; the endgame was absolutely atrocious.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,"You're absolutely right, and I don't mean to shit on the people that *do* enjoy it. Different strokes for different folks and all that, I just don't understand it.

The gameplay is just a series of hallways and small rooms, pressing the same 2-3 buttons to fight the same level-scaled mobs. It's so stale.

I don't get it."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Agreed.

1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Yeah I worded it pretty bad

As far as seeming young goes you used that “I’ll wait” line that kids always do plus u went out of your way to comment on my dissenting opinion"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-11,Mmmhmm one day maybe you'll be relevant too.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Yeah it’s weird that they’re okay with releasing the ultimate edition on PC but no word ever on a Marcus Fenix Collection
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,You’re playing gears 2 on pc?
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"I’m an iPhone developer, so that’s how I know the annual Apple dev event is tonight. Obviously that’s when they’ll announce it. 😂😂"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,Yes. Remember when they promised every game on showcase will be released in under a year and then a lot of them got pushed back.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"2 was released in May of ‘18!!!

It doesn’t seem like it was that long ago."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"I'm kind of a collector. I have sealed doubles of multiple 64 era games. Mostly the hits, Goldeneye, Conker, Mario 64, Perfect Dark, Gold cartridge OoT, etc. I'm not looking to sell, I like having them even more now that most games lack a physical copy and I mostly play PC."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,And I don't get how people find kicking a digital football around entertaining but it still sells millions of copies every year. It's okay to not be interested in every popular game.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-09,All good - I appreciate seeing a bit of self reflection. It’s rare to see on the internet!
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,This is a beyond insane thing to say.
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"I didn’t go out of my way you replied to *my* post with some nonsense dude. Kids say I’ll wait? No im just condescending your whole contrarian for attention shtick. 

There are *11* new IPs on this chart, that’s 1/3rd of the games shown. It’s just so tired dude, you’re not unique or funny and I’m going to call it out whenever i see it."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"Gears 2, 3 and judgement would need actual porting work to change the codebase from the old 360 code to work well on computers of differing hardwares. From the xbox one onwards the code is more unified with PC and that's pretty much been the policy since. If it can be released on xbox, there's no reason it can't on PC it's practically the same code and is a lot easier to port. I'm actually kinda surprised we haven't seen an xbox one emulator yet on PC."
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Holy fuck 😂 how did that happen
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,"why play forza, its just driving around, you can do that in real life"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-12,"I wasn’t trying to be unique or funny bud I was saying “why are we getting a million remakes instead of some new shit” However you are right it is very tired, only 1/3 of the games coming out are smth new which I’m a lil sad about.


I also just wanna put out there that I’m arguing my side cos you reacted so strongly towards it, I’m kinda serious but genuinely I’m partly just trolling to get a rise out of you. I find it funny. However you may have gotten a lil heated about it so It’s not fun anymore. I hope u enjoy these new games coming out bud!"
1dc0jt3,2024-06-09,2024-06-10,Did they do the thing Saints Row 2 did where they tied the physics engine to the Xbox hardware? Cuz saints row 2 tied all of their physics to the 3.2GHz single core on the 360 and it runs weird on any other clock speed.

1ha5cl9,2024-12-09,2024-12-09,"For anybody reading, you don't have to reinstall the game. I only had italian language folder. Add english as language in windows (not display language, just language pack), and move it up in the list. The xbox app if everything is right, should be in English when you start it (restart it after you changed the language). If you did correctly, the game will say that ""english is available for download"" when you start the game next time. Download the language for the game, and restart the game one more time = the game should be in English, without having to download the whole game again or changing the display language of the operative system (windows)."

19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,If it had been third person we'd be seeing articles about it retreading ground that Uncharted or Tomb Raider already did. News around Xbox studios games always seems so negative.
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,We don't anymore need more 3P action adventure game....
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,How in the world did people convince themselves  a studio that has only worked on Wolfenstein and Quake for the last decade was gonna shift gears and make a third person adventure game? Let these studios play to their strengths.
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,I... actually like the first-person.
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,So I'm the only one who wanted a Point & Click adventure?
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,"Nah I trust machine games

They make fantastic games and especially fps ones"
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,So much toxic discourse around this game and the other xbox games shown. MG are doing their own take on Indy and FPS perspective is fine 
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,"I love what machine games did with wolfenstein, and from what i see here im in 💯."
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,"Dawg, we’re just happy for more Indiana Jones"
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,As long as the game is good i don't have a problem either way.
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,This again?
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,Again the same nonsense as when cyberpunk was announced 1st person. Don't like it? Go play a different game. As if us who like 1st person have to give up for the others...
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,"I really wish it was 3rd person. Games about famous characters should usually be third person because I want to be able to see my character as I'm doing stuff like running from getting chased or beating up bad guys. It's why Spiderman and Batman games aren't first person. 

The argument about being compared to uncharted is stupid. The new Tomb Raider games were still successful despite those comparisons..."
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,"I mean. We can for sure have an argument about this. 

  
But I'm kinda irritated that reasoning behind ""Why Indy should be third-person"" is ""because Uncharted and Tomb Raider are third person."" Which is weak ass argument if you ask me.

I have no doubts that MachineGames had endless debate about this and fact that they settled for FPS is their choice and I trust them. After all, they are former Starbreeze devs who made excellent Escapce from Butcher Bay and that game had same first-person/third-person combo as Indy."
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,"I think it being first person makes it a more interesting game to anticipate. I do wonder whether the decision was partly to differentiate it from Uncharted, not to mention Machine Games' experience with making first person games."
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,It's Machine Games. It was always going to be first-person.
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,i have no strong feelings either way

19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,First person games are far more immersive to me and that's one of the reasons I'd rather play a game like Cyberpunk 2077 over the Witcher 3 for example.
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,I generally prefer action/adventure games as 3rd person otherwise I feel like I’m just a floating camera. Also if there is any platform segments I find it difficult (looking at you dying light). Will be interesting to see how this plays though.
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,"Why is this even a question in 2023? 


Why is camera perspective not a player preference? We've had both options since Xbox 360 days in some games."
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,There should be an option for both. Mods will get it covered
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,"For years Xbox and many fans have been saying the console needs more story driven third person games (Phile Spencer said this not that long ago).

They have an ip thats perfect for that type of game and opt to make it first person so it isn't compared to the sort of games they have been saying they need.

This should be third person and hopefully there's a mod on PC that will make it third person."
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,The answer is *always* yes.

19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,funny how people would say Indy copied those two games and yet those two games copied Indy
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,"Fanboys and certain media outlets have a hate boner for Xbox no matter how good they're doing and how happy the Xbox fanbase is, Xbox announced more upcoming exclusive first party games in the last 12 months then PS and Nintendo combined, but people will still come up with some bullshit reason to dump on them."
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,"The Xbox tax.

Negativity towards anything Xbox guarantees clicks. There is no controversy. This as manufactured as it gets."
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,I really don't think that would be true though! I think the IP of Indiana Jones and it being set in the past makes it much more different than both Uncharted and Tomb Raider. It makes it the most different of the bunch.
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,Could've been a Guerilla Games type situation
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,Theres a group of people who hate anything thats not third person. Its wild
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,"Me too, I think the game could be have sone beneficts from the first person because the first person can give to the game a better exploration.  
About the explorations I read that we will have big areas to explore so I'm glad about that because I didn't liked Uncharted games who in my opinion they are too focused on the story and them give to you a lot of helps:D"

19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,Fate of Atlantis still slaps - not exactly next gen graphics tho
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,"I see where you’re coming from, but first person POV also lets you “be” the character you’re playing rather than just watching them. There’s arguments for both styles with regard to the narrative you want to tell and the experiences you want the player to have.  I don’t think one is inherently superior to the other. 

On the other hand, I don’t like this middle ground approach where it swaps to 3rd person for cutscenes. Personally, I tend to find that somewhat jarring. If the story is best told in 3rd person then the gameplay should be in 3rd person. I think it would’ve been better to pick a lane."

19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-20,"I've actually read a lot of the opposite argument that Indy shouldn't be third person because those games are third person. Despite there already being a couple of  third person Indy games. I have not seen anyone make the argument you're saying are being made.

The main reason why an Indy game should be made third person, is because Indy is one of the biggest pop culture icons in existence. Fans want to see him in action. It's a similar argument for characters like Spiderman, Batman, and Luke Skywalker."

19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,I think the game of Indiana Jones is different and it will offer a different kind of experience from Uncharted
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,"Because game design is different for 1st or 3rd person. You can do both, but one of them would suffer for not being primary design choice."
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,Because PlayStation fans seems to buy them on the regular and Microsoft don't make many.
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,"Have you ever looked at the mirror? Cause 1st person it's more inmetsive, as you see what your character sees... Who is the clown again?"
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,"I might be misinterpreting but it seems the third person is more reserved for certain actions and cutscenes, while first person is the main focus like in combat"
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-20,No one copied anyone.  Inspiration leads to good things.  The only people complaining are the console warriors.
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,"I mean. Even as someone who hopes Microsoft does better. Their first party offerings since the 360 have been mixed at best. Doesn’t matter if they release more titles if the majority of them have at best been critically luke warm. If not outright panned for their shortcomings. 

Microsoft needs to get some smash hits both critically and financially for a lot of us fence sitters to have any sort of hype on their upcoming releases. 

Sonys worst release in recent memory was the last of us part 2. And that was mostly just a vocal minority on sites like Reddit bitching about some story decisions. 

Microsoft on the other hand has in the past year had Redfall(nuff said) and starfield(disappointing for many people despite a decent foundation in my opinion). 

Like I said. It matters little how prolific in quantity Microsoft has if their big name releases continue being disappointing on a critical level at least. Theirs just not enough confidence in the brand from those of us who sit in the middle compared to Sony or even Nintendos little corner."

19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,It won't stop publications from comparing it with those two games.
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,"I don't know, I think the first person element and the gameplay that enables is pretty meaningful. From the gameplay they showed it feels more like a cross between uncharted and dishonored (without the magic). I like that because the gameplay in uncharted was where it always was lacking."
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,Some people get motion sickness with first-person games. It’s not wild at all.
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,"Man. Now just imagine that. A remastered fate of Atlantis with some good stylized graphics and modern sound. 

Make it like Diablo 2 and halo anniversary where a key press reverts it to the original version of the game."
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,"Exactly but those games that let you ""be"" the character are usually games where the main selling point is the world the games are in, and those characters are usually heavily customisable characters because they are essentially meant to be you. Here the main selling point is the character and therefore the right approach in my opinion should've been third person. I also agree with what you said at the end, and it feels the main reason this is first person is to avoid correlations to Uncharted and Tomb Raider and not because it's the best choice for this game."
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,"Lol It is not. Because game still in some instances translate to third-person, so devs still had to make animations for main character."
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,[removed]
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,"Depends on what you like. I don't like any of the playstation first party games so for me they offer nothing. They don't have enough titles to have that one big hit that's made for me and all their games feel the same. Microsoft hasn't been putting out as high quality games but having so many to choose from has been more successful with me. 

That's one of the benefits of quantity over quality. It's not just that you get more bang for your buck, you also have more chances at something that really appeals to you. It's like going to a restaurant that sells really good meat but you're a vegetarian. But across the street there's a place that has all kinds of food. It might not be as good but at least there's something for you."
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-20,"If I tell you don't you even think about pushing that button. You are going to do one of two things. 1. You're going to think about pushing that button. 2. You may push that button because fuck me.

That is the internet. Someone writing a blog can find any source they need to confirm whatever dumb shit they have in their head. The sources could be like two random ass people. Boom sources.  That then becomes the central point of discussion which then colors how people view a thing. 

It has very little to do with debating since there is very little to discuss you either like something or you don't. If anything has even the slightest negative connotation and it has anything to do with Xbox it will get more clicks. Which then becomes the talking point. You aren't starting at zero but in the negative and are working your way towards zero. This has always been the issue with Xbox and it will never go away. If you predict for the thousandth time that the next Xbox will be the last Xbox you will get people's attention. It doesn't matter that people have been saying that for two decades now. But that negative bent got people's attention. People secretly like rooting for disaster."
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,What difference will that make though. We saw the same thing with the recent tomb raider games but those were still very successful...
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,How hard would it be to be better then a game from 2016 to get a positive comparison in 2024
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-20,Neither does making it first person. The games will still be compared regardless (they already are). It's an irrelevant argument.
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,Since when? I have *never once* heard this complaint before the past 24 hours
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,The entitlement is fucking wild .
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-24,"Lol bro if you get sick playing video games idk what to tell do some pushups, read a book or something "
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,"Yeah, but since Disney shuttered Lucasarts I’m not sure how the licensing would work.   Of all the companies to have the IP Disney’s probably the most aggressive to try and work with/around"
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-20,"Or maybe because first person is the bread and butter of machine games?????


Have you heard of literally any of their other games? Also I don’t know what you’re talking about by making up a point that most games that allow you to play from first person perspective are highly customizable characters meant to be you.

Not true. I don’t know where you are making this conclusion from. If anything games where you can customize your appearance benefit more from third person as opposed to vice versa. Most rpgs are generally third person. The first person perspective just brings you closer to the scenes and actions happening and it’s a nice change of pace."

19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,OK big guy. You seem really mature.
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-20,"Xbox consoles have no exclusives everything can and will be released on PC.  At least Sony has actual exclusives to make you spend money on their consoles.  I know yall going to take it the wrong way... but xbox gamepass is all we need, eliminate the xbox consoles."
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,"To a point true. But when the quantity of actual quality releases is so low. Then it runs into the same issue of Sonys low quantity of releases. 

In the past 5 years Microsoft has released one game I have had any real interest in. That being Starfield. Which as much as I enjoyed it. Definitely wasn’t as high quality as I hoped. 

I haven’t been interested in every one of Sonys releases. But of those releases I had been interested in. I could guarantee a decent level of quality from them. Something I sadly can’t say the same of with Microsoft’s releases of recent history. 

They have a good few games on the docket I’m interested in. But that’s coming with a heavy dose of skepticism that they can actually pull those releases off. 

My hope is they dig themselves out of this development disappointment hole they’ve been in for years now. But I’m also not really holding my breath on that."
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-20,"First, this isn't merely an Xbox topic. It's not just on Xbox. Second, media bias is irrelevant. Indiana Jones fans don't really care about it. They do care about an Indiana Jones game, though. There is a debate to be had."
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-19,"Where I said that it's the same?

I just said that if your (stupid) opinion about ""lazy devs"" was true, they would not even bother to make third-person transitions with fully fledged animations.

But from your post history it's pretty clear that you have no interest in discussion. And calling devs ""lazy"" because they chose first-person view instead of third-person is just pathetic. So...bye"
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-20,"If you're buying a PC for games you're pretty much buying a more expensive xbox. That is their platform and you have to use their store front to play their games on there. I see so many people say this sort of thing and it makes no sense. They're like, ""Just buy a PS5 and a PC, no need for an Xbox."" Like dude...the PC IS your Xbox except microsoft makes money when you buy one rather than selling it at a loss like these companies do to sell a console.

On top of that most people don't want to game on their PC. It's too much hassle for them. They just want to buy a machine that always works without any effort, that's why they buy a console. So for those people they are choosing based entirely on what is available on that console."
19aifyl,2024-01-19,2024-01-20,The game is not even out yet…this is all so silly.
1ihe4nl,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"Yes! I'm playing Assasin's Creed Osyssey and Origins and the environments are so fantastic! And the buildings are amazing. So much detail, it's crazy."
1ihe4nl,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,Check out the Tom Clancy's The Division games (1&2) for some really amazing interiors.
1ihe4nl,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"Oddly enough I find the opposite to be true. I used to admire all the scenery and details in the games I play and now I’ll see an exquisitely detailed street and just walk through it only bothering to look for hidden ammo etc.

I think that when games were lower poly each bit of detail felt more meaningful. As they got more detailed it felt less necessary"
1ihe4nl,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"Having played a decent amount of retro games lately, there wasn't really much to soak in, a lot of the time. Very simple layouts, not much in the way of ornamentation or details. Just enough to give a sense of walls around you in a lot of cases.

Anyone who says graphics and presentation haven't improved or that devs are lazy hasn't actually played an old game recently."
1ihe4nl,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,My favorite part of Bioshock Infinity was enjoying those old Columbia era buildings.
1ihe4nl,2025-02-04,2025-02-05,"On the other hand, I must have ran through that stairwell over 50 times and am just now realizing there are chairs there."
1ihe4nl,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"I took it as a sign of me getting old that my first reaction to House Beneviento in Resident Evil 8 wasn't trepidation or trigger-happiness, it was an appreciation of how gorgeous that house is.

Sadly, living right next to a waterfall irl is apparently terrible. You get a great view at the cost of constant noise and mold problems."
1ihe4nl,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"Soulsborne games are great examples in this regard. The highly detailed Gothic, Romanesque, etc. architecture in these games are so great to just explore, especially given the epic scale of the structures in those games."
1ihe4nl,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,Now if only there wasnt so much filmgrain and denoising artifacts in modern games... I wish rasterized graphics do get a comeback. Dont get me wrong ray tracing is sick but it doesnt have to be there for every game and every aspect of rendering.
1ihe4nl,2025-02-04,2025-02-04,"This is true in a lot of cases but far from all - Pokemon went from extremely simple (gen1), to significantly more complex/interesting (gens ~3-6 or so), especially for the offshoot games like Colosseum, and now in Gen 9 they’ve removed most building interiors entirely to just create menus."
1hb10ll,2024-12-10,2024-12-10,So....do? Go ahead and play them?
1hb10ll,2024-12-10,2024-12-10,Then play it??
1hb10ll,2024-12-10,2024-12-10,There’s currently a [humble bundle for them](https://www.humblebundle.com/games/disney-classics-black-friday?hmb_source=&hmb_medium=product_tile&hmb_campaign=mosaic_section_1_layout_index_2_layout_type_threes_tile_index_1_c_disneyblackfriday_bundle)

1hb10ll,2024-12-10,2024-12-10,I played it so much on my PSP the UMD broke. Great times...
1hb10ll,2024-12-10,2024-12-10,"Call me crazy, but I miss how creative Lego games had to get so they could tell a story without the characters being able to speak. It was always hilarious to see what kind of abridged retailing of the story they could come up with to fit into the Lego universe."
1hb10ll,2024-12-10,2024-12-10,Fond memories of this one
1hb10ll,2024-12-10,2024-12-10,don't play the second one.
1hb10ll,2024-12-10,2024-12-10,New lego indiana jones would go hard
1hb10ll,2024-12-10,2024-12-10,"The first one is definitely better, you should certainly give it a shot!"
1hb10ll,2024-12-10,2024-12-10,Never played the first one but I've 100%ed the second one I don't know how many times.
1hb10ll,2024-12-10,2024-12-10,"this is the first game I got 100% gamerscore for, so good"
1hb10ll,2024-12-10,2024-12-10,🤣
1hb10ll,2024-12-10,2024-12-10,My laptop died so I couldn't play it :(
1hb10ll,2024-12-10,2024-12-10,"I don't remember exactly what Darth Vader did in LEGO Star Wars 2, but I believe he either pulled out a family tree or a baby photo of Luke during the ""I am your father"" scene. Shit was funny as fuck."
1hb10ll,2024-12-10,2024-12-10,Charge it
1hb10ll,2024-12-10,2024-12-10,It doesn't work. With or without battery.
1hb10ll,2024-12-10,2024-12-10,Well if you’re in the market for another one I’m selling my new-ish gaming laptop
