Adventure,Stray,2022-10-04,"i could not quite place why this song hit as hard as it did, but i think it finally clicked. you have this absolutely amazing second verse that perfectly encapsulates the postapocalyptic despair of the world presented in the game, and as it goes on it feels like it just gets more and more hopeless and angry and volatile, and then oh. there's a cat. i think it hits just right because it isn't just applicable to the game. so many times i've had moments where i feel like life is going to break me, and the despair is gonna set in. and then there's a cat, just this little adorable kitty named garth that doesn't care how heavy things are. he just wants attention and that's enough to make the rest of it not matter for a minute. it's that little bit of hope in the wake of everything else that makes it all just a little less heavy, and it's presented perfectly with 4 words. thanks for making me cry, stupes, i definitely needed it. 1010 song as always!",After

Adventure,Stray,2022-07-25,"i dont understand the negative feedback on this.. its a game where things that dont matterrobots,stray cat try to accomplish something for themselves!! and thats beautiful! the way the robots learned and started mimicking the humans was too cute.. they felt fear,anger,joy everything a human feels.. and the way every single robot in the lower cities were rooting for the cat to reach the outside was really moving for me when clementine says something like we dont all have to reach the outside, its enough if atleast one us makes it! that really hit me.. in the end when the cat is looking through the glass where the lower cities are filled with sunlight while the roof opens up was really good and powerful. a small stray cat, who is soo fragile and dumb cute, brings joy and happiness to all the robots who dreamed of seeing the outside. now thats really something. i didnt have any kind of expectations on this game, just dived right in, and it checked all the boxes for me, 1010 game !!",After
Adventure,Stray,2025-03-03,"one thing i love about lee know's 'youth' is that its not just adored because of bundles' love for him, but because the song itself is genuinely cherished by everyone. over time, streaming naturally slows down, but true love for a song remains. i often stream songs to show support, even if they dont always make it into my daily playlist. like, 'drive' is a great song, but the autotune, while fitting for the vibe, isnt my personal preference. instead, i enjoy the concert tour version without autotune as i love lee know  chans raw vocals. meanwhile, 'limbo' and 'love me or leave me' have found their place in my night playlist, while 'youth' is my morning song. it brightens my mood, reminds me of the little blessings in lifehaving another day to enjoy good food, watch cute cat videos, draw my imagination to life, edit videos of lee know to make others happy, and just being fortunate enough to know a lee minho in this lifetime. i believe 'youth' will continue to receive love as youth is forever just like our love for lee know",After

Adventure,Stray,2022-08-07,"my biggest issue with matt patt's theory is how? if the zurks are evolved bacteria, even if they were given an evolutionary boost from reckless human scientists and had 7 million year to evolve, how could they be smart enough to come up with such an advanced plan? other then the one robot which could honestly just have been a recent catch or food being saved for later like a spider putting it's half eaten fly to the side for a midnight snack, what proof is there of zurks having such advance intelligencecritical thinking skills? the zurks seem to only exhibit basic pack hunting traits throughout the game. just swarm food, eat food. if the zurk are being controlled by a central hive mind that is smart enough to figure out how to control a computer andor robot through hacking, then wouldn't they have already used their unending army of baby zurks to over run all levels of the city? instead them seem to be stuck in only the lowest levels. even if the fully matured zurks that are stuck in the sewers are some how advanced enough to come up with and follow through with the plan being suggested, they sure as heck don't seem to have much control over their swarms of baby zurks. they seem to listen to only listen to the matured zurks as far getting a direction to run in towards food.",After
Adventure,Stray,2022-07-21,"its fascinating, this game had me in tears through most of it and i only vaguely know why. i think its partially because the cat reminded me of all the cats i've lost over the years, partially because i wanted more, to see what the cat sees at the top of the staircase when it says goodbye to the city and, indirectly, to us as it moves on, and partially because, for some odd reason, it reminds me of my own life. the cat starts in a stable group, but, gets separated and has to go through the dark depths mostly alone before finding a single, great friend that unlocks much of the path ahead, passing in and out of other folks lives and, through, unexpected ways, sparking off others own journeys. then, at the penultimate point in the tale, the friend is lost and the cat is alone again, looks back on where it has been on this diversion in its life one last time, and then moves on, to parts unknown. i've been told this company doesn't typically do d.l.c., much less sequels, so, i suppose we'll never know what became of the cat, the city, and the world of tomorrow, which is sad to me, but, if the company designers enjoy the oneshot style of production, i say, don't force em to change their route for our sakes. apologies for the meandering textwall, things been building inside me for the past two days postwatch and i just had to get it off my chest somehow.",After
Adventure,Stray,2022-12-14,"1 yes the zurk eat metal. but there has to be something else to all of it. if their only requirement is to be able to resist uv light would they have not chewed up the ceiling? the steel walls and others? sure its stronger metal but it has also been 7m years so yk something might be missing here. 2 plenty of comments also mentioned the potency of the uv lights and the sort of hive mind that the zurk comprise, and personally? they behave like sculk from minecraft. the catalysts might be able to expand sculk, but they dont kill anything. the warden can be deadly but he doesnt generate sculk. you need both for a sculk infestation. similarly, the zurk might kill and in proximity with the rest of the biomass this can expand, but, the absence of zurk could mean an end to the species of the bacteria by the loss of their hunter component. the fact that sunlight would be much stronger than the uv lamp so yk, that might also impede growth or even kill the fleshy eyes at the bottom of the sewers. edit after watching more of the video how would the zurk evolve past their weakness if they have grown in the absence of uv light? bacteria build up their immune systems from encounters with other bacteria or by surviving whatever they are weak to. sure, they could've encountered micrococcus luteus and traded genes but even then why? how would you prepare yourself for something you don't even know exists?",After

Adventure,Stray,2024-01-04,"after watching the movie, i have noticed a lot of comments about people saying the father abused her, and he's the incestuous biological father to her baby. when i was watching the movie, i thought differently. my take was jennifer was responsible for her mother's death and had a psychotic break. then, she burned the house down. jennifer also sets fire to the houses after she kills marvin and greg. then, her father takes her on the run, so she won't get arrested. her father isn't perfect, but he isn't abusive. the twist at the end is that he is actually trying to help jennifer. the stories she told were lies. marvin seems nice at first, but he is cheating on his girlfriend. greg shows remorse for his actions, but he cheats on both sarah and jennifer. greg isn't pure evil, as he cares greatly for lily. but he is a liar and cheater all the same. sarah is also not pure evil, but she went through jennifer's purse and was not honest with andrew when she easily could have been. the characters who survived jennifer's wrath were greg's mom, jennifer's father, and andrew not really a survivor , but they get to live because they are pure at heart. i don't expect that jennifer calculated her crimes to kill people who were sinning, but it is the underlying message of the story. the people that showed her selfless care lived, and those with selfserving agendas did not. i am not the writer, and a lot of people have written out good explanations , but i like mine.",After
Adventure,Stray,2022-08-06,"mat, the theory with zurk apocalypse is indeed appealing one, but there are few major problems with that 1. we do not have any evidence to support zurk having complex intelegence capable of even basic deduction. so it would be weird for pretty premitive organism to suddenly understand complex electronics 2 the thing on the walls seeing how it is a living organism, by it having eyes, need to eat somehow, but as we also see it doesn't have any limbs nor mouth or any complex digestive system, as there are no fecies, also taking into account how it sticks to walls, we can assume that it's closer to slime mold. slime mold are simple organism which are evolutionary between fungi and animals, they feed by extending its body until they reach any food and the absorbing back all parts not connected to any food, they also consume stuff by slowly absorbing stuff. the thing on the walls is probably doing exactly that to a robot in sewers, it's slowly absorbing him, which is supported by the fact that the robot seems grown into the wall. 3. the uv flashlight is a very weak source uv light and radiation and therefore the immunity to it can't be equated with complete immunity to uv light. as example we humans aren't affected by the uv flashlight either but the sun affects are pretty strongly, all through it is not deadly for us, ateast not immediately, there is no reason to assume that a organism which is generally weak to uv light won't die from exposure to the strongest source of uv light. therefore all through the theory is very interesting it is also highly improbable.",After
Adventure,Stray,2022-08-06,"i personally prefer to believe that, without zurks everywhere and doc back in the slums, the companions start to develop wired, handheld, very powerful uv ray emitters which they bring into the sewers and use to eradicate the infestation edit and another thing i am honestly very suprised that matpat didn't see the fact that the zurks may not be only in the 99th underground city. this isn't fallout, these aren't experiment vaults meant to bring psychology to it's furthest, these are safehouses, sanctuaries, seeing as a screen in the last area of the game points to a world map, implying that the game takes place in city 99, neco corp, the corporation that is the culprit for the existence of the zurks may not be present in all of these cities, there may be more humans in the previous 98 around the world which may just as well be safe from the zurks. edit2 an important part of this theory is that the zurks may be able to upload themselves to the network, but i think otherwise. you see, in the beginning of the game the cat has to being the b12 robot to a station to upload the scientists consciousness from the network to its new body, this also happens when we put b12 back into the network at the end of the game. now, i have come to realise the way that the concept of consciousness within the network might work, you see, wherever there are companion robots in the game, you can find a white pod along with wires in a certain proximity, this leads me to the conclusion that the network works like the following if you want to upload yourself to the network, you have to climb into a white pod, from there you can either use cables to connect a body to the pod or make it that a body is placed in a nearby station. therefore, there is no way that a zurk, let along multiple upload themselves into the network, turn the robots into a hivemind or become a companion.",After
Adventure,Stray,2022-08-07,"there are definitely a few holes in the zurk lore because of level design. the zurk supposedly eat everything from metal to plastic to flesh. yet there are whole swatches of city the are over run with hungry baby zurks that apparently already ate all the robots, but there are metal structures and furniture and buildings still standing all over the place. and granted, those sections are set up like that for the sake of an interesting yet challenging level design for the player to navigate through but still... the only things i think that could explain the zurks abandoning what should be easy and viable food for them to chase down the cat or any of the robots is if the zurks can only eat specific types of metals and plastics andor if the zurks prefer to eat organic material over inorganic material maybe both. . honestly, even the matured zurks not dying from uv light is probably not a lore choice, just a level design choice. there are important chucks of some levels that are just made out of mature zurk bodies. to remove those would make whole chunks of level just disappear and potentially be impossible to navigate or open up so much space that isn't needed that the player could get lost in a now unnecessarily large level. plus, the game makers put in a lot of design choices so that b12's uv light wouldn't be too overpowered. if you want to take it in a lore direction, b12's uv light honestly looks pretty small and weak, definitely nowhere near as strong as the sun. it could definitely be that b12's uv light is too weak to have much of an effect on the matured zurks' stronger and more well established bodies, compared to the smaller, weaker, and more fragile baby zurks, while matured zurks could still be susceptible to and die from direct sunlight. the juveniles of basically every species on earth tend to be much more fragile than the adults of the species. juveniles tend to die from smaller amounts of the same things that kill adults.",After
