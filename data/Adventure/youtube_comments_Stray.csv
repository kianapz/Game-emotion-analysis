I was not surprised that this runs very well on my Ryzen 5 5600 w/ 64gb ram, an m2 drive and a GTX 1650, but I was VERY surprised that it ran very smoothly on high settings on my two i7-4790 PC's with 32gb ram and the GTX 1050 ti's and SATA SSD drives.

kJawWyRUOBM,@IllusionQueen4Eva,2023-12-06T03:58:27Z,"Wish there were more games like this, but longer. Much longer. I want games where you can run around as an animal or animal-like being, with at least 20 hours of gameplay and plenty of content to last for days and days. The only game that I know of that does this well is Okami. Outside of the stories and the battles, there are also a bunch of side stuff and minigames and achievements. There's so much to see, so much to do. I found myself having so much fun running around with a rabbit in my mouth and headbutting cows into the lake. There's just so many random things that you can do in the game. Even if you're not a completionist, the game is still 30+ hours long. When I first saw the trailer for Stray, I thought about getting it, but when I found out that the game isn't even ten hours long (I think it can be beaten in two hours), I quickly changed my mind. I wonder if I'll ever see another game like Okami in my lifetime...",3

OaE_UPIfiAo,@blackstarlight17,2025-02-16T18:17:46Z,"Maybe others have considered this as I'm only now watching this video,  having the time to do so, but for the language, I'm wondering if that's how cats perceive our language, or at the very least, the language for whatever country this takes place in. So when we see actual English, it's a translation from human language to cat language for our furry friend to understand and follow said instructions. Not 100% certain if that is the case since some of the signs have English shaped letters unless by chance, was in the shape similar to cat language and with some electrical manipulation, made it read what we needed to see.

And Seans' commentary about BB makes me laugh because I have cats that would likely act the same way. Munchkin is terrified of a lot of things, even running away from me still despite wanting cuddles from me. If she was in this environment, she would have a mental breakdown and not likely survive long because of her timid nature. Then again, when cornered, she will fight hard as I've learned when trying to collect her for vet appointments or attempts to treat her for fleas. So she could hold her own likely against those bacterial creatures before she's overwhelmed. However, I can't say how well she'd do hunting wise. Now my other cat, Lester, on the other hand would be absolutely terrified and may likely have a mental and emotional breakdown. Lester is a big baby and is a coward similar to Munchkin. He adores my company and will whine and fuss when I have to leave for work and come running when I come home, begging to be held and cuddled because he missed me so much. In that environment, he would be crying nonstop looking for me, he would be scared, he probably would have no clue how to find food, and if those creatures attacked him, he would have no way to really fight back because he's never had to fight. Lester would not last 5 minutes in that world. Munchkin probably not last more than a couple of days.

Thankfully, they are here at home with me where they are safe with plenty of food, a warm bed to snuggle in, toys to play with, treats to eat, and get as many hugs and kisses from me and give in return to each other and to me.



Adding:

Lester and Munchkin aren't stupid cats. They are quite intelligent in fact. They are just cowardly babies, Munchkin more so, and Lester is more a dramatic crybaby.


Also, the language thing just occurred to me that it's not so much ""human"" language but could be more likely robotic language they designed for themselves. Could be wrong, or could be half right.",0

Also love that it was a new game studio formed by 2 ex ubisoft artists in france montpellier who had had the idea and they executed it with the team perfectly! From blueprint to game, the reasom it took so long is because they had to hire people and also animate the cats ffom scratch instead of a mocap suit but the time was worth it! The vibes of the game are nice. Idk why but i feel relaxed when walking as a cat through the neon lit streets of the walled city just chilling with some npc bots, its also not boring because they added some action like the sentinels and the zurks a nice game without guns finally!",0

DE6JBysCljk,@Taxodium-d2j,2023-08-02T19:21:52Z,"This entire review is very biased. And overly critical and stupidly unfair. Acknowledge the glitches, though they were not that common when I played it. Depends on the plateform. In case you didn't know, almost every cat move was captured through motion capture *on real cats*... That's hard work. First evey game to do that for a cat protagonist. Be thankful and pay tribute to the effort. This is almost disrespectful.

Second, the ""lack of story through lame band-aid to cover  for missing contend compared to other games that tell the story through visuals blablabla"".  Well, what an opinionated statement. The whold industry of video games is dedicated to hate text because, what? People are lazy? They can't read a few (I insist, few) lines? It's perfectly fine to me. You can't just magically include origin stories like that of B12, the small robot, into gameplay or visuals.

Third, the lack of easter eggs. You couldn't be further from the truth. There are plenty of them, signs, old food crates, text (I remember one ""Le bout du monde"" - bar - entr√©e interdite aux robots"" translating into ""Edge of the world - bar - only humans allowed"", bc the developers are French, etc).

The trophies really show the problems with this game with how many are luck based such as avoiding a Zurk jumping on you and another is for speedrunning the game in under 2 hours. I'm sure there will be a Stray 2 since this game sold very well on Steam and was placed on PS+ for over a year as a Ps4 and Ps5 title. I'm most definitely avoiding any sequels to this game and it showed me why I shouldn't get wrapped into hype from people. Getting Platnium caused me a lot of rage and it took 3 playthroughs cause I was 6 minutes short on my speedrun. I was beyond bored the entire time.,0

Fails on every level, even its rather short and weak story.
Even the cat mechanics are disappointing and lacking.
4/10, because it works, has no microtransactions, and technically has a cat. (Which lacks in floof)

You can‚Äôt get jumpscared by rainbow friends if you land on them with yellow, you will only die from yellow‚Äôs fall damage mechanic.

UQUB0bWg2-Q,@Epicface48,2022-09-02T18:44:00Z,"I have to say, there's something familiar about this game. It feels like I've been through something like this before.
Whenever I thought about the main points, it just felt nostalgic somehow.
I mean... Consider this, it's a game which has:
-A being not of this world being forced into it to bring back whatever hope remains.
-A soundtrack that encourages exploration and curiosity by staying in the background.
-The reliance on the game's story and plenty of details, characters and dialogue that show how bad and utterly screwed the situation is.
-The quest being complete by shining a bright light on everything.

Sure the gameplay and visuals are drastically different, but this really reminds me of ""One Shot,"" a top-down RPG-maker game where you had to guide a child through a world on the brink of ruin so that they could install the Sun and help re-kindle the people's belief. Both games even have a cat motif and made use of robots to further the story along.
It really makes me wonder if there was any inspiration taken from it...",0

UQUB0bWg2-Q,@mrjones29,2022-08-28T12:17:55Z,Stray is a little masterpiece. Still not sure if I would like a sequel to it where it would take away the beautiful open ended finale of the little boy walking away in the final shot. Endings to films and tv shows like that is what makes them extra special leaving your imagination to fill in the blanks and endless possibilities if he ever gets to meet up with his cat buddies again.,0

It was a mixture of sadness, fullfilment, nostalgia, hope, and sense of wonder. It's difficult for ANY game to elicit these feelings with their story, let alone barely scratching the 5hr mark. Stray's developers know what story they're trying to tell and they don't take or add anything from it. Every environment, every NPC you meet, every word you read feels well-placed and together, they pull you into this world and nudge you to care for its inhabitants, the collective fate they've endured and the hope they cling to so dearly for a better future. This is a MUST PLAY, even if you are not a fan of cats like Skill Up. Try it, you won't be disappointed.",1

UQUB0bWg2-Q,@Erosgates,2022-08-07T22:22:25Z,"I used to truly dislike cats.   Until I was forced to rescue one.  It‚Äôs odd, too.  Now I really communicate with the damned things.  I have two cats now, not the original rescue but, I rescued a pregnant cat who was going to die & lose her litter without an emergency cesarean.  We figured out the $1k surgery cost & everyone lived.  One of the vet techs did have to give mouth to mouth on a kitten straight out of the womb & she actually adopted her after I fostered the kittens to a viable age.  Anyways, I‚Äôve got the mother & kept one of the litter.  These two cats are attached at the hip to each other & they very much are attached to me.  I take a lot of walks through my neighborhood & they just follow me miles away walking around the lake and all over the town.  It‚Äôs actually cool as hell.  Sometimes I get anxious, though.  I would hate to lose one or both of them.  However, the mother cat was totally feral prior to my adopting her. She even tried to take her kittens out of my room, down the apartment staircase & fucking underground in the little cave under a tree that she was planning to nest in.  She managed to take one kitten & I had to let her grab the second one & follow her to see where she was going & take them all back.  After this, she never tried again and straight up thanks me every day for helping her.  I‚Äôm not so worried about her because, she can just kick so much ass & belongs to the streets through & through. It‚Äôs her son that doesn‚Äôt really have that in him.

THIS game however... is a work of art.,0
UQUB0bWg2-Q,@LHITShappy,2022-07-30T14:24:37Z,"I completed the whole game on a desktop rtx 3080, overall I found that the game is fairly light on both gpu & cpu for the most part, I was getting 80+ to 100fps on average at 4k max on my system depending on scenes. However, if you run the game in dx12 instead of dx11, then the game becomes very demanding on the gpu, barely keeping above 60fps max at 1080p on a rtx 3080, the reason? well after some testing on my part,  it seems that the game uses ray-tracing for AO and most reflections when running in dx12, and the ps5 uses medium settings for shadows and effects at dynamic 4k with no ray-tracing, and my rtx 3080 was getting around 100-120fps avg at 4K in most scenes using ps5 settings. So UE shader compilation stutters aside, a rtx 3060ti/2080s should be enough to match or exceed the ps5 in this title. The fact that you're having performance issues on a rtx 2080ti at 1440p imply that you're probably running the game in dx12.",0

From the falling onto her back to play with other cats and to the scratching at random things and then jumping when it falls over. It's honestly just an amazing game. It's not trying too hard to be realistic but also not making this seem like a fantasy. Like even if the world is being ran by robots. The game manages to not take it out the realm of impossibility. U can still feel like ur in that world even tho in the world we don't exist. Honestly just a super refreshing game, this is definitely 8/10 and I'd push for 10/10 but I know id get hate for ir",1

""T√©l√©-a-chat"" is a pun on ""T√©l√©-achat"" in French, which means ""Teleshopping"" in English, and ""Chat"", the French word for ""Cat""
""Oskour"" is a jole name. ""Au secours"", which is pronounced quite similarly to ""Oskour"", is a call for help. It's like his name is ""Helpme""",0

The main character is a dog whose owner is a dirty guy, a drug addict, a pervert and just a loser, a white muscular man who cheated on his girlfriend and ruined his whole life. Then the second most important character is a small bulldog who had an almost perfect start, but a white girl stepped on his paw and he accidentally bit her, for which she and her evil parents immediately decided to put him to sleep, he ran away and wandered. But then they were traveling with friends and he found a black girl and trusted her and the girl was not afraid of him. And before that, a caring black policewoman who takes good care of her dogs called the bad dog catchers, who were white. And also in the dog shelter there was a cruel and stupid looker, also white. In the end, the owner of the main dog tried to blame all his problems on the dog and beat it with a bat. My opinion is that often even in children's films there is obvious propaganda of racism towards whites. In fact, almost all the white people in the film are bad, and the black people are good.",0

OvioeS1ZZ7o,@cibellesanty7518,2025-02-25T16:19:32Z,"A Loucura e a Autenticidade em 'MANIAC' do Stray Kids

A m√∫sica 'MANIAC' do grupo sul-coreano Stray Kids √© uma explos√£o de energia que desafia as normas e a hipocrisia social. Atrav√©s de uma letra intensa e um ritmo contagiante, a banda aborda temas como a loucura, a autenticidade e a press√£o para se encaixar em padr√µes considerados 'normais'. O t√≠tulo da m√∫sica, 'MANIAC', que pode ser traduzido como 'man√≠aco', j√° sugere uma quebra de expectativas e uma celebra√ß√£o da excentricidade.

No contexto l√≠rico, a m√∫sica critica a forma como as pessoas muitas vezes se escondem atr√°s de m√°scaras de normalidade, enquanto por dentro guardam seus verdadeiros sentimentos e pensamentos, que podem ser vistos como loucos ou anormais pela sociedade. A letra utiliza met√°foras como 'Frankenstein' e 'dormant volcano' para ilustrar a ideia de que todos t√™m um lado selvagem e imprevis√≠vel que √© frequentemente reprimido. A refer√™ncia a Frankenstein, uma criatura composta por partes de diferentes corpos, pode ser interpretada como uma analogia √† forma como as pessoas s√£o for√ßadas a compor uma identidade que agrada aos outros, em vez de serem verdadeiras consigo mesmas.

Stray Kids √© conhecido por suas letras provocativas e por abordar quest√µes sociais e psicol√≥gicas em suas m√∫sicas. 'MANIAC' √© um exemplo de como o grupo utiliza o K-pop como plataforma para expressar descontentamento com as press√µes sociais e encorajar os ouvintes a abra√ßarem suas peculiaridades. A m√∫sica desafia o ouvinte a reconhecer e aceitar sua pr√≥pria 'loucura', em vez de se conformar com o que √© considerado normal, promovendo assim uma mensagem de autoaceita√ß√£o e resist√™ncia contra a conformidade",0

His name is Theo, but it took me 2 weeks to think of a name for him when he was a kitten, so i called him buddy for a while.  Buddy shortened to Bud.  I wanted to call him Teddy, but my brother called him Theo or Teo so much that teddy just never stuck no matter how hard i tried.  He nips when he plays, so i called him Butt Munch every time he bit me.  That shortened to Munchie, then Munch Butt.  Then he got angsty in his teenager stage and went after everyone's ankles, so i said, ""you better cool it, booger!"" Then i started calling him Booger Munch, Booga Munch, Booga Butt, Sugar Boog, Suga Booga, and finally Booga, which is my main nickname for him.  He also goes by Dickhead and Dumbshit depending on his actions.  And then of course the usual Handsome Boy, Baby Boy, Big Boy (he's a maine coon), Big Baby, etc.  He's 14 now and the main ones i call him now are Teddy Munch, Handsome Boy Boog, Big Boog, Suga Boog, BOIII, Fluff Munch, and Munchie.

It can actually get pretty serious and can be hard to fix if your body gets too depleted (one of the worst periods of my life was when i was chronically B-12 deficient, it was absolutely awful). i imagine any humans stuck in the slums would end up suffering from that deficiency, so i sort of like that our little companion is named after this vitamin that does so much to help our bodies thrive and be healthy. it's like we're bringing back good health and good brain vibes to the world, along with trying to open up the city and get Outside again where everyone can hopefully live better lives.",0

Hypocrisy & double standards against ùòçùò¶ùòêùò™ùòπ within this fandom over the years. A refresher : Behavioral patterns of many so-called ‚ÄúOT8 STAY‚Äù: Trying to silence people every time they showed reasonable concerns for his health - even when he‚Äôs evidently in pain, acting as if it‚Äôs a crime to worry about ùòçùò¶ùòêùò™ùòπ & the company is flawless. While whole fandom would be trending tags against JYPE if it‚Äôs anything related to other members or even random idols.
Setting him up in fan wars with other fandoms & let him get dragged.
Excluding him from votings, nominations, ignored or minimized his skills & achievements in posts. Some ‚ÄúOT8‚Äù even openly telling other STAY not to support him because ‚Äúhe‚Äôs already popular‚Äù.
Overreacting & spreading weird takes whenever some famous figures showed interest in ùòçùò¶ùòêùò™ùòπ & or had some innocent / professional interactions.
Making demeaning ‚Äújokes‚Äù about him or his sexuality that crossed the line of basic human decency.
If ùòçùò¶ùòêùò™ùòπ‚Äôs fan accounts asked to report akgaes‚Äô defamatory lies & slanders or trend to get JYPE to act & protect him, or against JYPE‚Äôs unfairness & incompetence in supporting his career, fandom rarely ever helped besides his outspoken fans.
Complaining about ‚Äúunfairness‚Äù under media posts that highlight ùòçùò¶ùòêùò™ùòπ while having no problems hyping those that focus on other members.
Discrediting & undermining his talents if he ranks higher in polls or got praised by non-fans or the media.
Trying to guilt trip new fans expressing interest in ùòçùò¶ùòêùò™ùòπ to change bias or bias ‚ÄúOT8‚Äù, while they themselves have some clear biases.
Harassing fans/locals or media accounts that praise ùòçùò¶ùòêùò™ùòπ & guilt tripping them into praising *everyone* instead, while they themselves only praise other members.
Shading or hyping discrediting & bodyshaming posts about ùòçùò¶ùòêùò™ùòπ every time he goes viral or stands out too much in a group activity.
Enabling akgaes‚Äô hate train & disgusting lies about ùòçùò¶ùòêùò™ùòπ. Whole fandom including ‚ÄúOT8‚Äù joining in on akgaes‚Äô fake narrative that ùòçùò¶ùòêùò™ùòπ ‚Äústole another member‚Äôs show appearance‚Äù (Fact: He didn‚Äôt.).
Rarely reported obsessed akgaes & antis who drag ùòçùò¶ùòêùò™ùòπ 24/7 yet always using ridiculous excuses to cancel his fan accounts, fanbases, fan sites & chase away his loyal fans who defend & support him. Reporting his fan accounts especially when he has a solo event or a song coming out or when he goes too viral.
Dragging ùòçùò¶ùòêùò™ùòπ for having 1 second too many in some teasers or songs. ONLY hating on ùòçùò¶ùòêùò™ùòπ even in instances when others got more lines, shows & company schedules.
No objections when ùòçùò¶ùòêùò™ùòπ has least solo song, least lines or fewer shows or when JYPE didn‚Äôt share his brand & shows‚Äô posts. Yet enabling akgaes‚Äô false accusations of ‚Äúfavoritism‚Äù & trending about everyone else‚Äôs mistreatment wheneverit‚Äôs his turn to finally gets something.
Harassed only him for having beliefs when other members share the exact same religion.
Supported other members‚Äô solo brand events then only singled out ùòçùò¶ùòêùò™ùòπ‚Äôs to ‚Äúboycott‚Äù.
Undermining his long time donations & charity work, calling it ‚Äúfake/performative‚Äù, yet there‚Äôd be only praises when it‚Äôs other members or the whole group.
Using his achievements & good deeds to defend the group in fan wars while they themselves only target him for criticisms.
Shading ùòçùò¶ùòêùò™ùòπ‚Äôs individual Cbars for having solo ad projects for him while hyping other members‚Äô Cbars for doing exactly the same. Even complained if god forbid Pixies did too much for his *birthday*.
Weaponizing a real-life war to use in K-pop fan wars & forcing hypocritical double standards against him & ONLY him (even harassed his family) while it‚Äôs the whole group involved in the ‚Äúboycotted‚Äù deals & collaborations. Not a complaint when it‚Äôs other members with the ‚Äúboycotted‚Äù products/people.
ùòçùò¶ùòêùò™ùòπ breaths and gets criticized by some self-proclaimed ‚ÄúSTAY‚Äù : ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a STAY but this (totally normal) talk/behavior of ùòçùò¶ùòêùò™ùòπ is sooo triggering for ME! He‚Äôs supposed to be an angel/role model, he needs to consider MY‚Äôs feelings.‚Äù // inserts their own personal life issues & complexes.
Because he‚Äôs an idol he‚Äôs supposed to be everybody‚Äôs therapist & live to please everybody‚Äôs needs & ideals; He must change how he acts & talks to fit their personal demands? THAT is crossing boundaries as fans.
Not to mention they have no issue when it‚Äôs their actual biases so those are just excuses to smear ùòçùò¶ùòêùò™ùòπ‚Äôs name while disguising as his ‚Äúfans‚Äù.
Not to mention they have no issue when it‚Äôs their actual biases so those are just excuses to smear ùòçùò¶ùòêùò™ùòπ‚Äôs name while disguising as his ‚Äúfans‚Äù.
People who think it‚Äôs all flowers & rainbows in Stayville must be new. Just because you live in a nicer part of town doesn‚Äôt mean neighborhoods where people live in misery don‚Äôt exist. That‚Äôs not how logic works. You just haven‚Äôt seen or chosen to ignore.
Everything mentioned here are provable facts. See & judge for yourselves. And you can‚Äôt claim it‚Äôs just a few extreme individuals because there are receipts of shady/insulting posts about ùòçùò¶ùòêùò™ùòπ by ‚ÄúSTAY‚Äù big accounts - with thousands of likes & reposts from fellow ‚ÄúOT8s‚Äù.",0

But whats standing out to me is the fact that these cats DO MEOW! Its been established for osmetime that cats do not meow on their own or with each other typiclly. That their communication with other cats is dine through the usual list of animal acts, pheremones, marking territory, sounds when in heat (....shudder when theyre hunting (if you havnt, google domestic cat hunting birds...good lord it's somehow haunting and aggressive. But when cats unlike dogs domesticated themselves ( Wolves basically started coming closer to human villages 1k's ago and essentially started doing various beneficial things for humans and were given food and shelter, over time they began to rely on each otehr and eventually the wolves th started out as began to evolve and breed into dogs we have today, it was a mutually beneficial social development) Cats however..lol theyre believed to be found living with humans as some semblance of a pet later than dogs/wolves did, but unlike dog they didnt tr to help humans in exchange fo for pack safety humans could afford them or for as a means of gratitude and praise when helping humans by getting rid of pests and rodents that destroyed crops and spread disease. No cats just str8 up kind of just showed up and gave cuddles and demanded complete devotion day one lol. One hing they did was ""meow"", it mimicks the sounds toddlers and babies make in distress, they started it speifically to get attention or food from humans. So it's super interesting that after all this time these cats are still doing it....almost like a way to not forget humanity by still meowing even if there havnt been actual humans to hear them in millenia....jUTS A a cool touch, anyone who read that im sorry,",1

Then there's the silky tongue lick, I call it the love lick. Cats can choose how rough they make their tongue, they have control there. Our cats absolutely know the difference.

Sometimes, they rough lick, just because, they're cats and cleaning you and all that. Then, the soft love lick, that is gentle and often accompanied by the hanger tail and some head butting.

Cats are wonderful. This game is wonderful. It is, overall, our favorite game! It is understated, yet rich with character and warmth. It's a collection of butterfly moments, all special, worthy, and beautiful.",0

However this was referring to a stray alley about how cats strut down the alley with their tails in the air how they seem to be allof and don't care. It is about time someone wrote a song about our four legged furry feline friends. I have a cat who much loved and happens to be a black and white tuxedo cat like the one one in the video.,0

Joseph was Jody and Lil Deebo will always be my Deebo. Rev Wilma and Rev Don should have adopted me. My heart still aches and I'm 61. I was 10 when my bio-moms broken elbow was healed. Sis Mullins held me like I was her child and said watch the Lord geal your mom's arm God is going to show you His power. When we got home after the healing service, bio-mom  was holding her broken arm up in the air waving it around.  Mind you, the elbow ball was completely broken off both sides, we kids were shifting that tugboat Pontiac with a 3-on-a-tree while she slammed the clutch.(ask a mechanic lol) Brother Whites teen son was healed completely after being run over by an 18 wheeler. We all prayed over a big work of the Holy Spirit we Pentecostals Church of God & PCoG in Christ came back together. Our sister churches pastor responded to Bro Mullins invitation ""If you want to make a point, I'm your man. It was in the Flint Journal, I'm the skinny girl serving ppl behind Bro.
